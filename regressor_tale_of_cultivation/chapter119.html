        <p>Chapter 119: What You Trampled On / The Path You Have Tread (7)</p>
        <p>"Ah, I see. That was an item my granddaughter-in-law brought when she married into the family. My grandson
            was from the grasslands tribe, but his wife was from Byeokra. When they had my great-grandson, she gifted
            the child a norigae. Now that I think about it…"</p>
        <p>Wolryang and I are talking in front of the tent.</p>
        <p>The world is indeed small.</p>
        <p>To meet such a connection in such a place.</p>
        <p>"My granddaughter-in-law wished for her friend's child to be matched with my great-grandson, but my
            great-grandson chose a suitable partner for himself and got married without being bound by that promise."
        </p>
        <p>I listen quietly to his story.</p>
        <p>"As my great-grandson got married and he and his wife were living happily... Yuan Li that bastard... one day
            he attacked the child's tribe..."</p>
        <p>Krghh.</p>
        <p>Wolryang grinds his teeth.</p>
        <p>His intent seething with anger.</p>
        <p>"Everyone died, and my great-grandson vanished, leaving only his lower body behind. He always carried the
            norigae his mother had given him..."</p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>"I... I will definitely reclaim my great-grandson's upper body from that devil!"</p>
        <p>'Upper body...'</p>
        <p>There seemed to be a certain fate at play.</p>
        <p>Buk Hyang-hwa lost her lower body, and her fated partner, the upper body. Both devoured by Yuan Li.</p>
        <p>Amidst my thoughts, I grind my teeth next to the old man.</p>
        <p>'Why must the tyranny of the powerful bring despair and pain to others?'</p>
        <p>Me, and this man as well.</p>
        <p>Everyone suffered unbearable pain and lost something precious to Yuan Li.</p>
        <p>I think to myself.</p>
        <p>'Does he have anything precious?'</p>
        <p>It’s unknown.</p>
        <p>Can someone who holds something precious so ruthlessly take away others' without a second thought?</p>
        <p>I became lost deep in my thoughts, and Wolryang continued to curse Yuan Li endlessly.</p>
        <p>And then, after a while, all Core Formation cultivators from the entire continent gathered, and the grand
            council began.</p>
        <p>Inside the tent, space compression was applied.</p>
        <p>There are about 200 Core Formation cultivators. This number includes members from minor clans and secluded
            cultivators who hadn't been contacted previously, as well as those from ostracized powers, which are about
            50 more than last time.</p>
        <p>Around 200 Core Formation cultivators.</p>
        <p>This is the last force left in this world.</p>
        <p>"...Then, let's commence the grand council regarding the war against the old monster Yuan Li, who caused the
            Heaven-Treading Desert massacre."</p>
        <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin stood up and addressed the assembly.</p>
        <p>The decision was made that Cheongmun Jung-jin is the most suitable leader for this alliance, probably greatly
            influenced by the fact that he is a descendant of Azure TIger Saint.</p>
        <p>The meeting began.</p>
        <p>Various factions presented different plans to counter Yuan Li.</p>
        <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin listened to and organized these ideas.</p>
        <p>And when no more suggestions came forth, he spoke.</p>
        <p>"Now, let me share the plan concluded by the Cheongmun Clan."</p>
        <p>Shortly after, he began discussing the Serving Command Palace and the strategy of lowering Yuan Li’s
            cultivation from Nascent Soul to Core Formation.</p>
        <p>"Are you suggesting we lower the old monster’s Nascent Soul cultivation to Core Formation level?"</p>
        <p>"That's right. We have also confirmed that most of the treasures inside the palace were taken by the Heavenly
            Being cultivators, but…"</p>
        <p>He continued his explanation.</p>
        <p>"We found some items still inside the palace, including certain types of immortal liquor and talismans, as
            well as miscellaneous items."</p>
        <p>"What kind of miscellaneous items?"</p>
        <p>"Items like a bamboo pipe that helps in infusing enlightenment into demon beasts, a slightly more sturdy
            storage bag, a needle that repairs clothes automatically, a ring that aids in digesting food... such
            ambiguous items."</p>
        <p>The Core Formation cultivators, who momentarily harbored hopes, were visibly disappointed and disheartened by
            his words.</p>
        <p>"Both the liquor and talismans are ancient cultivator treasures, so they're useful, but aren't they both
            single-use only?"</p>
        <p>"Correct. We found only a few bottles of liquor that temporarily enhance abilities and a few kinds of
            talismans that allow the use of unique techniques for a short time."</p>
        <p>"If they are single-use..."</p>
        <p>"They’re basically table scraps."</p>
        <p>"Useful, but..."</p>
        <p>It was then.</p>
        <p>The head of the Byeok Clan, Byeok Cheon-gi’s eyes flashed and asked.</p>
        <p>"Talismans, did you say talismans?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, that's right."</p>
        <p>"Did you, by any chance, check what kind of talismans are remaining?"</p>
        <p>"I didn't check in detail."</p>
        <p>Byeok Cheon-gi chuckles and pulls something out of his robe.</p>
        <p>"Last time Serving Command Palace was open, our Byeok Clan was also able to secure a few things from there.
            One of them was this."</p>
        <p>"That, that is...!?"</p>
        <p>Whoosh!</p>
        <p>What Byeok Cheon-gi produced from his robe were two shining talismans, exuding a divine light.</p>
        <p>"Heaven-Striking Talisman, a talisman that can replicate the strike of a Heavenly Being cultivator once.
            Heaven-Sealing Talisman, a talisman that temporarily wraps the defense of a Heavenly Being cultivator around
            oneself. We obtained these two talismans in the last visit to Serving Command Palace."</p>
        <p>"Heavenly Being…!"</p>
        <p>"Yes, with this Heaven-Striking Talisman, if it hits, it's possible to turn that bastard into a pulp with one
            strike."</p>
        <p>He continued.</p>
        <p>"The Heavenly Being seniors already have the defensive and offensive capabilities of that level so they
            didn't need it… so there must certainly be Heaven-Sealing Talismans remaining in Serving Command Palace.
            And…"</p>
        <p>He smirked.</p>
        <p>"As you said, if we lure that bastard into Serving Command Palace to lower his cultivation, and then use the
            Heaven-Sealing Talisman to defend and the Heaven-Striking Talisman to attack the old mosnter…"</p>
        <p>A glimmer of hope appeared on the faces of Cheongmun Jung-jin and the others.</p>
        <p>I, too, felt a rare sense of joy at the prospect of killing Yuan Li.</p>
        <p>"We can hunt that bastard."</p>
        <p>"Well, I was originally thinking of a different plan, but it seems it needs to be revised."</p>
        <p>"Hm?"</p>
        <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin points at me.</p>
        <p>"Cultivator Seo over here is unaffected by the restraining formation of Serving Command Palace, even when
            it's activated. Therefore, he can maintain Core Formation level strength continuously and face Yuan Li
            one-on-one as he falls to Core Formation level."</p>
        <p>"Ah…."</p>
        <p>Byeok Cheon-gi looks at me in amazement, and various emotions appear on the faces of the numerous cultivators
            present.</p>
        <p>Byeok Cheon-gi says,</p>
        <p>"How about our Byeok Clan and this fellow take the lead in facing the old monster while the other cultivators
            provide support from the rear?"</p>
        <p>"Wait, our Eastern States also have excellent decisive weapons effective against Nascent Soul cultivators."
        </p>
        <p>"Our Northern Grassland tribes also have famous formations effective against Nascent Soul cultivators."</p>
        <p>Nascent Soul cultivators are certainly formidable beings, and the wealth they had accumulated over hundreds
            of years, including dharma treasures, spirit stones, and elixirs, are far greater than that of Core
            Formation cultivators.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of this, the Core Formation cultivators gathered here were already scheming among themselves
            to divide up the spoils as much as possible.</p>
        <p>Of course, I have no interest in such petty squabbles over gains.</p>
        <p>'Excluding the Serving Command Palace plan, the methods proposed by the others are…'</p>
        <p>All bound to fail.</p>
        <p>Because, even 200 years later, Yuan Li was alive and well.</p>
        <p>Especially the Heaven-Sealing Talisman and Heaven-Striking Talisman, boasting the power of the Heavenly Being
            stage.</p>
        <p>‘Why was Yuan Li so unscathed in my past life despite the existence of such terrifying talismans?'</p>
        <p>Of course, this life introduced the variable of the Serving Command Palace plan.</p>
        <p>So, maybe it’s possible to hunt him.</p>
        <p>'But that alone is not enough.'</p>
        <p>He must be killed.</p>
        <p>Absolutely.</p>
        <p>If I don't tear him apart in this cycle, I can’t console the souls of those who died in this life.</p>
        <p>After the meeting ended and various cultivators were chattering, I approached Cheongmun Jung-jin and
            whispered another plan.</p>
        <p>"Please keep this plan confidential. I will proceed with it alone."</p>
        <p>“What are you talking about… No, more importantly, is this true?"</p>
        <p>"It's true. If it's this, even for a Nascent Soul cultivator, it would be difficult, right?"</p>
        <p>"Hmm... Of course. No matter how mighty a Nascent Soul cultivator is, that is not an easy power to contend
            with."</p>
        <p>I nod.</p>
        <p>Besides simply trapping him in Serving Command Palace, a few more plans are needed.</p>
        <p>To ensure.</p>
        <p>To ensure his death.</p>
        <p>The first conference ended satisfactorily.</p>
        <p>Practically all future plans were also decided in this conference. From now on, it’s just a matter of moving
            according to the plan.</p>
        <p>I acted along with the others, starting the task of scraping together the remaining treasures of Serving
            Command Palace using the Nether Crossing Ship, along with some formation masters and artisan masters.</p>
        <p>Zing!</p>
        <p>The formations sealing the treasures of Serving Command Palace were released by the artisans and formation
            masters and the items inside were brought out.</p>
        <p>"Hmm... These miscellaneous items are really of no use. They seem to be mostly for decoration or show."</p>
        <p>"Actually, the liquors and talismans seem more useful."</p>
        <p>The Core Formation cultivators who came with me also clicked their tongues at the useless miscellaneous
            items. Each one was a peculiar dharma treasure or magic artifact, so there was no particular greed for them.
        </p>
        <p>Only the Byeok Clan, known for rearing demon beasts, showed some interest in the pipe that infuses
            enlightenment into beasts, but that was all.</p>
        <p>"Then, let's also release the formations on the liquors and talismans."</p>
        <p>We succeeded in retrieving talismans and liquors from the Serving Command Palace's treasury with the
            cooperation of Core Formation cultivators, formation masters, and artisan masters.</p>
        <p>Among the talismans, there are two Heaven-Sealing Talismans, which grant defensive capability equivalent to
            that of a Heavenly Being cultivator.</p>
        <p>One Crimson Bird Talisman that traps the enemy in a formation maze.</p>
        <p>And one Transforming Demon Talisman that allows instantaneous transformation into a demon beast.</p>
        <p>There were a few more talismans, but they were just ordinary Core Formation-level talismans sold in markets,
            with no significant utility.</p>
        <p>"There are quite a few liquors. Talismans are very useful, but liquors take up more space and are often
            single-use, granting temporary abilities, so they weren’t taken as much..."</p>
        <p>The artisans and formation masters brought by the Core Formation cultivators classified the immortal liquors
            and explained them to us.</p>
        <p>The liquors were roughly divided into three types:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                </p>
                <p>Immortal liquors that enhance physical abilities like regeneration, speed, defense, and strength for
                    a short period, such as Spirit Nectar, Heavenly Heart Water, Moon Spirit Liquor, and Lower Immortal
                    Liquor.</p>
                <p>
            </li>
            <li>
                </p>
                <p>Immortal liquors that enhance abilities not related to physical strength, for example strengthening
                    the connection with or enhancing dharma treasures within the body, or improving the ability to
                    handle external objects, such as Dream Lotus Elixir, True Moon Dew, White-Red Wine, Mysterious Flame
                    Jade, and True Dew Liquor.</p>
                <p>
            </li>
            <li>
                </p>
                <p>Purely recreational liquors that improve mood and clarity of consciousness just by smelling them,
                    like Red Plum Liquor, Whole Heart Liquor, Fringe Fragrance, and Purple Jade Liquor.</p>
                <p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin, looking at the liquors, spoke:</p>
        <p>"These types of immortal liquors will be distributed before the decisive battle to amplify abilities."</p>
        <p>He looks at me, and Byeok Cheng-gi who followed us here.</p>
        <p>"Especially Cultivator Seo, Cultivator Byeok, and Eastern Lord Manli Min-lap, who will confront the old
            monster head-on, will be given the most varieties of immortal liquors."</p>
        <p>"Understood."</p>
        <p>"Among them, Cultivator Seo and Lord Manli will play the role of hindering the old monster in the early
            stages, so they will be given the most liquors and talismans. Keep that in mind."</p>
        <p>Lord Manli Min-lap of the Eastern States gratefully thanks Cheongmun Jung-jin, and I nod with a weary face.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, the few remaining treasures, immortal liquors, and talismans inside the Serving Command Palace, as well
            as other consumables, were all retrieved and planned for distribution.</p>
        <p>The plan to confront Yuan Li is almost finalized, and all clans, tribes, and states are exerting their full
            efforts to nurture new Core Formation cultivators.</p>
        <p>All that is left is for time to pass.</p>
        <p>'During the remaining time, I need to cultivate.'</p>
        <p>There are still 200 years left.</p>
        <p>Within that time, I plan to enter Qi Building Great Perfection through the advanced practice of the Yin Soul
            Ghost Incantation.</p>
        <p>'But with the current state of the Yin Soul Ghost Incantation...'</p>
        <p>I will likely surpass the Great Perfection and still have time to spare.</p>
        <p>'Then what remains is to find a place to cultivate...'</p>
        <p>After some thought, I decided on a location for my cultivation.</p>
        <p>And so, time flows on.</p>
        <p>In a blink of an eye, 200 years have passed.</p>
        <p>Whoosh!</p>
        <p>In the mountainous regions of Shengzi.</p>
        <p>Three streaks of dim light soar above.</p>
        <p>They are three Core Formation cultivators using the Flying Escape Technique.</p>
        <p>“So, Young Noble Byeok, the cultivator we're visiting is training in his cave?”</p>
        <p>“That's right. I’ve heard he's practicing curse-related techniques, so be prepared for the eerie aura."</p>
        <p>"Ugh, creepy. Training curse methods in his lone dark cave."</p>
        <p>"Mind your words. Did the clan head and elders not say he's key in hunting the old monster?"</p>
        <p>"Hmph, I respect the clan head for his authority, but we are Core Formation cultivators now. How long should
            we heed the words of those old folks? Young Noble Byeok, how about enjoying the scenery of the city before
            we arrive..."</p>
        <p>Byeok Mun-seong, the Core Formation cultivator from the Byeok Clan, frowns.</p>
        <p>The two beautiful cultivators chattering beside him seem to enjoy flirting with him, but Byeok Mun-seong
            isn’t interested.</p>
        <p>'Foolish beyond measure. We’ve become Core Formation cultivators thanks to the unprecedented support from our
            clans. To dismiss the elders who reached this level through their own skill...'</p>
        <p>Byeok Mun-seong is well aware of his limitations.</p>
        <p>Even in the past, he would have had to use all his allotted 300 years in the Qi Building stage to barely
            reach Core Formation.</p>
        <p>‘Indeed, no one is as wise and virtuous as her.’</p>
        <p>With a bittersweet smile, Byeok Mun-seong flies with the two cultivators towards a village in the mountainous
            area of Shengzi.</p>
        <p>Flash!</p>
        <p>As the three streaks of light hover above the village, villagers came out buzzing with curiosity.</p>
        <p>Byeok Mun-seong looked down at them and spoke.</p>
        <p>“Is there a large centipede's cave nearby? Where is it located?”</p>
        <p>The village elder approaches Byeok Mun-seong, kneels respectfully, and replies.</p>
        <p>"I am not sure about a centipede's cave, but there's a place called Darken Cave beyond that ridge. Legend has
            it that a centipede demon lived there 200 years ago..."</p>
        <p>"Thank you."</p>
        <p>Byeok Mun-seong didn't wait to hear more from the village elder. He flew in the direction the elder pointed
            to.</p>
        <p>Crossing the ridge, he sees a large cave on a rugged mountainside. Dark, ominous shadows are constantly
            seeping out of the cave.</p>
        <p>‘Curse methods…’</p>
        <p>Byeok Mun-seong swallows hard at the chilling aura.</p>
        <p>'Is every tendril of darkness leaking from there a curse spell?'</p>
        <p>The two women who followed Byeok Mun-seong also noticed the cave on the mountainside.</p>
        <p>“That must be the infamous…”</p>
        <p>“Shh! Don’t attract a curse by speaking carelessly.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, right, my apologies…”</p>
        <p>Byeok Mun-seong glances back at the duo, then approaches the cave. He respectfully performs a fist-and-palm
            salute and calls out.</p>
        <p>“It’s been a long time, Cultivator Seo. The time for the old monster to be released is nearing.”</p>
        <p>A flicker of killing intent briefly crosses Byeok Mun-seong’s eyes.</p>
        <p>“It’s time for her revenge. Please come out.”</p>
        <p>Kugugugugu…</p>
        <p>From the cave's depths, sinister shadows began to emerge.</p>
        <p>Translator Notes: Guys….we managed to avoid Won Rip but there’s no transliteration for Manli Min-lap</p>

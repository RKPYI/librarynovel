      <p>Chapter 134: Baihui (1)</p>
      <p>After distancing myself from Kim Young-hoon,</p>
      <p>I first begin to form the Inner Core in a nearby mountain.</p>
      <p>Wo-woog Wo-woong</p>
      <p>The Inner Core is formed.</p>
      <p>
        I gather the energy from all over my body to the Baihui point, located
        at the top of my head. Baihui, meaning 'hundred meetings,' is called so
        because it is where a hundred meridians converge. It is also the most
        crucial part of the body that connects with the spiritual energy of
        heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        As energy gathers at the Baihui, I can feel the Inner Core melting into
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The melted Inner Core disperses into the meridians of my body,
        connecting with the Formless Sword in my grasp.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword permeates my entire body, flowing through my
        meridians.
      </p>
      <p>
        With my eyes closed, I gather the Formless Sword at the Baihui and
        integrate it at my upper dantian.
      </p>
      <p>Fully embodying the Formless Sword, I become the sword itself.</p>
      <p>
        I can feel the power to draw out strength from each and every cell
        through the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, I can also use my flesh and blood to draw out the power of
        the Formless Sword to its extreme.
      </p>
      <p>And that extreme of the Formless Sword is precisely...</p>
      <p>Piiitt!</p>
      <p>
        When I swing my sword, I can feel the heaven and earth spiritual energy
        of the surrounding mountain veins being cut off in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>The power to cut what I desire.</p>
      <p>'Did Yuan Li call it planes?'</p>
      <p>
        I wasn't sure exactly what he meant by planes, but as my Formless Sword
        is honed to the extreme, I vaguely feel something.
      </p>
      <p>It’s a vague sense of crossing something similar to a dimension.</p>
      <p>
        I realize that my imitation of the Surpassing Radiant Saber to cut
        through space might have been possible because both the Formless Sword
        and the Surpassing Radiant Saber's abilities are related to dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Well, I'll have to keep using the Formless Sword in the Treading-Heaven
        realm to confirm….
      </p>
      <p>I resume my thoughts as I propel myself from my spot.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        As I became one with the Formless Sword, I flew much faster than the
        Flying Escape Technique.
      </p>
      <p>'It's time to take care of the tasks I need to do.'</p>
      <p>In Yanguo, there are things to be done.</p>
      <p>The first is...</p>
      <p>'I need to see their faces.'</p>
      <p>I have never missed a visit in any cycle.</p>
      <p>This cycle will be no exception.</p>
      <p>I swiftly fly to the Jin Clan.</p>
      <p>'They are asleep.'</p>
      <p>
        I look over the sleeping children in the quarters who were receiving
        training.
      </p>
      <p>"...I'm sorry."</p>
      <p>I speak to my former disciples, looking around at them.</p>
      <p>
        "Living has taught me that sometimes, people must plunge into things
        they know might kill them."
      </p>
      <p>This is an apology to those children.</p>
      <p>
        "In my short-sightedness and obstinacy, I forced my will upon you all
        without knowing that."
      </p>
      <p>Of course, I had my reasons back then.</p>
      <p>Assassination attempts that were certain to lead to death.</p>
      <p>
        Cultivation techniques that exploit the grievances of relatives,
        inflating hatred beyond measure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing their intent, watching them love each other, rejoice, and even
        find happiness in their hatred, I wished they could live.
      </p>
      <p>But that was the position of the powerless.</p>
      <p>
        'If I wanted them to live, I should have risked my life and assassinated
        the emperor in advance.'
      </p>
      <p>There are many excuses, but one thing I have to say is clear.</p>
      <p>
        "I couldn't do anything for you then, but now I will use my power for
        you. Live well."
      </p>
      <p>Leaving the quarters, I bow to the building, as once their master.</p>
      <p>
        A bow is not only a sign of respect but also a gesture of gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>I am thankful to those children who are a part of my fate.</p>
      <p>I head to the Jin Clan's soul storage warehouse.</p>
      <p>Numerous crystal orbs are stored there.</p>
      <p>I swing my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>Shick!</p>
      <p>
        My Formless Sword cuts the cultivation technique that links the crystal
        orbs and the souls.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technique is severed, and the souls begin to emerge from their orbs,
        slowly dissipating.
      </p>
      <p>I speak to them.</p>
      <p>
        "Your children, those who survived, will live peacefully for the rest of
        their lives in the Jin Clan. They will be happy for generations. May you
        find peace in the afterlife."
      </p>
      <p>Aaaah....</p>
      <p>Aaaaah....</p>
      <p>
        The souls tremble for a while upon hearing my voice, then ascend to the
        heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, as the soul storage warehouse is about to set off an
        alarm, I cut that technique as well and left the Jin Clan unhurriedly.
      </p>
      <p>Now, in Yanguo, the only thing left to do is...</p>
      <p>"Makli Clan."</p>
      <p>
        Those traitors who betrayed the alliance in my past life need to be
        purged.
      </p>
      <p>"I can’t think of a single reason for you…to remain in this world.”</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I fly towards the Makli Clan's main house, which I had learned of as a
        decisive member of the alliance
      </p>
      <p>The Makli Clan's main house is a place very familiar to me.</p>
      <p>The capital of Yanguo, Seokyung City!</p>
      <p>Whoooosh!</p>
      <p>Tearing through the air, I arrive above Seokyung City.</p>
      <p>
        Then, after observing below for a moment, I plunge straight towards the
        center of Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        My body, like the Formless Sword, pierces through the center of Seokyung
        City and heads underground.
      </p>
      <p>Kuguaguagua!</p>
      <p>
        After drilling through the ground for a while, I finally come across a
        vast empty cavity.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The underground den, likely under spatial compression by the Makli Clan,
        is immensely vast inside.
      </p>
      <p>It’s so big that a small mountain range was fit inside.</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        And above that mountain range, there stands a huge palace, from which a
        heavy scent of decay and a thick devilish energy emanates.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have heard before that this place was not originally the Makli Clan's
        main stronghold.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the headquarters of the Devil Path Alliance. The Makli Clan had
        been living there as tenants in a small land under that very palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, with the entire alliance ascending to the higher realms, the
        Makli Clan had taken over the empty cave.
      </p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>
        I fly towards the main house of the Makli Clan, cutting through the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ceiling of the cavity is lit by incredible glowing stones, making it
        as bright as day.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, I arrived at the palace.</p>
      <p>
        Two Qi Building cultivators of the Makli Clan block the palace entrance
        and approach me.
      </p>
      <p>“Greetings, senior. Are you a Core Formation senior?”</p>
      <p>
        They must have thought I used the Flying Escape Technique seeing me fly
        without a magic artifact.
      </p>
      <p>Although it isn't a flight technique, their judgment isn't bad.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I am indeed their senior.</p>
      <p>However,</p>
      <p>
        “There are three things I need to correct you on. First, I am not at
        Core Formation”
      </p>
      <p>“Oh, so you must be a Daoist who has mastered a unique method?”</p>
      <p>“Second, I am neither your Daoist nor your senior.”</p>
      <p>
        Sensing something off from my stern tone, the gatekeepers' expressions
        start to harden.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Third, I don't wish to receive any greetings from you, so keep them to
        yourself.”
      </p>
      <p>They ask with stern faces.</p>
      <p>“What brings you here?”</p>
      <p>“I've come to make a few demands. If you comply, I will leave.”</p>
      <p>I begin listing my demands to them.</p>
      <p>
        “One, stop sacrificing innocent lives for elixir making. Two, abandon
        your dirty foundations in Yanguo and leave for somewhere else. Three,
        hold a ritual for those you've killed for your elixirs.”
      </p>
      <p>With each point I make, their faces turn red and then pale.</p>
      <p>
        “If you comply with these terms, I will spare your clan. What do you
        say?”
      </p>
      <p>“You... insane...!”</p>
      <p>
        The two early Qi Building cultivators, faces red with anger, reach out
        towards me.
      </p>
      <p>“Die! You madman!”</p>
      <p>Whooosh</p>
      <p>
        A strong force, accompanied by the smell of corpses, tries to push me
        back.
      </p>
      <p>I just snort and swing my hand.</p>
      <p>Booong Kuaaang!</p>
      <p>
        With my gesture, one of them is split in half along with the palace door
        behind him.
      </p>
      <p>“...Ah...”</p>
      <p>
        The remaining early Qi Building cultivator, seeing my might, steps back
        with his mouth agape.
      </p>
      <p>“Ah, aah! Core, Core Formation cultivator...!”</p>
      <p>He turns pale and flees in haste.</p>
      <p>But,</p>
      <p>
        After he takes five steps, he falls to the ground, split into three
        pieces.
      </p>
      <p>Ignoring them, I walk through the split doors.</p>
      <p>Step, step….</p>
      <p>Inside the dark palace.</p>
      <p>
        Once the main headquarters of the Devil Path Alliance, I feel the gaze
        of hundreds.
      </p>
      <p>Eight powerful auras press down on me.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu</p>
      <p>The head of the Makli Clan, Makli Hwang-cheon.</p>
      <p>And the 7 Core Formation elders.</p>
      <p>
        “How dare this madman attack the Makli Clan? Just as the Heavenly Being
        seniors are ascending, he's running wild. Such disrespect.”
      </p>
      <p>One of the elders growl at me.</p>
      <p>
        “Judging by the power in his meridians, he's at best Core Formation...
        no, he doesn't even seem to have a core, maybe Qi Building? Is he out of
        his mind causing a ruckus here?”
      </p>
      <p>“You won't be able to leave here in one piece.”</p>
      <p>
        “Let's see how the elixir made from your boiled body will turn out.”
      </p>
      <p>A pack of dogs, barking loudly.</p>
      <p>
        And the leader of the wild dogs, Makli Hwang-cheon, sits quietly on his
        throne, just watching me.
      </p>
      <p>I smirk.</p>
      <p>
        “You’re all barking like dogs, but everyone is tense, right? Since if
        I’m not really crazy, then I must have something to be confident in to
        have invaded like this....”
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t have the power of a Core Formation cultivator, just a strong
        force flowing through my meridians like Qi Building cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wouldn't be strange for them to mistake me for a Qi Building
        cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>
        The power I have achieved is completely different from cultivation
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>“Since it’s noisy, all of you come at me at once.”</p>
      <p>I’ll show them.</p>
      <p>The power I've attained in Treading Heaven.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        I begin to draw out the power of the Formless Sword, now completely one
        with myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The head of the Makli Clan, Makli Hwang-cheon, stands up from his seat.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the seven elders of the Makli Clan also rise from
        their positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three hundred fifty QI Building elders of the Makli Clan also stand up.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>Around Makli Hwang-cheon, a tornado surges upwards.</p>
      <p>
        “Daring to challenge the Makli Clan, you madman. I'll show you the power
        of the Makli Clan.”
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun and the Makli Clan collide.</p>
      <p>Kuang Kuang Kuang!</p>
      <p>
        Hundreds of Makli Clan cultivators against the sole Seo Eun-hyun clash.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>“...!?”</p>
      <p>“...?”</p>
      <p>“???”</p>
      <p>
        Makli Hwang-cheon, along with the elders, and all the members of the
        council look around with wide eyes.
      </p>
      <p>They unleashed their full power on the unidentified intruder.</p>
      <p>But instead, they were the ones who were thrown out of the palace.</p>
      <p>“What is this…?”</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Step, step...</p>
      <p>Outside the palace, Seo Eun-hyun walks out.</p>
      <p>
        “My demands, once again, are simple. One, stop making human elixirs.
        Two, leave Yanguo. Three, hold a sacred ritual for the deceased used in
        the elixirs.”
      </p>
      <p>He looks around with a chilling gaze.</p>
      <p>“This is my last mercy and demand. You'd better accept it.”</p>
      <p>Makli Hwang-cheon frowns and shouts.</p>
      <p>
        “A cultivator who has mastered strange techniques! Everyone, brace
        yourselves!”
      </p>
      <p>“...Hoo.”</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun sighs.</p>
      <p>“I have shown mercy even to you. Don't blame me.”</p>
      <p>And then, he begins to use his power.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu</p>
      <p>The Formless Sword is a kind of Gang Sphere.</p>
      <p>
        And the Gang Sphere and Inner Core, apart from one being connected to
        life, are essentially the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        From such a concept, Kim Young-hoon's external Inner Core was created.
      </p>
      <p>
        A method of connecting his life force to the external Path Beyond the
        Heavens (Gang Sphere), enhancing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, ascending to the Treading-Heaven realm, along with the Inner Core
        inside the body, the Path Beyond the Heavens that has fully merged with
        the body is also considered an external Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>In fact, it’s much more efficient than an external Inner Core.</p>
      <p>
        Not an artificially created Gang Qi meridian, but truly connected to
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the Formless Sword of Seo Eun-hyun who has reached Treading
        Heaven Beyond the Path is completely different in enhancement compared
        to the Path Beyond the Heavens.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun swings his hand.</p>
      <p>Something connected to his hand swung.</p>
      <p>Kuang!</p>
      <p>
        Makli Hwang-cheon manages to hastily dodge with a dreadful premonition,
        and the heaven and earth spiritual energy at his position is cut off.
      </p>
      <p>Ossak!</p>
      <p>'It’s dangerous.'</p>
      <p>Makli Hwang-cheon grits his teeth and forms a seal.</p>
      <p>“Corpse River!”</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        A green river smelling of rotting corpses pour out from the palace,
        covering Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with other Core Formation cultivators, they also begin to form
        their spells.
      </p>
      <p>“Dragon and Demon Ghost Summoning Yin!”</p>
      <p>“Wind Summoning Devil Dragon Transformation!”</p>
      <p>“Yin Water Gathering Fire!”</p>
      <p>
        Although there are slight differences in attributes, generally Yin-based
        spells strike Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun only swings his hand in response.</p>
      <p>Walak!</p>
      <p>Bang Bang Bang!</p>
      <p>
        Their spells explode at once by something transparent swung in a
        crescent moon shape.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun swings his hand again.</p>
      <p>A bizarre darkness.</p>
      <p>Around him, an invisible storm begins to rage.</p>
      <p>Colorless trajectories swirl, growing larger.</p>
      <p>Kwagagagaga!</p>
      <p>
        The palace of the Makli Clan closest to him is the first to be cut by
        the force of the trajectories.
      </p>
      <p>And the colorless whirlwind grows, covering the entire Makli Clan.</p>
      <p>“Block it!”</p>
      <p>“Damn it!”</p>
      <p>
        Several Core Formation elders attempt to block the colorless trajectory
        with their dharma treasures, but the treasures crumble, unable to pierce
        through the colorless storm.
      </p>
      <p>Landscape Painting.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>The raging storm suddenly transforms, altering the trajectory.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>In the next moment.</p>
      <p>
        Colorless trajectories whirl in all directions, slashing through the
        entire cavity.
      </p>
      <p>Mountains are split, and cracks form throughout the den.</p>
      <p>Makli Hwang-cheon's expression hardens.</p>
      <p>“Na-Nascent Soul cultivator...?”</p>
      <p>At the very least, this is clearly not a Core Formation cultivator.</p>
      <p>Until the end, Makli Hwang-cheon ponders Seo Eun-hyun's trajectory.</p>
      <p>
        ‘It's definitely beyond Core Formation, but to call it Nascent Soul...
        isn't it too weak?’
      </p>
      <p>However, his decision is swift.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Even if it's not Nascent Soul, at the very least it's an equivalent
        force. I've misjudged.’
      </p>
      <p>
        “Everyone listen! This man is a Nascent Soul old monster! A Nascent Soul
        old monster who hid from the Heavenly Being seniors, now attacking the
        Makli Clan!”
      </p>
      <p>His words continue.</p>
      <p>
        “However, this place is the stronghold of the Makli Clan and where the
        Devil Path Alliance once stood! As the successors of the Devil Path
        Alliance’s spirit, we will never yield to a Nascent Soul old monster!”
      </p>
      <p>Makli Hwang-cheon ponders.</p>
      <p>
        ‘The power is definitely beyond Core Formation, but it's too weak for
        Nascent Soul. Just like that person in the desert... But compared to the
        hidden power of the desert cultivator, his attacks are simple and weak.
        This guy...’
      </p>
      <p>Greed flickers in the eyes of Makli Hwang-cheon.</p>
      <p>
        ‘If we mobilize the entire power of the Makli Clan, we can capture him!’
      </p>
      <p>He smirks.</p>
      <p>
        “The jiangshi made from a Nascent Soul cultivator's corpse, just
        thinking about its power makes my heart race! Capturing the Nascent Soul
        old monster, the Makli Clan will leap to greatness once again!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon his declaration, the elders solemnly draw out all their dharma
        treasures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Qi Building elders also simultaneously start forming hand seals in
        unison.
      </p>
      <p>“Unleash an all-out attack! Block the Nascent Soul old monster!”</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Numerous spells, dharma treasures, and magic artifacts fly towards Seo
        Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Yin energy explodes, and spells formed of devilish energy assault Seo
        Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Qi Building elders pull out wartime weapons from the clan's arsenal
        and activate them against Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Siege weapons fly towards him, and numerous devilish fire and jiangshi
        legions swarm him like a tide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Numerous formation barriers in the Makli Clan's palace activates,
        restricting Seo Eun-hyeon's power.
      </p>
      <p>Against all that.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun swings his sword.</p>
      <p>“Aaaaah!”</p>
      <p>“We're being sucked in!”</p>
      <p>“Block it! Block it!”</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Layered Mountains!</p>
      <p>Kuguaguagua!</p>
      <p>
        Colorless trajectory extends in all directions, filling the entire
        space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dozens of Qi Building cultivators are split apart, and several parts of
        Core Formation elders' bodies are torn off.
      </p>
      <p>
        The colorless trajectory, spreading in all directions, writhe like
        tentacles.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Mountain Echoes Valley Responds.</p>
      <p>Ting!</p>
      <p>
        The writhing trajectory turns into a wave, echoing throughout the entire
        cavity, causing everyone except Seo Eun-hyun inside to vomit blood at
        once.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Flowing Ridge!</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The colorless trajectory twists and sweeps away the gathered Qi Building
        cultivators and three Core Formation elders.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>
        The aura of Seo Eun-hyun, integrated with the Formless Sword, begins to
        grow even stronger.
      </p>
      <p>“Block it! Block it!”</p>
      <p>“Set up the formation!”</p>
      <p>“The Nascent Soul old monster is using his power!”</p>
      <p>“Stop the old monster!!!”</p>
      <p>“Aaaaaah!”</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Qi Mountain Heart Heaven!</p>
      <p>He, clad in colorless trajectory, steps forward step by step.</p>
      <p>Like a mountain lord soaring over the mountains.</p>
      <p>
        The movement technique of the Mountain Lord’s Soaring Flight, tailored
        to Seo Eun-hyun and fused with the Formless Sword, becomes a fierce
        weapon in itself.
      </p>
      <p>A giant colorless tiger leaps.</p>
      <p>
        Led by eight Core Formation cultivators, hundreds of Qi Building
        cultivators are swept away by the flight of the lord.
      </p>
      <p>“Buy time! The formation is almost complete!”</p>
      <p>Makli Hwang-cheon clenches his teeth and shouts.</p>
      <p>
        This is the Makli Clan's stronghold and the main base of the Devil Path
        Alliance that they have inherited.
      </p>
      <p>The formations spread here are by no means simple.</p>
      <p>And finally.</p>
      <p>“Form the seal!”</p>
      <p>“Yin Spirit!”</p>
      <p>“Devilish Fire!”</p>
      <p>
        Three Core Formation cultivators and one hundred fifty Qi Building
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>Each group, thus composed, forms different seals.</p>
      <p>
        In the center, Makli Hwang-cheon and the Makli Grand Elder
        simultaneously form hand seals, completing the formation.
      </p>
      <p>"Yin Spirit Devilish Fire Ghost Formation! Activate!"</p>
      <p>Simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        From the Makli Clan's palace, black Devilish Fire surges, engulfing Seo
        Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The yin energy emitted from the Devilish Fire forms a barrier, and from
        the barrier, numerous ghostly wails erupt, creating symbols that
        complete the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eight Core Formation cultivators, from all eight directions,
        simultaneously form seals.
      </p>
      <p>"Seal!"</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>Shortly after.</p>
      <p>A dark green barrier seals the rampaging Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>
        "Struggling within the Devilish Fire, his consciousness will be
        gradually suppressed, and he will be refined into a jiangshi Haha...
        Hahahaha!"
      </p>
      <p>Makli Hwang-cheon bursts into laughter.</p>
      <p>
        "Look, everyone! The Makli Clan has successfully captured and is
        refining a Nascent Soul old monster!!!"
      </p>
      <p>He clenches his fists and looks around at the elders.</p>
      <p>
        "Everyone, contact our territories through the communication division!
        We need more pure blood! Using more pure blood to refine the jiangshi,
        we can truly..."
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>
        Makli Hwang-cheon's face stiffens as he turns to the loud noise behind
        him.
      </p>
      <p>There, he sees the barrier cracked all over.</p>
      <p>"...What?"</p>
      <p>Craaack!</p>
      <p>Once again.</p>
      <p>A loud noise echoes.</p>
      <p>Craaaaack!</p>
      <p>Simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Pukwak!</p>
      <p>
        From inside the flaming barrier, Seo Eun-hyun's hand bursts through.
      </p>
      <p>Kuadukduk!</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun's hand slowly tears apart the barrier.</p>
      <p>
        The colorless trajectory in his hand causes the barrier to crumble,
        widening the cracks.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Pukwak!</p>
      <p>
        His other hand also bursts through the barrier, and he begins widening
        the breach with both hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the Devilish Fire, Seo Eun-hyun's eyes blaze like ghostly fire.
      </p>
      <p>"Not a bad attempt... but you made one mistake."</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun emerges from the Devilish Fire with a pale smile.</p>
      <p>
        "You shouldn't have boasted after sealing me... you should have run
        away..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "How, how can this be... A mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivation should be
        required to break such a barrier!"
      </p>
      <p>Makli Hwang-cheon loses his composure and shouts.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun's eyes explode with brilliance.</p>
      <p>
        "I may be weaker than the typical Nascent Soul, but I have a bit of an
        edge in specialized areas. Early, mid, late... those don't mean much in
        front of me..."
      </p>
      <p>Ssshhhhh!</p>
      <p>
        Finally, Seo Eun-hyun, fully emerged from the Devilish Fire, raises one
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You should have accepted my mercy when it was offered. Those still not
        fleeing have courageously chosen to enter the gate of death, correct?"
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugugu!</p>
      <p>Colorless trajectories boil over his entire body.</p>
      <p>"From now on, I will end the Makli Clan."</p>
      <p>The next moment.</p>
      <p>His pupils seethe pure white.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>Ultimate Technique.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain!</p>
      <p>Kugugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        A colorless storm fills the cavity so densely that no one could find a
        foothold.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mountain range where the palace stood is split into thousands of
        pieces.
      </p>
      <p>The Makli Clan's palace is torn apart, turning into dust.</p>
      <p>"Phew..."</p>
      <p>And thus.</p>
      <p>
        The Makli Clan, one of the twin pillars of Yanguo and rulers of the
        imperial family for hundreds of years, disappeared into the annals of
        history that very day.

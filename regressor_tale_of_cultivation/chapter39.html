      <p>Chapter 39: Cultivator (3)</p>
      <p>"Haah..."</p>
      <p>
        I naturally let out a sigh of admiration as I looked around at the
        scenery.
      </p>
      <p>It was overwhelming.</p>
      <p>
        The exterior of the buildings and the people passing by felt similar to
        the bustling streets of Seokyung City, but the essence of this place was
        entirely different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through my awakened Five Energies Converging to the Origin vision, I
        could see the vast flows of heaven and earth energy rippling throughout
        the Spirit Path Conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flow of heaven and earth energy enveloped the entire land, and
        countless tiny spell runes moved to form a barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, buildings were also covered in layers of inscrutable spell
        runes and magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only people and animals, but even the weeds on the streets were
        imbued with spiritual energy, and the buildings themselves exuded a
        majestic aura.
      </p>
      <p>'Those intents...'</p>
      <p>
        Everywhere I looked, there were only cultivators with consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        After being accustomed to the markets of mortals without consciousness,
        being at a cultivator's exchange meeting felt strangely novel.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the markets of mortals, the place is chaotic due to countless humans
        unable to control their intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at the cultivators' exchange, everyone tightly controlled their
        consciousness, making it difficult to discern their intents without
        close inspection.
      </p>
      <p>It felt spiritually much cleaner.</p>
      <p>
        I was momentarily taken aback by the sight, but I decided to look around
        and get a sense of the place.
      </p>
      <p>'What do they sell at the cultivators' exchange meeting?'</p>
      <p>
        While it felt spiritually different, at first glance, it didn’t seem
        much different from a luxurious downtown area.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were street vendors selling talismans, herb sellers with
        unfamiliar herbs, and tamers sitting with cages of strange beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for the value of the items and currency being incomparably higher
        than in the markets of mortals, it seemed quite similar.
      </p>
      <p>"A pound of Jasawhong!"</p>
      <p>"Selling Xian spiritual plant!"</p>
      <p>"Special large storage artifacts, only seven left!"</p>
      <p>
        As I passed by a stall selling fascinating spiritual herbs and
        restoratives, my eyes were drawn to a certain magic artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the vendor selling items put his hand into a small pouch, he
        reached in all the way up to his shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm... fascinating."</p>
      <p>
        I unknowingly entered the store and looked at the storage magic
        artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Excuse me, I'm just a country bumpkin, but how much can fit inside
        these storage artifacts?"
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm? Hmm.."</p>
      <p>
        The cultivator vendor looked at me drowsily and chuckled. A hint of
        disdain was evident in his consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The lowest-performing storage artifact we sell here can hold about one
        stone (approximately 180 liters)."
      </p>
      <p>He pointed to the small pouch as he spoke.</p>
      <p>That small thing could contain all my current belongings.</p>
      <p>'Incredible.'</p>
      <p>
        Just having that small pouch would vastly increase the types of poisons
        and hidden weapons I could carry.
      </p>
      <p>
        For someone who often used hidden weapons, it was a very tempting item.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shopkeeper, seemingly unimpressed by my appearance, gestured and
        said,
      </p>
      <p>
        "This one is 50 spirit stones. If you don't have money, don't block the
        shop, please move aside..."
      </p>
      <p>"How much is the most expensive one?"</p>
      <p>
        I looked past the small storage artifacts to a more luxurious-looking
        one.
      </p>
      <p>'To quickly draw out hidden weapons, that would be better.'</p>
      <p>I pointed to a rosary-shaped bracelet and asked,</p>
      <p>"I like that one. I'll take it."</p>
      <p>"That's 300 spirit stones."</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>
        I put down the bag containing spirit stones and selected 300 stones to
        give to the shop owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked momentarily flustered, but soon changed his expression and
        handed over the storage artifact with a smooth smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, sir, you indeed have a good eye. This storage bracelet is the
        best for storing items. Each of the 27 beads on this bracelet can hold
        three stones' volume, secured with space manipulation..."
      </p>
      <p>
        I roughly listened to the explanation and purchased the storage
        bracelet.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I infused energy into the storage bracelet on my wrist, it shone
        brightly and absorbed the items I designated.
      </p>
      <p>Touching the bracelet, the desired item immediately appeared.</p>
      <p>"Sir, our store has other fine magic artifacts as well..."</p>
      <p>
        He showed me other artifacts, but except for the storage artifacts, most
        required a considerable amount of spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        'With my current lack of spiritual power, most are practically useless.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, even if I bought mid to low-tier magic artifacts at the Qi
        Refining level, most would be weaker than my Sword Gang.
      </p>
      <p>In short, they were just expensive luxuries to me.</p>
      <p>"Hmm, sorry, but I don't see anything else I need."</p>
      <p>As I coughed and was about to leave, the shop owner inquired,</p>
      <p>
        "Well, if that's the case. Are you looking for something specific? Not
        just magic artifacts, but talismans, elixirs... I have good connections
        with merchants in the Spirit Path Conference and can introduce you to
        some good shops."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, do you perhaps sell books here?"</p>
      <p>"Oh, are you looking to purchase books on cultivation methods?"</p>
      <p>
        "Well, that and just general knowledge about the world of cultivation...
        Is there a bookstore that sells such books?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing my question, the owner thought for a moment, then stepped
        out of the store and pointed down one of the streets in the Spirit Path
        Conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you go down that street and turn right at the third crossroad,
        you'll find 'Cheong-nan Bookstore.' They sell a variety of books, and
        the owner, an old man, is well-known for recommending the right books to
        his customers."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, I see. Thank you."</p>
      <p>
        "You're welcome. If you need anything else, please visit our store
        again!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I left the magic tool store and headed for the bookstore the owner had
        mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>'Cheong-nan Bookstore...'</p>
      <p>
        The bookstore looked quite ordinary from the outside, almost
        unnoticeable. It felt strangely out of place in the atmosphere of the
        Spirit Path Conference.
      </p>
      <p>"Is the owner here?"</p>
      <p>"Cough, cough, cough..."</p>
      <p>
        As I opened the door, dust scattered around, and I heard coughing from
        inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, a customer? It's been a long time since I've had a visitor,
        welcome. My name is Cheong-nan, the surname Eom."
      </p>
      <p>
        The person introducing himself as the owner, Mr. Eom, was an elderly man
        with a long beard that reached his waist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Eom's consciousness seemed to be around the level of Qi Refining,
        but for some reason, the boundaries of his consciousness were blurry and
        hard to discern.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could feel the multiple writing brushes he wore on his chest blurring
        my vision.
      </p>
      <p>Sensing my gaze, Mr. Eom pointed to the brushes and said,</p>
      <p>
        "Ah, these? They're low-tier magic artifacts that obscure one's
        cultivation level. If you buy more than five books from this bookstore,
        you get one as a free gift. Somehow, I have a feeling you'll be taking
        one with you. Heh heh.."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Not bad. Anyway, I'd like to buy books on basic knowledge of the
        cultivation world, Qi Gathering, and the cultivation methods for Qi
        Refining cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, good. I'll give you a gift in advance. Heh heh..."</p>
      <p>
        Mr. Eom took off one of the brushes hanging on his chest and handed it
        to me, then went into the storeroom and came back with several books.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Let's see, here are 'Basic Knowledge of the Cultivation World,'
        'Etiquette for Cultivators,' '100 Essential Facts Cultivators Should
        Know,' 'On the Realms of Cultivators.' Four basic knowledge books. Then,
        'Analysis of Qi Gathering' which interprets Qi Gathering, and 'Myriad Qi
        Gathering Methods' outlining optimal Qi Gathering techniques for
        different types of spiritual roots. Two books on Qi Gathering.
      </p>
      <p>And finally, a total of 13 books on basic methods for Qi Refining."</p>
      <p>
        He stacked 19 books in front of me, handed me six books on Qi Gathering
        and basic knowledge, and then spread out the 13 books on Qi Refining
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Choose whichever you like from these 13... If we start with this 'Great
        Five Elements World Changing Technique'..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Eom laid out the basic cultivation books for me and gave a brief
        explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "These are the types of books we have in Cheong-nan Bookstore. But you
        should know, these basic cultivation books are all based on foundational
        principles. They explain the concepts of each level well, and the
        spiritual power is quite pure at the Qi Refining stage, but they don't
        specialize in any particular field.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the basic cultivation methods of the Jin Clan for Qi
        Refining are specialized in fire and wind elements, and the basic
        cultivation methods of the Makli Clan are specialized in yin, water, and
        wind elements. These 13 books are common basic methods that can be found
        in many other stores, not just mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the reason they're so widespread is that they're
        straightforward and have pure spiritual power."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, Mr. Eom, do you have any methods you'd recommend?"</p>
      <p>"What type of spiritual root do you have?"</p>
      <p>"I possess Five Elements Spiritual Roots."</p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, Mr. Eom rummaged through his books and presented a
        cultivation book titled 'Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation.'
      </p>
      <p>
        "It contains five methods: Earth Surpassing Path, Water Surpassing Path,
        Fire Surpassing Path, Wood Surpassing Path, and Metal Surpassing Path,
        each suited to the corresponding spiritual root. Each one helps in
        gathering pure spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        While they don't specialize, allowing you to use only the basic spells
        of Qi Refining... If you master two or more of these methods, you'll
        benefit from a faster recovery of spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the latter part of the cultivation book, apart from special abilities
        of Qi Refining itself, there are some basic spells recorded, like
        defensive spells, telekinesis, concealment, consciousness spells, and
        telepathy."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, then I'll take this."</p>
      <p>
        Since I had no knowledge of cultivation methods, I bought all the books
        without much thought.
      </p>
      <p>"The total comes to forty-nine spirit stones."</p>
      <p>
        'The price of these books is about the same as some common low-grade
        magic artifacts. Well, it makes sense since they contain cultivation
        methods up to the 14th Star of Qi Refining.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I received the books from Mr. Eom, put them in my storage bracelt, and
        asked him a question.
      </p>
      <p>
        "By the way, Mr. Eom. Do you know where the cultivators of the Cheongmun
        Clan are staying during the Spirit Path Conference?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm? I believe they often stay across the street for lodging. Actually,
        this is my first time setting up a shop at the Spirit Path Conference,
        so I'm not too sure. I used to wander around with my books."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, I see. I hope you find a good spot then."</p>
      <p>
        "That's alright. To be honest, I opened this bookstore just for fun, not
        really to settle down. I find wandering around more enjoyable. Besides,
        I have another main occupation."
      </p>
      <p>"That's good to hear. Thank you for the gift. Farewell."</p>
      <p>
        I bid farewell to Mr. Eom and left Cheong-nan Bookstore, heading across
        the street as he had mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the way, I felt an odd sensation and looked back at Cheong-nan
        Bookstore.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Did that store owner really recommend me to a good bookstore? Mr. Eom's
        reaction didn't seem to match the story about being popular with many
        customers before... Huh, perhaps they have some personal connections.'
      </p>
      <p>
        While pondering this, I walked through the street where I could find
        lodging.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Even though I know where to stay, the place is quite large. How am I
        going to find the people from the Cheongmun Clan...'
      </p>
      <p>However, my concern was short-lived.</p>
      <p>"Ah! The rascals from the Cheongmun Clan!"</p>
      <p>"Damn it, why are those foul-tempered people here!"</p>
      <p>
        "Look, just stay away from here so you don't get caught up in their
        trouble!"
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        Silently, I watched people avoiding the area and noticed a pair of man
        and woman walking towards my location from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both were dressed in dark black robes, exuding a strong fighting spirit
        as they walked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man, especially, was a burly giant, wearing a storage artifact
        similar to mine on his wrist.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Hmm, it seems like something very unpleasant has happened. Their intent
        is predominantly red with anger.'
      </p>
      <p>
        The man and woman from the Cheongmun Clan seem furious as their intent
        colored red with rage near their upper dantian.
      </p>
      <p>It was then.</p>
      <p>Thunk-</p>
      <p>"Haha, this is a good purchase..."</p>
      <p>
        A man in a red robe, stepping out from between the lodgings, bumped into
        the giant from the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>'That attire, that seal... is he from the Jin Clan?'</p>
      <p>
        The man from the Jin Clan, seeing the giant, nodded as if to apologize,
        then tried to continue on his way.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the giant from the Cheongmun Clan grabbed the shoulder
        of the cultivator from the Jin Clan.
      </p>
      <p>"If you bump into someone, shouldn't you apologize?"</p>
      <p>"Huh? I did apologize, what is the problem?"</p>
      <p>"You... Are you making fun of me?"</p>
      <p>"What? Gah! Ack!"</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the giant exerted force on his grip and the cultivator from
        the Jin Clan screamed and fell to his knees.
      </p>
      <p>"You, you son of a..!"</p>
      <p>Click, click!</p>
      <p>
        Around the Jin Clan cultivator, spiritual power of the fire element
        started to spread, and sparks began to fly off him.
      </p>
      <p>"Will you not let go?"</p>
      <p>
        "Hmph. You bump into me and instead of apologizing, you act all high and
        mighty. Even if you get beaten to death, you'll have no one to blame."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You, you son of a bitch! If you do not let go of me and kneel down
        right now, I'll make sure you can never use that hand again..!"
      </p>
      <p>
        'There’s trouble. I don't know about the giant's character, but the
        cultivators from the Jin Clan are known for their fiery temper and
        strong pride...'
      </p>
      <p>The woman beside the giant spoke.</p>
      <p>
        "Aren't you aware of the Spirit Path Conference's rules? Inside this
        area, the use of spells above Qi Refining 2nd Star for attacks is
        prohibited. Also, causing injury to others is forbidden."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha, so what? You're going to use the rules of the Spirit Path
        Conference to stop me.."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I’m saying, as long as you abide by 'attacks using spells above the
        limit' and 'inflicting injuries' rules, you can do whatever you want.
        One of our clan members used this to his advantage in a scuffle
        recently,"
      </p>
      <p>The woman from the Cheongmun Clan spoke.</p>
      <p>
        At this, the giant grinned and, in an instant, a bright light burst from
        his fist, striking the cultivator from the Jin Clan squarely in the
        face.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The fire spell the Jin Clan cultivator was about to use shattered, and
        he was sent flying over a distance of more than a meter.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Aaagh! You, you bastard! How dare you injure me! Do you think you can
        leave the Spirit Path Conference unscathed after this?"
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, noisy."</p>
      <p>The giant grumbled.</p>
      <p>Thump! Thump!</p>
      <p>
        Approaching the Jin Clan cultivator, the giant grabbed his collar and
        began to beat him with his luminous fist.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Stop, stop! This guy is breaking the rules of the Spirit Path
        Conference!"
      </p>
      <p>
        However, no cultivator dared to intervene, as the Jin Clan cultivator
        wasn't actually injured.
      </p>
      <p>I sensed a familiar energy emanating from the giant's fist.</p>
      <p>'It's the same healing technique Sir Chang-ho used to fix my arm.'</p>
      <p>
        Indeed, the giant was beating the Jin Clan cultivator with a healing
        technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why, why isn't the Spirit Path Conference's protective barrier
        activating against a Qi Refining 2nd Star level attack...!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being the one getting hit, the Jin Clan cultivator seemed too
        preoccupied to understand why the conference's rules weren't being
        enforced.
      </p>
      <p>"You. Damn. Little…If you bump into someone..."</p>
      <p>"Ahh, ahhh!"</p>
      <p>Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivator, trying to escape the giant's grip, kept casting
        spells, but the blue light emanating from the giant's hand held him
        firmly in place.
      </p>
      <p>"Tsk tsk, seems like the Jin Clan cultivator met his match."</p>
      <p>
        "It seems they were only paying attention to cultivators from certain
        regions and not from others."
      </p>
      <p>
        "He didn't know that the Cheongmun Clan is infamous for their foul
        temper..."
      </p>
      <p>
        The other cultivators didn't interfere in this bizarre fight where one
        was beating the other while healing them; they just watched from a
        distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most onlookers appeared to be around the Qi Refining 3rd or 4th Star..
      </p>
      <p>
        The giant from the Cheongmun Clan, and even the woman observing beside
        him, seemed to be at least Qi Refining 5th Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        '...Sir Chang-ho, the founder, is a generous and kind person. Seems like
        his clan's branch family members are a bit less so.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I clicked my tongue watching the Cheongmun Clan giant mercilessly beat
        the Jin Clan cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        '...Tsk. I don't particularly like the Jin Clan, but seeing someone who
        was once on my side in a past life being beaten like this doesn't sit
        well with me.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I approached the giant who was still beating the nearly unconscious Jin
        Clan cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Excuse me, sir. It seems the Jin Clan member has learned his lesson.
        Perhaps it's time to forgive him."
      </p>
      <p>"Huh? Who are you to meddle in our affair?"</p>
      <p>
        "It does not matter who I am. Your behavior does not seem very
        honorable. Please, let him go now."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha, if you don't like it, try to take this arrogant fool away from me.
        Let's see how strong a Qi Refining 3rd Star like you is..."
      </p>
      <p>I didn't need to use my hands.</p>
      <p>
        I used the essence of Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting
        Martial Arts' ultimate technique, adjusting its power before shooting it
        at the giant.
      </p>
      <p>"Aaaaah!"</p>
      <p>
        The giant clutched his head and let go of the Jin Clan cultivator. I
        quickly went over to the latter, pressing on a point to alleviate his
        pain.
      </p>
      <p>"Are you alright?"</p>
      <p>"Hu, huff...! Heuughk... Thank you, really, thank you..."</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivator, appearing to be around Qi Refining 4th to 5th
        Star, tearfully thanked me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I do not know who you are, but if you ever come to Yanguo's Cheombuk
        City, I will repay this favor. Use this token to contact me when you are
        there. I must go now. Thank you for today!"
      </p>
      <p>
        After thanking me, he handed me a token and hurriedly left, fearing that
        the giant might rise again to strike him.
      </p>
      <p>"How dare you harm us?"</p>
      <p>The woman from the Cheongmun Clan glared at me, blocking the giant.</p>
      <p>I smiled and spoke.</p>
      <p>
        "My technique is not like Qi Refining spells, so I do not believe I have
        violated any Spirit Path Conference rules. And where exactly is the
        injury on that man?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmph! You seem to have cunningly skirted the rules using some
        consciousness technique. You will regret picking a fight with the
        Cheongmun Clan's descendants..!"
      </p>
      <p>Blue light also emanated from the woman's hand.</p>
      <p>
        It was the same healing technique used to beat the Jin Clan cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>However, I swiftly cut through her technique with a hand-chop.</p>
      <p>
        Her hand remained intact, but the blue light was severed in mid-air.
      </p>
      <p>"What, what..."</p>
      <p>Swiish</p>
      <p>
        I quickly approached her, extending two fingers and slowly thrusted
        towards her.
      </p>
      <p>"Defense!"</p>
      <p>
        The Cheongmun Clan's woman, startled, hastily summoned a transparent
        barrier with a spell, but it shattered instantly as I released Gang Qi
        from my fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly dispersed the Gang Qi and pressed on a vital point on her
        body.
      </p>
      <p>"Cough!"</p>
      <p>
        The Cheongmun Clan's woman clutched the pressed point, groaning in pain
        and collapsing to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You use a healing technique to beat people. I am also well-versed in
        the human body, knowing where to strike to heal and cause pain at the
        same time... Shall we try it?"
      </p>
      <p>"Eek, you..."</p>
      <p>"Hold on."</p>
      <p>Her face flushed with anger as she was about to cast a spell on me.</p>
      <p>
        The Cheongmun Clan's giant, stopping her, clutched his head and stood
        up.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ahem. My apologies. I did not realize you were a senior with concealed
        cultivation."
      </p>
      <p>"Huh?"</p>
      <p>As I wondered, he pointed to the brush at my waist and said.</p>
      <p>
        "I did not recognize it before, but that tool blurs your cultivation
        level, making it hard for me to perceive. Please forgive our rudeness."
      </p>
      <p>He bowed deeply, asking for forgiveness.</p>
      <p>I nodded, accepting his apology.</p>
      <p>
        "O-Orabeoni (<em
          >formal way of referring to an older brother for a woman</em
        >). That man, no, that person..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Didn't you see his strike just now? He dissipated our spells with a
        wave of his hand and nearly knocked me unconscious with his
        consciousness technique. He must be at least Qi Refining 7th Star."
      </p>
      <p>"That, that's... I apologize for my rudeness as well."</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>I felt awkward and scratched my head.</p>
      <p>
        What would they do if they knew I wasn't a Qi Refining 7th Star, but a
        martial artist without any spiritual power?
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems they mistook me for a high-level cultivator disguising my
        cultivation with a tool.
      </p>
      <p>'The reality is the opposite, though.'</p>
      <p>"...By the way, do you recognize this pattern?"</p>
      <p>
        I showed them the pattern of recommendation from Sir Chang-ho on the
        back of my hand.
      </p>
      <p>The giant's eyes widened.</p>
      <p>
        "This is an external family recommendation token. It's at least from a
        main family elder or a public official level. We failed to recognize a
        distinguished person like yourself. Please forgive us for this as well."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Luckily you know of it. Actually, I was looking for people from the
        Cheongmun Clan because of this... So, how do I join as an external
        member using this?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, it is simple. Come to our clan's territory, and receiving
        confirmation from just one elder-level senior will make you an external
        member immediately. Haha, since it has come to this, we will escort you
        to our territory as soon as the Spirit Path Conference is over."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, thank you."</p>
      <p>
        I nodded to the now humble Cheongmun Clan siblings and decided to find
        lodging nearby, waiting until the end of the Spirit Path Conference.
      </p>
      <p>Twenty days passed, and the Spirit Path Conference ended.</p>
      <p>Guided by the Cheongmun Clan siblings,</p>
      <p>I arrived at the Cheongmun Clan's territory in Byeokra.</p>

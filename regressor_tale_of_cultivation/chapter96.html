      <p>"...What wind blew into you?"</p>
      <p>
        [It's none of an outsider's business. If you don't know, keep quiet.]
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        Although I felt irritated for a moment, seeing Seo Ran and Song Jin both
        seemingly relying on each other to some extent, I nod.
      </p>
      <p>"Congratulations then."</p>
      <p>"I can only thank you again, senior."</p>
      <p>
        "It’s alright. Seeing Seo Ran happy, it seems I've done well in carrying
        out the Sea Dragon King's errand."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran smiles at me and says,</p>
      <p>
        "Someday, if you need my help, please call on me. It’s all thanks to
        you, senior, so I’ll be sure to answer your requests three times, no
        matter what."
      </p>
      <p>"I appreciate your kindness."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran bids me farewell, and Song Jin, with a gruff look, tosses a
        comment at me.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Since you've helped my disciple, as a master, I want to repay you. Is
        there anything you desire? I’ll grant you three requests.]
      </p>
      <p>"Three requests..."</p>
      <p>I first point to my upper dantian and ask him.</p>
      <p>
        "Can you possibly dissolve the mental restraint curse on my upper
        dantian?"
      </p>
      <p>[Hm?]</p>
      <p>Hearing my words, Song Jin looks at me and asks,</p>
      <p>
        [Who placed the mental restraint curse on you? It’s not the Sea Dragon
        King or someone of that sort, is it? I can't dissolve a curse by a
        Heavenly Being.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, it's a person called Bloodwood Practitioner Yuan Li. Do you know
        him?"
      </p>
      <p>[Ah...]</p>
      <p>Song Jin nods and replies.</p>
      <p>
        [I know of him. He's that Core Formation cultivator living in the
        Heaven-Treading Desert, correct? The one with an unusual dharma
        treasure. He couldn't reach the Nascent Soul realm due to lack of
        potential and was extending his life with elixirs.]
      </p>
      <p>"Unusual dharma treasure?"</p>
      <p>
        [Yes, it's a black castle-shaped dharma treasure. I don’t know its exact
        name, but inside the castle, its owner can possess strength beyond their
        realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Core Formation peak can have the strength of a Nascent Soul. Early
        Nascent Soul can have the strength of mid-Nascent Soul. Mid Nascent Soul
        can have the strength of late Nascent Soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a powerful dharma treasure that gives its owner strength beyond
        their realm, quite famous among Core Formation cultivators.]
      </p>
      <p>Shiver!</p>
      <p>
        'If I had directly sought Yuan Li in the Heaven-Treading Desert
        before...'
      </p>
      <p>
        In the black castle, the Yuan Li, possessing the strength of the Nascent
        Soul realm, would have been my opponent.
      </p>
      <p>'I'm glad I didn’t go.'</p>
      <p>I inwardly sigh in relief and ask.</p>
      <p>
        "Why don't the Heavenly Being seniors covet such an incredible dharma
        treasure?"
      </p>
      <p>[Ah, that...]</p>
      <p>Song Jin clicks his tongue and explains,</p>
      <p>
        [It’s useless to anyone above Heavenly Being. Moreover, the dharma
        treasure has a force of destiny, making the trials of ascension much
        harder. That’s why no one really touches it. Though, I’ve heard rumors
        that the Sea Dragon King peculiarly sought that dharma treasure.]
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        'Did Bloodwood Yuan Li desperately attack Serving Command Palace because
        of the black castle...'
      </p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, this mental restraint curse was placed by that Bloodwood
        Practitioner Yuan Li. Can you undo it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [Let me see, I need to flow my consciousness into your upper dantian to
        understand the curse.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Are you planning to do something with my consciousness as an excuse?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [You, do you think so little of me, even though I am just a remnant soul
        now..!]
      </p>
      <p>I look at him for a moment and then ask,</p>
      <p>
        "Can you promise not to harm me, swearing on the Nether Crossing Ship?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [Yes, I, Song Jin, swear on the Nether Crossing Ship not to harm you.
        Satisfied!?]
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, alright."</p>
      <p>I nod and cautiously allow him access to my upper dantian.</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin’s cold consciousness infiltrates my domain of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, his consciousness brushes past the Five Elements Blood
        Curse Banner in my upper dantian and then leaves.
      </p>
      <p>Opening his mouth, Song Jin says,</p>
      <p>[If I were alive, maybe I could have dissolved it in a month.]</p>
      <p>"So that means..."</p>
      <p>
        [It's a bit difficult now. The curse was cast by Yuan Li, correct? Since
        he has the skills of the Nascent Soul realm, it's not easy with my
        current power.]
      </p>
      <p>"I see..."</p>
      <p>[However.]</p>
      <p>Song Jin crosses his arms and continues.</p>
      <p>His face reverts from the middle-aged face to his skeletal form.</p>
      <p>
        [I can teach you a method to master the curse yourself. It's slower but
        effective in dissolving the curse, and once fully dissolved, you can
        transform it into your own unique technique.]
      </p>
      <p>"Interesting, what method is it?"</p>
      <p>
        [It's called the 'One Emotion Method,’ a consciousness technique. You
        focus endlessly on a single emotion, understand it, and infuse your
        mental restraint with that emotion, making it your own.]
      </p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin tears off a piece of the damaged Nether Crossing Ship and
        writes down the intricacies of the One Emotion Method, handing it over
        to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Here, no tricks involved. Take this. And what about the other two
        requests?]
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, thank you."</p>
      <p>
        After skimming through the details of the One Emotion Method, I ask him
        for a cultivation method with the same requirements as last time..
      </p>
      <p>
        'Between Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll and Silica Earth Great Wall
        Practice, I wonder which one is better.’
      </p>
      <p>After some thinking, I request Silica Earth Great Wall Practice.</p>
      <p>
        [Silica Earth Great Wall Practice, huh? It's quite a complex one to
        master, is that alright?]
      </p>
      <p>"It doesn't matter."</p>
      <p>
        [Hmm, if mastered, it’s a method that can manipulate dragon veins,
        making one unmatched. However, it requires understanding the land where
        you’re rooted. It’s not only difficult to understand but also
        drastically loses power once you leave your original location, making it
        a half-useless method…]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Does that not mean if I stay in my original place my power will
        increase significantly?"
      </p>
      <p>I recall my past life.</p>
      <p>
        'It seems better to learn the Silica Earth Great Wall Practice and
        defend either Shattered Heaven Peak or Serving Command Palace, as I will
        likely be stationed in one place.'
      </p>
      <p>[If that's what you want.]</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin once again produces the intricacies of the Silica Earth Great
        Wall Practice.
      </p>
      <p>[And your last request?]</p>
      <p>"My last request is..."</p>
      <p>I look at Song Jin and point at Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>"Please teach Seo Ran well. That will suffice."</p>
      <p>[......]</p>
      <p>
        Since Seo Ran has already offered to help me, there is no need to
        extract everything from Song Jin.
      </p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, Song Jin looks momentarily flustered but then speaks.</p>
      <p>
        [That goes without saying. Since it's something I should do anyway,
        consider that request void, and I'll owe you another favor in the
        future.]
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>I bow to Song Jin and then rise from my seat.</p>
      <p>
        With Seo Ran's matter resolved and the One Emotion Method obtained, it
        seems the issue with the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner will be
        resolved in about 30 to 40 years.
      </p>
      <p>'Now, what remains is...'</p>
      <p>Extending Kim Young-hoon's lifespan.</p>
      <p>I recall the framework of the spell used by Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>'I understand the general idea.'</p>
      <p>
        Yet, could I redefine those details into a new spell to ripen the fruit
        of longevity?
      </p>
      <p>First, I need a powerful energy source.</p>
      <p>
        A source comparable to the boundless life energy Yuan Li absorbed from
        the Core Formation cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>A powerful energy source.</p>
      <p>'What can it be...'</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, my thoughts turn to the newly received Silica Earth Great Wall
        Practice.
      </p>
      <p>A method that will ultimately allow control over dragon veins.</p>
      <p>'Dragon veins...'</p>
      <p>I stare intently at the Silica Earth Great Wall Practice.</p>
      <p>
        'Could I use the immense power of dragon veins, refine it with Yuan Li’s
        spell, and make the Longevity Fruit ripen?'
      </p>
      <p>
        The immense natural force flowing through the earth might be comparable
        to the life energy of tens of thousands.
      </p>
      <p>'Of course, it's fantastical.'</p>
      <p>It’s an unrealistic thought.</p>
      <p>
        If it was that easy, why would there be devilish clans and human elixirs
        in this world?
      </p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>'Right now, even such a fanciful idea needs consideration.'</p>
      <p>I have to invest in seemingly impossible tasks to forge new paths.</p>
      <p>And for that, I need,</p>
      <p>'Formations and knowledge.'</p>
      <p>New knowledge.</p>
      <p>And if it's knowledge about formations.</p>
      <p>
        'The three great figures of the Qi Building realm. The alchemy of Makli
        Yeun-ryo. The magic artifacts of Gomyo Cheon-saek. And the formations of
        Cheongmun Ryeong.'
      </p>
      <p>I decide to seek out Cheongmun Ryeong.</p>
      <p>
        After receiving the Silica Earth Great Wall Practice from Song Jin, I
        left the Black Wind Sea and went to where Kim Young-hoon was waiting.
      </p>
      <p>"You've grown even more in these few days..."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon has already taken another step towards Five Energies
        Converging to the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You’re right. Since I couldn't speak the language here, I focused more
        on reading people's intents, which advanced my understanding of Three
        Flowers Gather at the Summit."
      </p>
      <p>I am amazed at his rate of growth.</p>
      <p>
        Despite my easy explanation about Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin, he's already nearing that realm.
      </p>
      <p>'He might reach the realm faster than expected.'</p>
      <p>After pondering for a moment, I speak to him.</p>
      <p>"Kim Hyung, how about we part ways now?"</p>
      <p>"What? Why are you saying that all of a sudden?"</p>
      <p>
        "From what I see, Kim Hyung. You grow faster when you assimilate and
        apply understanding on your own, rather than just digesting what I've
        simplified and organized. I've already taught you everything regarding
        Five Energies Converging to the Origin, including the Ultimate Pinnacle
        and Beyond the Path to Heaven."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, you did."</p>
      <p>
        "Then, from now on, why not try reaching Beyond the Path to Heaven on
        your own in this world?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Given his nature, it seems he woul progress faster by challenging
        himself against the world rather than just following me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though he looks flustered at first, my continued persuasion eventually
        leads him to nod in agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        After parting with Kim Young-hoon and asking him to eliminate Makli Jung
        later on, I leave Yanguo and head towards the Cheongmun Clan in Byeokra.
      </p>
      <p>
        "'If I directly go to the main house of the Cheongmun Clan, it will
        certainly surprise them...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, the main houses of cultivating clans are known to those who
        should know, but officially, it’s a secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultivators of the Core Formation realm and above, such as clan heads
        and Core Formation elders, could visit other clan's main houses without
        being considered rude.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, for elders who are merely at the Qi Building level, it's basic
        etiquette to pass through the territory of the cultivating clan before
        visiting, unless instructed by the clan head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, my actual strength is at Core Formation, but since my visible
        skill is at the very beginning of Qi Building, I decide to act
        accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>
        I head to the territory of the Cheongmun Clan and use a spell on the
        formation that envelops the territory to give it a stimulus.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Pure Spiritual Force momentarily interacts with the formation, and
        soon after, a cultivator of the Qi Refining 12th Star comes out.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘“I am Cheongmun Jeon of the Cheongmun Clan. May I know which senior
        from which clan you are?”
      </p>
      <p>He asks me courteously, and I reply.</p>
      <p>
        “I am a wandering cultivator. I heard that a Qi Building cultivator of
        your esteemed clan, known as Cheongmun Ryeong, is an expert in
        formations, and I have come to consult him on a certain matter.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah! You've come to see the elder. Please wait a moment; I will contact
        the elders of the territory.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He takes out a communication device from his pocket, infuses it with
        spiritual power, and relays the reason for my visit.
      </p>
      <p>After a while,</p>
      <p>
        A Qi Building cultivator from inside the territory comes out and
        welcomes me.
      </p>
      <p>“Ha ha, my name is Cheongmun Dan.”</p>
      <p>
        Typical of a cultivator from the Cheongmun Clan, he is a muscular giant,
        and he leads me inside the territory to his residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thank you for visiting the Cheongmun Clan. I heard you wish to see
        Cheongmun Ryeong Hyung. You want to discuss formations.”
      </p>
      <p>“Yes.”</p>
      <p>“May I ask for your name?”</p>
      <p>“My name is Seo Eun-hyun. Please call me Cultivator Seo.”</p>
      <p>
        “Understood, Cultivator Seo. Ha ha, it's an honor for our clan that a
        talent like Cultivator Seo has come to consult with our hyung on
        formations.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, as a distinguished guest like Cultivator Seo has visited, let me
        inform the main house and get back to you. For now, let's have some tea
        while we wait.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Dan treats me, who has reached Qi Building, as an equal guest,
        and we have tea together, sharing various stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there isn't much to talk about regarding cultivation methods,
        the Cheongmun Clan is a martial clan devoted to the Dao of Combat, so he
        and I share our battle experiences and have a hearty conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few days later, I’m invited to the main house of the Cheongmun Clan,
        and finally, I am able to meet Cheongmun Ryeong in person.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Clan’s main house.</p>
      <p>In one of the guest rooms.</p>
      <p>Slide!</p>
      <p>
        The sliding door opens, and a stern-looking old man with a goat beard
        enters.
      </p>
      <p>I stand up and greet him respectfully.</p>
      <p>“Hello, I have long heard of your reputation.”</p>
      <p>
        “Hello. There's no need for such formalities. We are both cultivators of
        the same ream... I will call you Cultivator Seo. You can just call me
        Cultivator Cheongmun.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Facing my past master, who has become Cultivator Cheongmun, I open my
        mouth reluctantly, with a face unable to cry or smile.
      </p>
      <p>“Understood... Cultivator... Cheongmun.”</p>
      <p>My master has appeared before me as Cultivator Cheongmun.</p>

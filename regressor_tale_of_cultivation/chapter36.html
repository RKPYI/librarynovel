        Chapter 36: Five Energies Converging to the Origin and the Changes that
        Followed
      </p>
      <p>
        I descended to the ground, woke up my companions, and briefly explained
        the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems we are stranded, with no knowledge of our location, and so
        on...
      </p>
      <p>I led the group to a cave, lit a fire, and fed them some food.</p>
      <p>After that, I put them back to sleep and left the cave.</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>I kicked off the air and ran towards where the fox was.</p>
      <p>Thud...</p>
      <p>How long did I wander in the air?</p>
      <p>I was able to sense the vast field of consciousness once again.</p>
      <p>A giant fox with three tails.</p>
      <p>This time, how far can I go?</p>
      <p>Thump-</p>
      <p>I landed on the ground.</p>
      <p>
        Then, I slowly approached the fox while simultaneously using Record of
        Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts and Record of
        Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts.
      </p>
      <p>Buzz, Whirr!</p>
      <p>
        Creating a hand blade, I cut through the air, slicing through the fox's
        perception, and approached it slowly.
      </p>
      <p>Just ten steps from the field of consciousness.</p>
      <p>That was my limit in the past life.</p>
      <p>What about now?</p>
      <p>Step-</p>
      <p>Without hesitation, I moved within ten steps.</p>
      <p>Step-</p>
      <p>And then another step.</p>
      <p>
        The texture of consciousness is much clearer and more distinct than when
        I first reached the stage of Three Flowers Gather at the Summit.
      </p>
      <p>It's clear how to cut and navigate through it.</p>
      <p>I continued walking towards the fox's field of consciousness.</p>
      <p>Nine steps, eight steps, seven steps...</p>
      <p>Three steps, two steps, and then the last one.</p>
      <p>
        Hesitating with just one step left, I focused my intent more intensely
        and took that final step into the fox's field of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>Ugh-</p>
      <p>Like so, I successfully entered the fox's domain of consciousness.</p>
      <p>'The consciousness of a Core Formation demon. Finally...'</p>
      <p>I smiled within the fox's consciousness.</p>
      <p>
        Finally, I can operate to some extent within the consciousness of a Core
        Formation being.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, at least I can flee in front of a Core Formation cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continued to navigate the fox's field of consciousness using the
        martial arts created by Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The size of the fox's consciousness extends 30 zhang (100 m) in radius
        from the fox.
      </p>
      <p>I continued walking, closing in about 1 zhang closer to the fox.</p>
      <p>The remaining distance is about 29 zhang.</p>
      <p>The fox's consciousness gets much denser from here on.</p>
      <p>However, I concentrated my consciousness and gather my intent.</p>
      <p>
        The essence of Kim Young-hoon's enlightenment, evolved from Secrets of
        Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts, is still vivid in my
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >'Its minimum entry requirement is Five Energies Converging to the
          Origin. Just as a first-rate cannot understand the world of the
          pinnacle and an early peak cannot understand the world of Three
          Flowers Gather at the Summit. Anyone below Five Energies cannot
          comprehend this martial art system. It's incomplete because it can't
          be properly transmitted.'</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>The end of my past life.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's words echo in my mind.</p>
      <p>'But you don't need to worry. This martial art will now...'</p>
      <p>I concentrate.</p>
      <p>'Be inherited by me...'</p>
      <p>Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts!</p>
      <p>
        A supreme martial art system that only begins with Five Energies, born
        through all the stages from Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts to Secrets of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding
        Martial Arts.
      </p>
      <p>That enlightenment blooms from my fingertips.</p>
      <p>
        Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts lets one
        slice through consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Record of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts lets one
        harmonize with consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts lets one divide
        consciousness!
      </p>
      <p>Sword Gang forms in the air.</p>
      <p>
        The shining Sword Gang, moving on its own, unfolds Record of Surpassing
        Cultivation and Martial Arts and burrows into the fox's consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Sword Gang is inanimate, it doesn't cause any worry for biological
        reactions or other thoughts, making it much more easy to enter and only
        needs to cut through consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sword Gang swiftly crosses another 6 zhang, closing the distance to
        the fox t0 23 zhang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond this point, the density of the consciousness was definitely
        thicker, making it hard to approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dispersed the Sword Gang and organized the essence of Record of
        Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        'So this is what the enlightenment of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial
        Arts is like...'
      </p>
      <p>
        A technique where I divide my consciousness, input actions, and
        implement it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not just simple actions, but even thoughts and enlightenment could be
        input, allowing me to fully unfold my techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        'This is the essence leading to the next realm beyond Five Energies
        Converging to the Origin...'
      </p>
      <p>The realm of using Gang Qi Compression Sphere.</p>
      <p>
        Until now, I wondered how Kim Young-hoon managed to intercept opponents
        with spheres of Gang Qi but now I'm beginning to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I continue to follow the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial
        Arts, I will eventually reach the realm beyond Five Energies.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that hope, I cut through the fox's consciousness again and return
        to the cave.
      </p>
      <p>The next morning.</p>
      <p>
        The fox came again, asking for my arm, and I simply gave it to it again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe because my new arm was free of cholesterol and nicotine, the fox
        chewed it very deliciously, seemingly coveting the rest of me, but
        eventually said it would come back in five days and left.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems my body has become more suited to the fox's taste after my
        transformation.
      </p>
      <p>A few days passed.</p>
      <p>Soon they arrived..</p>
      <p>Swoosh-</p>
      <p>As Sir Chang-ho stomped his foot, my arm regenerated.</p>
      <p>Three cultivators appeared and looked around us.</p>
      <p>This time, the reaction was slightly different than before.</p>
      <p>[Hmm, so there are four with spiritual roots.]</p>
      <p>The middle-aged man in a golden robe flicked his hand.</p>
      <p>
        As his consciousness moved, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth
        spontaneously writhed and enveloped me, Jeon Myeong-hoon, Oh Hyun-seok,
        and Kang Min-hee.
      </p>
      <p>'This is a new sight.'</p>
      <p>
        Until now, only the same three were chosen, but now I was also the
        subject of their interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        They chatted amongst themselves, then one by one took Jeon Myeong-hoon,
        Kang Min-hee, Oh Hyun-seok, and turned their attention to me.
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm, not responding to my spell.]</p>
      <p>[No reaction to my Earthen Listening Technique.]</p>
      <p>[My Law View shows no reaction.]</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>Woong woong-</p>
      <p>
        I felt my consciousness tremble at their strange method of conversation,
        resonating with vibrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t realize until now, but with awakened consciousness, I
        understood their way of speaking was not through voice but by directly
        infusing meaning into consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>[Well, let's see what kind of spiritual nature you have.]</p>
      <p>The man in the golden robe reached out to me.</p>
      <p>Woong woong-</p>
      <p>"Cough!"</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy of heaven and earth moved on its own, compressing
        my entire body.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the spiritual energy forced its way into my meridians,
        wreaking havoc throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, I felt the consciousness of the man in the golden robe
        thoroughly searching my entire body.
      </p>
      <p>"Kgh, Agh!"</p>
      <p>Pain as if holes were being drilled into all my meridians!</p>
      <p>But I clenched my teeth and endured the pain.</p>
      <p>
        After a while, the cultivator in the golden robe crudely withdrew the
        spiritual energy from my body and spoke,
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm, you have good endurance. But...]</p>
      <p>Pfft!</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy that had exited my body gathered in the air and
        split into five streams of energy.
      </p>
      <p>The attributes of the Five Elements.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, interest faded from the eyes of the cultivator in the
        golden robe and the others.
      </p>
      <p>[Five Elements Spiritual Roots.]</p>
      <p>
        [That impure energy I feel from his body... Is he a martial artist?]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ha ha ha, judging by his expression, he seems to have been unaware of
        the cultivation world. Perhaps, he just lived in the mountains, unaware
        of his own spiritual nature, practicing martial arts.]
      </p>
      <p>The blue-armored cultivator, Chang-ho, laughed heartily.</p>
      <p>
        [You seem to be unaware of the cultivation world. For spiritual nature
        or spiritual roots of cultivators, the fewer attributes they have, the
        faster the cultivation speed. Conversely, the more attributes, the
        slower the cultivation progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why a single attribute spiritual nature is called 'Heavenly
        Spiritual Nature.' Two or three attributes are called 'True Spiritual
        Nature.' Four or five attributes are called 'Mixed Spiritual Nature' and
        are disdained.]
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        [Ha ha ha, but don't worry too much. If cultivation was solely
        determined by natural talent, those with Five Elements Spiritual Roots
        like you would have all hanged themselves by now. Cultivation is not
        just about talent, but also understanding of techniques and realms, and
        overall mental capacity is important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Persistence, patience, and willpower also play a significant part. From
        what I've seen, you have terrible talent and I'm not sure about your
        mental capacity, but you passed that nasty golden robe guy's brutal
        spiritual nature test without screaming, so your endurance and willpower
        seem excellent.]
      </p>
      <p>Pfft!</p>
      <p>
        Sir Chang-ho laughed heartily and flicked a small cluster of light
        towards me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cluster of light merged into the back of my hand, transforming into
        a small mark.
      </p>
      <p>
        [At the farthest reaches of my family's extended lineage...there is a
        cultivator clan established by those guys. They're too weak and overall
        frail to be taken to the Ascension Gate this time. Still, this might be
        of help to you. It's a recommendation letter for an external member of
        the family.
      </p>
      <p>
        They're in a country of mortals called Byeokra, and they use the surname
        Cheongmun, so you should head to the Cheongmun Clan.]
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing his words, Sir Chang-ho and the other two cultivators
        turned into clusters of light and vanished into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        I quietly greeted Sir Chang-ho while looking at the small mark imprinted
        on my hand.
      </p>
      <p>"Hey, Deputy Manager Seo. What exactly did they say?"</p>
      <p>"...I'm not quite sure myself."</p>
      <p>I shook my head, pretending not to know, and another day passed.</p>
      <p>Just like before, a storm blew.</p>
      <p>
        I lay in the cave, nursing Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo, who was groaning
        in pain, and observed her.
      </p>
      <p>'The spiritual energy of heaven and earth is moving around her.'</p>
      <p>
        I hadn't known before, but now, with awakened consciousness, I could
        tell.
      </p>
      <p>The vast spiritual power of the sky was swirling around her.</p>
      <p>
        Sometime later, Sea Dragon King Seo Hweol appeared, took her away, and
        soon after, Manager Kim Yeon awoke her powers.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu-</p>
      <p>'This is...'</p>
      <p>
        Only now, with awakened consciousness, could I vaguely see the reality
        of Manager Kim Yeon's abilities.
      </p>
      <p>'Incredible. This is a human’s consciousness?'</p>
      <p>
        Countless threads of consciousness, seemingly thousands, millions, even
        billions, were emerging around her, enveloping the space between heaven
        and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The size of these threads of consciousness seemed not to pale in
        comparison to those of cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, I noticed her upper dantian rapidly expanding.</p>
      <p>
        'Suffering the same side effects as me upon awakening her abilities...'
      </p>
      <p>
        I let out a small exclamation at her ability and pressed some acupoints
        to stabilize her upper dantian a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Deputy Manager Seo... touching me like this, my head seems to hurt
        less..."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>Manager Kim Yeon held her head and looked at me.</p>
      <p>Then, she looked in one direction.</p>
      <p>
        The direction where the several cultivators and the Sea Dragon King had
        headed.
      </p>
      <p>From there, a hunchback strange being was flying towards us.</p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>
        As soon as the hunchback being arrived, he looked at me and Manager Kim
        Yeon, flicking his finger at her.
      </p>
      <p>
        A white cluster of light flew and landed on Manager Kim Yeon's upper
        D\dantian, starting to ease the twisting effect.
      </p>
      <p>'What's that?'</p>
      <p>I had never seen such a thing in my past life.</p>
      <p>
        It must be something he’s been using all along but I could only see now
        with awakened consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hunchback old man examined Manager Kim Yeon, then turned his gaze to
        me.
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm... hm, what's this.]</p>
      <p>
        Like the previous cultivators, the hunchback’s gaze was different from
        the previous encounters.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Let's see, this bone structure, this spiritual nature, this size of
        consciousness...]
      </p>
      <p>
        After examining me for a moment, the hunchback suddenly approached and
        started fiddling with my body.
      </p>
      <p>Shortly after, the hunchback chuckled and giggled.</p>
      <p>
        [Hehehe, I see. This internal energy. This bone structure. These
        meridians. The size of consciousness, and especially the Five Element
        Spiritual Roots. You're the same kind as that person I saw in my youth!]
      </p>
      <p>The hunchback revealed his teeth and giggled.</p>
      <p>[You, you weren't born a chosen cultivator, were you? Right?]</p>
      <p>"....!"</p>
      <p>I couldn't help but flinch at those words.</p>
      <p>
        None of the previous cultivators or the Sea Dragon King had noticed that
        fact.
      </p>
      <p>Or perhaps they just weren't interested.</p>
      <p>The old man chuckled and continued to grope me.</p>
      <p>
        I felt a bit annoyed, but seeing the size of his consciousness, I knew I
        couldn't oppose him and had to silently endure.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ah, your consciousness is stirring. I was right. You... are a martial
        artist who has learned martial arts and entered the realm of
        cultivators. Right?]
      </p>
      <p>"...How did you know?"</p>
      <p>
        I asked in Yanguo’s language so Kim Yeon and Director Kim wouldn't
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>The hunchback old man chuckled and spoke.</p>
      <p>
        [Well, I saw someone just like you about sixteen hundred years ago. Yes,
        martial artists call this realm 'Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin', don’t they?]
      </p>
      <p>"...Indeed."</p>
      <p>I expected they were beings who lived for a very long time.</p>
      <p>
        Such beings, having lived for so long, would surely have encountered a
        martial artist who had reached the realm of Five Energies at least once.
      </p>
      <p>
        [That person was also considered a genius by the standards of the
        martial world. I met them when I was in Qi Building, and they were able
        to compete with me to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although they eventually lost to me, it was quite an entertaining
        experience. After meeting them, I scoured ancient texts to see if there
        were any other such peculiar beings. It turns out, every few hundred
        years, such individuals do emerge, albeit very rarely.
      </p>
      <p>Their characteristics were all the same as yours.]</p>
      <p>The old man touched my shoulder.</p>
      <p>
        [Very sturdy physique. Wide meridians. A martial artist's internal
        energy fully filling the dantian.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man grabbed my chin, forcibly opened my mouth, and pointed at my
        teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment, I felt the urge to kick him away, but knowing the
        potential backlash, I had no choice but to forcibly suppress my
        irritation.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Perfectly symmetrical and clean teeth alignment. Such alignment can't
        naturally occur. Even cultivators born with spiritual roots don't have
        such teeth. Only martial artists who have reached Five Energies
        Converging to the Origin and undergone a complete transformation have
        such teeth.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man let go of my chin and touched my consciousness domain with
        his own, speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        [And the consciousness of a typical 3rd or 4th Star Qi Refining. To
        think a martial artist without a speck of spiritual power would have
        such consciousness? Impossible. Such an enlarged consciousness is only
        seen in martial artists who have awakened their consciousness at Five
        Energies Converging to the Origin. Most importantly, your Five Elements
        Spiritual Roots.]
      </p>
      <p>
        He then grabbed my wrist, sending energy through it like checking the
        pulse.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Martial artists when reaching Five Energies Converging to the Origin
        evenly draw the spiritual energy of the Five Elements from the spiritual
        energy of heaven and earth to prevent imbalance in the upper dantian
        during their transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to this, martial artists at Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin have much more evenly distributed spiritual energy in their
        bodies compared to ordinary cultivators with Five Elements Roots. These
        are the proof that you are not an ordinary cultivator with Five Elements
        Spiritual Roots but a martial artist at Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin.]
      </p>
      <p>The hunchback chuckled and released his hand from me.</p>
      <p>
        [Such facts are unknown unless you're as scholarly and wise as I am,
        having lived a long life. It feels like meeting an old friend from my
        youth, so I ended up talking a bit too much.]
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed he momentarily overlapped me with the martial artist he met
        sixteen hundred years ago.
      </p>
      <p>The hunchback old man smirked while looking at the mark on my hand.</p>
      <p>
        [Seeing the mark on your hand, it seems that Chang-ho, that kind soul,
        gave you a recommendation, right? Hahaha, what a foolish and stupid
        fellow. A martial artist who reached Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin would be perfect for inheriting the Body Refinement Technique he
        practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just being at Five Energies Converging to the Origin guarantees basic
        combat power. To recommend such a person to a lowly clan in the lower
        realms, that foolish fellow made another mistake.]
      </p>
      <p>He chuckled amusingly and asked me a question.</p>
      <p>
        [I have a question for you. What is the primary martial art you
        practiced?]
      </p>
      <p>"Swordsmanship."</p>
      <p>
        [Oh, good. Swords are great. The friend I met used a spear mainly, but
        they also practiced swordsmanship. Most martial artists learn the sword
        anyway... Ah, but that's not the important part.
      </p>
      <p>Regarding you.]</p>
      <p>He looked at me with a wicked smile.</p>
      <p>
        [Can you swear never to wield a sword for the rest of your life? If you
        make such a vow, I'll personally take you as my disciple.]
      </p>
      <p>Never to wield a sword?</p>
      <p>Contemplation was brief.</p>
      <p>No, it would be more accurate to say there never was contemplation.</p>
      <p>"Thank you for the offer, but I cannot let go of the sword."</p>
      <p>
        [Hmm, even though if you become my disciple, you will get the
        opportunity to ascend beyond the Ascension Gate, directly to the higher
        realms?]
      </p>
      <p>
        "I may be ignorant of what that opportunity entails, but I cannot give
        up the martial arts I have practiced all my life."
      </p>
      <p>
        [If you become my disciple, you can live for hundreds of years more. And
        yet, you can't give up the martial arts you've only practiced for a few
        decades?]
      </p>
      <p>Just a few decades.</p>
      <p>I let out a small, bitter smile.</p>
      <p>Not just a few decades, nor was it insignificant.</p>
      <p>My past lives...</p>
      <p>Yes, martial arts are my past lives.</p>
      <p>
        "I apologize, but I... Even if I live a short life and die young, I
        cannot let go of the sword entrusted to my hand."
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm...]</p>
      <p>
        After examining me for a while, the hunchback old man let out a wry
        laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        [It seems boring. That person 1600 years ago said the same. Their
        consciousness was barely at the 4th Star of Qi Refining, but they could
        launch attacks beyond the peak of Qi Refining. It was fascinating, so I
        tried to take them as my disciple, but... they said the same as you.]
      </p>
      <p>His expression seemed somewhat regretful.</p>
      <p>
        [Fine. If you refuse to be my disciple, so be it. Just so you know, I
        have a bad temper, so I won't particularly recommend you like Chang-ho.
        It's just that our paths didn't cross. Now, get lost.]
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>
        The old man extended his hand, and space behind him split open, emitting
        a dark void.
      </p>
      <p>The same progression as before.</p>
      <p>
        My body and Kim Young-hoon began to be sucked into the spatial rift.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Well, I'm not pleased that you refused to be my disciple. But I respect
        your spirit, so I'll give you a gift.]
      </p>
      <p>Pfft!</p>
      <p>
        A white cluster of light burst from the fingertips of the hunchbacl old
        man.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cluster of light seeped into my head as it was drawn into the
        spatial rift, and something seemed to imprint in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>Like always, I fell through the spatial rift.</p>
      <p>
        The difference from past lives was that the last thing I saw beyond the
        rift was not Manager Kim reaching out to us,
      </p>
      <p>But the hunchback old man waving.</p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>The wind blows.</p>
      <p>It's cold.</p>
      <p>Everything around is utterly blue.</p>
      <p>"....?"</p>
      <p>'Where is this...'</p>
      <p>I suddenly realized I was descending at high speed.</p>
      <p>"....!!! This is crazy.."</p>
      <p>I was startled and came to my senses.</p>
      <p>Falling!</p>
      <p>From the sky!</p>
      <p>Looking around, Kim Young-hoon was also far away, falling with me.</p>
      <p>
        I quickly deployed void stepping and caught Kim Young-hoon, pressing his
        sleep acupoint to keep him unconscious, then used void-stepping to
        reduce our falling speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        After falling for a while, I stepped through the air and safely landed
        on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If I hadn't come to my senses, I would have unknowingly transitioned to
        the next life.'
      </p>
      <p>It's chilling.</p>
      <p>No matter how random, I didn't expect to fall from the sky.</p>
      <p>I wiped the cold sweat and looked around.</p>
      <p>'First of all, this place is...'</p>
      <p>
        After observing the terrain by leaping through the sky with void steps,
        I figured out roughly where I was.
      </p>
      <p>'The west of Lianshan City (鍊山城)...'</p>
      <p>Lianshan City.</p>
      <p>The city where I first fell.</p>
      <p>After several regressions, I had fallen again near this place.</p>
      <p>'First, let's see what the hunchback old man gave me...'</p>
      <p>
        I closed my eyes and began to read the laws imprinted in my head by the
        hunchback old man.

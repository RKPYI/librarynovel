      <p>Chapter 31: Life (6)</p>
      <p>My intent clashed with that of my disciples.</p>
      <p>For a while, we glared at each other, exchanging volleys of intent.</p>
      <p>In that silence, Man-ho took a step forward.</p>
      <p>"...Master, are you going to break your promise with us?"</p>
      <p>"Promise...?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. You clearly promised that once we destroyed all of Makli Clan's
        territories, we would strike together at the Imperial Palace. You told
        us to survive for that. But... Why are you changing your words now?
        Telling us to go back?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Other disciples, besides Man-ho, also emitted fierce intent as they
        joined in.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's right. Why do you make a promise with us and then prevent us
        from fulfilling it?"
      </p>
      <p>"We are trying to survive to keep our promise!"</p>
      <p>
        "We all thought it didn't matter if we died and endured hell-like
        training.
      </p>
      <p>So why...!"</p>
      <p>I examined the children's intents.</p>
      <p>They were of an indescribable color.</p>
      <p>But, generally, their colors were casting a dark blue light.</p>
      <p>Sorrow.</p>
      <p>My disciples were all crying together.</p>
      <p>'You too, are grieving.'</p>
      <p>Over the deaths of comrades, of friends...</p>
      <p>'I'm sorry.'</p>
      <p>I'm so sorry and ashamed as a master.</p>
      <p>As a master, I let my disciple die.</p>
      <p>'My heart aches with regret.'</p>
      <p>But that's why I couldn't back down anymore.</p>
      <p>
        "I will... keep my promise. The day you can truly defeat me, I'll join
        you to strike at the Imperial Palace."
      </p>
      <p>As soon as I finished speaking, Kae-hwa lunged at me with a dagger.</p>
      <p>"Surround him!"</p>
      <p>
        With that, Man-ho shouted in a booming voice, and the disciples quickly
        formed the Transcending Cultivation Formation around me.
      </p>
      <p>A formation created to counter cultivators.</p>
      <p>
        Peak experts in the martial world cannot properly sense the intent of
        cultivators from inside their domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, cultivators can easily see through the movements of peak
        experts,
      </p>
      <p>
        A formation created to mitigate the extreme disparity between martial
        artists and cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Even if a cultivator can observe actions within and even if we can't
        predict the cultivator's movements...'
      </p>
      <p>
        The Transcending Cultivation Formation is capable of completely grinding
        down anyone trapped within.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Basically, since the Transcending Cultivation Formation is infused with
        the insights of the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting
        Martial Arts, the flow of the formation itself disrupts the flow of
        consciousness.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if I execute the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting
        Martial Arts and escape their perception, it's not easy to escape from
        the formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts is
        essentially about cutting off the opponent's consciousness and escaping
        from their perception.
      </p>
      <p>It's not a technique for sudden spatial movement.</p>
      <p>
        It is a formation designed to counter cultivators, regardless of whether
        the opponent's actions can be predicted or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether or not the opponent escapes perception, anyone trapped in the
        formation will be shredded.
      </p>
      <p>That's the Transcending Cultivation Formation!</p>
      <p>
        Despite the loss of 34 members, the disciples linked their intents well,
        filling the gaps and pressuring me.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The disciples surrounding me in a circle started to close in, rotating
        around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiple human barriers surround me, rotating in different directions to
        tighten the formation.
      </p>
      <p>Within this formation, numerous flows of intent intertwined.</p>
      <p>
        'The proficiency of the Transcending Cultivation Formation among the
        disciples has significantly increased.'
      </p>
      <p>
        The movement of the disciples themselves disrupts the direction of
        intent, making it difficult to discern whose intent belongs to whom.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the strange optical illusions caused by the formation, I couldn't
        read their movements.
      </p>
      <p>"...But this is not enough."</p>
      <p>It's certainly a formation that can counter cultivators.</p>
      <p>
        Even a martial artist of the Three Flowers Gather at the Summit would be
        shredded by this formation.
      </p>
      <p>However, I am nearing the extreme limit of Three Flowers.</p>
      <p>
        I am on the verge of achieving the ultimate realm of Five Energies
        Converging at the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I have also understood the superior counterparts of the Record
        of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts â€“ the Record of
        Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts and Gazing Martial Arts
        and Exceeding Martial Arts Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Are you saying with just these skills you won't listen to me? What
        confidence do you have?"
      </p>
      <p>Whizz-</p>
      <p>
        As my concentration reached its peak, I entered the world of intent,
        seeing thousands of colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering that spectrum of colors, I assimilated my disciples' intents
        with my own through the enlightenment of Three Flowers.
      </p>
      <p>Record of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts.</p>
      <p>
        Not just cutting off consciousness and intent as in Record of
        Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts, but developing the
        enlightenment of Three Flowers to its extreme.
      </p>
      <p>A martial art that completely dives into the opponent's movements.</p>
      <p>
        My sword pierces through the rapidly rotating Transcending Cultivation
        Formation of intents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although a distinctly different intent intervened, the disciples didn't
        feel anything unusual until my sword energy completely mingled within
        the formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If even one of them was at the level of a mature mid peak master, they
        would have felt something.
      </p>
      <p>
        But their growth was hindered by the resentful spirits of their families
        entwined in their upper dantians.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Without hesitation, I dove into the flow of the formation, swinging my
        Sword Gang towards it.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>Dust scattered.</p>
      <p>The ground shook.</p>
      <p>"Ugh...!"</p>
      <p>"Block it!"</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>Layered Mountains!</p>
      <p>
        The Sword Gang split into thousands of strands, scattering in all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>Even when split, it was still Sword Gang.</p>
      <p>It was a different dimension from just splitting sword energy.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Their initial actions, designed to nullify sword energy, now scattered
        in all directions, annihilating the formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You can't stop me. Unless you sever that obsession, release your
        families' resentful spirits,
      </p>
      <p>And realize intent!"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The Transcending Cultivation Formation collapsed.</p>
      <p>"Wasn't avenging your families' against their murderers your goal!</p>
      <p>If you want to become stronger, first sever your attachments!"</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        I executed the Mountain and Valley Transformation to shake the terrain,
        completely breaking the formation, and scattered paralysis powder.
      </p>
      <p>
        The disciples, having used up all their poison and antidote during the
        territory raids, could not resist my paralysis powder and all fell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The disciple who used the Langya Staff, named Gyu-san, looked at me and
        said,
      </p>
      <p>
        "...How can I sever this. How can I... sever the voices of my
        family...!"
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>"You don't understand us!"</p>
      <p>I couldn't respond.</p>
      <p>All I could do was forcibly drag my fallen disciples away.</p>
      <p>That was all I could do.</p>
      <p>
        "I am a poor master, I am sorry... Let's go. I'll help you become
        stronger. More..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Where do you think you're going? I waited for you to finish making
        graves for mortals, but suddenly you're fighting amongst yourselves...
        This is why I despise martial artists."
      </p>
      <p>
        The overseer of the assassination squad, the old man, clicked his tongue
        and interrupted me, descending on a flying artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        "From what I hear, you're talking nonsense. What right do you have to
        take away the assassination squad?
      </p>
      <p>
        I acknowledge you're a good martial arts instructor, but I can't allow
        the detachment of the squad in this situation."
      </p>
      <p>
        "...What use will my weak disciples, who haven't even reached Three
        Flowers, be in the upcoming battles? From now on, those who haven't
        reached Three Flowers will be useless... Quality will become more
        important than quantity."
      </p>
      <p>"They're not useless just because they're not important."</p>
      <p>
        "The Makli Clan has started preparing. Most of the cultivators in the
        remaining territories are in the mid to late stages of Qi Refining. My
        disciples are no longer useful against them."
      </p>
      <p>"So you admit that you've been insufficient in your training."</p>
      <p>
        "That's right. Since I've been insufficient, I'll take the blame and
        retrain my disciples to be useful. Please allow me this."
      </p>
      <p>Squirm</p>
      <p>Veins bulged slightly on the forehead of the old man.</p>
      <p>He raised his spirtual energy with an annoyed expression.</p>
      <p>
        I hastily retreated out of his range, ready to draw my sword at any
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Constantly talking nonsense and trying to detach the squad. Are you in
        your right mind? The secret battle between the Jin and Makli is
        justified due to the high proportion of mortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a large number of mortals suddenly detach in such a situation, it
        only gives the Makli Clan's upper class a reason to intervene."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Even if my inadequate disciples leave, the forces brought by Sir
        Kim..."
      </p>
      <p>"Enough with this nonsense. For disobedience..."</p>
      <p>Vroom-</p>
      <p>Spiritual energy gathered in the old man's hand.</p>
      <p>That's when it happened.</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>A strong hand silently grabbed the old man's arm.</p>
      <p>It was Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>"When did you enter my consciousness..."</p>
      <p>"Hmm, look here, Sir Jin."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon tightened his grip on the old man's arm, smiling.</p>
      <p>
        The old man's arm lost blood circulation, turning pale as his energy
        scattered.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Seo, my brother, is from my hometown. The crimes of a fellow townsman
        are my crimes too, so please punish me as well."
      </p>
      <p>"Eeek..."</p>
      <p>
        The overseer old man strained to escape from Kim Young-hoon's grip, and
        his other hand seemed to cast some spell.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the flow of energy around Kim Young-hoon sliced and erased all
        the old man's spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while of struggling, the overseer old man, with a flushed face,
        shouted.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Fine, fine. I'll overlook the disobedience. Just let go of my arm!"
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm."</p>
      <p>
        Only then did Kim Young-hoon release the old man's arm, and the old man,
        sweating, began to restore energy to his arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...I may overlook it, but the clan elders won't let you just leave.
        What I said isn't just my personal opinion. These kids are more than
        just a force; they're a justification! Whether they're effective or not,
        they must be deployed in battle!"
      </p>
      <p>"Then, I have a request," I said, looking at my disciples.</p>
      <p>
        "My disciples have forcibly awakened their talents and reached the
        Pinnacle Realm. Somehow, I have managed to stabilize them there with my
        training. Yet, to transcend beyond this point, they need to realize
        intent and reach the realm of Qi Silk. Howevr, as long as the resentful
        spirits of their relatives linger in their upper dantians, they cannot
        progress further."
      </p>
      <p>"So?"</p>
      <p>
        "I know you're the one who bestowed the resentful spirits on them.
        Please help their spirits ascend. At this point, it's just a limitation
        for my disciples."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, you want to detach the spirits?" the overseer old man, who was
        scanning my disciples' upper dantians, clicked his tongue and spoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sorry, but it can't be done. Even if I try to undo the spell, it won't
        work unless these kids want to let go of their families. There are only
        two ways to undo it now: Either a Core Formation elder forcibly removes
        the spirits, or the disciples themselves let them go."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        "Ah, now that I think about it, there's another way. If these kids die,
        the spell will be undone automatically. You knew all this, didn't you?"
      </p>
      <p>The old man looked at me with half-closed eyes and asked.</p>
      <p>'Did I know?'</p>
      <p>I smiled bitterly and nodded.</p>
      <p>Yes, it was a question grasping at pointless hope.</p>
      <p>
        Slowly, as the paralysis began to wear off, my disciples started
        speaking.
      </p>
      <p>"Who, just who... thinks they can separate me from my family..."</p>
      <p>"It can't be done..."</p>
      <p>
        "Inadequate skills can be improved by accumulating more battle
        experience!"
      </p>
      <p>Without exception.</p>
      <p>None of them wanted to let go of their families.</p>
      <p>Nobody.</p>
      <p>
        The overseer old man, looking at my disciples, turned to me with a
        mocking tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha, the so-called master doesn't even know who he's teaching. Do these
        kids seem alive to you? All of these kids have already resigned to
        death! Your disciples are alive but not living!
      </p>
      <p>They are the dead, obsessed with revenge!</p>
      <p>Ha, fine. I'll help a little."</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        As the old man formed a spell, a green light burst from his grasp and
        seeped into the minds of the remaining disciples.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's the spirit ascension spell. If your disciples succeed in letting
        go of their attachments to their families and undo the spell, their
        familiesâ€™ spirits will naturally ascend. Yes, 'if' your disciples let go
        of their attachments!"
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        "Heh, not even knowing who you're teaching and giving such ridiculous
        orders. Both the clan elders and your disciples themselves don't want to
        withdraw from the upcoming battles!
      </p>
      <p>Stop clinging to pointless delusions and lead the troops properly."</p>
      <p>
        After finishing, the overseer old man gave Kim Young-hoon a brief glare,
        muttered something about 'mortal origins,' and flew away on his flying
        artifact.
      </p>
      <p>I clenched my teeth and looked up at the sky.</p>
      <p>There was nothing I could do.</p>
      <p>
        "...Kim Hyung, I wonder if relying on the power of the Jin Clan... was
        the right thing to do. I have so many doubts."
      </p>
      <p>"Me too."</p>
      <p>"What should we do..."</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>"What should I do..."</p>
      <p>He sighed softly.</p>
      <p>
        "There's no choice. The Jin Clan may not be good, but the cultivators of
        Makli are worst! We have to choose such an option..."
      </p>
      <p>
        I clenched my teeth, fed my fallen disciples the antidote, and helped
        them up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, we had no choice but to gather and head to the next battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>It was what everyone wanted, except me.</p>
      <p>Half a year passed.</p>
      <p>
        Today, another fierce battle ended, and I roamed the territories of the
        Makli Can, collecting the bodies of the victims and my disciples.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Recently, it seems your hair has been turning white more and more."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>"Are you okay?"</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, who was helping me collect the bodies, looked at me with
        a pitiful expression and asked.
      </p>
      <p>Lately, I have been aging rapidly.</p>
      <p>
        Until now, I hadn't aged much due to consuming many health-related
        medicine.
      </p>
      <p>However, my hair has been turning white at an alarming rate.</p>
      <p>"...I'm fine."</p>
      <p>"...Don't overdo it."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon looked at me with pitying eyes and then went off to
        collect other bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the ruins of the destroyed Makli territory, I found the body of my
        disciple, Gise-gu.
      </p>
      <p>
        His poison blade, a large sword always well-maintained, reflected my
        face cleanly even after his death.
      </p>
      <p>My eyes were bloodshot, with dark circles underneath.</p>
      <p>My lips were dry, and my hair was a mess of white and gray.</p>
      <p>Once again, I pulled the body of a dead disciple from the debris.</p>
      <p>Because of my weakness, I couldn't save my disciple today.</p>
      <p>"Why!!!!!"</p>
      <p>I screamed towards the sky.</p>
      <p>"Why is this happening to me! Why!!!"</p>
      <p>I screamed until my throat was soar.</p>
      <p>
        "Why did I receive such talent! Why must I still remain in the state of
        Three Flowers!
      </p>
      <p>Why! Why! Why can't I still enter Five Energies!</p>
      <p>Why am I..."</p>
      <p>I roared, gripping the earth.</p>
      <p>The imprint of my hand was embedded in the ground.</p>
      <p>"Why... am I powerless to do anything..."</p>
      <p>I knew.</p>
      <p>It wasn't the fault of the heavens.</p>
      <p>It was all my fault.</p>
      <p>If only I had tried a little harder.</p>
      <p>If I had trained even a bit more desperately.</p>
      <p>
        Even if it meant my brain might explode, if I had aspired for a higher
        realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, if I had been just a little stronger, it would have been resolved.
      </p>
      <p>"Please... give me talent... please... give me strength..."</p>
      <p>I gritted my teeth and howled.</p>
      <p>"Why am I still... after doing this much... so powerless..."</p>
      <p>I regretted it.</p>
      <p>
        Why did I stupidly put my disciples in such a place? I should have
        opposed even at the risk of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, why did I teach these kids? Even if I had to be chased away, I
        shouldn't have taken them in.
      </p>
      <p>
        No... why did I even come to this place and form a bond? Yes, I
        shouldn't have joined the Jin Clan to stop the evil deeds of the Makli
        Clan.
      </p>
      <p>The disciples I taught out of guilt had become a part of my life.</p>
      <p>
        Every time these children died, it felt like my flesh was being carved
        away.
      </p>
      <p>"...The bodies have been collected, Master."</p>
      <p>"...Any survivors?"</p>
      <p>
        Man-ho, with tearful eyes in front of Gise-gu's body, came to me,
        clenching his teeth to report.
      </p>
      <p>"314... are left."</p>
      <p>"Alright... Let's go."</p>
      <p>
        I staggered, carrying the body of my disciple, and headed to the burial
        site.
      </p>
      <p>
        I buried my disciples in a sunny place and recited the rites led by Kim
        Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ritual of soul consolation, mastered by Kim Young-hoon, seeped in,
        and the spirits of the victims ascended.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon also recited the rites for my disciples' bodies.</p>
      <p>
        From the graves of the mortals he recited for, small light orbs rose and
        scattered into the air.
      </p>
      <p>We silently watched the scene.</p>
      <p>Then it happened.</p>
      <p>"Ha, haha! Finally, the permission has been granted!"</p>
      <p>
        One of the Qi Building cultivators from the Jin Clan, who had been
        fighting with us, exclaimed with a face full of joy.
      </p>
      <p>In his hand was a piece of communication paper.</p>
      <p>
        "Everyone, gather! The conversation between the elders of our main house
        and the upper ranks of Makli is over!"
      </p>
      <p>He exclaimed with a joyful expression, looking around us.</p>
      <p>
        "The negotiation is over. They say if the Jin Clan accepts only the
        participation of mortals and Qi Refining cultivators, they will allow a
        challenge to replace the Yanguo Imperial Family!"
      </p>
      <p>"Ooooh! Finally, the elders have succeeded in the negotiation."</p>
      <p>"Indeed, the elders are commendable."</p>
      <p>
        The eyes of the Jin Clan cultivators shone with excitement, and so did
        the eyes of my disciples and the martial artists under Kim Young-hoon's
        command.
      </p>
      <p>However, Kim Young-hoon and I each wore a bitter smile.</p>
      <p>'Negotiation.'</p>
      <p>
        The hundreds of lives that had been lost were merely tools for
        negotiation in the upper echelons of the cultivator clans.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon seemed to feel the same way.</p>
      <p>As he was scoffing, he questioned the Qi Building Cultivator.</p>
      <p>
        "So... you're saying that by 'allowing a challenge,â€™ we can challenge
        the Yanguo Imperial Family, a branch family of the Makli Clan?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's right. Originally, if we attacked the Imperial Family on a large
        scale, it would be considered a challenge to the Makli Clan, and we
        would have to wage a full-scale war. But them accepting the challenge
        means we can attack the Makli Imperial Family with a large army without
        a full-scale war."
      </p>
      <p>
        '...So even the replacement of the Imperial Family is just a
        disappearance of a branch family.'
      </p>
      <p>
        From his tone, it seemed like the Makli Clan considered Yanguo as just a
        subordinate force and that their replacement was within acceptable
        limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, they won't just obediently allow the change of the Imperial
        lineage.
      </p>
      <p>
        They only permit a challenge, and even then, as mentioned earlier, our
        side can no longer involve Qi Building cultivators. Even..."
      </p>
      <p>The Jin Clan's Qi Building cultivator frowned.</p>
      <p>
        "The Makli Clan allows all cultivators directly related to the Imperial
        Family to participate. The former emperors of Yanguo. Especially..."
      </p>
      <p>"You're talking about the Founding Emperor..."</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, the Yanguo Founding Emperor, Makli Wangshin! While all former
        emperors were low-level Qi Refining, he was a highly talented late-stage
        Qi Refining cultivator when he ascended to the throne. And... he stepped
        down from the throne and ascended as a Qi Building cultivator."
      </p>
      <p>A shadow fell on the faces of the Jin Clan cultivators.</p>
      <p>"That means..."</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, while we can only challenge them with mortals and Qi Refining,
        they have Makli Wangshin, a Qi Building cultivator on their side."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Those damn Makli Clan dogs! How can Qi Refining defeat Qi Building!
        This..."
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the Jin Clan's Qi Building cultivator who was briefly
        irritated, smiled.
      </p>
      <p>"But don't worry... we have this guy!"</p>
      <p>He approached Kim Young-hoon and patted his shoulder.</p>
      <p>
        "This young martial artist has the power of a Qi Building cultivator..
        Your mission is crucial!
      </p>
      <p>
        After this mission, the elders of our clan have decided to marry you
        into a higher family and take you as a son-in-law of the Jin Clan.
        Consider it an honor!"
      </p>
      <p>"Marriage..."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon grimaced as if remembering something.</p>
      <p>
        "...Well, let's talk about that later. Does the Makli Clan know my power
        is at the Qi Building level? Isn't there something else they're going to
        say later?"
      </p>
      <p>At his words, the Jin Clan's Qi Building cultivator grinned.</p>
      <p>
        "Huh, even if you recently started learning this and that about
        cultivation, your cultivation is clearly at Qi Refining 3rd or 4th Star.
        Their set limit was clearly up to 14th Star Qi Refining, and you fit
        within that standard!
      </p>
      <p>Hahaha, what can they do even if they try to nitpick? Hahaha!"</p>
      <p>He laughed, seemingly in a good mood.</p>
      <p>
        "Although we can't help you, with your skills, you should be able to
        handle Makli Wangshin. You don't even need to kill him. Just holding him
        off is enough!"
      </p>
      <p>The explanation continued.</p>
      <p>
        "Regardless of the legitimacy of the Yanguo Imperial Family, if we
        successfully assassinate the current Emperor Makli Jung and his son
        Makli Hyun, it will be the victory of the Jin Clan. All former emperors
        were talentless and couldn't ascend to Qi Building and hence died.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you hold off Makli Wangshin, Qi Refining cultivators and the
        mortals will only have to kill Makli Jung and Makli Hyun,
      </p>
      <p>And the Jin Clan can reclaim this country!"</p>
      <p>The Qi Building cultivator excitedly announced.</p>
      <p>"The Jin Clan can restore its name as the Imperial Family!"</p>
      <p>
        It seems this cultivator was originally a descendant of the Jin Imperial
        lineage, fervently desiring to reclaim the Yanguo Imperial Lineage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if it is a subordinate force of the cultivator clans, an Imperial
        Family is no light matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        He passionately spoke of the glory of the Jin Clan reclaiming the
        Imperial lineage for some time. Then, with an excited expression, he
        flew away with the other Jin Clan cultivators on a flying artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        We left the territory, and I quietly looked at my disciples who had been
        listening attentively to the Qi Building cultivator's words.
      </p>
      <p>"...It's time to fulfill our promise."</p>
      <p>Though the intents of the disciples were varied,</p>
      <p>They all had determined expressions.</p>
      <p>
        However, I clenched my teeth and made the same request I had made when
        they first went into battle.
      </p>
      <p>"Please, survive."</p>
      <p>And their response was the same as before.</p>
      <p>"...I'm sorry, Master."</p>
      <p>"I ask you as your master. Please, survive."</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>Now, I had no reason to stop them.</p>
      <p>
        I had promised them with my own mouth to join them in revenge if they
        survived.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...You all must have lived so far to avenge your families. And you must
        have no hesitation in dying.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what about those who will be left behind... Why don't you think
        about my feelings?"
      </p>
      <p>"...I'm sorry."</p>
      <p>Their eyes were filled with dark blue intent.</p>
      <p>
        "It's not that we don't know Master's feelings. But... Master, you don't
        understand..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Your feelings? Eun-hyun doesn't understand your feelings? Eun-hyun?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Just then, Kim Young-hoon, who had been watching our conversation,
        approached me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "These ungrateful brats... Do you know what your master has been feeling
        while saying such harsh words!"
      </p>
      <p>A massive surge of energy burst from him.</p>
      <p>Under his presssure, all my disciples fell to the ground.</p>
      <p>"Cough!"</p>
      <p>"Keugh..."</p>
      <p>"Kuugh...!"</p>
      <p>
        "Do you not know what Seo Eun-hyun has been through! Haven't you heard
        from him!"
      </p>
      <p>He showed an angry expression and growled.</p>
      <p>
        "Your friends who died in the past, their resentful spirits are still
        not fully appeased. So, Seo Eun-hyun asked me to let their spirits
        possess him! It's because of that my brother is getting old, and yet you
        dare to speak such nonsense!
      </p>
      <p>You insolent ones, how can you..."</p>
      <p>
        While speaking, Kim Young-hoon read the intents of my disciples and,
        noticing something strange, turned to look at me sharply.
      </p>
      <p>"...You, did you not tell anything to your disciples?"</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        "...Foolish one. Stupid one! A stupid master with stupid disciples!"
      </p>
      <p>He beat his chest in frustration.</p>
      <p>
        "Listen, all of you! Your master, in order to fulfill your unfulfilled
        wishes even in death, did the same foolish thing as you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite not being related by blood, he accepted the resentful spirits of
        your friends into his body, and has been fighting against the
        cultivators with them!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The revelation from Kim Young-hoon shocked the faces of the children.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Didn't you feel anything strange seeing your master aging so rapidly?
        His life was drastically shortened because he was forced to accept more
        than two hundred vengeful spirits not related by blood!
      </p>
      <p>
        To fulfill your stubborn and insolent wishes... did you not realize how
        your master has been feeling?"
      </p>
      <p>He shouted with great anger.</p>
      <p>
        "These foolish, insolent, and selfish brats! Are only your grievances
        important? Don't you care about your master's feelings?"
      </p>
      <p>"...Stop it, Hyung-nim."</p>
      <p>
        "...Such a foolish and frustrating man. Why did you bear it all alone?
      </p>
      <p>
        Did you think you'd be praised for it? Did you expect these foolish and
        selfish brats to support you?
      </p>
      <p>
        I accepted your request considering your relationship with your
        disciples. But what is this! You've kept it to yourself all this time
        without saying a word!
      </p>
      <p>This, this..."</p>
      <p>Overwhelmed, Kim Young-hoon sighed.</p>
      <p>
        "Hoo... it's enough. Such a foolish man. Sort it out among yourselves. I
        will leave first."
      </p>
      <p>For a moment, the surroundings were enveloped in silence.</p>
      <p>After collecting my emotions, I spoke.</p>
      <p>
        "At first, I accepted the first thirty-four fallen disciples. I obtained
        permission from each of them, and contained my disciples' spirits in my
        upper dantian. Since then, the deceased children have been with me...
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it was hard to accept all their relatives, at least those
        children have been with me after death..."
      </p>
      <p>Until now.</p>
      <p>
        I felt frustrated by my disciples who clung to death and honed their
        revenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after accepting vengeful spirits like my disciples, I finally
        understood the children.
      </p>
      <p>Master and disciple influence each other.</p>
      <p>Just as they were influenced by me, I was also influenced by them.</p>
      <p>
        That's why the master-disciple relationship is called a familial
        relationship.
      </p>
      <p>Now, I can no longer simply block my disciples.</p>
      <p>
        I have come to understand their emotions, the grudges in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now, I can empathize with you, even if it's weak. I understand a little
        of the pain and grudge you all bear..."
      </p>
      <p>Looking around, I said.</p>
      <p>"But still, I..."</p>
      <p>Facing their emotions head-on and empathizing with them,</p>
      <p>I expressed my desire.</p>
      <p>"I wish you are alive."</p>
      <p>My talent is extremely modest.</p>
      <p>
        Even though I maximized my limited talent by accepting the resentful
        spirits of my disciples under much more favorable conditions than other
        masters, I have yet to discover the last of the Seven Emotions.
      </p>
      <p>Desire is my unattainable emotion.</p>
      <p>
        Even though I know that desire equals life, I have not yet discovered
        this last emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have not reached the Ultimate Enlightenment, nor have I understood
        what life is.
      </p>
      <p>It has been a life of not being able to do, and not doing.</p>
      <p>So please.</p>
      <p>
        "I won't tell you to forget your grudges or not to repay them. But..."
      </p>
      <p>At least all of you.</p>
      <p>"Please, live..."</p>
      <p>Live that life.</p>
      <p>Before today, my disciples never listened to me.</p>
      <p>But now, they nodded to my words.</p>
      <p>"We will definitely live."</p>
      <p>"We will live and greet you, Master...!"</p>
      <p>Starting with Man-ho, they all fell prostrate before me.</p>
      <p>"We will survive! For you, Master!"</p>
      <p>
        Maybe, for the first time since establishing this master and disciple
        relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a moment when the hearts of the master and disciples connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, we were successful in opening our hearts before the final battle.
      </p>
      <p>And the day of the decisive battle arrived.</p>

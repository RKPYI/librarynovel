      <p>Chapter 100: Lotus (8)</p>
      <p>
        I attempt to sweep away the statues with my Formless Sword, but I’m
        suddenly concerned about Buk Hyang-hwa repairing the circuit behind me.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I could sweep them away, but if she carelessly informs Cheongmun Ryeong
        or Cheongmun Jung-jin...'
      </p>
      <p>
        I can already hear the word 'Daoist' from Cheongmun Jung-jin and I can
        imagine Cheongmun Ryeong saying, 'Senior.'
      </p>
      <p>'That can't happen.'</p>
      <p>
        I stop myself from drawing out the Formless Sword and just overlay Gang
        Qi in the air instead.
      </p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>
        'For Qi Refining level puppets, Five Energies Converging to the Origin
        should be enough.'
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>
        I swing wildly at the statues in front of me while overlaying Gang Qi in
        the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        The statues seem to resist, but because they have not fully recovered,
        they’re swept away by the Gang Qi.
      </p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>
        However, after destroying the statues, they automatically start
        repairing themselves, wrapped in a pale light.
      </p>
      <p>'I hope Cheongmun Jung-jin and Cheongmun Ryeong are alright...'</p>
      <p>
        Despite the restraint that reduces one's realm by one, Cheongmun
        Jung-jin would still be at Qi Building, so there’s no need to worry.
      </p>
      <p>But Cheongmun Ryeong will have fallen to Qi Refining.</p>
      <p>"Miss Buk, how much longer until the restraint is lifted?"</p>
      <p>"Almost done. Just..."</p>
      <p>Paaaat!</p>
      <p>"If I just repair this!"</p>
      <p>
        As she manipulates the circuit with a tool resembling a pick, the
        circuit glows, and the oppressive pressure dissipates. .
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the guardian statues of Serving Command Palace, which
        were repairing themselves, collapse into ruins again.
      </p>
      <p>"Phew, finally done."</p>
      <p>"You've worked hard, Miss. You’re truly remarkable."</p>
      <p>
        "Not at all, the golden order was just temporarily triggered and would
        have dissipated over time. I just hastened the process."
      </p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa began to tidy up her tools, wiping the sweat off her
        forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Then Miss Buk, please wait here for a moment. I'll check if Cheongmun
        Ryeong is safe."
      </p>
      <p>"Okay, please do so."</p>
      <p>
        She agrees readily, and I fly to the first-floor arboretum where
        Cheongmun Ryeong is likely to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the center of the arboretum, Cheongmun Ryeong is gathering wood
        attribute spiritual energy, standing in the midst of a large formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the outskirts of the formation lay the ruins of what appeared to
        be guardian statues.
      </p>
      <p>"Cultivator Cheongmun, are you alright?"</p>
      <p>
        "I am fine. The spiritual energy scattered here is of the wood
        attribute, and I was able to draw it into my formation and use spells
        since the dragon veins around here have already been investigated..."
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that the restraint was not a significant threat to Cheongmun
        Ryeong.
      </p>
      <p>"...What exactly was that just now?"</p>
      <p>"I'm relieved you're safe. What just happened was..."</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        From one side of the arboretum, a cracking sound rings out, and
        Cheongmun Jung-jin arrives, using the Flying Escape Technique.
      </p>
      <p>"What was that just now!"</p>
      <p>"Ah, clan head."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong looks at Cheongmun Jung-jin.</p>
      <p>I explain the situation to him.</p>
      <p>
        "So, that Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent caused this phenomenon in
        Serving Command Palace by tampering with its circuit?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, that's correct."</p>
      <p>
        After my explanation, Cheongmun Jung-jin seems to ponder for a moment
        before speaking.
      </p>
      <p>"Where is she now?"</p>
      <p>"She's currently on the outskirts of Serving Command Palace."</p>
      <p>"Lead me to her. I need to verify something."</p>
      <p>I guide Cheongmun Jung-jin back to Buk Hyang-hwa.</p>
      <p>"Ah, clan head. What brings you here?"</p>
      <p>
        "There's something I need to discuss. I understand you triggered the
        restraint, causing this phenomenon in Serving Command Palace."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, that's correct."</p>
      <p>He strokes his chin thoughtfully and says,</p>
      <p>
        "When that phenomenon occurred, I was examining the upper levels of
        Serving Command Palace and discovered something strange."
      </p>
      <p>"Something strange?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, at the top floor of Serving Command Palace, a peculiar barrier
        revealed itself."
      </p>
      <p>'Hmm...'</p>
      <p>
        It seems that Serving Command Palace has something that can be revealed
        by triggering the special restraint
      </p>
      <p>He then asks Buk Hyang-hwa.</p>
      <p>"Can you trigger that phenomenon again?"</p>
      <p>"It's possible."</p>
      <p>
        "Hmm... Then you'll need to trigger it right when I give the signal..."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, that should be no problem."</p>
      <p>She begins to explain.</p>
      <p>
        "The restraint I triggered seems to be one of the main golden orders
        forming the axis of Serving Command Palace. Judging by its state, there
        appears to be at least three more corresponding golden orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        These axes exist all around Serving Command Palace, and each floor of
        the palace is formed along these axes. If I go up to the top floor of
        Serving Command Palace with the clan head and trigger this order again,
        that should do it."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, understood. And..."</p>
      <p>He looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        "Come with us. Since the external formation you're responsible for isn't
        as critical as the one Ryeong is handling, protect the artifact artisan.
        It seems when the order is activated, the guardian statues of Serving
        Command Palace will start moving again..."
      </p>
      <p>"I understand."</p>
      <p>
        Curious about the barrier Cheongmun Jung-jin has discovered, I follow
        him without complaint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together with Cheongmun Jung-jin and Buk Hyang-hwa, we go up to the top
        floor of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa goes to the axis of the top floor of Serving Command
        Palace and begins to dismantle the wall there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The top floor is a bit narrower than the others, even considering the
        spatial compression, so I can see Cheongmun Jung-jin from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looks to be waiting for something in the center of the top floor of
        Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I thought there was nothing there, but it seems I didn't know about
        something.'
      </p>
      <p>[Begin!]</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin roars with spiritual power, and upon hearing his
        command, Buk Hyang-hwa begins her work.
      </p>
      <p>Giiiing!</p>
      <p>
        As she fiddles with something in the circuit, an odd pressure
        circulates, compressing the spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Paaaaatt!</p>
      <p>
        In the center of the top floor of Serving Command Palace, where
        Cheongmun Jung-jin is waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above that area, a white light bursts out, revealing a hidden barrier.
      </p>
      <p>'What is that?'</p>
      <p>I’m slightly surprised and observe the barrier closely.</p>
      <p>
        There was no change previously even with my demon senses, but the
        barrier appeared suddenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it because my perception is weak, or was it that the artisan who
        built Serving Command Palace was such a great being?
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s unclear, but what’s certain is that the barrier that appeared this
        time is an immense one.
      </p>
      <p>
        'A dense spatial fluctuation... Inside that barrier, space is compressed
        again. If we enter, another place will appear...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Cheongmun Jung-jin, who has been observing the barrier,
        suddenly throws a punch towards a weak point in the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaaaaang!</p>
      <p>
        However, the barrier just vibrates and roars, showing no further
        reaction.
      </p>
      <p>I can see him muttering something from a distance.</p>
      <p>
        I couldn't hear him due to the distance, but judging from his lip
        movements, it looked like he was saying, 'Even the power of Qi Building
        can't break through it.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin continues to observe the barrier, and I destroy the
        guardian statues of Serving Command Palace that are rushing towards us.
      </p>
      <p>About one hour passes, and the order naturally subsides.</p>
      <p>
        When the order disappears, the barrier also vanishes, and Cheongmun
        Jung-jin flies back to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you for your cooperation. For now, go back down to the lower
        floors. Spend the remaining time working on your formations and magic
        artifacts."
      </p>
      <p>
        He looks towards the place where the barrier had appeared and murmurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I will gather energy here for the next few days. The strength of Qi
        Building can't break through the barrier, but if I gather enough for a
        few days and release it all at once with a secret technique of the
        Cheongmun Clan, it might rival a Core Formation’s strike for a
        moment..."
      </p>
      <p>"Understood."</p>
      <p>
        We nod and head back to inspecting various parts of Serving Command
        Palace, drafting diagrams for the formations.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the three of us gather for meetings about the
        formation.
      </p>
      <p>And so, three days pass.</p>
      <p>
        "For now, I've completed the basic investigation of the surrounding area
        and the conceptualization of the inner formation."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The external formation has also been designed. It will perfectly
        support Cultivator Cheongmun's inner formation."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I've also conceptualized magic artifacts that can maximize the
        formation by connecting it with Serving Command Palace."
      </p>
      <p>Somehow, we managed to finish all our tasks in a short time.</p>
      <p>
        "Now we have to go back to Cheon-saek City to report on the formation,
        make adjustments, and realign the connection between the magic
        artifacts, external formation, and inner formation. And..."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong looks upwards.</p>
      <p>
        "Is it true that the clan head is trying to break the barrier on the top
        floor?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, it's dangerous to break a barrier directly connected to the
        palace's golden order without caution... Especially with an ancient
        relic like Serving Command Palace..."
      </p>
      <p>He expresses slight concern.</p>
      <p>
        "If the analysis of the barrier had been entrusted to me, I could have
        done it quickly... It seems clan head thought the conception of the
        Longevity Fruit and Longevity Tree Formation is considered more
        important."
      </p>
      <p>"Indeed, the Longevity Fruit must be important to the clan head."</p>
      <p>I say, looking upwards with Cheongmun Ryeong.</p>
      <p>After a while, Cheongmun Ryeong frowns and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "This won't do. I need to go up and see for myself. There's not much
        time left, less than a day, but I still need to analyze the barrier. If
        the clan head accidentally triggers more of the palace's golden
        orders..."
      </p>
      <p>
        With that, he heads upstairs, and Buk Hyang-hwa and I follow him to the
        top floor.
      </p>
      <p>At the top floor.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin is there, infusing spiritual power into his right
        fist, waiting.
      </p>
      <p>His right fist shines brightly, vibrating the space around him.</p>
      <p>'Is that the secret technique of the Cheongmun Clan...'</p>
      <p>
        The power contained within it seems capable of delivering a blow
        equivalent to that of a Nascent Soul, even if just for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Clan head, we have established the basic framework of the formations.
        What remains is to go back and refine the details... I came here upon
        hearing that you intend to break the barrier connected to the golden
        orders"
      </p>
      <p>He speaks earnestly to Cheongmun Jung-jin.</p>
      <p>
        "However, tampering with a formation connected to a golden order can be
        dangerous."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I know, Cheongmun Ryeong. But it will be disgraceful for a clan head to
        come all the way to Serving Command Palace and gain nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Being seniors have literally scraped everything clean. Only
        a few talismans, wine, and useless decorative artifacts remain, nothing
        else."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong sighs lightly and says,</p>
      <p>
        "Could you give me time to analyze the barrier? If you do, I'll try to
        analyze it so you can strike where it's least problematic."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Alright, let's do that. Artisan! Trigger the golden order again and
        reveal the barrier!"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa, obeying Cheongmun Jung-jin's command, tears the wall
        again to trigger the golden order.
      </p>
      <p>Kurrrrung!</p>
      <p>The golden order is triggered again, and the barrier appears.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong examines the barrier closely, and each time the order's
        activation time ends, Buk Hyang-hwa repeats the process of triggering
        the golden order.
      </p>
      <p>A day passes like this.</p>
      <p>"Clan head, you should strike this part."</p>
      <p>
        "Alright, it's about time for the Nether Crossing Ship to depart. Let's
        quickly check inside the barrier and leave."
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The power gathered in Cheongmun Jung-jin's right fist looks ready to
        burst at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>"Alright, trigger the golden order again!"</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa triggers the golden order once more.</p>
      <p>
        After several days of inspecting various parts of Serving Command Palace
        and triggering the golden order at four axial points, Buk Hyang-hwa has
        become adept at freely turning the golden order on and off.
      </p>
      <p>Paaaaatt!</p>
      <p>The golden order is triggered, and the barrier appears.</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong points to a corner of the barrier.</p>
      <p>"This part here."</p>
      <p>
        Even though the golden order has lowered its level, the power in
        Cheongmun Jung-jin's fist is still immense, comparable to that between
        Nascent Soul and Core Formation.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        As Cheongmun Jung-jin swings his fist, the barrier shakes and begins to
        crack.
      </p>
      <p>
        A look of satisfaction appears on Cheongmun Jung-jin's face, and
        Cheongmun Ryeong, Buk Hyang-hwa, and I all look at the barrier with
        anticipation.
      </p>
      <p>Then, Cheongmun Ryeong's expression changes.</p>
      <p>"Wait, clan head! Stop for a moment!"</p>
      <p>Giiing!</p>
      <p>A red light spreads from the barrier.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, the entire Serving Command Palace is enveloped in the red light.
      </p>
      <p>Jjaang!</p>
      <p>The barrier finally shatters.</p>
      <p>But the red light from the barrier does not subside.</p>
      <p>
        "What's happening, Cheongmun Ryeong? Didn't you say there would be no
        problems?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin looks at Cheongmun Ryeong in panic, and Cheongmun
        Ryeong grimaces and replies.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There shouldn't have been a problem under normal circumstances. But it
        seems someone twisted the barrier from the inside artificially. I didn't
        anticipate this scenario. I apologize..."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm... First, let's secure an escape route."</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin retreats from the barrier and strikes the outer wall
        of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>
        The outer wall crumbles, and now only the outer wall's prohibition
        remains to be breached for escape.
      </p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>"The prohibition on the outer wall... it's changed."</p>
      <p>I grimace.</p>
      <p>I grimace at the sight.</p>
      <p>
        The outer wall's prohibition is also dyed in a red light, and the
        barrier-breaking scroll I brought does not respond to the mutated
        prohibition.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin's face contorts in frustration.</p>
      <p>
        "Damn it, it's almost time for the Nether Crossing Ship to depart! Can't
        we send a message out?"
      </p>
      <p>
        But neither I nor Cheongmun Ryeong can do anything but shake our heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin, with a hardened face, turns back to look at the
        barrier he had shattered.
      </p>
      <p>"First, we need to see what's inside."</p>
      <p>Outside Serving Command Palace, in the empty space.</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin, who has anchored the Nether Crossing Ship nearby, looks up at
        Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>The entire city is enveloped in a deep red light.</p>
      <p>
        [This reaction from the golden order... They must have tampered with
        Serving Command Palace's control room. Heh heh... The agreed time is
        almost up, and with their abilities, they won't be able to break out of
        this golden order... Should I wait a bit longer out of mercy, or not?]
      </p>
      <p>
        After a moment of contemplation, Song Jin decisively grabs the steering
        wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Those who recklessly meddle with the control room without knowing their
        place, it's not my concern. I should go see my disciple's training.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, if they entered the control room, there should be an escape
        route, so there's no need to worry about them being trapped...]
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The Nether Crossing Ship begins to leave the void, enveloped in mist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Song Jin, holding the steering wheel, looks back at Serving
        Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        [But... It's been 800 years since I last entered Serving Command
        Palace... Are the escape routes still intact...?]
      </p>
      <p>'This place is...'</p>
      <p>The inside of the barrier which we entered is a vast library.</p>
      <p>Or more precisely, it 'was' a library.</p>
      <p>"Ha, they've scoured everything thoroughly."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin looks around with a hollow voice.</p>
      <p>The library is completely empty.</p>
      <p>
        The bookshelves are devoid of a single book, and dust has accumulated
        everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This formation seems to be the one that twisted the barrier from the
        inside. It appears I misanalyzed because of this formation..."
      </p>
      <p>
        On the floor, walls, and ceiling of the library, a bizarre formation
        drawn in blood cover the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It looks like a demon formation, but I don't know the demon script, so
        it's hard to identify."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong examines the formation with a grimace.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin also scrutinizes the formation with a serious look.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I shiver as I read the script and symbols on the formation.
      </p>
      <p>'Isn’t this a symbol of the Sea Dragon Tribe?'</p>
      <p>I have a hunch about who is behind this.</p>
      <p>'Is it you again, Seo Hweol?'</p>
      <p>What exactly is his goal?</p>
      <p>While I’m observing the formations,</p>
      <p>"What does this stand for?"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin points to a small stand in the center of the library.
      </p>
      <p>'That stand...'</p>
      <p>I look at the stand with intrigue.</p>
      <p>
        On top of the stand, there’s a small indentation that perfectly matches
        the size of the Serving Command Seal I had seen in my past life.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If you insert the Serving Command Seal there, does something
        activate...?'
      </p>
      <p>"Let's investigate that area."</p>
      <p>
        Led by Cheongmun Ryeong, I and Buk Hyang-hwa start to examine the stand.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin watches us with a serious expression.</p>
      <p>'Huh?'</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, I notice small writing on one of the bookshelves near the
        stand.
      </p>
      <p>'Is this ancient script?'</p>
      <p>
        I had studied ancient languages while reading scrolls in the royal
        library of Shengzi, so I could identify the writing without difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>The inscription read something like this:</p>
      <p>
        -Why even bother preparing the ascension blessing for maggots? So they
        can feast harder on high-quality corpses?
      </p>
      <p>"....?"</p>
      <p>'Is "maggots" the right translation?'</p>
      <p>
        It was an ancient term meaning something like 'corpse-eating worms,' so
        I interpreted it as "maggots."
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The corpse-eating worms referred to here... Are the maggots meant to
        symbolize those who are preparing for ascension? Who left these words,
        and with what kind of sentiment or intention?'
      </p>
      <p>
        I look around the writing for any mechanisms or formations but find
        nothing and eventually dismiss it.
      </p>
      <p>While investigating the area,</p>
      <p>"I found it!"</p>
      <p>"I've got it!"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong and Buk Hyang-hwa exclaim almost simultaneously.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong was inspecting the ceiling while Buk Hyang-hwa tore
        open the floor under the stand, manipulating circuits.
      </p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, two white formations appear on the ceiling and floor.
      </p>
      <p>"This is..."</p>
      <p>"A teleportation array.?"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin and I mutter as we look at the formation.</p>
      <p>"Ah, there was an escape route!"</p>
      <p>
        A look of relief appears on Cheongmun Jung-jin's face, but Cheongmun
        Ryeong is still cautious.
      </p>
      <p>"We don't know where this teleportation array leads."</p>
      <p>"But... Do we have any other choice in the current situation?"</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong, with a grim expression, eventually speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "Even if we use this teleportation array, you do know that we need to
        endure the spatial pressure, correct? We don't have teleportation aid or
        talismans to withstand it."
      </p>
      <p>His words are spot on.</p>
      <p>
        Crossing through space means directly enduring the pressure from the
        outer limits of space.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why only Heavenly Being cultivators dare to challenge the
        Ascension Gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spatial pressure inside the gate connecting to the higher realms is
        something only Heavenly Being cultivators can withstand.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin responds.</p>
      <p>
        "I, having practiced the Cheongmun Clan's Body-Refining Techniques, can
        endure the spatial pressure."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong looks around and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "But for Qi Building cultivators, resisting the spatial pressure is
        impossible."
      </p>
      <p>
        "That may be true. However, I can protect one person at a time using my
        skills and make use of the teleportation array."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin looks around at us and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "Since it's my mistake that led to this, as the clan head, it's only
        right for me to take everyone out. I'll use the teleportation array to
        take one person at a time and then come back for the next.
      </p>
      <p>If I take each person one at a time, we can all escape."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong's expression darkens at his words.</p>
      <p>"But clan head, doing so might injure you..."</p>
      <p>
        "It's alright. It’s my fault for entering the barrier out of greed, so I
        should take responsibility. I'll start by taking you with me, Cheongmun
        Ryeong."
      </p>
      <p>He then points to me and Buk Hyang-hwa in turn.</p>
      <p>
        "After I've taken Cheongmun Ryeong, I'll come back for you two. Wait
        here."
      </p>
      <p>"I understand."</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>
        Seemingly because of their kinship, Cheongmun Jung-jin decides to take
        Cheongmun Ryeong out first.
      </p>
      <p>
        It makes sense and he indicates that he doesn't intend to abandon us, so
        we readily agree.
      </p>
      <p>"Then, let’s see where this leads!"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin, protecting Cheongmun Ryeong with his Core Formation
        power, jumps into the teleportation array below.
      </p>
      <p>Paaaaatt!</p>
      <p>The formation lights up, swallowing the two of them.</p>
      <p>"It seems they have teleported successfully."</p>
      <p>"Hopefully, they didn't end up somewhere dangerous... Ah!"</p>
      <p>At that moment.</p>
      <p>Pssh...</p>
      <p>
        The teleportation array used by Cheongmun Jung-jin fades and is
        extinguished.
      </p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa, in a panic, stutters as she looks at the formation.</p>
      <p>"What, what just happened?"</p>
      <p>"Let me see."</p>
      <p>I examine the teleportation array, realizing the issue.</p>
      <p>'Damn, it's a rechargeable teleportation array..!'</p>
      <p>
        Normally it's maintained by drawing power from Serving Command Palace,
        but once used, it needs time to recharge from the palace before it can
        be used again.
      </p>
      <p>Seemingly, Cheongmun Ryeong had missed this in his haste.</p>
      <p>
        I explain this to Buk Hyang-hwa, who looks anxiously outside the
        barrier.
      </p>
      <p>"Does it take a lot of time to recharge?"</p>
      <p>
        Red light from outside the barrier is slowly creeping into our area.
      </p>
      <p>I bite my lip and nod.</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa, pale-faced, continues.</p>
      <p>
        "By the looks of it, once the red light fills Serving Command Palace, a
        more powerful golden order might activate... Such orders usually involve
        lethal mechanisms."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>"Is there really no way?"</p>
      <p>
        I clench my teeth and look up at the teleportation array on the ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly, the teleportation array that Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun
        Jung-jin used leads directly opposite of this one.
      </p>
      <p>But now we have no other choice.</p>
      <p>"Miss Buk, there is one way."</p>
      <p>"What, what is it?"</p>
      <p>
        "However, you must promise not to disclose this method to the Cheongmun
        Clan."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes...? Ah, you have a secret. I swear I won't disclose it."</p>
      <p>"Then..."</p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>I grab the Formless Sword in my hand.</p>
      <p>"Excuse me for a moment."</p>
      <p>
        I pull her closer with one arm and wrap both of us within the Formless
        Sword.
      </p>
      <p>I’ll block the spatial pressure with the Formless Sword!</p>
      <p>Red light creeps towards us from outside the barrier.</p>
      <p>
        I glance outside briefly, then look up at the ceiling's teleportation
        array again.
      </p>
      <p>"Here we go!"</p>
      <p>"Wait, hold on, you're too close..!"</p>
      <p>Paaaaatt!</p>
      <p>
        Enveloped in the Formless Sword, I jump into the radiance of the
        transmission array holding the two of us.
      </p>

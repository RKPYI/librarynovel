      <p>Chapter 57: Heavenly Thunder (4)</p>
      <p>"That is..."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon stared blankly at the Gang Sphere that had formed in my
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>Twitch, twitch...</p>
      <p>
        The whirlwind of formidable intent contained within the Gang Sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Realizing its significance, Kim Young-hoon trembled all over, his eyes
        bulging as he stared at me.
      </p>
      <p>Then, he started to laugh.</p>
      <p>"Ha, hahaha...hahaha...!"</p>
      <p>
        Staggering, he suddenly collapsed on to the ground, tears streaming down
        his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        His intent, incomparable to what I had seen before, was shining in a
        brilliant golden light.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There was... another... besides me... who has reached this realm...!"
      </p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>His intent blazed even brighter, resembling a sun in its intensity.</p>
      <p>However, I felt a chill run down my spine.</p>
      <p>
        The sun-like intent before me seemed like the jaws of a lion, ready to
        pounce at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>He is excited.</p>
      <p>
        "...Until now, I thought the martial world was filled with fools. The
        vast majority linger in the secondary stage of physical combat, and
        those with exceptional talent could only see intent in basic red and
        blue hues.
      </p>
      <p>
        At most, they reach the Three Flowers Gather at the Summit, seeing maybe
        three, four, or at best, a dozen colors of intent. I never expected
        anyone to reach the same realm as me. I desperately hoped that someone
        might reach the Five Energies Converging to the Origin, but..."
      </p>
      <p>Crrack, crackle...!</p>
      <p>Small stones and sand on the ground vibrated with energy.</p>
      <p>
        The lower-ranking cultivator of the Jin Clan, sensing the ominous
        atmosphere, already flew far away.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The realm of Five Energies Converging to the Origin, a stage that
        scarcely appears once every few hundred years across the continent...
        Yes, it's understandable since it's an enlightenment that overturns the
        inherent limits of one's birth. But, it's always been so utterly empty."
      </p>
      <p>I tensed up.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon is very excited.</p>
      <p>That means...</p>
      <p>
        "Even when fighting cultivators, it was only about matching levels.
        There was no one who could truly exchange martial prowess with me. No
        one who could fulfill my deep craving...!"
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon opened his right palm.</p>
      <p>
        From within his palm burst a star, and like me, a Gang Sphere appeared.
      </p>
      <p>"Finally... I can resolve this grudge...!!!"</p>
      <p>With a brilliantly shining smile, he lifted the Gang Sphere.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>The Gang Sphere spun and split into three.</p>
      <p>Then, each of those three split again.</p>
      <p>Nine Gang Spheres!</p>
      <p>Nine Gang Spheres lined up behind Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>"Let's play!"</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        In an instant, Kim Young-hoon's figure vanished from before my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>There wasn't even a moment to read his intent!</p>
      <p>It was sheer speed!</p>
      <p>I instinctively ducked, driven almost entirely by reflex.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The sound of breaking air echoed, and Kim Young-hoon's saber slightly
        trimmed my hair.
      </p>
      <p>'Is he crazy, swinging at me with the intent to kill?'</p>
      <p>
        Apparently, he lost his mind upon encountering someone of a similar
        level after 40 years of solitary existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If it weren't for the reaction speed granted by the Inner Core, I would
        have been dead.'
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's intent was palpable.</p>
      <p>[What are you doing, playing around? Come at me properly!]</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Suddenly, Kim Young-hoon's palm was right in front of me.</p>
      <p>
        Blinded by the dazzling light of the Gang Sphere targeting my head, his
        movements seemed choppy and hard to follow.
      </p>
      <p>'Back in my past life, it was just a playful spar...!'</p>
      <p>
        Is this the power of an experienced master who has reached the Ultimate
        Pinnacle?!
      </p>
      <p>
        I exerted all my internal energy to counter the Gang Sphere flying at me
        with my own.
      </p>
      <p>Light erupted, pushing us both back.</p>
      <p>Countless sword and saber scars sparked, creating a storm.</p>
      <p>'I need to create some distance.'</p>
      <p>
        I quickly formed another Gang Sphere and prepared for the next move.
      </p>
      <p>Fast.</p>
      <p>
        Aside from the fact that he could create nine Gang Spheres at once, he
        was too fast for me to even react.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a relief that Kim Young-hoon was using slow moves; if he had used
        his extremely fast moves, I might have been killed instantly.
      </p>
      <p>'I need to get to a more isolated place, like a mountain valley...'</p>
      <p>Then, Kim Young-hoon's hand grasped my head.</p>
      <p>"...What?"</p>
      <p>Sssssh!</p>
      <p>Boom!!!</p>
      <p>An immense force erupted from his palm, sending me flying far away.</p>
      <p>
        I was thrown from the manor where the Qi Refining cultivator lived, away
        from the mortals, and crashed into a valley outside the city.
      </p>
      <p>"Cough!"</p>
      <p>I spat out a mouthful of blood and got up.</p>
      <p>
        If I hadn't instinctively used protective Gang Qi, my head would have
        been crushed!
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's going on? It feels like time is being cut off. My reactions
        are..."
      </p>
      <p>It's not just the effect of the Inner Core.</p>
      <p>There's something different about Kim Young-hoon!</p>
      <p>Thump-</p>
      <p>
        Just like before, Kim Young-hoon unnaturally appeared right before my
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>It's as if a scene from a movie has been abruptly cut.</p>
      <p>
        This isn't like the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting
        Martial Arts, which cuts perception to create illusions.
      </p>
      <p>He's just, solely, too fast.</p>
      <p>
        He's moving so swiftly that even with my reaction speed at the Ultimate
        Pinnacle, his actions appear disjointed and impossible to follow.
      </p>
      <p>"What the..."</p>
      <p>"Hmm, what are you doing? Why aren't you reacting properly?"</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon looked at me quizzically for a moment and then seemed to
        realize something, nodding his head.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, I see. You haven't been at this realm for very long!"</p>
      <p>"...That's true."</p>
      <p>
        "Well then, you're probably not adept to using the power of this realm.
        If you properly harness the power of this level, you can easily do this
        much. Now that I look at it, you're only managing one Gang Sphere at a
        time."
      </p>
      <p>He inhaled deeply, smiling as if enjoying himself.</p>
      <p>
        "Well, this is more a matter of technique than talent. Once you learn
        it, you should be able to apply it easily. I'll teach you, so grow while
        sparring!"
      </p>
      <p>"Wait, I'm not..."</p>
      <p>
        I wanted to say that I'm not a monster who grows during battle like him,
        but I had to hurriedly deploy defensive Gang Qi to block Kim
        Young-hoon's kick, coming at me with extreme speed.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        A giant rock behind me, about three meters in size, couldn't withstand
        the shockwave released and shattered into pieces.
      </p>
      <p>[Don't worry, I'll teach you so you can grow.]</p>
      <p>His intent echoes around me.</p>
      <p>
        I concentrate to the utmost to survive and enter the world of intent.
      </p>
      <p>At that moment.</p>
      <p>'What...?'</p>
      <p>Why are there ten Kim Young-hoons?</p>
      <p>
        I quickly alternate my focus between the real world and the world of
        intent.
      </p>
      <p>In reality, there is clearly only one Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>But in the world of intent, there are ten of him.</p>
      <p>'This is...!'</p>
      <p>
        And in the place where Kim Young-hoons stood in the world of intent,
        there were Gang Spheres in reality.
      </p>
      <p>One Kim Young-hoon and nine Gang Spheres.</p>
      <p>[First of all, Gang Sphere isn't just a bomb to throw and explode.]</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>Ten Kim Young-hoons rush at me simultaneously.</p>
      <p>
        He seems to have controlled his speed, and this time our reaction speeds
        are similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in the world of intent, ten Kim Young-hoons vividly assault me.
      </p>
      <p>Even a single hit from one of them is dangerous.</p>
      <p>
        One is an Ultimate Pinnacle master, and the other nine are Gang Spheres
        that could slice my body apart upon explosion!
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh...!"</p>
      <p>
        The biggest problem is that the Gang Spheres are also using intent to
        fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's as if ten masters of equal level are surrounding and competing with
        me in the world of intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, I'm overwhelmed in the battle of intent, and I allow Kim
        Young-hoon's punch through my guard.
      </p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>"Ugh..!"</p>
      <p>
        "Gang Sphere isn't just a compressed bomb of internal energy. It's
        another self, a split spirit. It's a stage far beyond Dual Energy Sword
        Control or Dual Energy Saber Control, where you input the next action
        into the weapon with your intent and consciousness. Here, you input your
        very self into it. That's why once you can handle one Gang Sphere, your
        combat power multiplies!"
      </p>
      <p>We exchange blows.</p>
      <p>
        If I attack the lower body, ten Kim Young-hoons stab at me from all
        directions, and while dealing with them, Kim Young-hoon's knee strikes
        my waist.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I thrust at the midsection, ten Kim Young-hoons use different
        techniques to disrupt the flow of intent. In the meantime, the real Kim
        Young-hoon strikes my shoulder with the back of his blade.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I attempt to strike high, Kim Young-hoons from all around attack
        me, forcing me to hastily retreat.
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh...!"</p>
      <p>As I radiate intent, branches and pebbles rise around me.</p>
      <p>
        I imbue the branches and pebbles with energy, creating thousands of
        sword energies to counter the many Kim Young-hoons...
      </p>
      <p>Flash, flash, flash!</p>
      <p>
        A bright light sweeps through, and nine of the Kim Young-hoons
        simultaneously explode.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a whirl of light, countless saber marks slice through my sword
        energies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, from behind the real Kim Young-hoon, another nine Kim Young-hoons
        walk out again.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality, he's drawing Gang Spheres from his hand, but in the world of
        intent, it's a completely different scene.
      </p>
      <p>'Another self...'</p>
      <p>
        Spontaneously, I extend my hand in the same manner as Kim Young-hoon,
        with a blank expression.
      </p>
      <p>Gang Sphere also emanates from my palm.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, another me emerged from behind, grasping the Gang Sphere
        that had burst forth from my palm.
      </p>
      <p>'Ah, I understand.'</p>
      <p>Somehow, it all makes sense.</p>
      <p>Myself.</p>
      <p>
        Yes, if sword control involves inputting intent into a weapon for its
        next action, then Gang Sphere involves inputting myself into the Gang
        Qi.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I truly enter into within, then myself becoming another source of
        intent is also possible, is it not?
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>My vision split.</p>
      <p>It felt as if my consciousness had been divided.</p>
      <p>I only had one consciousness. But now, I feel as if I have two!</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, my own figure became distinctly visible in the world of
        intent.
      </p>
      <p>In front of ten Kim Young-hoons stood two of me.</p>
      <p>Their eyes sparkled with interest.</p>
      <p>"So, are you getting the hang of it now?"</p>
      <p>"...Indeed."</p>
      <p>I smile wryly and assume a fighting stance.</p>
      <p>The other me also took up a different fighting stance.</p>
      <p>
        This was more about technique and understanding the realm rather than
        talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, even I, lacking talent, managed to grasp it in such a short
        period.
      </p>
      <p>
        The situation of 10 against 1 and 10 against 2 will be quite different.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The exchange of intents ensued, and so did the actual exchange of blows
        between me and Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Good, you seem to have grasped this much. Shall we move to the next
        stage?]
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's complexion seemed to burn with a golden light.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, one Kim Young-hoon walked towards the original body and
        merged within.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a visual perspective, Kim Young-hoon had placed one of the
        surrounding Gang Sphere in his hand.
      </p>
      <p>'Huh?'</p>
      <p>Dangerous.</p>
      <p>
        The moment my instincts warned me, I didn't hesitate to leap into the
        air.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        A fan-shaped energy burst forth, cutting the spot I had been standing on
        and the trees beyond.
      </p>
      <p>It was as if, just like before, time had been cut off.</p>
      <p>
        And then Kim Young-hoon, who suddenly appeared in that spot, looked at
        me.
      </p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>"Cough!"</p>
      <p>Before I knew it, Kim Young-hoon's hand was clutching my face.</p>
      <p>
        I instinctively spread my protective Gang Qi, and Kim Young-hoon's foot
        kicked my stomach three times.
      </p>
      <p>Bang, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>Explosions resounded as I soared into the sky.</p>
      <p>
        'Had I not used protective Gang Qi, my waist would have been gone..!'
      </p>
      <p>Puff!</p>
      <p>I pierced through the clouds.</p>
      <p>A sea of white clouds spread beneath me.</p>
      <p>
        But I had no time to appreciate the beautiful scenery as I focused my
        consciousness and spread my protective Gang Qi.
      </p>
      <p>[Watch carefully.]</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Once again, Kim Young-hoon, who suddenly appears in front of me, swings
        his saber.
      </p>
      <p>Clouds trail from behind.</p>
      <p>[Considering your level, I've only doubled the speed.]</p>
      <p>Kuaang!</p>
      <p>
        He struck me down with his saber, and I plunge through the clouds back
        to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for the reaction speed granted by my Inner Core, I wouldn’t
        have lasted this long!
      </p>
      <p>'Doubled the speed..?'</p>
      <p>I recalled the merging of two Kim Young-hoons.</p>
      <p>
        Clearly, he retrieved his consciousness inputted into the Gang Sphere.
      </p>
      <p>'No, it's not just retrieval.'</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Once again, Kim Young-hoon appears right above me, spinning in the air
        before striking down with his saber.
      </p>
      <p>I barely manage to block his strike with my sword.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The ground of the mountain valley caves in, and spider web-like cracks
        forme around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I endured his attack while observing his movements in the world of
        intent.
      </p>
      <p>'Not just retrieval. He's...'</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon wasn't moving alone.</p>
      <p>He was 'moving together' with another.</p>
      <p>The two Kim Young-hoons were 'overlapping'.</p>
      <p>'Ah, I see.'</p>
      <p>They were in sync.</p>
      <p>
        The two Kim Young-hoons synchronized their thoughts, doubling everything
        about themselves.
      </p>
      <p>'Aha...'</p>
      <p>I'm not a martial arts genius.</p>
      <p>
        So I don't gain incredible enlightenment or grow tremendously during a
        fight.
      </p>
      <p>However, I am a master of martial arts.</p>
      <p>
        What Kim Young-hoon showed me was a 'technique' applicable within the
        realm of the Ultimate Pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a master, within the same realm, I could immediately understand
        such a technique through countless experiences.
      </p>
      <p>'Come on.'</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>My distant Gang Sphere, another 'me', flew towards me.</p>
      <p>And then, it overlapped with me.</p>
      <p>The thoughts of my physical and mental bodies began to synchronize.</p>
      <p>The speed and efficiency of my thoughts doubled.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, the world seemed to slow down.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the control and reaction speed amplified by my Inner
        Core increased manifold.
      </p>
      <p>Vroom!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon swung his saber again, but this time, I caught it up
        close.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's eyes sparkled with intrigue.</p>
      <p>[You've finally understood. Excellent.]</p>
      <p>His thoughts were conveyed through his intent..</p>
      <p>I also communicated through intent.</p>
      <p>
        [...It's only this much for now. But you, can you accelerate your
        thoughts by up to ten times..?]
      </p>
      <p>Eight Gang Spheres gathered around him.</p>
      <p>[That's right. Let's have a real battle...]</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>My sword pierced through his defense and thrust into his abdomen.</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>
        At that moment, I executed a series of seven attacks: Entering Mountain,
        Cliff Edge, Dragon Vein, Joy of Mountains and Peaks, Mountain Tiger,
        Mountain Echoes Valley Responds, Flowing Ridge.
      </p>
      <p>[Ascending Vein]</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        I struck Kim Young-hoon's chin with the flat of my sword, sending him
        flying into the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems he was safe, having quickly deployed protective Gang Qi, but he
        looked down at me with a shocked expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        [What, I thought you could only handle one Gang Sphere...? Why suddenly
        so fast..?]
      </p>
      <p>[It feels like...]</p>
      <p>
        I had experienced a completely different 'realm' each time I progressed
        from first-rate to peak, from peak to Three Flowers Gather at the
        Summit, and from there to Five Energies Converging to the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, from Five Energies Converging to the Origin to the Ultimate
        Pinnacle, it was just a slight increase in reaction speed after forming
        the Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from that, there was only a difference in enlightenment compared
        to Five Energies Converging to the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought it was a bit of a stretch to completely overshadow the
        previous realm.
      </p>
      <p>But now, I truly feel it.</p>
      <p>The world seems to move slower.</p>
      <p>I've truly stepped into the 'next realm.'</p>
      <p>I emitted Gang Qi throughout my body.</p>
      <p>
        I couldn't flow Gang Qi through all my meridians like Qi Building
        cultivators, but for a single moment, I could wrap my entire body in
        Sword Gang.
      </p>
      <p>For an instant, I became the sword!</p>
      <p>Ascending Vein!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        I used Ascending Vein with myself as the sword and rushed at Kim
        Young-hoon, who couldn't react in time and took the hit.
      </p>
      <p>Kuaaaang!</p>
      <p>
        He was sent flying to a distant mountain peak, leaving spider web-like
        cracks and our blade marks on it.
      </p>
      <p>"...Hahaha, so that's it...!"</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon laughed heartily, dusting himself off.</p>
      <p>
        It was a sudden attack, but it seems he nullified the damage with his
        protective Gang Qi.
      </p>
      <p>He was unharmed.</p>
      <p>
        "Daoist cultivation...! You're in the latter stages of Qi Refining. Does
        that mean your consciousness is larger than mine?"
      </p>
      <p>He seem to realize the secret of my reaction speed.</p>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>
        Until now, I couldn't react to his speed. However, once I learned the
        technique to accelerate my perception and thought, I moved much faster
        than him despite using the same number of Gang Spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's because I'm at the 9th Star of Qi Refining, with an abnormally
        large consciousness, practically at the 12th or 13th star in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with the same body and Gang Sphere, the efficiency and capacity of
        acceleration differ!
      </p>
      <p>
        The size of the consciousness itself makes the amplification rate
        different when it's boosted!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Martial arts and Daoist cultivation complement each other. It's like
        being in a different weight class...? Even if you learn the same
        technique, if the size of your consciousness is different, you're at a
        disadvantage..."
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon grinned and gathered his energy.</p>
      <p>
        "Well, good. It's a very unique experience. Since a large consciousness
        for a cultivator is like a physical trait, come at me. It'll be fun!"
      </p>
      <p>Wooong-</p>
      <p>One of the Gang Spheres circling him absorbed back into his body.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's acceleration tripled.</p>
      <p>
        "Let's fight with everything! Whether it's cultivation spells or
        whatever, come at me! Hahaha!"
      </p>
      <p>Once again, Kim Young-hoon and I clashed.</p>
      <p>
        I formed hand seals, altered the terrain around me, and engaged him.
      </p>
      <p>Our fight started in the morning and lasted until evening.</p>
      <p>The surrounding mountain valley completely collapsed.</p>
      <p>In the end, I lost to Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>But unlike before, Kim Young-hoon was no longer an absolute wall.</p>
      <p>High, but a wall with a somewhat visible top.</p>
      <p>That was now the difference between me and Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>"Huff, huff..."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon stood up using his saber, now missing many edges, as a
        cane and laughed.
      </p>
      <p>"It's been a long time since I had this much fun."</p>
      <p>"I feel the same way."</p>
      <p>I smiled wryly at my completely shattered sword.</p>
      <p>I couldn't get up.</p>
      <p>All the strength in my body was drained away.</p>
      <p>
        "By the way, you contacted me through a lower-ranking cultivator. Are
        you planning to join the Jin Clan? With your ability and my
        recommendation, you could become an external elder right away."
      </p>
      <p>
        "That would be nice, but I came here to check on something rather than
        the elder position."
      </p>
      <p>I struggled to get up, feeling sore all over.</p>
      <p>"There are mortals working in the Jin Clan, some people I know."</p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, if it's about mortals, I can arrange a meeting. So you won't join
        the Jin Clan?"
      </p>
      <p>I nodded slightly.</p>
      <p>I have only about ten years left in my lifespan.</p>
      <p>
        In that time, I intend to elevate my Qi Refining cultivation as much as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>In this life, I plan to head to Shengzi.</p>
      <p>Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect.</p>
      <p>
        I need to see if that sect, said to be located in the western mountains
        of Shengzi, has any connection to the Ascension Gate.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe, it has something to do with why we ended up here.</p>
      <p>
        Translator Notes: Martial arts in this novel is so fun. The fights
        between Kim Young-hoon and our MC are always a delight to read.

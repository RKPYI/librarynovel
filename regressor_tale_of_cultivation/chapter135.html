      <p>Chapter 135: Baihui (2)</p>
      <p>Tap tap...</p>
      <p>I dust off my clothes and look back.</p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>From the ground I emerged, dust rose up.</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>I move my Formless Sword, covering the dirt a bit more.</p>
      <p>
        Although I had extensively destroyed the palace I didn't touch the main
        barriers, so it wouldn't cause the fall of Seokyung City abruptly.
      </p>
      <p>The Makli Clan is now over.</p>
      <p>
        Having eliminated most of the Qi Building cultivators and the Core
        Formation elders, including the clan head, the remaining members of the
        Makli Clan in the territory will slowly wither away under the pressure
        of the Jin Clan.
      </p>
      <p>I look at the bundles of goods I have taken from the Makli Clan.</p>
      <p>
        I have gathered every single spirit stone from the Makli Clan, except
        for the elixirs.
      </p>
      <p>With this.</p>
      <p>I resolved all the issues in Yanguo.</p>
      <p>'Now then...'</p>
      <p>I turn my gaze southward.</p>
      <p>'I should go meet Song Jin and Seo Ran.'</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>The blue sea.</p>
      <p>
        Flying over the sea, I arrive at Seo Ran's residence from Yanguo in a
        day.
      </p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>
        I part the waters with my Formless Sword and descend directly to Seo
        Ran's dwelling.
      </p>
      <p>When I arrive at his underwater cave,</p>
      <p>Splash!</p>
      <p>From inside the underwater abode, Seo Ran hastily lifts his head.</p>
      <p>I speak to Seo Ran in the language of the demon race.</p>
      <p>"Are you Seo Ran?"</p>
      <p>
        Feeling the presence of my Formless Sword, he looks at me cautiously and
        asks.
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, that's me. But may I ask... are you also a demon beast?"</p>
      <p>"Just an unusual human. And..."</p>
      <p>
        I have come to Seo Ran without any major incidents in this life, so he
        must have received the space-breaking bead from Seo Hweol as planned.
      </p>
      <p>'How should I explain...'</p>
      <p>After a moment of contemplation, I tell him.</p>
      <p>
        "I'm here on behalf of an elder of the Sea Dragon Tribe, named Jeon
        Hyang. He asked me to find you."
      </p>
      <p>"You, know Elder Jeon?"</p>
      <p>Seo Ran asks, his eyes widening.</p>
      <p>I nod.</p>
      <p>
        "You received the space-breaking bead from Seo Hweol, and were
        instructed to blow up the Nether Crossing Ship, correct? Isn't that so?"
      </p>
      <p>"...Yes, that's correct."</p>
      <p>"First, give me the space-breaking bead."</p>
      <p>"Yes? Oh, here it is."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran, though suspicious, hands me the space-breaking bead.</p>
      <p>After receiving the dharma treasure, I say to him,</p>
      <p>
        "You couldn't break through the barrier of Black Ghost Valley to enter
        the Nether Crossing Ship, could you? Let's go together, I'll break the
        barrier for you."
      </p>
      <p>"Th-thank you."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran bows to me in gratitude, and I continue.</p>
      <p>
        "You can transform into your true form since I know you're a
        demi-human.”
      </p>
      <p>"...Elder Jeon told you about that as well?"</p>
      <p>
        "Let's say he did. Now follow me. We're going to the Nether Crossing
        Ship."
      </p>
      <p>"...Yes."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, while still suspicious, follows me towards the Nether Crossing
        Ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        We arrive at the sea area where the Nether Crossing Ship is located.
      </p>
      <p>An invisible barrier is positioned ahead.</p>
      <p>Beyond this barrier lies the domain of ghosts.</p>
      <p>"Senior, first of all, this barrier..."</p>
      <p>"Never mind, just stay there."</p>
      <p>I step back and raise my hand.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Entering Mountain!</p>
      <p>A slicing upward motion.</p>
      <p>That’s all it took.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>The air splits open, and the barrier is cut through.</p>
      <p>
        Beyond the barrier, the army of tens of thousands of ghosts that form
        the Black Ghost Legion are also split in half, clearing the path.
      </p>
      <p>Gasp...</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran's mouth hangs open, and I, pulling along the stunned Seo Ran,
        quickly head towards the center of the formation where the Nether
        Crossing Ship is located.
      </p>
      <p>In the center of the well shaped formation,</p>
      <p>A solid final barrier remains.</p>
      <p>Boom</p>
      <p>Kuang!</p>
      <p>My thrown Formless Sword shatters the barrier in one strike.</p>
      <p>
        "Huh, gasp...! Even a Core Formation cultivator would struggle to break
        such a barrier..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, who had been staring blankly, now looks at me with eyes full of
        fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s understandable. An already suspicious person showing Nascent Soul
        capabilities is indeed terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>"Hurry up. There's someone we need to meet."</p>
      <p>"To meet... who?"</p>
      <p>
        "Did you think, even though Black Ghost Valley became a wasteland, that
        they would leave the Nether Crossing Ship, their pride and joy,
        completely unguarded?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I lead Seo Ran straight down to the lowest level of the Nether Crossing
        Ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, in the deepest part of the ship, we meet Song Jin, who glares at
        me nervously.
      </p>
      <p>[Who are you?]</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin seems aware that I had broken the barrier in one go, sizing me
        up intensely.
      </p>
      <p>I turn to Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        "Introduce yourself, Daoist Seo. This person is Senior Song Jin, a
        Heavenly Being remnant soul, guarding this Nether Crossing Ship after
        being killed by the Mad Lord Jo Yeon."
      </p>
      <p>"Uh, hello...?"</p>
      <p>[You... could it be? Why have you come here?]</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran looks to not understand the situation and just greets Song Jin
        as instructed.
      </p>
      <p>[...Are you her child? Why have you come here?]</p>
      <p>At this, Seo Ran clamps his lips shut.</p>
      <p>"I came to search for my mother's relic."</p>
      <p>[You came to search for your mother's relic?]</p>
      <p>Flames blaze in Song Jin's eyes.</p>
      <p>Yet, he seems to restrain his anger, speaking more softly.</p>
      <p>
        [Whatever is remaining in this place, everything, is a part of the
        Valley. I cannot give anything to an outsider like you.]
      </p>
      <p>I raise my Formless Sword and ask.</p>
      <p>"Why don't you give us a chance to find it, senior?"</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin's eyes blaze even more fiercely at the sight of my Formless
        Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though angry, realizing he has no way to resist against my Nascent Soul
        prowess, he seems to accept his situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        [...How did you manage to not get dragged into ascension? And what is
        that ominous thing that freely enters and leaves planes…? Damn it…]
      </p>
      <p>He grits his teeth, clenching his fists tightly.</p>
      <p>
        [I'll give you half a day. Find your mother's room within that time and
        search for the relic. If you don't leave within that time, I will burn
        my soul to show you the wrath of a Heavenly Being cultivator...!]
      </p>
      <p>"Understood. Thank you."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran bows to Song Jin, and I nod.</p>
      <p>Later, guided by me, Seo Ran reaches his mother's room.</p>
      <p>[You...!]</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin looks furious but closes his mouth and watches us silently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Seo Ran finds the jade slip his mother left and begins to read it.
      </p>
      <p>Song Jin also sneaks in and starts reading the jade slip with him.</p>
      <p>I step outside for a while.</p>
      <p>
        After some time, I hear Song Jin and Seo Ran talking inside the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        I head outside the Nether Crossing Ship and slowly look up at the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Three days passed.</p>
      <p>[...You. What are your intentions?]</p>
      <p>Song Jin came to find me, who had been quietly waiting on the deck.</p>
      <p>
        [Why did you bring that boy to me? And why did you support him without
        asking for anything in return?]
      </p>
      <p>I pause before making an excuse.</p>
      <p>"I was asked by an elder of the Sea Dragon Tribe, Jeon Hyang."</p>
      <p>
        [Jeon Hyang...? The chief astrologer of the Sea Dragon Tribe, I see.
        Hm...]
      </p>
      <p>"Why do you ask?"</p>
      <p>[That boy... I've decided to take him as my disciple.]</p>
      <p>
        Once again, the master-disciple bond between Song Jin and Seo Ran is
        established.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran and Song Jin came to the deck to thank me.</p>
      <p>[I don't like it, but I need to thank you anyway.]</p>
      <p>
        "I'm also very grateful. If there's anything you need in the future,
        senior, I will fulfill up to three requests."
      </p>
      <p>
        [My disciple is doing so, so I can’t just stand by only opening my
        mouth. I will do the same.]
      </p>
      <p>"In that case..."</p>
      <p>I look at Song Jin and say,</p>
      <p>"First, let me use the Nether Crossing Ship."</p>
      <p>[What...?]</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        I present the pile of spirit stones I have brought from the main house
        of the Makli Clan in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "With this, it should be enough to operate the Nether Crossing Ship,
        right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be more than enough since I had taken all the spirit stones
        from the Makli Clan.
      </p>
      <p>[Hm...!]</p>
      <p>Song Jin's eyes gleam at the sight of the spirit stones.</p>
      <p>[It's more than enough. Alright, where do you want to go?]</p>
      <p>"First, let's go to the Sea Dragon Palace of the Sea Dragon Tribe."</p>
      <p>Together, we move towards the Sea Dragon Palace.</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Together with ghostly energy, the Nether Crossing Ship moved through
        space.
      </p>
      <p>We immediately reached the location of the Sea Dragon Palace.</p>
      <p>
        "Is it possible to break the barrier of the Sea Dragon Palace using the
        main cannon of the Nether Crossing Ship?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [Impossible. All the main cannons on the Nether Crossing Ship are
        broken.]
      </p>
      <p>"I see..."</p>
      <p>
        I recall the power of the cannon fired by Manli Min-lap and lick my
        lips.
      </p>
      <p>'Then I have no choice but to use my own strength.'</p>
      <p>
        I descend from the Nether Crossing Ship, braving the water pressure, and
        swing my Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>The area in my past life where Seo Ran had set up the formation.</p>
      <p>
        It should be enough to break through the weakest part of Seo Hweol's
        barrier.
      </p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>The Formless Sword penetrates the inside of the formation.</p>
      <p>
        Starting with the most fragile parts, it begins to permeate and erode
        them.
      </p>
      <p>As the layers thin, soon after.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A small hole appears on one side of the barrier.</p>
      <p>
        "Daoist Seo, follow me. And if possible, Senior Song Jin, please come
        along."
      </p>
      <p>[...How can I trust that you haven't set a trap here?]</p>
      <p>Song Jin looks at me suspiciously, and I sigh and say,</p>
      <p>
        "I swear on the Nether Crossing Ship. I assure you, I haven't set any
        traps here."
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm... Alright.]</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin forms a hand seal and draws the ghostly energy from the Nether
        Crossing Ship to himself.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin jumps down with the ghostly energy attached, followed by Seo
        Ran and me, and we enter the Sea Dragon Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The Sea Dragon Palace... The last time I was here was when I was
        invited by Dragon King Seo. It’s been a long time.]
      </p>
      <p>"It's been a while for me too."</p>
      <p>We head towards the inner palace of the Sea Dragon Palace.</p>
      <p>[But why have you called us here?]</p>
      <p>"Please follow me. There's something I need to show you."</p>
      <p>I lead them to the hall where Jeon Hyang had died.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>And when we enter the hall.</p>
      <p>"Ah!"</p>
      <p>A sticky curse flies towards Seo Ran and sticks to him.</p>
      <p>
        Just as Song Jin is startled and tries to remove the curse attached to
        Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>Hiss...</p>
      <p>The curse attached to Seo Ran melts away.</p>
      <p>
        It seems like Seo Ran has heard Jeon Hyang's voice, as his eyes tremble.
      </p>
      <p>"Elder Jeon...? I, I need to read that book...!"</p>
      <p>I calmly picked up a jade slab.</p>
      <p>Below, I find a familiar book.</p>
      <p>
        I pull the book towards me with my Formless Sword and then place the
        jade slab down.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I hand the book to Song Jin.</p>
      <p>"Please check if there are any problems with it."</p>
      <p>[What problem could there be... it's just...]</p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>[What...! Damn it, our eyes met!]</p>
      <p>Startled, Song Jin glares at the book.</p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle...</p>
      <p>
        Even though the book left by Seo Hweol hasn't been fully read or closed
        yet, it begins to wriggle wildly.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        A ghostly energy emanates from Song Jin's hand, enveloping the book, and
        he urgently speaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Damn, I've temporarily sealed it. Let's quickly go back to the Nether
        Crossing Ship!]
      </p>
      <p>Snap!</p>
      <p>
        I grab Song Jin's shoulder, and together we return to the Nether
        Crossing Ship using the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>When we finally arrive at the Nether Crossing Ship,</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The ghostly energy fails to withstand anymore and finally breaks apart.
      </p>
      <p>From inside the book, a blue light bursts forth.</p>
      <p>The consciousness of Sea Dragon King Seo Hweol!</p>
      <p>
        The consciousness of Seo Hweol begins to spill out the same words I had
        heard in my past life.
      </p>
      <p>As Seo Ran's eyes widen in shock, Song Jin forms a seal and shouts.</p>
      <p>[Devour it, Nether Crossing Ship!]</p>
      <p>Simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Screech!</p>
      <p>
        Ghostly figures emerge from the deck of the Nether Crossing Ship, ightly
        binding Seo Hweol's remnant.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, Seo Hweol's remnant is sucked into the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh...</p>
      <p>Just like that, Seo Hweol's remnant vanishes.</p>
      <p>
        [It’s the remnant consciousness left by Dragon King Seo. Why did he
        leave such a thing?]
      </p>
      <p>
        Song Jin wonders, and Seo Ran, shocked by Seo Hweol's words, trembles.
      </p>
      <p>I pick up the book and hand it to Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        "Inside, you'll find Elder Jeon Hyang's diary. There's no more trickery
        from Seo Hweol, so take your time and read it."
      </p>
      <p>"...Alright."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran looks fearful of facing the truth, hesitating briefly. But soon,
        he tremblingly begins to read the book.
      </p>
      <p>After a while.</p>
      <p>Drip, drip...</p>
      <p>Tears begin to flow from Seo Ran's eyes.</p>
      <p>"Everything the King showed me... was it all a lie...?"</p>
      <p>He looks deeply shocked.</p>
      <p>Seo Ran weeps for a long time while looking at the book.</p>
      <p>After several hours,</p>
      <p>"Have you calmed down a bit, Daoist Seo?"</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "I was entrusted by Elder Jeon Hyang before he wrote the last part of
        his diary. He asked me to guide you well. I have led you here in
        accordance with his will, so I hope you make wise decisions going
        forward."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran grits his teeth and nods.</p>
      <p>"...Understood. Thank you."</p>
      <p>He has a resolved expression on his face.</p>
      <p>Song Jin, who has been watching us, speaks to me.</p>
      <p>
        [I won't count activating the Nether Crossing Ship as a favor. Thanks to
        this, my disciple has learned about the deceitfulness of Dragon King Seo
        and will also gain the numerous treasures left in the Sea Dragon
        Palace.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you. Then, can we make a few more stops using the Nether Crossing
        Ship?"
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm...?]</p>
      <p>Late evening.</p>
      <p>The heat of the desert cooled as night approached.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>The Nether Crossing Ship appeared in the middle of the desert.</p>
      <p>In the distance, a black castle is visible.</p>
      <p>
        "Senior Song Jin, do you feel the enormous resentful souls sleeping
        beneath that castle?"
      </p>
      <p>[Indeed... They are immense.]</p>
      <p>"Can you use them to break the barrier covering that black castle?"</p>
      <p>Hearing my words, Song Jin nods</p>
      <p>[Well…alright.]</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>Shortly after.</p>
      <p>The Nether Crossing Ship lands in the desert.</p>
      <p>Song Jin begins to form seals.</p>
      <p>
        It’s the dead of night with no sunrise, so the yin energy of the
        resentful souls are boiling more fiercely.
      </p>
      <p>Kyaaaaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>Kyaaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>Kyaaaa!</p>
      <p>Bubble, bubble, bubble...</p>
      <p>Millions of resentful souls beneath the black castle scream wildly.</p>
      <p>
        And feeling the anomaly, a bloody fog starts to flow out from inside the
        black castle.
      </p>
      <p>[What? Who are you! Who dares...?]</p>
      <p>And a familiar face appears.</p>
      <p>It’s Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>I smirk.</p>
      <p>"Should have stayed hidden, why come out and risk your life?"</p>
      <p>[What...? W-Wait! Nether Crossing Ship? Black Ghost Valley?]</p>
      <p>Just then, Song Jin completes his spell.</p>
      <p>Kyaaaaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>A horde of ghosts wail and rush towards Song Jin.</p>
      <p>
        [This is madness! What! Why are you doing this to me all of a sudden!]
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li, sensing Song Jin’s growing power, cries out in terror.</p>
      <p>
        But Song Jin, indifferent to his pleas, completes his ghostly spell.
      </p>
      <p>[Damn it!]</p>
      <p>Shoosh!</p>
      <p>Kiing!</p>
      <p>Yuan Li curses and retreats back into the black castle.</p>
      <p>Soon, the ancient barrier covering the black castle reveals itself.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, a crimson river of blood flows from inside the castle,
        strengthening the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>Long Source True Power.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li's backup life.</p>
      <p>Kiing!</p>
      <p>Crack, Crackkkk!</p>
      <p>The barrier, strengthened, emits sparks.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>The sky fills with yin energy.</p>
      <p>
        In an instant, Song Jin, regaining his Heavenly Being power, stands with
        his hands behind his back, floating in the air, looking down at the
        black castle.
      </p>
      <p>
        [It seems to be an immortal treasure with the power to attract fate.]
      </p>
      <p>"So they say."</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord had mentioned it before.</p>
      <p>I had heard about this castle before as well.</p>
      <p>Song Jin looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        [It seems you want to capture that guy. Though the castle itself is not
        much, the core supplying the castle with the power of fate is
        troublesome, and he's hiding right below it. I can shatter the castle
        with one blow, but I might not be able to capture him and the core.]
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, it's alright. Just do that much, and I'll handle the rest."</p>
      <p>[Very well then....]</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>Blue ghostly flames rise in Song Jin's eyes.</p>
      <p>
        [I'll show you the power of an Elder of the Great Azure Ghost
        Valley....]
      </p>
      <p>Kyaaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>Kurun, Kurururung!</p>
      <p>Dark clouds gather in the sky.</p>
      <p>Soon, the clouds merge, forming a giant ghostly head.</p>
      <p>[Thousand Ghost Bone Formation! Open!]</p>
      <p>[Kyaaaaa!]</p>
      <p>A ghostly wail echoes between heaven and earth.</p>
      <p>
        Then, the ghostly head formed by the dark clouds contort wildly and
        plummet towards the black castle.
      </p>
      <p>A force that rivals the statue thrown by the Mad Lord!</p>
      <p>Jjeoong!</p>
      <p>
        The black castle's barrier, saturated with Long Source True Power, seems
        to resist for a moment but then turns red and explodes.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>The black castle beneath the barrier also crumbles.</p>
      <p>Kwagwagwang!</p>
      <p>A storm of yin wind sweeps across heaven and earth.</p>
      <p>Shortly after.</p>
      <p>
        [Hmm... Surprising indeed. I did hold back a bit... Still, I didn't
        expect the castle to retain its shape.]
      </p>
      <p>Song Jin looks at the black castle in astonishment.</p>
      <p>It’s just as he said.</p>
      <p>
        Despite the immense strike it had just endured, the black castle hasn't
        turned entirely to dust. Only the upper layers and the roof had been
        blown off, maintaining its general structure.
      </p>
      <p>Of course.</p>
      <p>[Aaaaaargh! Arghhh, ack!]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li is inside, half turned to meat, vomiting blood.</p>
      <p>Shururuk, shuruk!</p>
      <p>He’s using the Long Source True Power to regenerate his body.</p>
      <p>And then...</p>
      <p>Above him, the apparition of Seo Hweol flickers and disappears.</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin looks at Seo Hweol's apparition, his ghostly energy distorting
        for a moment before turning his head away.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Seo Hweol's remnants and the core of this castle shielded it from my
        strike.]
      </p>
      <p>"That is..."</p>
      <p>I remember something from my distant past life.</p>
      <p>After the Mad Lord dealt with Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>When he tore apart the black castle, there was a stone fragment.</p>
      <p>
        Back then, I was more concerned with escaping the Mad Lord secretly and
        didn't pay much attention to the fragment.
      </p>
      <p>But at this moment...</p>
      <p>Seeing the stone fragment clearly, my eyes widened in astonishment.</p>
      <p>Crackle, crackle!</p>
      <p>The stone fragment is continuously emitting golden lightning.</p>
      <p>
        It’s the upper part of the stele that had floated right in front of
        Ascension Gate, in the center of Ascension Path!

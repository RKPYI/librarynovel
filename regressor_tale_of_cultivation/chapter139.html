      <p>Chapter 139: Ascension</p>
      <p>Koogooogoo!</p>
      <p>Numerous sounds and rays of light brush past me.</p>
      <p>I grit my teeth, focusing on the Formless Sword throughout my body.</p>
      <p>‘My whole body feels like it's about to be crushed…!’</p>
      <p>
        Had it not been for the Formless Sword enveloping my body due to my
        attainments in Treading Heaven, my body would have instantly been
        crushed without a moment's notice.
      </p>
      <p>‘The Heaven-Sealing Talisman…!’</p>
      <p>
        Gritting my teeth hard enough for my gums to bleed, I tak out the
        Heaven-Sealing Talisman
      </p>
      <p>“Heaven-Sealing Talisman, activate!”</p>
      <p>Koogooogoo!</p>
      <p>
        An immense force gathers in the talisman, and the power of the
        Heaven-Sealing Talisman envelops my body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heaven and earth spiritual energy even exists in spatial passageways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heaven and earth spiritual energy wraps around my body, creating a
        dense barrier that prevents even a single strand of energy from leaking
        out.
      </p>
      <p>“Cough! Huk!”</p>
      <p>I spit blood, barely regaining consciousness.</p>
      <p>‘Damn it, what a mess this is!’</p>
      <p>
        Inside the spatial passageway of the Ascension Gate, I am being pulled
        upwards towards some [Above].
      </p>
      <p>Kiiing!</p>
      <p>
        The blessing of the Serving Command Seal within me is pulling me far
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon entering the Ascension Gate, the Serving Command Seal’s blessing
        became a definite force, pulling me along, and I realized that this
        force is terrifyingly abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>Koogooogoo!</p>
      <p>‘Soon, I'll probably reach the upper realm. But…’</p>
      <p>
        I grit my teeth, watching the barrier of the Heaven-Sealing Talisman
        trembling madly all over my body.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The Heaven-Sealing Talisman seems to be losing its effect faster than I
        thought. There's a possibility it might break before I reach the upper
        realm…!’
      </p>
      <p>I clench my teeth, thinking of the Serving Command Seal.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Originally, even if I entered the Ascension Gate, I planned to return
        to that world with the power of the Serving Command Seal…’
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't expect that the Serving Command Seal itself would be repelled
        by some strange repulsive force.
      </p>
      <p>‘There’s no other choice, I have to endure as much as I can!’</p>
      <p>Koogooogoo!</p>
      <p>
        I frown, watching the Heaven-Sealing Talisman about to collapse any
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>‘This won’t do. Then…’</p>
      <p>I look at Yuan Li’s Blood Body, ascending alongside me.</p>
      <p>
        I recall one method of using the Blood Body, a technique passed down by
        Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>I form a seal together with the Blood Body.</p>
      <p>“Blood Body Skin Armor! Open!”</p>
      <p>At the same time, the Blood Body ‘opens’ wide.</p>
      <p>Swooosh!</p>
      <p>Its internal organs, muscles, and inner body are all exposed.</p>
      <p>
        And then, from within, all the organs and muscles turn into blood, and a
        space large enough for one person to squeeze in is seen forming.
      </p>
      <p>As I form a seal, the Blood Body flies towards me and envelops me.</p>
      <p>
        The Blood Body covers my whole body, and soon seeps through every part
        of it.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        As the Blood Body seeps through my muscle fibers, my entire body is
        further strengthened.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength and regenerative ability of my physical body increases
        tremendously, and in an instant, I can feel that I’m able to use all the
        techniques that the Blood Body can use.
      </p>
      <p>But what’s most important is...</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        The energy of the Heaven-Sealing Talisman that had been residing in the
        Blood Body now merges with my Heaven-Sealing Talisman, significantly
        extending the duration of the talisman's effect.
      </p>
      <p>Pa-aa-aa-at!</p>
      <p>
        The barrier of the Heaven-Sealing Talisman, which seemed about to
        collapse at any moment, has now become more robust, and I can finally
        take a breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Good, I don’t know when I'll reach the upper realm, but at least I can
        hold out for a while.’
      </p>
      <p>Now that I have some leeway for survival, I look around.</p>
      <p>Numerous beams of light and sound are brushing past me.</p>
      <p>Honestly, it’s hard to discern what is what.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Inside the Ascension Gate... perhaps there's a reason why we fell into
        this world here…’
      </p>
      <p>I look around inside the Ascension Gate.</p>
      <p>The spatial passage leading to the upper realm.</p>
      <p>Piii-eeeeet!</p>
      <p>
        Among the numerous beams of light, occasionally, stars that look like
        the universe reveal themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        I catch glimpses of what seems to be countless spaces and dimensions,
        and then, down below.
      </p>
      <p>I faintly make out the form of the world I came from.</p>
      <p>‘That world’ is...</p>
      <p>Like...</p>
      <p>“...Huh?”</p>
      <p>I see it, and it sees me. Our eyes meet. It’s a gigantic jade...</p>
      <p>“...Heok!”</p>
      <p>What was that?</p>
      <p>What just happened?</p>
      <p>Pii-eeet!</p>
      <p>I realize I’m still ascending to the upper realm.</p>
      <p>Numerous beams of light are still passing by around me.</p>
      <p>
        And from the scenes occasionally visible between the beams of light, I
        realize I have ascended quite a bit.
      </p>
      <p>‘Just now, my consciousness cut off for a moment…’</p>
      <p>I hold my throbbing head.</p>
      <p>Why did I lose consciousness?</p>
      <p>‘Was it because of the spatial pressure?’</p>
      <p>
        Even though there’s the Heaven-Sealing Talisman, considerable pressure
        is still being transmitted through..
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it’s bearable, but there are times when the pressure
        intensifies suddenly, so it’s possible that I lost consciousness due to
        the severe pressure at that moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘But right before losing consciousness, it seemed like I saw something…’
      </p>
      <p>I hold my throbbing temples and try to gather my thoughts.</p>
      <p>‘Damn it, my head isn’t working right.’</p>
      <p>Fortunately, things are stabilizing.</p>
      <p>But the throbbing headache doesn’t easily subside.</p>
      <p>And also...</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        It seems quite some time has passed since I lost consciousness, as the
        Heaven-Sealing Talisman is already showing signs of collapsing.
      </p>
      <p>‘Damn, what do I do if the Heaven-Sealing Talisman collapses?’</p>
      <p>The pressure increased even more than before.</p>
      <p>
        The heaven and earth spiritual energy in the spatial passage becomes
        denser, but at the same time, the resistance beating against the
        Heaven-Sealing Talisman becomes stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this continues, once the effect of the talisman wears off, I will be
        crushed into a lump of flesh.
      </p>
      <p>‘I can't let that happen!’</p>
      <p>While being pulled [Above], I take a stance.</p>
      <p>‘I will. Divert the pressure!’</p>
      <p>
        I begin performing a sword dance towards the pressing force bearing down
        on me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon had certainly performed Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains
        by himself.
      </p>
      <p>A self-destructive technique that usually requires an opponent.</p>
      <p>
        The fact that he performed Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains towards empty
        space meant that...
      </p>
      <p>
        'It means that the world itself can become the subject of martial arts.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Cutting through the void itself, exchanging and merging with that
        emptiness, I enter the state of Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I have no intention of performing Foolish Old Man Moves
        Mountains to completion.
      </p>
      <p>‘But if it’s just Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains…’</p>
      <p>Shoong, shoong, shoong!</p>
      <p>I swing my Formless Sword towards the void.</p>
      <p>What Nascent Soul cultivators call ‘planes’.</p>
      <p>I feel my sword brushing against the boundaries of dimensions.</p>
      <p>Whoom, Whoom, Whoom!</p>
      <p>Beyond the dimension.</p>
      <p>
        I feel my sword colliding with the vital force (Qi) that makes up the
        world itself.
      </p>
      <p>'Cut it.'</p>
      <p>
        I slice through the vital force, and with that as a starting point, I
        perform a sword dance towards the immense 'pressure' that is assaulting
        me.
      </p>
      <p>Whizz!</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>My sword dance cuts through the spatial pressure.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the pressure on the Heaven-Sealing Talisman decreases.
      </p>
      <p>'I can't perform Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains. But…'</p>
      <p>
        I can still pour out every move from the beginning to the end without
        getting tired!
      </p>
      <p>
        Horizontal slash, lower three cuts, upward slash, stab, change moves,
        offense and defense as one…
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless moves burst out almost simultaneously, forming a single shape.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain!</p>
      <p>Whooooosh!</p>
      <p>The pressure above is split.</p>
      <p>Crack, Crack!</p>
      <p>
        Despite this, an endless amount of pressure continues to squeeze me, and
        the Heaven-Sealing Talisman is gradually losing its power.
      </p>
      <p>And then, at some moment.</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>Finally, the Heaven-Sealing Talisman exhausts its power.</p>
      <p>'Faster, stronger!'</p>
      <p>
        I resist the pressure squeezing my whole body and slice through the
        spatial pressure more quickly with the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>But the pressure continues to gradually increase.</p>
      <p>Crack, Crack!</p>
      <p>
        Despite cutting through, the residual pressure alone feels enough to
        crush my entire body covered in the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>During this.</p>
      <p>Wriggle!</p>
      <p>
        I spot something wriggling on the other side of the spatial passage,
        swimming through space.
      </p>
      <p>'What is that?'</p>
      <p>
        That bizarre creature, seemingly living in the crevices of space,
        fortunately has no interest in me, but its momentum is not inferior to a
        Heavenly Being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feeling a chill down my spine, I continue to cut through the pressure.
      </p>
      <p>Crack, Crack!</p>
      <p>
        Even after being infused by the Blood Body for enhanced durability and
        regeneration, my whole body feels like it’s about to be shattered by the
        spatial pressure!
      </p>
      <p>And then, when blood finally bursts from my seven orifices!</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        I vomit blood as I collide with a 'barrier' that suddenly appeared in
        front of me.
      </p>
      <p>Whooooosh!</p>
      <p>
        Naturally, the Formless Sword cut through the 'barrier', and thanks to
        the inertia that had been pulling me along, I am finally able to enter
        [Above] by piercing through the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>"Keughhk! Cough, Gasp!"</p>
      <p>I spit out a mouthful of blood.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>"This is…"</p>
      <p>I feel the [ground] beneath my hands.</p>
      <p>That terrible spatial pressure is no longer felt.</p>
      <p>
        A stable, and much denser heaven and earth spiritual energy than what I
        felt in the previous world.
      </p>
      <p>Tens of times more spiritual energy than Ascension Path.</p>
      <p>
        Compared to typical areas in the previous world, it’s hundreds of times
        more.
      </p>
      <p>"Huff… Huff…?"</p>
      <p>I look around.</p>
      <p>'This place…'</p>
      <p>"Upper Realm…?"</p>
      <p>As I look around.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>[What's this now.]</p>
      <p>A giant in green armor appears before me.</p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, he’s not made of flesh and blood like humans or
        demi-humans, but of wood and earth.
      </p>
      <p>And the pressure emanating from him...</p>
      <p>"Kwak! Keeeuuugh!"</p>
      <p>'I can't breathe!'</p>
      <p>Four-Axis!</p>
      <p>His pressure is outrageously beyond that of a Heavenly Being.</p>
      <p>
        Him just standing in my domain of consciousness makes me feel like my
        head is going to split open.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly abandon the thought of observing him and withdraw my
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>I try to look at him but quickly lower my gaze to his shadow.</p>
      <p>Looking directly at him somehow made my eyes sore.</p>
      <p>An entity those below Heavenly Being can't even look directly at.</p>
      <p>A cultivator of the Four-Axis stage!</p>
      <p>
        [Breaking through the thinned spatial barrier, and yet the aura is only
        at most the level of Qi Building… How suspicious. Has some strange
        creature from the void masqueraded as a human and infiltrated?]
      </p>
      <p>Kugugu!</p>
      <p>The Four-Axis cultivator raises his hand.</p>
      <p>'This is…!'</p>
      <p>The same momentum I felt from [Her] palm!</p>
      <p>'I'm going to burst and die!'</p>
      <p>My pupils shrink with tension and fear.</p>
      <p>I try to speak as I vomit blood.</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>"Wait a minute!"</p>
      <p>A familiar voice rings in my ears.</p>
      <p>[Hmm?]</p>
      <p>The Four-Axis cultivator looks in one direction.</p>
      <p>I also look towards where the voice came from.</p>
      <p>There stood a familiar figure in blue armor, arms crossed.</p>
      <p>'Cheongmun Sunwoo...!?'</p>
      <p>"It's a face I know. He’s not a strange life form from the void."</p>
      <p>[Hmmm....]</p>
      <p>Whooooosh….</p>
      <p>
        The momentum that formed in the hands of the Four-Axis cultivator
        dissipates.
      </p>
      <p>Only then do I take a look around.</p>
      <p>
        Behind Azure Tiger Saint, there are several Heavenly Being cultivators
        who exude similar auras and Nascent Soul cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        And behind them, numerous burly figures with unusually powerful auras
        are positioned.
      </p>
      <p>Further back, Chief Oh Hyun-seok is staring at me, eyes wide open.</p>
      <p>
        On both sides of Azure Tiger Saint, stand a middle-aged man in golden
        robes and a gender-neutral figure in black devilish robes.
      </p>
      <p>PIjitt Pijijijijit!</p>
      <p>
        The man in golden robes, the Master of Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder
        Sect, Jin Byuk-ho.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him are several Heavenly Being cultivators emitting lightning
        energy, and a significant number of Nascent Soul cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        And many disciples of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect are also
        visible.
      </p>
      <p>Kyaaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>Gieyaaa</p>
      <p>
        And the figure in black devilish robes, the Grand Elder of Black Ghost
        Valley, White Bone Ghost Devil Heo Gwak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind them, two Nether Crossing Ships float in the air, and eerie
        valley sounds echo around.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore…</p>
      <p>"Ho-ho, this is an unexpected visit…"</p>
      <p>
        A handsome young man with blue hair, wearing blue robes, and antler-like
        horns on his forehead.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hweol smiles gently as he looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        Behind Seo Hweol, several giant sea dragons exuding the energy of
        Heavenly Beings reveal themselves, with dozens of smaller sea dragons
        positioned behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kings of the Mighty Tiger and Holy Peng tribes are also present beside
        Seo Hweol, along with their tribe members.
      </p>
      <p>And then…</p>
      <p>[Huhuhu, what an odd situation. How did this kid get here?]</p>
      <p>Mad Lord Jo Yeon.</p>
      <p>
        He stands a little apart from the other forces, hands behind his back,
        watching me and stroking his chin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside him, Team Leader Kim Yeon is inexplicably lying on the ground,
        foaming at the mouth and unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn’t look like the actions of the Mad Lord. Rather, the shock of
        withstanding the spatial pressure, even with his protection, seemed too
        significant.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone I had met on Ascension Path is gathered here.</p>
      <p>Then, the Four-Axis entity speaks.</p>
      <p>[Explain. You say you know this kid?]</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. That guy is definitely… someone I saw before passing through the
        Ascension Gate when I was in the lower realm. We three met and even
        tested him, he's definitely a human, not a strange lifeform."
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmm, then how could this human of apparently Qi Building stage ascend
        to the Bright Cold Realm on his own?]
      </p>
      <p>
        At the wooden man's words, Azure Tiger Saint coughs, seemingly unable to
        guess.
      </p>
      <p>Then, Seo Hweol steps forward with a kind smile.</p>
      <p>
        “Perhaps, he too possesses some unique quality. Before our ascension
        through the Ascension Gate we encountered a group of humans, and we
        confirmed that some of them had interesting qualities. So, before
        ascension, those thought to lack such qualities were abandoned and each
        force took one of the talented for themselves… But it turns out, they
        all have unique talents. To think that he followed us and ascended on
        his own, it makes me a bit curious about what kind of talent the
        remaining human has.”
      </p>
      <p>
        At Seo Hweol's explanation, the wooden man in green armor asks
        curiously.
      </p>
      <p>[Unique qualities? What kind of unique qualities?]</p>
      <p>"Haha…"</p>
      <p>
        At that, Seo Hweol grins and exchanges glances with the other three
        Heavenly Beings, even the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord snorts but crosses his arms, keeping silent.</p>
      <p>
        "Just unique qualities. But no matter how unique, they can't compare to
        the distinguished bloodlines and methods practiced by those in the
        Bright Cold Realm, right?"
      </p>
      <p>The three Heavenly Beings also laugh and nod.</p>
      <p>"Well, they're a bit unique, but really nothing special."</p>
      <p>"Just talents that perfectly fit each sect's methods."</p>
      <p>[Hmmm….]</p>
      <p>The green-armored wooden man's eyes light up.</p>
      <p>
        [It seems you're hiding something. Speak plainly. You've just ascended
        to the Bright Cold Realm, why so secretive?]
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>The wooden man's aura envelops the area.</p>
      <p>
        I struggle to breathe, falling to the ground and clutching my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, it felt like my heart would stop any moment, and I had to
        forcibly keep it beating with my Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>'He-Heavenly Beings, how are they?'</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the eyes of the Heavenly Being cultivators, initially subdued
        by the wooden man’s aura, shined.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, Seo Hweol, hands behind his back, started walking towards us.
      </p>
      <p>[This guy…?]</p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>"…!?"</p>
      <p>My eyes widened.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>Seo Hweol's aura is rising.</p>
      <p>
        And the surrounding heaven and earth spiritual energy, hundreds of times
        denser than before, began to be absorbed by Seo Hweol.
      </p>
      <p>Craaaaack!</p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol's aura began to push back the green-armored wooden man's aura.
      </p>
      <p>With each step he took, his aura grew stronger.</p>
      <p>
        "...I must say something to the Bright Cold Realm senior, lest there be
        any misunderstandings."
      </p>
      <p>[What...!?]</p>
      <p>Thud, thud, thud...</p>
      <p>
        Not only Seo Hweol, but also Jin Byuk-ho, Heo Gwak, and Cheongmun Sunwoo
        approached. Absorbing the dense spiritual energy of the Bright Cold
        Realm, their auras intensified even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We are not like those who fled to the upper realms merely to extend
        their lives. Rather, we had already reached the peak of Heavenly Being
        and gained enlightenment towards the Four-Axis but had to ascend due to
        a lack of resources to elevate our cultivation..."
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>Buzz, buzz...</p>
      <p>Suddenly, it became difficult to even look directly at Seo Hweol.</p>
      <p>I felt the same towards the other three Heavenly Beings.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The next moment.</p>
      <p>
        A brilliant light burst from Seo Hweol, Jin Byuk-ho, Heo Gwak, and
        Cheongmun Sunwoo, and their auras changed.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The green-armored wooden man's aura was completely neutralized, and I
        finally found it easier to breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Even if you find the juniors from the lower realms somewhat lacking, we
        have worked hard in our own right and would appreciate a little
        respect."
      </p>
      <p>
        With the end of Seo Hweol's words, I once again look at them, or rather,
        their shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the blink of an eye, after absorbing the spiritual energy of the
        upper realm, they have become Four-Axis cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        The green-armored wooden man is suddenly surrounded by four Four-Axis
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        [What, what is this! How can you elevate your cultivation without
        undergoing Heavenly Tribulation?]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha. Before ascending, Sect Master Jin of the Golden Divine Heavenly
        Thunder Sect used the sect's divine treasure to disperse the Four-Axis
        Heavenly Tribulation in advance. We reached the Four-Axis immediately,
        having already faced the tribulation beforehand, so it does not strike
        us now."
      </p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint laughs heartily and pats the shoulder of the
        green-armored wooden man.
      </p>
      <p>As they begin to pressure him.</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        In the sky, a massive aura stirs, and several more Four-Axis cultivators
        begin to descend.
      </p>
      <p>[These ascenders are... all quite special.]</p>
      <p>
        [Enduring added spatial pressure and ascending with their sects... They
        are monsters from the start....]
      </p>
      <p>
        [To possess such talent to reach Four-Axis immediately upon arrival....]
      </p>
      <p>
        They look at Jin Byuk-ho, Heo Gwak, Cheongmun Sunwoo, and Seo Hweol in
        awe.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu</p>
      <p>
        From the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, Black Ghost Valley, Azure
        Heaven Creation Sect, Mighty Tiger, Holy Peng, Sea Dragon, and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Heavenly Being and Nascent Soul cultivators began to elevate their
        cultivation by absorbing the dense spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble</p>
      <p>
        They too seemed to have received help from the divine treasure of the
        Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect.
      </p>
      <p>None of them particularly caused Heavenly Tribulation.</p>
      <p>Of course, none reached Four-Axis immediately like the first four.</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        And there, quietly beside them, Mad Lord Jo Yeon seems to have broken
        through some stagnant bottleneck, but has not reached Four-Axis.
      </p>
      <p>
        He appears to have reached the peak of Heavenly Being, but likely...
      </p>
      <p>
        'Given his personality, he probably didn't accept help from the Golden
        Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect and didn't face the tribulation in advance,
        so he couldn't immediately overcome the ascension tribulation and reach
        Four-Axis.'
      </p>
      <p>As I survey the chaotic surroundings.</p>
      <p>
        [Anyway, lower your auras, juniors. No matter how impressive your
        generation is, there are Integration stage Grand Cultivators nearby in
        this Flying Immortal Platform, so be careful. Seeing sects like Black
        Ghost Valley and Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, it seems you've
        ascended from the Head Realm. I'll guide your group to the Human
        Territory. And you, demon beasts...]
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu</p>
      <p>Before the cultivators could finish speaking.</p>
      <p>
        Far away, thunder and lightning struck, and dark clouds gathered in the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>Soon after, the entity bringing the dark clouds descended.</p>
      <p>Kuguguugugugu!</p>
      <p>It’s a gigantic dragon.</p>
      <p>
        Larger even than Seo Hweol's original form, this Four-Axis dragon from
        the Earth Tribe’s True Dragon Alliance landed among the Sea Dragon
        Tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I am Elder Gyu-ryeon of the Earth Tribe’s True Dragon Alliance. This
        generation's Head Realm ascenders are indeed something. To have reached
        Four-Axis already. You demon beasts, follow me to the Demon Territory.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, we've heard of your fame even in the lower realm, Elder
        Gyu-ryeon. We appreciate your guidance."
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol greets Gyu-ryeon with a gentle smile, and Gyu-ryeon, seemingly
        a bit embarrassed upon seeing Seo Hweol's face, snorts.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Anyway, let's get going. I don't want to be around these folks for too
        long.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Gyu-ryeon declares, glancing briefly at the green-armored wooden man and
        the other human Four-Axis cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>Then, turning to me, Seo Hweol says,</p>
      <p>
        "Ah, please just wait a moment.There's a matter regarding this junior
        that needs to be addressed."
      </p>
      <p>
        With a gentle face, he extends his hand to me as I lay on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, this really… Getting caught between a dragon’s fight always hurts
        the ant’s back. I apologize for any distress. I don't know what unique
        talent you have, but it must have been difficult ascending all the way
        here, wasn't it?"
      </p>
      <p>"...Thank you for your concern."</p>
      <p>I reply, getting up on my own without taking his hand.</p>
      <p>
        "By the way, kid. Just what kind of method did you use to follow us?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint asks, passing by the green-armored wooden man to
        approach me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Indeed, we left several days before him, and yet he managed to catch up
        just as we ascended?"
      </p>
      <p>'That's right, now that I think about it.'</p>
      <p>
        Under normal circumstances, I shouldn't have been able to converse with
        them here. They had ascended days before me, and it’s odd that I, who
        left much later, arrived in the upper realm at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord Jo Yeon, who has been quiet, speaks with a chuckle.</p>
      <p>
        [Seems like he has a special connection or fate with the upper realm.
        Even just considering the blessing of the Serving Command Seal, those
        with stronger fates can reach the upper realm much faster, can't they?
        While it took us several days to barely ascend, this guy, with his
        extraordinary fate, might have managed it in just half a day. Kekeke…]
      </p>
      <p>'Because of the Serving Command Seal…'</p>
      <p>
        It seems that while they struggled for days to ascend through spatial
        pressure, I had ascended instantly thanks to the seal's blessing.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly...</p>
      <p>
        The ground beneath me lights up and is covered by a strange barrier.
      </p>
      <p>"This is?"</p>
      <p>
        "It's called the Flying Immortal Platform. All cultivators ascending
        from the lower realms arrive here. Now that there are no more
        ascendants, the Platform is closing, and the barrier we broke through is
        being restored,"
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hweol explains while walking.</p>
      <p>
        The Platform, now covered in a barrier, makes the surrounding space feel
        more stable.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hweol asks me.</p>
      <p>"So, what will you do?"</p>
      <p>"...?"</p>
      <p>He gestures around with a benevolent expression.</p>
      <p>
        "Your colleagues' talents have already been recognized. By ascending on
        your own, you've proven your exceptional talent as well... Since
        everyone has ascended, if you're as talented as they are, I wouldn't
        mind taking you with me. I'm quite interested in you…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Intrigue sparkled in the eyes of everyone around me, including Seo
        Hweol.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Make your choice. We'll soon scatter according to the guidance of the
        Bright Cold Realm's seniors. Which faction will you join?"
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, I relax my entire body.</p>
      <p>
        My Formless Sword, which has been surrounding me, disperses into the
        air.
      </p>
      <p>'Well, let's think about it.'</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>[Hey, you...!]</p>
      <p>
        The green-armored wooden man and other Four-Axis cultivators floating in
        the air, along with the dragon elder representing the True Dragon
        Alliance, all show signs of intense anger.
      </p>
      <p>'What's happening?'</p>
      <p>In my confusion, they react to my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        [Looking carefully, isn’t this a spy from the Heart Tribe trained in the
        Heart Path Method? I knew something was suspicious!]
      </p>
      <p>"What...?"</p>
      <p>
        [Die, you spy! We'll extract your soul and interrogate you after death!]
      </p>
      <p>"Wait a m-"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>I explode, not even realizing what hit me, and die instantly.</p>
      <p>Thus, I died right after succeeding in ascension.</p>
      <p>That is my thirteenth return.</p>
      <p>

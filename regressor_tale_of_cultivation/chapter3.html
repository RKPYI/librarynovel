      <p>Chapter 3: Scattering Destiny (2)</p>
      <p>Drip, drip-drip...</p>
      <p>
        The endless downpour gradually subsided after Deputy Manager Oh
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>After a while, the sky began to clear.</p>
      <p>"...Regardless of what happens next, I'll go gather some food."</p>
      <p>I stood up, leaving the two who had become despondent behind.</p>
      <p>"Wait, Deputy Manager Seo. Let's go together."</p>
      <p>
        "Yeah, yeah. What if some weird creatures kidnap us while we're
        separated?"
      </p>
      <p>"...Well, yes. And..."</p>
      <p>I said with a bitter smile.</p>
      <p>
        "Strictly speaking, since they were taken away as disciples or blood
        relatives, it's more like recruitment than kidnapping..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's kidnapping. What? Did those strange creatures actually get
        proper consent before taking them?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Director Kim spoke with a grimace. Indeed, it was actually a kidnapping.
      </p>
      <p>
        We stayed close to each other as we gathered herbs and fruits together.
      </p>
      <p>"Try chewing on this herb. It will warm your body."</p>
      <p>
        After the rain, I gave warming herbs to Director Kim and Manager Kim,
        who were shivering in the cold air.
      </p>
      <p>"Th-thank you, Deputy Manager Seo."</p>
      <p>
        "Really, if it weren't for you, we would have been starving from the
        first day until now..."
      </p>
      <p>"Why didn't the company recognize someone as capable as you..."</p>
      <p>I chuckled bitterly.</p>
      <p>
        "The only thing I know how to do is survive in the woods for a few days,
        but I have no other abilities or talents."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't be modest. It's because of you that we are still alive. You are,
        in essence, our lifesaver."
      </p>
      <p>"That's right, Deputy Manager."</p>
      <p>The two encouraged me with trembling voices.</p>
      <p>Moved by their sincere words, I could only smile bitterly inside.</p>
      <p>'This is all I can do for you.'</p>
      <p>
        Right now, I'm like a merchant trying to buy Director Kim's favor with
        my future knowledge.

      <p>
        I am neither a capable person, a good person, nor someone who can be a
        savior to others.
      </p>
      <p>I'm just paying the maximum price I currently can to buy favor.</p>
      <p>"That's why you should also try this. It'll clear your mind."</p>
      <p>"This herb helps with blood circulation..."</p>
      <p>"This fruit is said to be effective for beauty..."</p>
      <p>
        I wandered around the forest, feeding Director Kim and Manager Kim
        numerous medicinal herbs and fruits.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I've dug up a few more yellow bamboo roots. I've also gathered many
        precious herbs from my past life. And...'
      </p>
      <p>I made sure they both ate their fill.</p>
      <p>
        "Thank you, Deputy Manager Seo. Feeling full makes the gloominess fade a
        bit."
      </p>
      <p>"Deputy Manager. You really... can't go anywhere."</p>
      <p>"...Of course. I won't be kidnapped."</p>
      <p>
        As I wandered the forest, gathering herbs and fruits, evening
        approached.
      </p>
      <p>'Now, it's about time.'</p>
      <p>I took off my shirt and lit it on fire with Director Kim's lighter.</p>
      <p>"Good heavens! Deputy Manager Seo! What are you doing?"</p>
      <p>"De-deputy Manager!"</p>
      <p>
        The clothes, having dried after the rain and being worn while wandering
        outside, caught fire easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        I threw the freshly picked fruits into the fire made from my burning
        clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "···We couldn't gather firewood because of the rain. It'll be night
        soon, we need the fire."
      </p>
      <p>"But... your clothes..."</p>
      <p>"I'm fine. Didn't I bring a lot of warming herbs?"</p>
      <p>A farewell gift for Manager Kim.</p>
      <p>
        I left the two in a panic and, after a while, retrieved the fruits from
        the fire using a branch.
      </p>
      <p>"Manager Kim, try this. Director Kim, you too."</p>
      <p>"...Thank you, Deputy Manager Seo."</p>
      <p>"Really, thank you."</p>
      <p>The sun had set.</p>
      <p>We sat in the cave, watching the sunset, eating roasted fruits.</p>
      <p>This would probably be the last meal with Manager Kim.</p>
      <p>
        While eating the fruits, we chatted to hide the sadness of parting with
        Chief Oh, Section Chief Jeon, Deputy Manager Kang, and Deputy Manager
        Oh.
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes laughing heartily,</p>
      <p>Sometimes snickering quietly.</p>
      <p>Sometimes feigning disinterest at Director Kim's jokes.</p>
      <p>That way, we spent a long time laughing and talking.</p>
      <p>
        As the sky turned from red to purple at sunset, the sun almost
        completely set below the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>In the distance.</p>
      <p>
        In the direction where numerous cultivators and the Sea Dragon King had
        headed, towards the Ascension Gate,
      </p>
      <p>Manager Kim suddenly turned her head.</p>
      <p>"Manager Kim, what's wrong?"</p>
      <p>
        Director Kim asked Manager Kim Yeon. Seeing her trembling lips, I
        guessed that the time had come.
      </p>
      <p>"Uh, uhh..."</p>
      <p>She had awakened her abilities.</p>
      <p>
        "It's, it's strange... Suddenly, I can feel everything around me. My
        senses are reaching out for several kilometers... Ah, ahh..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Manager Kim Yeon, suddenly able to sense her surroundings for several
        kilometers, clutched her head in pain, moaning.
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh... Grrr..."</p>
      <p>
        "Deputy Manager Seo! What should we do? Is there any herb good for
        headaches...?"
      </p>
      <p>"There is one for headaches here, but..."</p>
      <p>I doubted it would be useful.</p>
      <p>50 years ago.</p>
      <p>In my past life, it was around this time that she was taken.</p>
      <p>"Ah, ahh...!"</p>
      <p>She screamed softly in the direction of the Ascension Gate.</p>
      <p>"It's coming! It's coming! Something is coming!"</p>
      <p>
        From the direction of the Ascension Gate, where the cultivators had
        headed, a small dot became visible.
      </p>
      <p>Soon after, the dot rapidly grew and swiftly approached us.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Arriving above our cave at an unbelievable speed, it was a giant
        puppet-like beast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitting on top of the sinister looking puppet beast, was an old man with
        a hunchback holding a cane.
      </p>
      <p>
        [What's this? Mortals? How did mortals without spiritual roots reach the
        outskirts of the Path to Ascension? Ah, I see. It's the time when the
        Ascension Gate opens, and the nearby space becomes unstable. It's likely
        that ordinary mortals got caught in a spatial storm! Kikihi, as
        expected, I'm a genius. To figure out such a puzzle in an instant!]
      </p>
      <p>
        The self-praising hunchbacked old man chuckled for a while and then
        asked us.
      </p>
      <p>
        [By the way, ordinary folks. Who was it just now that unleashed such an
        immense consciousness? I was startled, thinking a high-level immortal
        from the Upper Realm had descended... Ah, is it that one?]
      </p>
      <p>Leap!</p>
      <p>
        The old man jumped down from the puppet and approached Manager Kim Yeon,
        who was suffering from the headache.
      </p>
      <p>"Who are you...? Manager Kim is... our colleague."</p>
      <p>Director Kim bravely blocked the old man's path.</p>
      <p>
        But with a flick of the old man's chin, Director Kim was helplessly
        thrown aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ran to catch Director Kim, and although my back scraped, I managed to
        safely catch him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Deputy Manager Seo, thank you. Hah, huff! Are you okay? Your back!"
      </p>
      <p>"I'm... fine."</p>
      <p>
        While we were busy, the hunchbacked old man approached Manager Kim Yeon.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Interesting, indeed interesting. An ordinary mortal's consciousness
        should not extend beyond their own brain. But this girl's consciousness
        stretches out like threads in all directions. It's so vast that I
        mistook it for the presence of an immortal from the Upper Realm...]
      </p>
      <p>The hunchbacked old man lifted Manager Kim Yeon's chin, grinning.</p>
      <p>
        [Child, I will take you under my wing. You may lack spiritual roots, but
        with my abilities, I can fully awaken them. I'm curious to see what
        results will emerge if such a peculiar consciousness evolves into a
        cultivator's divine consciousness...]
      </p>
      <p>Manager Kim Yeon's eyes trembled, and she turned to us.</p>
      <p>"Director... Deputy Manager..."</p>
      <p>
        [Hmm...? I said I would take you, yet you still cling to these worldly
        connections?]
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh, huu..."</p>
      <p>Tears the size of beans began to fall from her eyes.</p>
      <p>
        She had worried about being separated from us, after her colleagues were
        kidnapped just a few days after arriving in this world. The thought of
        being separated from us again frightened her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing her like this, the hunchbacked old man’s face distorted
        grotesquely and pointed at us.
      </p>
      <p>"Keug! Keuugh!"</p>
      <p>"Argh!"</p>
      <p>Director Kim and I groaned loudly and collapsed on the spot.</p>
      <p>
        An overwhelming pressure that made it difficult to breathe squeezed us.
      </p>
      <p>[Then, I shall personally sever your worldly connections. Now...]</p>
      <p>"No, please! I'll do anything you ask. Please just spare them!"</p>
      <p>Manager Kim Yeon, tears streaming, clung to the old man's feet.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, the hunchbacked old man wrinkled his brow and withdrew his
        hand from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crushing pressure that felt like it would burst our hearts finally
        subsided.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Fine, if you say so... But remember, you are now mine, and you must
        forget all worldly connections. Understand?]
      </p>
      <p>"...I understand..."</p>
      <p>
        [Well, since it has come to this, I will send these two to a nearby
        mortal's nation through a spatial rift. I'll send them randomly, so even
        I will not know where they'll end up. You will never meet them again!
        Forget these meaningless worldly connections!]
      </p>
      <p>"Just a moment...!"</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>A dark rift opened behind Director Kim and me.</p>
      <p>
        Startled, Director Kim tried to run in the other direction, and I
        hurriedly gathered the herbs and medicinal plants I had placed at the
        cave entrance.
      </p>
      <p>[Stop right there!]</p>
      <p>
        As the hunchbacked old man gestured, we began to be sucked towards the
        rift.
      </p>
      <p>"Eun-hyun! Director Young-hoon!!! No!"</p>
      <p>
        As Manager Kim Yeon reached out to us with a desperate look, we lost
        consciousness on the other side of the rift.
      </p>
      <p>Blink.</p>
      <p>I came to my senses and got up.</p>
      <p>"Where is this...?"</p>
      <p>I looked around, recalling memories from 50 years ago.</p>
      <p>The musty smell.</p>
      <p>The noisy sounds coming from afar...</p>
      <p>"...What?"</p>
      <p>Rubbing my eyes, I looked around.</p>
      <p>It was different from my memory.</p>
      <p>
        This place was different from where Director Kim and I had landed in my
        past life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found myself in an alleyway, with people passing by on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>"Why is it different from last time?"</p>
      <p>
        Then I remembered the hunchbacked old man saying he would randomly
        connect the spatial rifts.
      </p>
      <p>'...It was random.'</p>
      <p>
        Even a tiny difference could have changed the probabilities due to the
        butterfly effect, sending me to a different place than in my past life.
      </p>
      <p>I looked back.</p>
      <p>
        Behind me were Director Kim and the herbs I had brought, scattered on
        the ground.
      </p>
      <p>'...Let's go outside for a while.'</p>
      <p>
        I arranged the herbs and pushed them into a corner of the alley,
        covering them with a burlap sack.
      </p>
      <p>Then I stepped out onto the streets.</p>
      <p>A cacophony of sounds hit my ears.</p>
      <p>"The best silk in Yanguo (鸢國)!"</p>
      <p>"Today's goods are scriptures from Shengzhi Country (盛製國)!"</p>
      <p>"If you talk about our pharmacy..."</p>
      <p>It was a bustling area.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, it was a language I was familiar with.</p>
      <p>
        'I was startled for a moment. I thought I had fallen into a completely
        different country where I had to learn a new language...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, it seemed I had landed in Yanguo (鸢國), where I had lived in
        my past life.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Excuse me, I'm a bit confused. What's the name of this place? I've just
        come up from the village and am a bit mixed up about the name here..."
      </p>
      <p>I stopped a passerby to ask the name of this place.</p>
      <p>
        In my past life, Director Kim and I had landed in Yanguo's Lianshan City
        (鍊山城).
      </p>
      <p>A small city located on the border of Yanguo.</p>
      <p>
        The passerby, looking at me as if I were insane, brushed off my hand and
        said,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Are you out of your mind? Asking where this is right in the middle of
        the capital, ugh, bad luck. Meeting a crazy person in broad daylight..."
      </p>
      <p>"The capital..."</p>
      <p>I smiled as I learned the name of this place.</p>
      <p>"Seokyung City (西京城)!"</p>
      <p>In this life, I had arrived in the capital of Yanguo.</p>

      <p>Chapter 94: Lotus (2)</p>
      <p>Rumble...</p>
      <p>I gaze at the dark clouds scattering across the sky.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Even if my lifespan hasn't ended, does the appearance of dark clouds
        mean I am about to receive a new lifespan?’
      </p>
      <p>
        I have never heard of such a phenomenon occurring when a typical
        cultivator reaches the stage of Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>"Is this also related to the Heavenly Rejection?"</p>
      <p>
        It seems like the heavens are trying to interfere with my receiving of
        new lifespan. However, I collect my Formless Sword, smiling wryly.
      </p>
      <p>"Try and stop me as many times as you want."</p>
      <p>
        I will split all the lightning and scatter the clouds, shattering the
        sky if need be.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble...</p>
      <p>
        Feeling the Pure Spiritual Force beginning to flow within my body, I
        stand up.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, is this a cultivator at Qi Building?"</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, who was standing guard beside me, asks with curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>Half a year has passed since we came to Ascension Path..</p>
      <p>
        Under my guidance, Kim Young-hoon has become a peak master, fully mature
        in the realm of Three Flowers Gather at the Summit.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he continues to follow my guidance for another 2 or 3 years, he will
        definitely reach the realm of Five Energies Converging to the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>"Yes. Now, I can live for another 350 years or so."</p>
      <p>"Amazing..."</p>
      <p>He looks at me in awe.</p>
      <p>
        "Just like the other colleagues, everyone seems to possess incredible
        talent."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If I hadn't accidentally obtained the Demon Core of the demon fox, it
        would have taken me decades to reach Qi Building."
      </p>
      <p>I lift the dim, energy-drained Core Formation fox's Demon Core.</p>
      <p>
        Although the fox's Demon Core was of the Core Formation mid-stage, I,
        with only the enlightenment of Qi Building mid-stage, couldn't absorb
        all the energy contained within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        'After all, the absorption rate is low as I had to refine the chaotic
        demonic energy and only absorb the pure part...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, thanks to the fox's Demon Core, I achieved great success
        in the Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation and reached the stage of Qi
        Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        'From now on, I can smoothly progress to Qi Building 2nd Constellation,
        thanks to the insights from the Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea and Yin
        Soul Ghost Incantation I gained in my past life.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding Qi Building 3rd Constellation, I chose the White Tiger
        constellation during this life’s Seven Stars Ritual and obtained the
        White Tiger’s blessing. This will let me make swift progress. This life,
        whether for better or worse, I can reach the 4th Constellation of Qi
        Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If things go well, I might even aim for the Grand Perfection of Qi
        Building.'
      </p>
      <p>Of course, there are things to do before that.</p>
      <p>"Then, Kim Hyung, shall we leave Ascension Path?"</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, are we finally leaving? Great. I can't wait to see people again!"
      </p>
      <p>
        At my words, Kim Young-hoon laughs joyously, excited to leave with me.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>
        We leave Ascension Path and land in the Heaven-Treading Desert. Then we
        speed across the desert using my spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon marvels at the vast landscape of the desert, and I,
        having ascended to Qi Building and acquired an immense amount of Pure
        Spiritual Force, quickly head towards Byeokra.
      </p>
      <p>'Perhaps, it will be good to visit the castle where Yuan Li is.'</p>
      <p>
        Thinking about it, at this point when the Heavenly Beings have not
        ascended for long, he might still be at Core Formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If he's still Core Formation, I might be able to do something now that
        I have ascended to Qi Building and gained Pure Spiritual Force.’
      </p>
      <p>After pondering for a moment, I press my head hard.</p>
      <p>
        I still feel the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner embedded in the core
        of my upper dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        'The Five Elements Blood Curse Banner is, after all, Yuan Li’s curse
        spell. Going there right now might be unpredictable.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It will be better to deal with the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner
        first before seeking him out.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Then, regarding the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner, the best is
        undoubtedly...'
      </p>
      <p>I turn my gaze towards the south, to the Black Wind Sea.</p>
      <p>
        'Heavenly Being’s remnant soul. It would be best to ask Song Jin of
        Black Ghost Valley.'
      </p>
      <p>With that thought, I head towards Byeokra with Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>"Cough, cough..."</p>
      <p>"Damn it, Eun-hyun. Are we there yet?"</p>
      <p>"We're almost there!"</p>
      <p>I frown.</p>
      <p>We encountered a sandstorm and spent several days inside of it.</p>
      <p>
        The sandstorm subsided, but during that time, we had to expend a lot of
        effort and spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, I couldn't generate water at regular intervals using
        spiritual power, leaving Kim Young-hoon and me without water for two
        days now.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Our clothes are tattered, and we have nothing more to eat or drink.
        Damn it...'
      </p>
      <p>But now we are almost at Byeokra.</p>
      <p>Soon, we should see Cheon-saek City.</p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>
        How long have we been pushing through the sandstorm, using spells to
        advance?
      </p>
      <p>Far in the distance, Cheon-saek CIty comes into view.</p>
      <p>"Kim Hyung, there's the city!"</p>
      <p>"Oh, ohh..! Let's hurry and get some water..!"</p>
      <p>
        'Crossing the Heaven-Treading Desert is always challenging, no matter
        how many times I do it...'
      </p>
      <p>
        There are tolerable times, but often when one encounters sandstorms,
        they will arrive utterly exhausted like this.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon and I stop in front of Cheon-saek City, and the guards
        approach us.
      </p>
      <p>"Stop! Who are you?"</p>
      <p>
        Without fuss, I approach and float a few spells above my hand to show
        them.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, uh... A cultivator!?"</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps because Cheon-saek City is famous for its magic artifacts and is
        frequently visited by cultivators looking to purchase them, the locals
        are more aware of cultivators than in other regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm a desert tribe cultivator who has crossed the desert. Please, let
        us enter."
      </p>
      <p>"Which tribe are you from?"</p>
      <p>"The Jurip tribe."</p>
      <p>"Ah, the largest tribe, I see. Understood. Here is your pass."</p>
      <p>
        It’s a knack I have developed from entering and leaving Cheon-saek City
        in several lifetimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there are no cultivators like me in the Jurip tribe, but by
        the time they check, I will likely be gone from this place.
      </p>
      <p>"People, at last..."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, seeing people for the first time in half a year, eagerly
        observes them, unable to understand the language of Byeokra.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only the people, but he also observes the myriad colors of intent
        they emit, which are visible to him at the realm of Three Flowers Gather
        at the Summit.
      </p>
      <p>
        'He'll probably reach the realm of Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin soon.'
      </p>
      <p>
        His enthusiastic observation of colors of emotions suggests he will soon
        reach the realm of awakening consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>'However...'</p>
      <p>
        I inhale the hot air of Cheon-saek City, adjacent to the desert, and
        look around.
      </p>
      <p>"Where can we find some water...?"</p>
      <p>
        It’s been almost 200 years since I last visited Cheon-saek City, so I’m
        a bit hazy about where the well is.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I look around with a burning face, a woman in white approaches me.
      </p>
      <p>"Are you looking for water?"</p>
      <p>Both Kim Young-hoon and I nod vigorously.</p>
      <p>"Follow me, I'll provide you with some water at my shop"</p>
      <p>"Ah, thank you, miss!"</p>
      <p>We follow her.</p>
      <p>
        Her shop, located in a small alley of Cheon-saek City is a magic
        artifact store named 'White Magical Lotus.'
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        She scoops a bucket of water from a wooden barrel in a corner of the
        shop and hands it to me.
      </p>
      <p>"Drink this, and I'll bring another bucket for your companion..."</p>
      <p>
        But before she can fetch another bucket, Kim Young-hoon uses telekinesis
        to draw water towards himself and starts drinking it desperately.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, I'm sorry. My companion is very thirsty..."</p>
      <p>
        "It's alright. It's not unusual for people coming from the desert to be
        like that."
      </p>
      <p>"Then, we'll gladly drink. Thank you."</p>
      <p>I take the bucket she offered and drink the water.</p>
      <p>'I finally feel alive again.'</p>
      <p>
        The water I create with my own spiritual power only quenches the basic
        thirst without bringing the satisfaction of drinking water.
      </p>
      <p>It’s like putting back into my body what I have taken out.</p>
      <p>But drinking real water from outside truly refreshes me.</p>
      <p>
        "Ah... I'm truly grateful, miss. We haven't had water for two days..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "No problem, there's a well in Cheon-saek City just a bit further. But
        judging by your aura, you seem to be a cultivator, right?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ah...!"</p>
      <p>Only then did I realize that she, too, is a cultivator.</p>
      <p>
        Judging by the fluctuation of her spiritual power, she seems to be
        around the level of Qi Refining 11th Star.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, I remember that I have seen her before.</p>
      <p>"Ah, you are..."</p>
      <p>That's right.</p>
      <p>Long ago.</p>
      <p>
        The first time I had escaped from the Heaven-Treading Desert on my own
        and crossed the Heaven-Treading Desert, she was the cultivator who had
        given me water!
      </p>
      <p>"Do you recognize me?"</p>
      <p>A hint of wariness appears in her eyes.</p>
      <p>'She might be misunderstanding something.'</p>
      <p>
        "Please don't misunderstand, miss. I remember your kindness from a long
        time ago when you gave me water in Cheon-saek City."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, I see."</p>
      <p>Her wariness relaxes.</p>
      <p>
        "Descendants from the Gongmyo Clan, Byeok Clan, and Cheongmun Clan often
        bother me so I got a bit startled. I'm relieved to know you're someone
        I've helped before."
      </p>
      <p>"Ha ha, it seems you've done many good deeds before."</p>
      <p>"Isn't it our duty to help those who wander in the desert?"</p>
      <p>"You have a kind heart."</p>
      <p>While talking, I look around the shop.</p>
      <p>'These are magic artifacts...'</p>
      <p>
        Honestly, having the overwhelmingly superior Formless Sword, I have
        never thought of using such artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, looking around the shop, even to the inexperienced eye, there
        are many magic artifacts that look quite useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        'The spiritual power emanating from these artifacts is very stable.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with demon senses, the circulation of spiritual energy in themis
        natural, making them excellent works.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who made these artifacts? Indeed, Cheon-saek City is famous for magic
        artifacts. Even I, with my ignorance, can tell their quality is
        exceptional."
      </p>
      <p>"Aha..."</p>
      <p>At my words, the corners of her mouth lifts slightly.</p>
      <p>'Did she make these?'</p>
      <p>It’s then that I notice the golden intent emanating from her.</p>
      <p>She suppresses a chuckle and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "Your clothes look too tattered. Would you like some unused clothes from
        my place?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, if you could do that, it would be much appreciated..."</p>
      <p>
        "Don't hesitate. These are really just clothes lying around without an
        owner."
      </p>
      <p>
        Saying so, she looks once more at Kim Young-hoon and me, and goes inside
        and returns with two sets of clothes.
      </p>
      <p>They are a bit worn but cleaner than what we’re wearing.</p>
      <p>
        One set is a white robe like the one she is wearing, and the other, a
        yellow robe, the color of the desert.
      </p>
      <p>Both were Daoist robes.</p>
      <p>
        "I brought these clothes that were just lying around in my house, hoping
        they might be of help. Since I offered water, why not clothes as well."
      </p>
      <p>"I'm so grateful I don't know how to thank you."</p>
      <p>"Oh..."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, having finished drinking his water, wipes his mouth and
        comes over. Though he doesn't understand the language, he chooses a robe
        after I explain she is offering clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon picks the yellow robe, and I choose the white one. We
        both go to a secluded corner of the shop to change.
      </p>
      <p>"My, you look much better now."</p>
      <p>
        "Thank you for the clothes. I don't know how to repay this kindness..."
      </p>
      <p>"If you insist, consider it a debt from a Qi Building senior."</p>
      <p>
        She smiles warmly as she accepts my thanks. After promising to repay her
        for the clothes, we leave the White Magical Lotus artifact shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon and I left Cheon-saek City and traveled through various
        cities in Byeokra, paying respects to the Cheongmun Clan from afar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, we reached Yanguo. We briefly visited my disciples after crossing
        the Jin Clan's barrier, and continued south to the Black Wind Sea.
      </p>
      <p>"Should I wait here?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, it won't take long."</p>
      <p>"Alright then. I'll practice my martial arts in the meantime."</p>
      <p>
        I leave Kim Young-hoon and take out the Space-Breaking Bead and
        Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation method given by Seo Hweol.
      </p>
      <p>'What to do...'</p>
      <p>
        In my past life, I had simply thrown the Space-Breaking Beadle into the
        depths of the sea. However, after some thinking, I decide not to discard
        it this time.
      </p>
      <p>'A self-destructing spatial dharma treasure...'</p>
      <p>
        It might be useful later on if I need to perform a mutual destruction
        tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
        'After helping Seo Ran defeat Song Jin's remnant soul and obtaining the
        coordinates of Serving Command Palace...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe this time, I can get a proper Longevity Fruit for Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>I vividly remember the spell Yuan Li used in my last life.</p>
      <p>
        The spell that rapidly grew the Longevity Fruit by extracting life
        force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I don’t know everything about that spell, my solid foundational
        knowledge from my master helped me understand its general principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Perhaps, in this life, if I can find a way to implement that same
        effect without stealing others' life force...'
      </p>
      <p>I might just be able to extend Kim Young-hoon's life.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>I leap into the air, heading towards Seo Ran's residence.</p>
      <p>The story progressed quickly.</p>
      <p>
        After showing Seo Ran my power and the Summoning Wind, Dragon
        Transformation method, I gained his trust. Together, we went to the
        Nether Crossing Ship where Song Jin resided, quietly dismantled the
        formation, and reached the lowest level of the ship.
      </p>
      <p>Song Jin is still a ghost engulfed in dark ghostly energy.</p>
      <p>"Look here, Elder Song Jin of Black Ghost Valley."</p>
      <p>"[Who are you?]"</p>
      <p>He glares at me, scattering his eerie ghostly energy.</p>
      <p>Ignoring him, I respond.</p>
      <p>"Hand over the Nether Crossing Ship."</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        His ghostly energy spreads everywhere, but it seems much weaker compared
        to Yuan Li in my last life.
      </p>
      <p>I grip the Formless Sword facing him.</p>
      <p>
        Somehow, confronting him this time doesn’t shake me as much as before.

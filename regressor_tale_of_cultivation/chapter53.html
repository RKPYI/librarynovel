      <p>Chapter 53: Heavens Above (3)</p>
      <p>"Am I truly mad?"</p>
      <p>
        The numerous hopeful gazes looking up at me from below felt so vivid.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dark clouds in the sky still haven't cleared, but I wasn't in pain
        or disappointed that the ritual failed.
      </p>
      <p>My master climbed up to the altar and patted my shoulder.</p>
      <p>"Let's try again next time," he said.</p>
      <p>The one who believed in me again and again.</p>
      <p>I nodded and smiled back at him.</p>
      <p>
        Even if they are the delusions of a madman, the numerous eyes gazing up
        at me from below the altar seem to me like the stars in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>I haven't met the stars in the sky.</p>
      <p>
        But I have successfully looked back at the stars on the ground with my
        own strength.
      </p>
      <p>"I will try once more."</p>
      <p>
        My master beside me calculated the celestial changes and timings again.
      </p>
      <p>And I recalculated the timings and performed the ritual again.</p>
      <p>
        The heavens blocked me many times, but I also challenged it many times.
      </p>
      <p>
        At one moment, the Kim Young-hoons took their sabers and flew towards
        the heavens!
      </p>
      <p>As if to open the sky for me!</p>
      <p>But still, the sky with clouds are high.</p>
      <p>
        After flying a certain distance, the energy in the sword control was
        exhausted, and they fell back to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>I couldn't directly ascend to the sky during the ritual.</p>
      <p>
        If the ritualier leaves the altar, the ritual would immediately stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, in a fit of passion, I asked the numerous figures for help,
        sending thousands of sword controls towards the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, as before, before reaching the sky, the energy was exhausted, and
        the weapons fell.
      </p>
      <p>
        After several more attempts, I tried concentrating the Gang Qi of
        thousands into a single weapon and sent it flying.
      </p>
      <p>
        It could reach the sky, but by the time it reached the clouds, its
        energy was so depleted it had no more power than ordinary Sword Gang.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that level of power, it did no more than slightly shake the massive
        dark clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shaken clouds attracted even more clouds, thickening and leading to
        another failure.
      </p>
      <p>'Failure, failure, failure...'</p>
      <p>But I smiled.</p>
      <p>The continuous repetition of failure.</p>
      <p>
        But based on those failures, I was constantly moving one step higher.
      </p>
      <p>My altar grew taller day by day, and more figures became tangible.</p>
      <p>Heavens above.</p>
      <p>I will not give up.</p>
      <p>"Heavens above, grant me strength."</p>
      <p>Permit me.</p>
      <p>
        Now, from the altar, nine floors high, I glared at the sky through the
        dark clouds.
      </p>
      <p>The 36th year.</p>
      <p>I gradually got better at sending sword control further.</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to that, when I sent the Sword Gang filled with energy towards
        the sky, the tremor became slightly larger than before.
      </p>
      <p>Yet, still not enough to clear those stubborn clouds.</p>
      <p>I smiled.</p>
      <p>Step by step, like this.</p>
      <p>I will gradually get closer to the heavens.</p>
      <p>The 37th year.</p>
      <p>I realized something had changed in my Dragon Vein Qi Method.</p>
      <p>
        I have successfully materialized five thousand figures and was infusing
        them with Gang Qi.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remembered that it's nonsensical to handle such tremendous internal
        energy with typical martial art’s internal energy methods.
      </p>
      <p>'What's going on? Why...?'</p>
      <p>
        I focused on my Dragon Vein Qi Method for a while and noticed a faint
        pressure and suction forming at the center of my dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pressure and suction further compressed my internal energy,
        increasing its total amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realized this phenomenon was vaguely similar to what is described in
        the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts.
      </p>
      <p>That's right.</p>
      <p>
        I was now entering the peak of Five Energies Converging to the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>'Two lifetimes dedicated, and only now am I reaching this point...'</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon would have already reached the Ultimate Pinnacle with the
        Record of Surpassing Path and Martial Arts by now.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe he even found a clue beyond the Ultimate Pinnacle.</p>
      <p>But I didn't mind.</p>
      <p>'Why...?'</p>
      <p>For some reason, Kim Young-hoon no longer seemed so unreachable.</p>
      <p>The sky didn't seem so high either.</p>
      <p>"...Maybe."</p>
      <p>I suddenly looked at the altar I had built.</p>
      <p>It was now fifteen floors tall.</p>
      <p>About 45 meters.</p>
      <p>An immense height.</p>
      <p>I slowly climbed the altar and unfolded today's ritual.</p>
      <p>Whoooosh!</p>
      <p>Dark clouds rolled in again.</p>
      <p>But this time, I shot my highly compressed Gang Qi towards the sky.</p>
      <p>It seemed to shake the sky a bit more.</p>
      <p>Of course, the sky still didn't show any gaps.</p>
      <p>I grinned, showing my teeth.</p>
      <p>"Heavens above...Do you see?"</p>
      <p>This insignificant bug.</p>
      <p>Is starting to shake the heavens.</p>
      <p>Will you truly not allow me?</p>
      <p>Heavens above.</p>
      <p>Look carefully, for one day you will have to allow me.</p>
      <p>I smiled at my master, who was happy to see the tremor in the sky.</p>
      <p>Time passed again.</p>
      <p>I reflected on my approach to sword control.</p>
      <p>With a clearer mind, I observed the figures gathered around me.</p>
      <p>'How can I send Gang Qi even further?'</p>
      <p>
        There was a time when I was pleased thinking the figures had
        materialized.
      </p>
      <p>
        But upon sober reflection, it wasn't that the figures materialized;
        rather, my skill with sword control had improved through incessant
        practice, increasing the number I could handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, despite the increase in numbers and technique, there was a limit to
        how far I could send sword control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, with the pressure forming at the center of my dantian, my
        internal energy has increased, pushing the limits slightly further.
      </p>
      <p>But that was about it.</p>
      <p>
        The fundamental issue was that beyond a certain distance, controlling
        energy became difficult, and the consumption of internal energy
        increased.
      </p>
      <p>I ask the figures around me,</p>
      <p>"How can I send you further away from me?"</p>
      <p>I question Kim Young-hoon,</p>
      <p>
        "Kim Hyung, you must know. How can I send sword control even further?
        What is the principle behind sending your Gang Qi so far?"
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon just smiled without answering.</p>
      <p>
        I know it too. This Kim Young-hoon is just my imagination, incapable of
        answering what I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, I ponder alone, endlessly.</p>
      <p>How should I do it?</p>
      <p>How can I send my power all the way to the heavens?</p>
      <p>
        I calculate the times while pondering how to send sword control further.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time passed, and my technique improved, but the fundamental problem
        remained unsolved.
      </p>
      <p>However, the figures gradually became more tangible and clear.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, I had this thought.</p>
      <p>'Why did the figures in my mind materialize?'</p>
      <p>''It's because I long for them.''</p>
      <p>'Then, are these now materialized figures fake?'</p>
      <p>''They are my delusions.''</p>
      <p>'If everything is my delusion, are these figures in vain?'</p>
      <p>
        ''They're not in vain. Empowered by delusions and madness, I've reached
        the peak of Five Energies Converging to the Origin.''
      </p>
      <p>'Why did the delusions affect reality?'</p>
      <p>"...It's not that the delusions affected reality."</p>
      <p>I spoke to myself in a question-and-answer format.</p>
      <p>
        "These figures are all connections I've had. My dear ones. Therefore,
        it's my connections that have had an impact."
      </p>
      <p>
        'If my connections have moved to another timeline, aren't they as good
        as non-existent?'
      </p>
      <p>
        "...It's different. Even if the connections have disappeared... I
        remember what everyone left behind. Everyone... is connected here."
      </p>
      <p>'Why are they connected inside you?'</p>
      <p>"That's because..."</p>
      <p>I lift my head.</p>
      <p>The one I was conversing with met my eyes.</p>
      <p>"They make up who I am."</p>
      <p>I had thought of this before.</p>
      <p>Humans are not formed alone.</p>
      <p>
        Humans emerge, grow, and eventually die within the framework of 'us'.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, 'I' am not just made up of myself.</p>
      <p>All the phantoms I had witnessed up to now were, in fact, myself.</p>
      <p>Rustle!</p>
      <p>
        Numerous figures were absorbed into the being before me, who became
        distinctly visible.
      </p>
      <p>It was me.</p>
      <p>Looking at myself, I smiled.</p>
      <p>
        "If everything I thought was separate was actually a part of me,
        wouldn't my martial arts be the same?"
      </p>
      <p>"Right."</p>
      <p>
        I have been lost in madness and delusion, reminiscing about many people
        from my past. Yet, they were all just aspects that constituted me.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the parts that make up me had been maneuvering sword control,
        couldn't I, as my complete self, also maneuver sword control?
      </p>
      <p>"Have you gained enlightenment?"</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>"It's not a split personality, is it?"</p>
      <p>"Haha, it seems not."</p>
      <p>"Then, let's proceed."</p>
      <p>I look at the 'me' before me, smiling, and extend my hand.</p>
      <p>Gang Qi burst forth from my hand.</p>
      <p>The 'me' extends both hands.</p>
      <p>
        The Gang Qi emitted from my hand began to transform within his hands.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, I could see the face of the 'me' before me.</p>
      <p>Numerous faces passed across the face of the 'me'..</p>
      <p>
        Among them were those I killed, those I hated, those I long for, and
        those I cherish dearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were enemies, subordinates, comrades, disciples, and also my
        master.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recall a night when the numerous gazes upon me felt like starlight.
      </p>
      <p>All those countless stars are within me.</p>
      <p>The stars within me converge in my hand.</p>
      <p>
        A whirlpool of Gang Qi converge into a single point, creating a star
        more beautiful than anything else in me's hand
      </p>
      <p>The 'me' hands that star to myself who was watching.</p>
      <p>I smile and accept the star.</p>
      <p>Then, the 'me' is absorbed into the star.</p>
      <p>
        Finally, I understood what Kim Young-hoon meant when he said there was
        'life' within the sphere.
      </p>
      <p>Beyond inputting actions like Sword Control.</p>
      <p>Finally, infusing 'oneself' into it.</p>
      <p>That is...</p>
      <p>"Ultimate Pinnacle!"</p>
      <p>
        Reaching the top of the Pinnacle to create the Ultimate– the Ultimate
        Pinnacle realm!
      </p>
      <p>Both my past and present lives.</p>
      <p>
        Only after dedicating two entire lifetimes, do I step into this realm.
      </p>
      <p>The 40th year of my regression!</p>
      <p>After about a century, finally!</p>
      <p>I stand up from my place.</p>
      <p>Time is approaching again.</p>
      <p>The sun sets, and the stars rise.</p>
      <p>I look at the altar I have built.</p>
      <p>The altar is 60 floors tall.</p>
      <p>It's an altar built over several decades.</p>
      <p>Wasn't it time to reach the heavens?</p>
      <p>Holding a star in my hand, I slowly climb the altar.</p>
      <p>It is fully night and it is time to begin the ritual.</p>
      <p>
        "I, Seo Eun-hyun, a mortal who seeks the path of Immortal Cultivation,
      </p>
      <p>
        Wearing simple clothes and ascending the Seven Stars Ritual Altar, I
        examine the terrain and wish to honor the Seven Stars of the Eastern
        Jia-Yi constellation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I offer to the twenty-eight celestial stars and six dings and six jias
        of heaven and earth, expanding each direction!
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Eastern Jia-Yi (東方甲乙), the Spirit of the Azure Dragon
        (靑帝之神) corresponds to the stars of Horn, Neck, Root, Room, Heart,
        Tail, and Winnowing Basket (角亢氐房心尾箕), forming the image of Azure
        Respect (靑尊) and planting it!
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Southern Bing-Ding (南方丙丁), the Spirit of the Red Vermillion
        (赤帝之神) corresponds to the stars of Well, Ghost, Willow, Star,
        Extended Net, Wing, and Chariot (井鬼柳星張翼軫), forming the image of
        Yang Respect (陽尊) and planting it!
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Western Geng-Xin (西方庚辛), the Spirit of the White Tiger
        (白帝之神) corresponds to the stars of Legs, Bond, Stomach, Hairy Head,
        Net, Beak, Triple Star (奎婁胃昴畢觜參), forming the image of White
        Respect (白尊) and planting it!
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Northern Ren-Gui (北方壬癸), the Spirit of the Black Turtle
        (黑帝之神) corresponds to the stars of Ladle, Ox, Girl, Emptiness,
        Rooftop, Chamber, Wall (斗牛女虛危室壁), forming the image of Yin
        Respect (陰尊) and planting it!!
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Central Wu-Ji (中央戊己), the God of the Yellow Emperor
        (黃靈之神) arranges the Yellow Spirit Flag (黃神旗) according to the
        order of the Five Directions (五方次第), and planting it!
      </p>
      <p>
        After Seo Eun-hyun has trimmed his nails and disheveled his hair
        (剪爪散髮), he humbly offers this prayer!"
      </p>
      <p>I recite the ritual text towards the celestial constellations.</p>
      <p>
        "As a mortal, Seo Eun-hyun, wishing to walk the path of Immortal
        Cultivation,
      </p>
      <p>
        I appeal to the Seven Stars of the Azure Respect constellation, Horn,
        Neck, Root, Room, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket, to graciously
        consider this..."
      </p>
      <p>I gather the spiritual energy of the altar and raise the star.</p>
      <p>"Grant this small star an opportunity! Thus, I pray!</p>
      <p>Heavens above, grant me the spiritual essence of heaven and earth!</p>
      <p>Heavens above, bestow upon me your strength..."</p>
      <p>Thunder rumbles ominously...</p>
      <p>As expected, the heavens are covered with dark clouds.</p>
      <p>I stretch my arms towards the sky.</p>
      <p>
        The star that I infused with my essence, a creation of human endeavor,
        began to ascend towards the heavens.
      </p>
      <p>The energy of the star is not excessively consumed.</p>
      <p>For within it, I had already embedded another aspect of myself.</p>
      <p>
        'Me', perfectly controlling the energy, brings the consumption rate to
        near zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        The star slowly ascends to the heavens and finally touches the clouds.
      </p>
      <p>Heavens above,</p>
      <p>Heavens above,</p>
      <p>Heavens above,</p>
      <p>"Heavens above..."</p>
      <p>I call out, time and time again.</p>
      <p>"Heavens above!!!!!"</p>
      <p>Towards that vast darkness.</p>
      <p>"Release your power to me!!!"</p>
      <p>With that shout, light burst forth.</p>
      <p>The star explodes, piercing through the heavens.</p>
      <p>
        The clouds tear apart in a circle, and starlight from above begin to
        descend.
      </p>
      <p>Sincerity moves the heavens?</p>
      <p>The heavens are not moved.</p>
      <p>They simply exist.</p>
      <p>Then, like a worm tirelessly squirming, I must reach them!</p>
      <p>
        The Gang Sphere I created exploded, and a stream of light surged forth.
      </p>
      <p>Within it, the aspect of myself that I had infused,</p>
      <p>
        All the connections from my past lives looked down at me from the
        heavens.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoons from my past lives, my disciples, my master...</p>
      <p>They all smile at me from the heavens.</p>
      <p>
        Stretching both my arms towards the heavens, I embrace the spiritual
        essence of heaven and earth falling upon me.
      </p>
      <p>
        This moment, practiced and envisioned countless times, I would not let
        slip away.
      </p>
      <p>
        I activate my meridians to absorb the spiritual essence of heaven and
        earth, looking up towards the heavens.
      </p>
      <p>"Heavens above!"</p>
      <p>I have won.</p>
      <p>
        Thus, I completed the Seven Stars Ritual and successfully advanced from
        Qi Refining 7th Star to the 8th Star.

      <p>Chapter 70: Eve (3)</p>
      <p>A form of consciousness perfectly suited for humans.</p>
      <p>
        "Is it merely a warning about the demon beast method I'm practicing? Or
        is it some kind of conundrum you've discovered, Kim Hyung?"
      </p>
      <p>It was unlikely he brought this up without reason.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon gaze at me intently, then seem to ponder for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>"...It's both."</p>
      <p>
        "If it's both, have you already found the foundation for the next realm,
        Kim Hyung?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha, what do you think is the reason I came to you and poured out my
        emotions? If I had found the clue to the next realm through that, I
        would have told you long ago."
      </p>
      <p>He adjusts his posture with a self-mocking smile.</p>
      <p>'Anyway, it seems he has found something.'</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon moves in front of a massive rock and takes a ready
        stance, then slowly reaches out his hand.
      </p>
      <p>A hand without any internal energy.</p>
      <p>
        No matter how slow, to strike a rock with such a hand looks like an
        action not caring about shattering the hand!
      </p>
      <p>But then, at that moment.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>"....!"</p>
      <p>My eyes widen as I closely observe Kim Young-hoon's fist.</p>
      <p>No, his 'consciousness.'</p>
      <p>
        His consciousness fluctuates, and suddenly, the area around Kim
        Young-hoon's fist compresses into the same shape as his 'fist.'
      </p>
      <p>It’s almost like...</p>
      <p>'Demon beast methods...!?'</p>
      <p>
        There is a resemblance to the demon beast methods that altered the
        domain of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's fist finally makes contact with the rock.</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>"....!!"</p>
      <p>Like burrowing into tofu.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's fist digs into the rock, burying up to his forearm.
      </p>
      <p>'He didn't use internal energy!?'</p>
      <p>
        I rub my eyes and look again, but there is no internal energy in Kim
        Young-hoon's arm.
      </p>
      <p>"Look."</p>
      <p>Craaack</p>
      <p>Sizzzz</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon pulls his arm out of the rock and shows it to me.</p>
      <p>
        Observing his arm, I understand how he burrowed into the rock without
        using internal energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        'It's not internal energy, but the basic Qi naturally flowing within the
        body activated to the extreme! When the consciousness domain momentarily
        aligns with the fist, the basic energy of the fist is maximally
        activated...!'
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh..</p>
      <p>
        After showing me his arm for a while, he relaxes his focus and returns
        the consciousness, previously compressed into a fist shape, back to its
        original form.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I can't maintain it for long as it's a recent discovery. Unlike your
        Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation, it's not about naturally altering
        the consciousness to fit the configuration. I just forcibly compressed
        the area of consciousness."
      </p>
      <p>I listen to him and ask.</p>
      <p>
        "So, a form of consciousness suitable for humans means, like you just
        demonstrated, changing the consciousness domain into a human form?"
      </p>
      <p>That is my conjecture based on what I had just seen.</p>
      <p>However, Kim Young-hoon's expression becomes strange.</p>
      <p>"It's... ambiguous. Perhaps subtle..."</p>
      <p>"Yes?"</p>
      <p>
        "I contemplated over hundreds, thousands of false paths laid before me.
        Among them, I found the method of compressing consciousness into a human
        form and strengthening the physical energy... I intuitively knew that it
        was one of the 'real paths.'"
      </p>
      <p>"Then, what's the problem?"</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure if the path I found truly belongs to martial arts."</p>
      <p>"...?"</p>
      <p>What does he mean by that?</p>
      <p>
        "Something about it subtly overlaps with the realm of martial arts. But,
        intuitively, I feel that following that path might eventually lead to a
        realm utterly unrelated to martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I also learned it with the intention of informing you, as
        it's clear that the stage you've reached with your demon beast method is
        certainly misguided."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        "By the way, is there no way to acquire other demon beast methods
        besides that Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, it would be difficult to find others."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon sighs in frustration.</p>
      <p>"It would be nice to have more reference material..."</p>
      <p>
        "You just said that changing the consciousness domain doesn't belong to
        the realm of martial arts, didn't you?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's true, but I've only researched the one Summoning Wind, Dragon
        Transformation you gave me. Without anything to compare and contrast,
        it's hard to reduce trial and error. If I could obtain other demon beast
        methods for research, I'd have much more data."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm... I'll try to find them, but I can't make any promises."</p>
      <p>"That's enough for me."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon nods and then we exchange a discussion about
        consciousness domains. After a while, we achieve satisfactory results.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gained a clue about the fifth Gang Sphere, and Kim Young-hoon attained
        enlightenment about the differences and similarities between cultivation
        methods, demon beast methods, and martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>We sat and discussed for several hours before parting ways.</p>
      <p>
        I wanted to spar with Kim Young-hoon after not seeing him for so long,
        but it felt like he was avoiding it due to some concerns he had.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that day, Kim Young-hoon started visiting me more frequently,
        especially to hear my insights into cultivation methods and demon beast
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is unparalleled in martial arts, but when it comes to cultivation
        methods, due to his perhaps lesser talent, there was no change in his
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        His focus was more on applying the insights from cultivation methods to
        martial arts to break through to the next realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the insights of 'Understanding before Breakthrough,' I taught
        him cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon explained his understanding of the Gang Sphere in a way
        that I could easily understand.
      </p>
      <p>Years passed like this.</p>
      <p>Swoosh.</p>
      <p>The valley around me.</p>
      <p>
        The water from the valley flows towards me, swirling around me as the
        center.
      </p>
      <p>Then, suddenly.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Like an explosion of water, it sprays apart and then gathers around me
        again, forming a large water droplet.
      </p>
      <p>Within that water spell, I slowly open my eyes.</p>
      <p>
        I am underwater, but the water energy connects with me, allowing me to
        breathe freely.
      </p>
      <p>Bubbling.</p>
      <p>
        After staying in the water for a while, I form a hand seal and disperse
        the water droplet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Water Surpassing Path to Cultivation has now reached the 9th Star of
        the Qi Refining stage, the phase of the Five Elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the 9th Star of Qi Refining, one can fully manifest the elements of
        the learned spell and use the corresponding attributes.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover,</p>
      <p>Swoosh.</p>
      <p>
        "The speed of spiritual energy recovery has increased significantly."
      </p>
      <p>
        'I wonder how much the recovery speed of spiritual energy will increase
        if I fully understand both the Earth and Water Surpassing Paths to
        Cultivation.'
      </p>
      <p>It definitely won't be a small increase.</p>
      <p>
        'How much help will it be to master two methods of different
        attributes...'
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, aside from being able to attempt Qi Building more frequently due
        to the faster recovery of spiritual energy, there are no other
        noticeable benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Once I fully understand the methods, I'll see. After all, in the Water
        Surpassing Path, only the stages of Four Images, Three Talents, Yin-Yang
        Unity, Unified Origin, and Infinite Spiritual Cloud are left. But since
        I've already cleared the spiritual meridians with the Earth Surpassing
        Path, all that's left is to accumulate more spiritual energy.'
      </p>
      <p>While gathering my spiritual energy, it’s time to think.</p>
      <p>Thud, thud.</p>
      <p>Someone approaches from afar.</p>
      <p>'By the sound of the footsteps, it's not Kim Young-hoon.'</p>
      <p>They isn't someone skilled in martial arts.</p>
      <p>The strength of the footsteps suggest a young person.</p>
      <p>But they don't seem afraid of venturing deep into the mountains.</p>
      <p>The weight of the footsteps indicate they aren't a child either.</p>
      <p>
        'Not a martial artist, not a mountain-wise hermit, not an ignorant
        child, and no fear in the footsteps?'
      </p>
      <p>Either a high official or cultivator.</p>
      <p>One of the two.</p>
      <p>'A cultivator, I guess.'</p>
      <p>A high official wouldn't come alone.</p>
      <p>They would bring dozens of attendants.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I use the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts
        to hide my presence .
      </p>
      <p>Soon after.</p>
      <p>A young cultivator in red robes emerges from the bushes.</p>
      <p>"Hmm, this is where that mortal often came..."</p>
      <p>A cultivator from the Jin Clan.</p>
      <p>
        It seems he had followed Kim Young-hoon and found this place where he
        often came.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I don't want to get involved in trouble, so I'll have to move and
        contact Kim Hyung later.'
      </p>
      <p>I assess his strength while hidden..</p>
      <p>
        Judging by the size of his consciousness domain and spiritual aura, he
        is also a Qi Refining 14th Star cultivator, likely one of the
        influential late-stage cultivators of the Jin Clan.
      </p>
      <p>'I seem to have seen him once or twice in passing.'</p>
      <p>I was about to leave him be when he suddenly started.</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, that damned mortal. How dare a mortal become an external elder
        with some strange power? Ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>That damned guy, I’ll make him suffer a lot..!"</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan's cultivator begins throwing spirit stones around, setting
        up a formation.
      </p>
      <p>'Is he setting a trap?'</p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately for him, Kim Young-hoon has already awakened demon senses
        and could see the flow of heaven and earth spiritual energy, so it
        probably wouldn't work on him.
      </p>
      <p>I continue to observe what he is up to.</p>
      <p>Click, click, click!</p>
      <p>He starts forming hand seals.</p>
      <p>With each seal, the fire energy starts to rise around him.</p>
      <p>
        While observing the changes in his energy, I am startled and step back.
      </p>
      <p>"Fire Embryo Formation!"</p>
      <p>Brrrrrrr</p>
      <p>
        The surrounding area fills with the energy of flames, covering a radius
        of 3 zhang with fire.
      </p>
      <p>"Come out, whoever is hiding!"</p>
      <p>'Ah, I see.'</p>
      <p>
        It seems my remaining energy from the water element spell I used before
        hiding hadn't completely dissipated.
      </p>
      <p>He must have sensed someone hiding nearby based on that.</p>
      <p>
        "Who are you! Come out now! What's your relationship with that mortal,
        the external elder of the Jin clan?"
      </p>
      <p>
        After a moment of consideration, I release my concealment and appear in
        front of him.
      </p>
      <p>He is quite startled when I appear out of nowhere like a ghost.</p>
      <p>"Who are you?"</p>
      <p>
        He cautiously sizes me up, feeling the pressure of my consciousness and
        spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>'How should I introduce myself...'</p>
      <p>How to do this without causing harm to Kim Young-hoon?</p>
      <p>I think for a moment and come up with a suitable excuse.</p>
      <p>
        "I am a disciple who learned techniques from Kim Young-hoon, the
        external elder of your Jin Clan, before he joined the clan. Recently, we
        have been exchanging insights.
      </p>
      <p>What are you trying to do here?"</p>
      <p>
        "Hmph, the place you are in now is the territory of my Jin Clan! Have
        you received permission from my Jin Clan to train here?"
      </p>
      <p>'Annoying, even though it's not really their territory.'</p>
      <p>I decide not to provoke him unnecessarily.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the Jin Clan recently usurped the imperial throne and
        established themselves in this area. There's no need to create a
        conflict with the Jin Clan, especially now when they are already so
        arrogant.
      </p>
      <p>Especially if Kim Young-hoon is taking refuge with the Jin Clan.</p>
      <p>I interrupt him and make a proposal.</p>
      <p>"Since we've met here, how about a bet?</p>
      <p>If you win, I'll teach you this technique."</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        As I manifest a Gang Sphere from my Inner Core, the cultivator flinches
        and steps back.
      </p>
      <p>But at the same time, greed appears in his eyes.</p>
      <p>"What kind of bet...? Wait, what happens if I lose?"</p>
      <p>
        He asks politely, bowing slightly, perhaps recognizing me as a Qi
        Building level figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you lose, keep it a secret that I train in this vicinity from the
        Jin Clan. Also, Kim Young-hoon is both my teacher and friend, so stop
        any intentions of bothering him.
      </p>
      <p>He’s an external elder of your clan, isn’t he?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, I understand."</p>
      <p>
        "The terms of the bet are simple. I will only use pure Qi Refining level
        spells to fight you. I won't use any magic artifacts, while you can use
        all your magic artifacts and spells to defeat me."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, alright."</p>
      <p>Sizzzzzz</p>
      <p>
        As soon as I finish speaking, the formation he had set up begins to
        react.
      </p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>
        I also activate the Earth Surpassing Path and spread my own formation
        around me.
      </p>
      <p>'A pure fight as a Qi Refining cultivator, almost a first for me.'</p>
      <p>Until now, I had mostly used cultivation methods as a support.</p>
      <p>
        Because the Ultimate Pinnacle is almost at the Qi Building level, the Qi
        Refining spells are relatively weak in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially after reaching the 14th Star of Qi Refining, I have hardly
        fought against any cultivators of the same level.
      </p>
      <p>'Well, let's see how much power I can use.'</p>
      <p>At the 14th Star of Qi Refining,</p>
      <p>
        When reaching the Infinite Spiritual Cloud realm, a spiritual cloud
        forms in the dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compressing this spiritual cloud into a spiritual star signifies
        successful Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the spiritual cloud can also be accumulated and utilized in combat.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Almost simultaneously, both of us breathe out.</p>
      <p>
        From his dantian, a hot red spiritual cloud containing fire energy, and
        from mine, a heavy yellow-brown spiritual cloud containing earth energy,
        emerges.
      </p>
      <p>Clouds cover the surroundings.</p>
      <p>The hot red and yellow-brown clouds collide.</p>
      <p>Kuaaang!</p>
      <p>
        Within the range of the clouds, the formations become more active, and
        several spells emerge above them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Heavenly Leader (天魁), Heavenly Gang (天罡), Heavenly Machine (天機),
        Heavenly Leisure (天閒), Heavenly Bravery (天勇).."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Earth Strength (地强), Earth Darkness (地暗), Earth Support (地輔),
        Earth Union (地會).."
      </p>
      <p>
        Earth and Fire spells begin to condense in the clouds and collide
        wildly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of us are at a level where we can use spells with just
        incantations, omitting the hand seals and detailed chants.
      </p>
      <p>
        We clash using the Seventy-Two Earthly Sha True Words and the Thirty-Six
        Heavenly Gang Method Decrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amidst the collision of flames and clods of earth between the two
        clouds, a thunderous explosion resounds.
      </p>
      <p>"Flame (炎), Explosion (爆), Brilliant (翡)!"</p>
      <p>
        He begins to form hand seals and starts to condense his unique innate
        ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the basic spells learned from the Earth Surpassing Path, it seems
        the Jin Clan's true essence cultivation methods have their unique innate
        abilities.
      </p>
      <p>Flames gather into the shape of a bird.</p>
      <p>Fluttering and fluttering!</p>
      <p>
        The fire-formed bird scatters sparks in all directions and then, like
        lightning, darts towards me.
      </p>
      <p>'So fast!'</p>
      <p>
        Judging by the structure of the spell, it’s the type that will explode
        upon direct impact.
      </p>
      <p>"Earth Prison (地囚)!"</p>
      <p>
        I quickly form hand seals to create a prison of earth, trapping the
        fire-formed bird inside.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The bird explodes within the prison, but the prison is only slightly
        charred and not destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>"How could... Basic spells counter unique innate abilities...!"</p>
      <p>
        "If you can draw out the true power of a spell, it's entirely possible."
      </p>
      <p>I continue to use spells while speaking calmly.</p>
      <p>
        "One who has reached a realm through Understanding before Breakthrough
        can dominate others of the same level...!"
      </p>
      <p>"Argh... You said I could use magic artifacts!"</p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivator pulls out a red magic artifact emitting flames
        from his storage device.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feathers on the tool flutter in his formation, akin to blazing
        flames.
      </p>
      <p>"Twelve Flame Explosive Birds!"</p>
      <p>Fwoosh!</p>
      <p>Flames condense, and twelve firebirds form in the air.</p>
      <p>"Attack!"</p>
      <p>The birds fly in from twelve directions.</p>
      <p>However, I start forming hand seals even faster.</p>
      <p>
        Inside the yellow-brown cloud, spells begin to condense at an even
        faster rate.
      </p>
      <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>
      <p>
        Basic spells fly out, shattering his unique innate abilities, and new
        basic spells begin to condense continuously.
      </p>
      <p>"What, how can you condense spells faster than before..!"</p>
      <p>
        I formed hand seals until my hands bled and my fingerprints disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>This isn't enough to tire me out!</p>
      <p>The yellow-brown cloud begins to engulf the red cloud.</p>
      <p>"Ugh!"</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivator continues to swing his magic artifact, and as he
        starts to lose, he even takes out talismans to throw.
      </p>
      <p>
        I match him equally with only basic spells, without using any magic
        artifacts or unique innate abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the battle drags on, my victory is assured due to my overflowing
        spiritual power, as I wasn't using any magic artifacts or powerful
        innate abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Realizing this, he begins to increase his spiritual power even more,
        opting for a short battle.
      </p>
      <p>Crack-</p>
      <p>He bites his finger, drawing blood.</p>
      <p>
        The red blood droplets rise into the air and soak into his magic
        artifact.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>His magic artifact blazes even redder, emitting intense heat.</p>
      <p>"Piercing Heat (穿熱), Explosive Brilliance (翡爆)!"</p>
      <p>
        The heat breaks through limits, and a giant firebird flaps its wings
        like a phoenix.
      </p>
      <p>"Not bad."</p>
      <p>
        Is this the strength of a typical Grand Perfection Qi Refining
        cultivator?
      </p>
      <p>"Thanks, now I know my own strength."</p>
      <p>"What..?"</p>
      <p>I begin forming different hand seals than before.</p>
      <p>"Heavenly Explosion (天暴)!"</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, the water in the valley behind him begins to churn.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>A giant wave rises and engulfs him from behind.</p>
      <p>
        His formation, clouds, and entire array of innate spells are enveloped
        by the wave, and the moisture evaporates, spreading steam everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>A sudden sneak attack!</p>
      <p>
        It’s an attack of the 9th Star Qi Refining level, so it doesn’t
        significantly affect his 14th Star Qi Refining formation.
      </p>
      <p>However, his prepared spell is significantly weakened.</p>
      <p>I seize the opportunity, forming sixteen hand seals in an instant.</p>
      <p>Sixteen spells condense and fly towards him.</p>
      <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>Splash!</p>
      <p>"Ugh..."</p>
      <p>
        His formation and clouds are completely shattered, and the Jin Clan
        cultivator is swept into the valley’s, submerged under water.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Cough! Huff.. How, how did you... How did you reach the 14th Star of Qi
        Refining and master another element method, and even high-level Qi
        Refining techniques, how...!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I won the bet, so please keep my training here a secret as promised."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivator, struggling in the valley, climbs onto a nearby
        rock and looks up at me incredulously.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How... No, why? Why bother mastering two element methods..? At the 14th
        Star, you should be secluded, preparing for Qi Building..."
      </p>
      <p>"Preparing for Qi Building."</p>
      <p>I chuckle.</p>
      <p>"I've been doing that consistently. For decades, continuously."</p>
      <p>The smile on my lips is bitter.</p>
      <p>
        "But I couldn't reach Qi Building, so I sought other methods by
        mastering different elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't it that one without talent must try everything possible, within
        the bounds of not losing one's way, to reach a higher realm?"
      </p>
      <p>I am actually thankful to this Jin Clan cultivator.</p>
      <p>
        During our intense battle, I felt my spiritual power rapidly depleting
        and then recovering.
      </p>
      <p>Through him, I have an idea.</p>
      <p>
        'If practicing two element methods has already sped up my recovery rate
        to this point, what if I fully master them?'
      </p>
      <p>What if not just two, but three elements? Or even four?</p>
      <p>No, what about all five elements?</p>
      <p>An absurd and foolish endeavor no one has tried.</p>
      <p>It would take a lifetime just to fully master them.</p>
      <p>But,</p>
      <p>
        'I have gained insight from Understanding before Breakthrough, and I
        have enough time.'
      </p>
      <p>If I fully master all five elemental methods,</p>
      <p>How fast will my recovery rate become?</p>
      <p>
        Could I attempt Qi Building dozens of times a day with that recovery
        rate?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivator, apologizing for daring to disturb me, swears on
        his clan's honor to keep today's events a secret and quickly flees into
        the distance.
      </p>
      <p>'I've decided.'</p>
      <p>
        For a dullard to reach a higher realm, they must put in many times the
        effort of a genius.
      </p>
      <p>So, why not just put in that much effort?</p>
      <p>
        Even if I attain enlightenment in the morning and die in the evening,
        it's worth it.
      </p>
      <p>"I will fully master the Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation..!"</p>
      <p>
        This had been brewing in my mind, and after today's duel with the Jin
        Clan cultivator, it burst forth.
      </p>
      <p>I am resolved to complete all Five Elements to reach Qi Building.</p>

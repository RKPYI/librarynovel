      <p>Chapter 159: Master's Grace (5)</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Enveloped in a sea of white clouds, a group of cultivators soared
        through the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wrapped in the aura of the Flying Escape Technique, emitting dull
        radiance, they flew far into the distance. Among them were disciples of
        the First-Cloud and a few from the Second-Cloud from the Azure Heaven
        Creation Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leading the group are two First-Cloud disciples, with five Second-Cloud
        disciples following behind. At the center of the group flies Seo
        Eun-hyun and Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>
        "When will we arrive? It feels like we've been flying for almost half a
        day..."
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok asked.</p>
      <p>A First-Cloud disciple at the forefront shouts back</p>
      <p>"Just a bit more patience, we're almost there."</p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, I'm curious, though. Have the senior brothers visited this place
        before?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, it's our first time too. Azure Cold Island is vast, and it took
        us a while to get used to it. As for other Human Race Sky Islands, we've
        only visited a few islands nearby."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm looking forward to it. The Human Race Grand Alliance headquarters,
        it's sort of like a capital, right?"
      </p>
      <p>"I suppose so."</p>
      <p>As they chatter and fly through the clouds.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>"Oh, there it is..."</p>
      <p>
        As the clouds part a Sky Island far larger than any they had seen before
        appears before them. At first glance, it’s about twenty times the size
        of Azure Cold Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        An overwhelmingly thick and vast barrier surrounds it, with heaven and
        earth spiritual energy enveloping the entire land.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Human Race Grand Alliance's headquarters, Heavenly Human
        Island...!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Awe-struck, the disciples of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect gape at the
        overwhelming sight of Heavenly Human Island.
      </p>
      <p>"Al-alright, everyone, let's go in."</p>
      <p>
        The highest-ranking First-Cloud disciple, holding an identity plaque
        proving their affiliation with Azure Cold Island, flies towards Heavenly
        Human Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they approach the barrier of Heavenly Human Island, the identity
        plaque glows, opening a small hole in the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering the Island, Oh Hyun-seok marvels at the dense spiritual energy
        inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I know Azure Cold Island is rich in spiritual energy, but this is
        almost two to three times denser."
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, actually, it's more like five or six times denser. The spiritual
        energy you felt on Azure Cold Island was from one of the most potent
        spiritual veins."
      </p>
      <p>
        The group's leader, a First-Cloud disciple named Cheongmun Gyu, inhales
        the spiritual energy of Heavenly Human Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Let's find the teleportation array that can take us near the Light
        Spirit Pond."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes!"</p>
      <p>
        At the Human Race Grand Alliance's main base, Heavenly Human Island, one
        can find teleportation arrays linking to other racial territories within
        the alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although only arrays to races with friendly relations with the Human
        Race are activated, most races near the Light Spirit Pond benefited from
        trade with the Human Race, so there are no issues.
      </p>
      <p>"Light Spirit Pond's water!"</p>
      <p>"Light Spirit Sacred Water?"</p>
      <p>"Light Spirit Sacred Water has come in!"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok looks around and comments.</p>
      <p>"Seems like the water from Light Spirit Pond is quite popular."</p>
      <p>"Appears so...."</p>
      <p>
        The First-Cloud disciples are equally puzzled, exploring various parts
        of Heavenly Human Island.
      </p>
      <p>Then, Seo Eun-hyun calmly explains.</p>
      <p>
        "The water from Light Spirit Pond, also known as Light Spirit Sacred
        Water, significantly boosts vitality when consumed. It's sought after as
        a reserve life source, allowing one to exhibit undying supernatural
        powers for a moment. When placed inside a puppet and specially
        processed, the puppet can recover from damage on its own, making it a
        coveted treasure among puppet masters that make their eyes burst from
        their heads."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, Junior Seo, how do you know this?"</p>
      <p>
        "I just heard some rumors. But, the presence of Light Spirit Sacred
        Water nearby suggests there's a teleportation array to Light Spirit Pond
        close by."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun points to a location.</p>
      <p>
        "Many people's intents are moving towards that spot. It must be the
        teleportation array. Let's go."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, o-okay."</p>
      <p>
        Guided by Seo Eun-hyun, the group is able to arrive in front of a
        gigantic tower.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the bottom of the tower, which is built with a total of five floors,
        numerous people are lined up waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This seems to be the Light Spirit Pond teleportation array. Now that
        we've found the teleportation array, let's go to the headquarters of the
        Human Race Grand Alliance, finish registering for the Mad Lord scouting
        mission, then use the teleportation array."
      </p>
      <p>
        Led by Cheongmun Gyu, they head to the alliance's headquarters in the
        center of Heavenly Human Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        While looking around, Oh Hyun-seok notices Seo Eun-hyun also looking
        around here and there.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, Eun-hyun, you find this place interesting too?"</p>
      <p>
        Amazed at seeing Seo Eun-hyun's human-like behavior after a long time,
        Oh Hyun-seok looks at him with wonder.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun, while looking around, replies.</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, well, I suppose so. Since it's my first time here, observing will
        make it easier when I come again in the future."
      </p>
      <p>"Ha, you're thorough."</p>
      <p>Laughing, Oh Hyun-seok suddenly feels a chill run down his spine.</p>
      <p>'What's that?'</p>
      <p>Startled!</p>
      <p>It wasn't just Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>
        The entire expedition team that came with him, as well as other
        cultivators passing by on Heavenly Human Island, all suddenly stop in
        their tracks and look up at the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after, the chilling sensation that had been swirling around them
        disappears.
      </p>
      <p>"What was that?"</p>
      <p>
        At the sudden eerie sensation, one of the Second-Cloud disciples from
        Azure Heaven Creation Sect asked those around him.
      </p>
      <p>Then, Seo Eun-hyun, with a stern face answers.</p>
      <p>
        "What we just experienced was the presence of an Integration stage Grand
        Cultivator. An Integration stage Grand Cultivator's consciousness is
        overwhelmingly larger than ours. They could have easily hid their
        presence from us... It seems they chose not to take such consideration
        and briefly observed this area with their consciousness."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing Seo Eun-hyun's words, one of the Core Formation cultivators
        passing by nods grimly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Indeed, in recent decades, Grand Cultivators of various races have been
        flocking to the vicinity of Heavenly Human Island, where the Human Race
        Grand Alliance is located, to search for something. It's become so
        common now that everyone just accepts it as normal."
      </p>
      <p>"…I see, thank you for letting us know."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun expressed his gratitude to the Core Formation cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>"This is troubling. It's hard to say whether this is good or bad…"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Gyu, with a troubled look, heads into the grand palace of the
        alliance's headquarters, and soon after, comes out with a mission
        confirmation plaque.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, for now it’s settled. We've properly confirmed our mission to
        scout the Mad Lord, so we can use the teleportation array."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, they boarded the teleportation array heading near the Light Spirit
        Pond.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok looks around.</p>
      <p>"Is this place near the Light Spirit Pond?"</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy around them is refreshingly stimulating to life
        force.
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok clenches his fist.</p>
      <p>
        'Somehow, I feel like training here might make it easier to break
        through my current realm.'
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Gyu looks around around at the members and says,</p>
      <p>
        "Remember, we didn't come to the Light Spirit Pond area for leisure. We
        have to observe the Mad Lord, who is said to have been expanding his
        conquests near this area, for the next 5 years. Any questions?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have a question. I heard that elixirs that can help me break through
        my cultivation are grown near the Light Spirit Pond. Would it be
        permissible to gather some to reduce future risks during our mission?"
      </p>
      <p>At Seo Eun-hyun's question, others also show interest.</p>
      <p>
        "It's fine. But make sure not to provoke the local races, and try to
        exchange through trade as much as possible."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, thank you!"</p>
      <p>
        "You all seem excited about getting Light Spirit Sacred Water, but let
        me remind you again, don't steal or coerce to obtain resources. Got it?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes!"</p>
      <p>
        "Then, I'll give everyone about a day to explore the area near the Light
        Spirit Pond."
      </p>
      <p>
        With that, Seo Eun-hyun and the rest of the expedition members dispersed
        in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok wonders.</p>
      <p>'Is Light Spirit Sacred Water really that amazing?'</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>Days passed.</p>
      <p>Led by Cheongmun Gyu, the expedition arrived at a certain location.</p>
      <p>"This is…"</p>
      <p>There are traces of a massive battle.</p>
      <p>
        The ground was overturned, and several giant valleys had formed, with
        remnants and pieces that look like puppet parts scattered around.
      </p>
      <p>"This was one of the territories of the Cold Spirit Race."</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun, with a slight frown, looks around.</p>
      <p>"The Mad Lord passed through here."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Gyu frowns at the sight, saying.</p>
      <p>
        "Mad Lord, this lunatic. The scale of his madness has grown even larger
        than when he was in the lower realm."
      </p>
      <p>
        "…Let's move towards where we can see the Mad Lord's Wonderfully
        Mysterious Fortress."
      </p>
      <p>"…Alright."</p>
      <p>They followed the trail of destruction.</p>
      <p>After a while, Cheongmun Gyu stopped in mid-air.</p>
      <p>A vast primeval forest near the Light Spirit Pond!</p>
      <p>
        At the edge of that primeval forest, far away at the end of a mountain
        range, a small dot is visible.
      </p>
      <p>"There it is. The Mad Lord's Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress."</p>
      <p>At Cheongmun Gyu's words, Oh Hyun-seok frowns.</p>
      <p>"That speck over there, you mean?"</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>
        "…Isn't that too far? We were told to scout, but with this distance… I'm
        not sure if looking is even possible…"
      </p>
      <p>
        "What are you talking about? Don't underestimate that madman's
        capabilities. This distance is just right. Any closer and we'd be
        captured and transformed by that lunatic."
      </p>
      <p>Shiver!</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps due to bad memories of the Mad Lord, Cheongmun Gyu shuddered and
        shook his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Did he say there was a time when he narrowly escaped after being
        captured by the Mad Lord in the lower realm?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok recalls the story Cheongmun Gyu had told about his
        entanglement with the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, he frowns.</p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, having to observe the Mad Lord here for five years is a bit
        worrying."
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's there to worry about? For cultivators, five years pass in the
        blink of an eye. It seems junior is not yet used to the sense of time
        cultivators have, having not practiced the cultivation methods for
        long."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Gyu chuckles and pats Oh Hyun-seok's back.</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok sighs softly and settles down atop a tree in the
        surrounding forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Well, worrying about it here won't do any good. I should continue my
        training as usual. I should talk to Seo Eun-hyun too, see if we can find
        Team leader Kim if we get a chance.'
      </p>
      <p>It was then, as he crossed his legs in meditation.</p>
      <p>'...?'</p>
      <p>
        Below the tree, Seo Eun-hyun is placing his hands on the ground, doing
        something.
      </p>
      <p>"Hey, Eun-hyun. What are you doing?"</p>
      <p>At Oh Hyun-seok's call, Seo Eun-hyun replies calmly.</p>
      <p>
        "I'm about to draw a circuit that leads to the Wonderfully Mysterious
        Fortress from underneath the ground."
      </p>
      <p>"What?"</p>
      <p>
        "If my circuit reaches the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, we can know
        about Kim Yeon's situation without attracting the attention of the
        Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress or the Mad Lord. Please trust me on
        this."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, well… Of course, I trust you. Why even say that?"</p>
      <p>
        "…Thank you. Please don't mention this to Cheongmun Gyu and the senior
        brothers. They might not believe it."
      </p>
      <p>"Sure, I understand."</p>
      <p>He nods and looks at Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>"There must be a way."</p>
      <p>He trusts Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>
        Even though he had been acting strange lately, he is still the person
        who was once his junior at work.
      </p>
      <p>Trusting someone who was once a junior isn't a big deal for him.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Five years flew by in an instant.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Light swirls around Oh Hyun-seok, being absorbed into his body.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>His energy soars to its peak.</p>
      <p>"Core Formation Grand Perfection, Celestial Dominion!"</p>
      <p>Finally, he has reached the end of Core Formation!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok stands up, his eyes shining.</p>
      <p>‘It's not just about reaching the peak’</p>
      <p>
        It feels as if given the right opportunity, he can reach the Nascent
        Soul stage in no time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The land near Light Spirit Pond always flows with a peculiar vitality,
        which greatly aided Oh Hyun-seok's body refining method, speeding up his
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>"Finally…"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok smiles contentedly.</p>
      <p>
        "Finally, I've caught up to Seo Eun-hyun in terms of cultivation stage."
      </p>
      <p>Indeed.</p>
      <p>
        While Seo Eun-hyun had reached the pinnacle of Core Formation, the
        Celestial Dominion, over the past five years, he hadn't achieved
        enlightenment or advanced to the Nascent Soul stage.
      </p>
      <p>He hasn't moved beyond the Grand Perfection of Core Formation.</p>
      <p>
        Thus, Oh Hyun-seok finally caught up to Seo Eun-hyun in terms of
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Well, even if we're equal in cultivation, it doesn't necessarily mean I
        can win in a fight…’
      </p>
      <p>Rumble...</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok somehow feels that, at this moment, he can have a proper
        spar with Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Now that our mission period is coming to an end, I should spar with him
        and ask what we'll do about Team Leader Kim.’
      </p>
      <p>
        He uses the Flying Escape Technique to approach Seo Eun-hyun, who is
        touching the ground with his eyes closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Seo Eun-hyun! Have you found a way to contact Team Leader Kim Yeon
        yet?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "No. After making contact with the circuits in the Wonderfully
        Mysterious Fortress, it took quite some time to steal one ten-thousandth
        of the control from the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress. In a few days,
        we'll be able to contact Chief Kim Yeon."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is that so? So, in a few days, our purpose for coming here will nearly
        be achieved."
      </p>
      <p>"That seems to be the case"</p>
      <p>"Then, we'll be leaving soon after that."</p>
      <p>At Oh Hyun-seok's words, Seo Eun-hyun looks at him and replies.</p>
      <p>"You're suggesting a spar, aren't you?"</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>
        "…I'm sorry, but prioritizing finding out Kim Yeon’s situation as soon
        as possible is more imp-"
      </p>
      <p>Before Seo Eun-hyun can finish speaking,</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok launches a punch towards Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A blue flash shot towards Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun quickly dodged and glared at Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>"What are you doing… Ah, so you came with that resolve?"</p>
      <p>"Ha, you speak as if you know exactly what's in my heart!"</p>
      <p>"…"</p>
      <p>
        "It’s always been like that. You seem to know everything, yet you never
        speak of the important matters, you don’t speak properly, nor do you try
        to converse with me. And yet, those occasional human moments of yours
        are exactly how I remember the Seo Eun-hyun I know!"
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok stomps the ground.</p>
      <p>The surrounding earth rumbles.</p>
      <p>
        "What the hell is it? What’s the issue that caused you to avoid talking
        with me after coming to this world and starting your training?”
      </p>
      <p>The air around them stirs violently.</p>
      <p>“Who are you! Are you the Seo Eun-hyun I know, or someone else?"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok stares intensely at Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun sighs softly after a moment of silence.</p>
      <p>"…It's dangerous to spar here, let's move elsewhere."</p>
      <p>
        With that, Seo Eun-hyun propels himself off the ground and flies away.
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok follows suit.</p>
      <p>
        After flying over the forest for a while, they finally land in the
        middle of a vast wasteland, beyond the forest.
      </p>
      <p>"Honestly, I don't think you can defeat me, Chief Oh.”</p>
      <p>"Ha, calling me 'Chief'…"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok smirks.</p>
      <p>
        "I haven't been called that in a private setting since I was promoted.
        Calling me that… I wonder if you're really the Seo Eun-hyun I know.
        Shall we find out?"
      </p>
      <p>At that moment, Oh Hyun-seok's aura explodes.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The ground upheaves as he stomps.</p>
      <p>Instantly, Oh Hyun-seok's figure melds into the earth and vanishes.</p>
      <p>
        But Seo Eun-hyun, with an expressionless face, swings his hand in one
        direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        A massive explosion reveals Oh Hyun-seok, who lunges at Seo Eun-hyun
        with a punch.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh! Boom!</p>
      <p>
        As the air explodes, Seo Eun-hyun smoothly catches Oh Hyun-seok's punch
        and moves in close, extending his palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, Oh Hyun-seok's body flashes, and he moves above
        Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>He slams his leg down where Seo Eun-hyun stands.</p>
      <p>
        The ground explodes, and in the next moment, the surroundings turn into
        a sea of lava.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flames engulf the sea of lava as Oh Hyun-seok shoots towards Seo
        Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>Bang Bang Bang!</p>
      <p>
        Each of Oh Hyun-seok's punches carry the power and speed of a mid
        Nascent Soul!
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun, using his Flying Escape Technique, footwork, and sharp
        energy, dodges Oh Hyun-seok's attacks with all his might.
      </p>
      <p>And, Oh Hyun-seok starts to gather even more power.</p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok's speed increases.</p>
      <p>
        Now, just his movement alone causes the air to explode, sending
        shockwaves in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>Gradually, Oh Hyun-seok's punches start to just graze Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>'I'm going to hit, I'm going to hit!'</p>
      <p>And finally.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok's body glows with a five-colored light and suddenly shoots
        towards Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>His punch 'connects' with Seo Eun-hyun!</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun is pushed back, crashing into a corner of the wasteland.
      </p>
      <p>"Huff…"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok lands on the ground smirking.</p>
      <p>"How about that? Do you think I can handle a fight with you now?"</p>
      <p>Shhh…</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun stands up from the large crater created by the impact, dust
        swirling around him.
      </p>
      <p>Creak.</p>
      <p>His arms are broken.</p>
      <p>
        But as he walks out of the dust pit, life force flows into his arms,
        healing them.
      </p>
      <p>Creak…</p>
      <p>"...Well, you can indeed keep up with me to some extent now."</p>
      <p>He looks at Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok flinches!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok feels as if he’s facing a massive beast, feeling like he is
        thrown unarmed in front of a tiger as a mere mortal.
      </p>
      <p>His spine chills, and his senses scream in alarm.</p>
      <p>Gulp!</p>
      <p>'That guy…'</p>
      <p>"Now, then…"</p>
      <p>'He's about to use his real power.'</p>
      <p>"I'll fight you properly."</p>
      <p>
        With those words, Seo Eun-hyun forms his hand into a knife-edge and
        takes a stance.
      </p>
      <p>The next moment.</p>
      <p>He swings his hand blade horizontally.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>"…!!!"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok, feeling a life-threatening crisis, hurriedly ducks.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, he catches a glimpse of the ground he had lifted and
        the mountains he had caused to rise being sliced horizontally behind
        him.
      </p>
      <p>“From now on, it seems I can use my techniques.”</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun smiles.</p>
      <p>
        However, Oh Hyun-seok does not feel that it’s a smile in the emotional
        sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather, it’s more like a predator that has found its target, baring its
        teeth at the prey.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok quickly enters the world of intent to see Seo Eun-hyun's
        attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        His understanding of intent had deepened, allowing him to see both blue
        and red lines simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>But in the next moment, Oh Hyun-seok despaired.</p>
      <p>‘I can't dodge it!’</p>
      <p>
        Around Seo Eun-hyun, thousands, millions of trajectories are freely
        changing and swooping down on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        And those ‘trajectories,’ imbued with the five-colored energy of his
        body refining method, shoots towards Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>Booom!</p>
      <p>Sword trajectories rampage in all directions.</p>
      <p>
        Within the world of intent, Oh Hyun-seok can hear the name of the
        technique Seo Eun-hyun is using through intent.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>Landscape Painting!</p>
      <p>‘If I can't dodge it!’</p>
      <p>Then don't dodge!</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>Starlight Force swirls around Oh Hyun-seok's body.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, starlight emanates from Oh Hyun-seok's skin, making his
        insides appear translucent.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, what is visible inside Oh Hyun-seok are not muscles, blood,
        bones, or organs.
      </p>
      <p>It’s a starry sky!</p>
      <p>
        A celestial domain, resembling the universe, is operating inside Oh
        Hyun-seok's body under certain laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        For an instant, Oh Hyun-seok transforms as if he personifies ‘night’
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>Clang, clang, clang!</p>
      <p>
        Numerous trajectories hit Oh Hyun-seok's body, but they fail to
        penetrate him.
      </p>
      <p>"Is that all?"</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok kicks off the ground, charging at Seo Eun-hyun while
        intercepting the trajectories.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        His fist is encircled with the blue light of the Azure Spirit Striking
        Origin Technique.
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok concentrates, staring at Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Every trajectory is dangerous if not countered by the activation of
        Starlight Protecting Void Body. My physical strength is at the Nascent
        Soul stage in my bare state without activating Starlight Protecting Void
        Body, meaning each thread is potentially lethal even for a Nascent Soul
        cultivator.’
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok frowns.</p>
      <p>
        ‘But activating Starlight Protecting Void Body is too draining. I must
        finish this quickly!’
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok arrives in front of Seo Eun-hyun, raising his fist.</p>
      <p>"Come on, this isn’t all you have, is it? Seo Eun-hyun!”</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun smiles.</p>
      <p>"Very well, then…"</p>
      <p>
        At that moment, Oh Hyun-seok feels a chilling sensation and hastily
        stops his punch towards Seo Eun-hyun, retreating instead.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, dark entities surge around Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>The ground around them begins to decay.</p>
      <p>
        Thousands of curse spells, filled with venom, surround Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>"Shall we try a cultivation method?"</p>
      <p>"Hahaha… Damn you."</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok grins.</p>
      <p>'All this time, it wasn’t a cultivation method?'</p>
      <p>The thousands of curse spells, like tentacles, target Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>"Yin Soul Ghost Incantation."</p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>Several curse spells latch onto Oh Hyun-seok's legs.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, Oh Hyun-seok feels his legs become several times
        heavier.
      </p>
      <p>'Ugh!'</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        As he concentrates starlight, the curse spells disperse, and his legs
        return to normal. But Oh Hyun-seok realizes.
      </p>
      <p>'If I’m hit by all those thousands of curse spells…'</p>
      <p>Defeat is inevitable without even thinking!</p>
      <p>"Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea."</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The river of curse spells around Seo Eun-hyun, like tentacles, form a
        diagram and start to create a forest around him.
      </p>
      <p>
        A forest of decayed ancient trees made of curse spells fill the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ancient trees vibrate in unison, amplifying Seo Eun-hyun's curse
        spells and launching thousands of curse spells at Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>"Haha, merely annoying!"</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok laughs heartily, clenching his fist and striking the air
        violently.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blue energy imbued in his fist detonates, neutralizing the curse
        spells.
      </p>
      <p>However, Seo Eun-hyun begins forming hand seals.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Inside the forest of decayed ancient trees, wooden puppets identical to
        Seo Eun-hyun begin to emerge.
      </p>
      <p>Crack, crackle!</p>
      <p>
        As Seo Eun-hyun raises his hand towards the wooden puppets, strange
        circuits begin to form above them.
      </p>
      <p>‘Seo Eun-hyun's puppet circuits!’</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the puppets, all fifteen of them, begin to emit a
        Nascent Soul stage level of aura.
      </p>
      <p>Click, click, click!</p>
      <p>The puppets open their mouths in unions.</p>
      <p>Curse energy gathers towards the mouths of the puppets.</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok instinctively knows.</p>
      <p>This can’t be dodged.</p>
      <p>‘Then, I just have to fight back!’</p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>
        In the state of activating Starlight Protecting Void Body, Oh Hyun-seok
        clenches both fists.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Blue wings sprout from his back.</p>
      <p>One pair, two pairs, three pairs...</p>
      <p>And then four pairs!</p>
      <p>"Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter!"</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok, adorned with a total of eight wings, looks down at Seo
        Eun-hyun and smiles.
      </p>
      <p>"Take this!"</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun's expression changes.</p>
      <p>The spiritual energy between heaven and earth fluctuates.</p>
      <p>And then, Seo Eun-hyun laughs as if it’s absurd, murmuring.</p>
      <p>"A strike at the Heavenly Being stage…?"</p>
      <p>With that, light explodes, engulfing everything in a flash.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun's puppets and Oh Hyun-seok's Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter
        collide!
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok gasps for air.</p>
      <p>Cough!</p>
      <p>He coughs up blood.</p>
      <p>"What… is this?"</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun is in front of him.</p>
      <p>
        And Seo Eun-hyun, though slightly scorched and injured, is much more
        intact than Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>"Why, did I get, injured by, my own attack?"</p>
      <p>
        "Chief Oh has never fought a curse sorcerer before. During our fight, I
        collected your blood and fed it to the generals I created earlier. Since
        you attacked the cursed puppets yourself, you must have felt the
        backlash."
      </p>
      <p>"…Is that so."</p>
      <p>
        "Still, Chief, you have indeed grown a lot. For me to be pushed to this
        extent, it's been a really long time since anyone besides Master…"
      </p>
      <p>"Shut up!"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok yells.</p>
      <p>"It isn’t 'Chief'!"</p>
      <p>He stands up, gasping for breath.</p>
      <p>
        "Have you forgotten the times you called me 'Hyung'? Stop pretending
        like you don't know me all of a sudden, it's annoying!"
      </p>
      <p>As he gathers his energy.</p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>Four wings sprout from his left half.</p>
      <p>"Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter strikes twice!"</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun has a bitter expression as he prepares himself.</p>
      <p>Kuaguanguang!</p>
      <p>
        A strike that Seo Eun-hyun described as of the Heavenly Being stage, the
        Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter, is launched at him again.
      </p>
      <p>
        And once more, a forest made of curse spells rise behind Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun chants as he takes the Starting Form.</p>
      <p>"White Orchid Blessing Incantation."</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        The curse spells all reverse at once, blossoming into white orchids
        (magnolias), enhancing Seo Eun-hyun’s energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the world of intent, Seo Eun-hyun’s ultimate technique resonates once
        more.
      </p>
      <p>Treading Heaven, Formless Sword!</p>
      <p>Slash!</p>
      <p>That is the end.</p>
      <p>"…"</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok's Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter is split in two and explodes
        on both sides behind Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun remains unharmed.</p>
      <p>"…Thank you for the impressive duel. Now…"</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok shouts.</p>
      <p>"Not yet!"</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>Energy boils from Oh Hyun-seok's body.</p>
      <p>"It's not over yet!"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok opens a storage scroll, pulling something out.</p>
      <p>It’s a water pouch.</p>
      <p>From the pouch came a liquid with a sacred golden glow.</p>
      <p>
        "Light Spirit Sacred Water…!? With that amount, the cost would be
        astronomical…"
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, Oh Hyun-seok's eyes light up.</p>
      <p>"This life force… fits me quite well. And you know what?"</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>Dark clouds begin to gather in the sky.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun twitches at the sight.</p>
      <p>"Wait, what are you doing?"</p>
      <p>"Today!"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok shouts with shining eyes.</p>
      <p>"I've decided to beat you!"</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>His energy amplifies.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, blue lightning strikes from the sky.</p>
      <p>And next to the blue lightning, golden lightning falls.</p>
      <p>Two-Colored Heavenly Lightning!</p>
      <p>
        For someone who has reached the peak of Core Formation to face Heavenly
        Lightning again means they are challenging the Nascent Soul stage.
      </p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok, struck by the two bolts of lightning, begins to walk step
        by step towards Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is dangerous, madness! Don't come closer, sit down and use your
        methods!"
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Oh Hyun-seok pays no heed and continues slowly walking towards
        Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble, rumble!</p>
      <p>
        The ground is torn apart by the Heavenly Lightning, and the earth turns
        to glass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, within that tremendous Heavenly Punishment, Oh Hyun-seok manages to
        reach Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun grits his teeth.</p>
      <p>"…Is that your resolve."</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun takes his stance.</p>
      <p>"…I’ll go again."</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok remains silent.</p>
      <p>He simply gathers his strength amidst the Heavenly Lightning.</p>
      <p>"White Orchid Blessing Incantation."</p>
      <p>Above Seo Eun-hyun's body, the Mad Lord’s circuits stretch out.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the power of the White Orchid Blessing Incantation
        amplifies his strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        He grasps an invisible Formless Sword, exerting his power to the utmost
        and taking the Starting Form.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Behind Seo Eun-hyun, three wings sprout.</p>
      <p>
        "I, too, am a disciple of the master. Naturally I can use it. I just
        chose not to display it until now."
      </p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>
        The blue energy gathers in Seo Eun-hyun's hand, mixing with the Formless
        Sword, becoming even sharper.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Oh Hyun-seok raises his fist amidst the Heavenly Lightning, Seo
        Eun-hyun's eyes flutter.
      </p>
      <p>‘Purple?’</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok's body is boiling in a purplish hue.</p>
      <p>For the first time, Seo Eun-hyun has a moment of confusion.</p>
      <p>‘What is that?’</p>
      <p>It cannot be cut.</p>
      <p>
        After reaching Treading Heavens Beyond the Path, Seo Eun-hyun gained
        absolute confidence.
      </p>
      <p>His Formless Sword can cut through anything.</p>
      <p>
        There were things it couldn’t cut, but that was only due to a lack of
        strength from Seo Eun-hyun himself.
      </p>
      <p>In theory, there is nothing his sword cannot cut.</p>
      <p>But for the first time, Seo Eun-hyun feels confused.</p>
      <p>It can’t be cut!</p>
      <p>What is before him is clearly uncuttable!</p>
      <p>‘It feels like, a distant chaos.’</p>
      <p>Can his sword cut through chaos?</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun questions his sword for a moment.</p>
      <p>Then, his eyes light up as he looks at Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Even if it's something incomprehensible, it's being wielded by only the
        human, Oh Hyun-seok. Then…’
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun's eyes envision thousands, billions of trajectories between
        him and Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>‘I will find the weakest point, no matter what!’</p>
      <p>
        Behind Oh Hyeon-seok, five pairs of wings sprout from Oh Hyeon-seok's
        back.
      </p>
      <p>They are purple wings.</p>
      <p>"Primordial Chaos, Heavenly Shatter!"</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok thrusts his fist!</p>
      <p>The purplish energy shoots towards Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, Seo Eun-hyun swings his Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>"Severing Mountain!"</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of slashes extend towards Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>The white slashes and the purple punches collide!</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>White and purple!</p>
      <p>
        The two colors seem to split the entirety of heavens and earth for a
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>And then, the purple begins to gradually overpower the white light.</p>
      <p>The white sword slashes begin to break apart.</p>
      <p>The purple storm advances forward!</p>
      <p>Just as the purple storm is about to completely devour the white!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The Heavenly Tribulation striking Oh Hyun-seok finally ceases.</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok has risen to Nascent Soul!</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        The light between heaven and earth shines momentarily on Oh Hyun-seok,
        strengthening his momentum!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at the same time, the aura of Primordial Chaos surrounding Oh
        Hyun-seok also fades away.
      </p>
      <p>"Hurghaaaaah!"</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>Nascent Soul stage!</p>
      <p>
        Finally reaching the Nascent Soul stage, Oh Hyun-seok infuses even more
        power into his fist.
      </p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>
        As soon as the purple disappeared, the white light began to devour Oh
        Hyun-seok's territory again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok's domain is cut into chunks by the white slashes, shrinking
        rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>"Taaaaaaaaght!"</p>
      <p>And finally!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The two domains explode in a flash.</p>
      <p>Hissssss…</p>
      <p>
        At the area where Oh Hyeon-seok and Seo Eun-hyun stood, a gigantic
        crater spanning a radius of thirty li had formed.
      </p>
      <p>A true natural disaster!</p>
      <p>At the center of the natural disaster.</p>
      <p>There stands two people.</p>
      <p>"…Haha, damn it."</p>
      <p>"…"</p>
      <p>"Tough guy."</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok chuckles.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun is covered in blood.</p>
      <p>It seems he too had poured much into that last strike!</p>
      <p>The two men gasp for breath.</p>
      <p>However, five wings still remain on Oh Hyun-seok's left half.</p>
      <p>
        "…Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter has two strikes. But you've poured
        everything into the last strike."
      </p>
      <p>"…"</p>
      <p>"If I land this on you, I win."</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun coughs up a mouthful of blood.</p>
      <p>"…If you hit, that is."</p>
      <p>"You think I can't?"</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun looks at Oh Hyun-seok with clear eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok likewise looks back at him with eyes full of clarity and
        confidence.
      </p>
      <p>No more words are needed.</p>
      <p>The two charge at each other.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun grasps the transparent void in his hand.</p>
      <p>His eyes shimmer with radiance.</p>
      <p>'The exchange just now was clearly in my favor.'</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok must have suffered deeper internal injuries!</p>
      <p>
        'With Endless Mountains beyond Mountains, my Formless Sword can be used
        with its full power regardless of my condition. If I use Endless
        Mountains before Mountains before Chief Oh hits me…'
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok's fist and Seo Eun-hyun's ultimate move collide once more!
      </p>
      <p>The explosion isn't as massive as before.</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok said that Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter had one strike left,
        but he too had poured a significant amount of his energy into the
        previous strike.
      </p>
      <p>The explosion is smaller.</p>
      <p>
        However, within that smaller explosion, the two exchange numerous
        intents, attempting counterattacks.
      </p>
      <p>'I will win!'</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun's eyes shine, blocking Oh Hyun-seok's intent.</p>
      <p>
        Without needing to apply anything beyond Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin, just pressing at the level of Three Flowers Gather at the
        Summit, Oh Hyun-seok, who can only see two colors, is beneath him!
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok grits his teeth.</p>
      <p>'I'm being pushed back.'</p>
      <p>Is this how I lose?</p>
      <p>'So it seems.'</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok resigns himself.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun is an opponent who will require a greater cultivation to
        defeat, even after reaching the Nascent Soul stage.
      </p>
      <p>It even feels like he hasn't used his full strength yet.</p>
      <p>
        If he really used dirty and vile methods, and it wasn't a 'spar' but a
        'battle,' Oh Hyun-seok would have died several times over.
      </p>
      <p>'It's a pity. I just wanted to know why you changed like that.'</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>
        The next moment, blue and red lines begin to overlap in Oh Hyun-seok's
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>'…!?'</p>
      <p>
        The two colors create a color that Oh Hyun-seok has never seen before in
        the world of intent.
      </p>
      <p>Purple!</p>
      <p>A purple thread exists between Oh Hyun-seok and Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>
        And through the purple thread, Oh Hyun-seok feels he can somewhat
        understand Seo Eun-hyun's intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, he can also feel a bit of Seo Eun-hyun's hidden
        concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the purple line, Oh Hyun-seok gathers all his strength and
        swings his other hand towards Seo Eun-hyun's blind spot.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        For the first time, Oh Hyun-seok's fist hits Seo Eun-hyun's
        'unprotected' face!
      </p>
      <p>"Seo Eun-hyun!"</p>
      <p>Crack, crackle!</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun's slight complacency, having perceived Oh Hyun-seok's
        martial realm to be merely at the pinnacle, allowed Oh Hyun-seok's punch
        through!
      </p>
      <p>"I have!"</p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyeon-seok's fist gathers starlight, blue light, and the light of
        five elements.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, Seo Eun-hyeon's face begins to distort.</p>
      <p>"Won!!!"</p>
      <p>Boom!!!</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun's head explodes!</p>
      <p>
        His head shattered, Seo Eun-hyun slumps powerlessly, as if his neck had
        vanished.
      </p>
      <p>After decades in this world.</p>
      <p>
        This is the moment Oh Hyeon-seok's fist, which trained trained solely to
        be Seo Eun-hyeon’s equal, defeated him.
      </p>
      <p>Chiiiiii</p>
      <p>Wiggle, wiggle</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun's head, having reached Core Formation Grand Perfection,
        begins to regenerate.
      </p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun sprawls on the ground.</p>
      <p>"Phew… that was tough."</p>
      <p>"…Congratulations on reaching Three Flowers Gather at the Summit."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun, regenerating his face, said while looking up at the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        "…Thank you. Yes, at the last moment, feeling your intent helped me
        understand a bit. Something only someone like me, your colleague, not
        even our master, could understand."
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok, with mixed emotions, asks.</p>
      <p>"…Do you not know who I am?"</p>
      <p>"…Haha."</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun laughs.</p>
      <p>Drip…</p>
      <p>Tears flow from his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "…I know, who you are. Chief Oh Hyun-seok… no, Senior Brother Oh, how
        good of a person you are. How kind and trustworthy you are."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun continues.</p>
      <p>
        "I know you're a good person. That's why I couldn't tell you until now.
        Senior brother Oh, I don't remember who you are. I can hardly remember
        most of what happened before."
      </p>
      <p>Covering his face with his hand, Seo Eun-hyun smiles bitterly.</p>
      <p>"…It might be dementia."</p>
      <p>I've always known Senior Brother Oh is a good person.</p>
      <p>But because of that.</p>
      <p>
        Because I have faint memories of receiving warm words from that person
        long ago and building good memories with them,
      </p>
      <p>I couldn't properly speak to Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>Now, I hardly remember anything from before the first cycle.</p>
      <p>I can't remember what world I came from.</p>
      <p>I can't remember what I used to do.</p>
      <p>
        I can't remember what kind of relationships I had with my colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>My memories are gradually sinking further down.</p>
      <p>
        That's why I've been pushing Oh Hyun-seok away, keeping a cold and
        indifferent demeanor whenever he tries to talk to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talking to him would only make me more aware that I no longer remember
        the good moments we shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn't stand the feeling of emptiness, as if my roots had
        disappeared, eating away at my mind.
      </p>
      <p>So, I kept my distance from Oh Hyun-seok as much as possible.</p>
      <p>"…I'm sorry, Senior Brother Oh."</p>
      <p>Thump, thump, thump!</p>
      <p>And then, as I lay fallen, Oh Hyun-seok walks towards me.</p>
      <p>"It's alright."</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok helps me up.</p>
      <p>"Now that you know, we can slowly figure it out, can't we?"</p>
      <p>He smiles warmly.</p>
      <p>
        "From today, call me Hyun-seok Hyung. Together, we'll find a way for you
        to regain your memories."
      </p>
      <p>"…Yes, Hyung."</p>
      <p>
        I respond, looking at Oh Hyeon-seok, who now smiles as heartily as Azure
        Tiger Saint, our master.

      <p>Chapter 41: Qi Refining (1)</p>
      <p>Qi Refining consists of a total of 14 stars.</p>
      <p>
        Previously, Qi Gathering was included in Qi Refining, making it 15
        stars, but even then, the foundation of Qi Refining began only after
        forming the Law-Transforming Dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I read through the Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation, I delved
        into the details of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although casually referred to as stars from 1 to 14, the boundaries of
        each stage within Qi Refining were quite complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        To reach the first star of Qi Refining, one must understand all
        seventy-two incantations of the Seventy-Two Earthly Sha True Words
        (七十二地地煞眞言) and activate the corresponding seventy-two spiritual
        meridians.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second star involves mastering the Thirty-Six Heavenly Gang Method
        Decrees (三十六天罡法訣), building upon the seventy-two Earthly Sha
        meridians and forming the corresponding thirty-six Heavenly Gang
        spiritual natures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third star requires evolving the seventy-two spiritual meridian and
        thirty-six spiritual natures to accommodate twelve types of spiritual
        energy corresponding to the Twelve Earthly Branches (十二地律).
      </p>
      <p>
        The fourth star demands accommodating ten changes of spiritual energy
        corresponding to the Ten Heavenly Stems Diagram (十天干圖).
      </p>
      <p>
        The fifth star is achieved by unifying the 108 spiritual meridians and
        natures and sixty types of spiritual energy changes into nine points
        according to the principles of the Nine Palaces (九宮).
      </p>
      <p>
        The sixth star involves completing the entire spiritual energy meridians
        in accordance with the operation of the Eight Trigrams (八卦).
      </p>
      <p>
        The seventh star is when one performs a ritual to seven stars among the
        28 stars and 4 constellations, declaring their intention to walk the
        path of cultivation and being granted permission to receive more
        spiritual energy under the auspices of heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eighth star entails navigating spiritual energy through the Six
        Harmonies (六合) and Four Directions of Heaven and Earth (天地四方),
        filling the entire body's spiritual meridians.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ninth star aligns the properties and symbols of the Five Elements
        with the main attributes of the learned cultivation method, fully
        awakening the attributes of these methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tenth star uses the principles of the Four Images (四象) to fully
        connect the completed and specialized Eight Trigrams spiritual meridians
        in order to create two channels of Yin and Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eleventh star involves fully penetrating the upper, middle, and
        lower dantians corresponding to the Three Talents with spiritual power,
        achieving unification of Heaven, Earth, and Man (天地人).
      </p>
      <p>
        The twelfth star entails continuously circulating the the Yin and Yang
        channels of the Dual Poles (雙極), eventually integrating the channels
        and becoming a flawless Unified Channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thirteenth star accelerates spiritual power through the Unified
        Channel, focusing the spiritual power into one point (origin) within the
        dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fourteenth star, the Infinite (無極), involves exploding the
        concentrated mass of spiritual power to further evolve the inner part of
        the dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Successful evolution of the dantian, marked by the formation of a
        spiritual cloud within and a spiritual star's birth, signifies reaching
        Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>That marks both the beginning and the end of Qi Refining.</p>
      <p>'...Can I see the end of this in my lifetime?'</p>
      <p>
        From first-rate to peak, from peak to Three Flowers Gathering at the
        Summit, and from there to Five Energies Converging to the Origin, it's
        achievable within each lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        But within the Qi Refining stage alone, there are immense differences in
        levels and realms.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Now I understand why Qi Refining cultivators show such vast differences
        in abilities with just a one-star discrepancy.'
      </p>
      <p>
        In the martial world, the differences within the same major realm were
        not so drastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        An early peak could defeat a mid-peak, and a mid-peak could overcome the
        threshold of Three Flowers Gathering at the Summit.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in Qi Refining, even a one-star difference could make direct
        confrontation nearly impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also understood why so many Qi Refining cultivators spend their entire
        lives unable to advance beyond a single star.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without exceptional understanding of spiritual arts, one could spend a
        lifetime in cultivation and still not fully grasp all incantations of
        the Seventy-Two Earthly Sha True Words.
      </p>
      <p>'It's not easy, indeed...'</p>
      <p>
        After contemplating the fourteen stars of Qi Refining, I turned to the
        methods written in the Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earth Surpassing Path to Cultivation, Water Surpassing Path to
        Cultivation, Wood Surpassing Path to Cultivation, Metal Surpassing Path
        to Cultivation, Fire Surpassing Path to Cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>Five methods were recorded.</p>
      <p>I chose the Earth Surpassing Path to Cultivation.</p>
      <p>The reason was simple.</p>
      <p>
        The internal energy method of the martial world that I had originally
        mastered, the Dragon Vein Qi Method, belonged to the Earth (土)
        attribute in the classification of cultivators' heaven and earth
        spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>"It's better to practice something familiar."</p>
      <p>
        While reciting the formula written in the Five Surpassing Paths to
        Cultivation, I chanted the Seventy-Two Earthly Sha True Words.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seventy-Two Earthly Sha True Words is a spell that activates
        seventy-two spiritual meridians and is a fundamental technique in
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the true words of Earth Corner (地角) would, from beginning
        to end, emanate energy from the spiritual veins corresponding to the
        Earth Corner Star, resulting in earthen spikes bursting forth from the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p>"I need to form the hand seals too."</p>
      <p>
        Of course, as one progresses to the higher stages of Qi Refining, hand
        seals and true words can be omitted, but for now, both were required to
        cast techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        "First, I need to activate the meridian corresponding to the Earth
        Leader Star (地魁星)."
      </p>
      <p>
        Activating even one meridian would mean entering the first rank of Qi
        Refining.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sighed softly and activated the meridian with the true words of Earth
        Leader (地魁).
      </p>
      <p>Two months passed.</p>
      <p>I came out of the stone chamber and breathed the outside air.</p>
      <p>
        Somehow, I had managed to activate the first spiritual meridian, the
        Earth Leader.
      </p>
      <p>But to do so, I had to use a hundred spirit stones.</p>
      <p>"The efficiency is terribly low."</p>
      <p>
        At this rate, I might not be able to activate all Seventy-Two Earthly
        Sha meridians even if I used all my remaining spiritual stones.
      </p>
      <p>"...Well, that's why I joined a cultivator clan."</p>
      <p>
        I could have become a loose cultivator, not joining the Cheongmun Clan.
        Stealing cultivation techniques from a couple of cultivators would have
        sufficed, so technically, coming here wasn't necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the reason I chose to come to the Cheongmun Clan was to seek help in
        such difficult times.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first went to Cheongmun Mok, the elder in Qi Building, and declared
        that I had become a Qi Refining cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elder Cheongmun Mok, surprised, checked my meridians and only believed
        me after confirming the activated spiritual meridian.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Huh, what did you do? You, with Mixed Spiritual Roots, achieved Qi
        Refining in just three months? This is insane... Well, now I see why the
        main clan elders gave you a recommendation. Heh..."
      </p>
      <p>He looked at me curiously and asked about the method I used.</p>
      <p>"What method did you use to enter Qi Refining?"</p>
      <p>
        "I used a method from the Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation,
        specifically the Earth Surpassing Path Method."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, the Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation. I see."</p>
      <p>
        It seems to be a common technique, as even Elder Cheongmun Mok
        recognized it immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That method is indeed the very basics of cultivation. It precisely
        outlines the essentials for Qi Refining. However, being just basic, it
        will not allow you to perform any special attribute techniques."
      </p>
      <p>"I am aware of that."</p>
      <p>"Hold on..."</p>
      <p>He fiddled with his desk and pulled out a book.</p>
      <p>
        "This is the Earth Dwelling Method (地住院法), an Earth attribute
        cultivation method and one of the basic practices of the Cheongmun Clan.
        It is specialized in solid defense. You can learn this instead of the
        Earth Surpassing Path, or alongside it. Since they have the same
        attribute, it will not significantly slow down your cultivation."
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>
        "You mentioned slow progress in cultivation mastery? That is inevitable
        due to your Mixed Spiritual Roots... But there's a way to accelerate
        your cultivation mastery."
      </p>
      <p>I listened attentively to Elder Cheongmun Mok's words.</p>
      <p>
        "Generally, understanding follows breakthroughs. Once you breakthrough a
        meridian or realm, the insights of the lower levels become instinctively
        clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have activated the Earth Leader meridian, so you should have some
        understanding of what the Earth Leader True Words mean, correct?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, I do."</p>
      <p>
        "As you move from Qi Refining 1st star to 2nd star, from lower to higher
        levels, and then to Qi Building, the meanings of the true words and
        formulas you learned before will become much more intuitively clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, cultivators with Heavenly or True Spiritual Roots quickly
        breakthrough meridians and realms to understand these insights. However,
        those with Mixed Spiritual Roots like you need to do the opposite."
      </p>
      <p>"The opposite?"</p>
      <p>
        "Understanding before Breakthrough! First fully understand and embody
        the meanings of the true words and formulas, engraving them in your
        soul. If you completely grasp the true words, you can activate meridians
        and breakthrough realms even without exceptional talent or quality."
      </p>
      <p>"Understanding before Breakthrough, huh..."</p>
      <p>I could roughly grasp what that meant.</p>
      <p>
        Cultivators born with incredible innate talents, those of the Heavenly
        Spiritual Roots and True Spiritual Root, could break through realms and
        understand mantras just by sitting quietly and circulating their energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, cultivators with lesser talents, those of the Mixed Spiritual
        Roots, had to first understand the mantras to activate their spiritual
        meridian and break through realms.
      </p>
      <p>And I, too, had experienced something similar.</p>
      <p>
        "Cultivators are born with inherent consciousness and spiritual roots,
        while martial artists need to reach the Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin."
      </p>
      <p>
        To reach the world of consciousness used as natural as breathing by
        cultivators, martial artists must realize intent, understand life within
        intent, and eventually awaken all life's intents to reach consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>A genius realizes and unfolds a technique in one go.</p>
      <p>
        A dullard reaches the same level only after numerous attempts and
        trials.
      </p>
      <p>I had already experienced this countless times.</p>
      <p>"Thank you for the advice."</p>
      <p>There was nothing to fear or find difficult.</p>
      <p>I just had to do what I’ve been doing all along.</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. Also, within the territory, every ten days, members of the
        territory and external members gather for a discussion meeting to share
        insights about mantras and cultivation. Participating in it will be
        helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advice I just gave you and the cultivation manual are gifts for your
        ascension to Qi Refining. If you want more advice, you'll have to
        collect and pay merit points next time. Now, off you go."
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>
        After thanking the Cheongmun Clan elder, I left the stone cave where he
        resided.
      </p>
      <p>Several days later.</p>
      <p>
        I attended a discussion meeting held within the Cheongmun Clan's
        territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a meeting where Qi Refining cultivators of the first, second, and
        third starrs gathered to discuss enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meeting, besides members of the clan, there were external members
        like me and even low-ranking members who had accumulated a lot of merit
        points.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meeting was organized with first, second, and third star Qi Refining
        cultivators forming their own groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, I joined the 1st Star Qi Refining group and participated in
        the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>"First, I'd like to talk about the wall I've recently hit."</p>
      <p>
        The meeting progressed with each Qi Refining cultivator sitting
        cross-legged, taking turns to share their insights and the walls they
        recently faced.
      </p>
      <p>
        I too spoke a few words about the Earth Leader Star's spiritual
        meridian, and that day I was able to interact somewhat with other
        cultivators of the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a month of discussions and missions at the Cheongmun Clan's
        meetings, during one of my conversations with the clan's cultivators, I
        learned a rather shocking fact.
      </p>
      <p>"So... you're saying you can't see this?"</p>
      <p>
        "That's right. Have you mastered some unique consciousness technique?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ah... well, something like that."</p>
      <p>
        I smiled awkwardly and laughed with an external member of the Cheongmun
        Clan who was conversing with me.
      </p>
      <p>Today, I learned a shocking fact.</p>
      <p>Cultivators cannot see the color of intent.</p>
      <p>
        They seemed able to recognize its form, but beyond that, they only saw
        transparent consciousness and intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        'A shocking fact indeed. I thought all cultivators could see the color
        of intent like me... Well, I never had anyone to compare with before.
        After all, reaching the Five Energies Converging to the Origin isn't
        common...'
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought about the extent of consciousness a martial artist at the Five
        Energies Converging to the Origin would have.
      </p>
      <p>Around the size of a Qi Refining 3rd of 4th Star.</p>
      <p>
        I was using the Hidden Consciousness Technique to make my consciousness
        appear as small as 1st Star Qi Refining, but in reality, my domain of
        consciousness was much larger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, I heard that not even Qi Building cultivators, let alone those
        at the 3rd Star of Qi Refining, could see the colors of intent like I
        could.
      </p>
      <p>Unless they had mastered some unique consciousness technique.</p>
      <p>
        'The domain of consciousness awakened by martial artists is
        fundamentally superior to that of cultivators.'
      </p>
      <p>
        In a way, it was the only area where martial artists surpass
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the interactions at the meeting, I learned another interesting fact
        about the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        'A clan that venerates the Dao of Combat... Is it the influence of their
        founder? And because of that influence, they hold an Immortal Combat
        Meeting every year...'
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Combat Meeting was a martial contest that the direct and
        collateral members of the Cheongmun Clan participated in once a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        All those bearing the Cheongmun surname, whether direct or collateral,
        were obliged to participate in the Immortal Combat Meeting, and their
        rankings within the clan were determined based on their performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, members of the Cheongmun Clan fought desperately at every
        Immortal Combat Meeting, constantly striving throughout the year for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I think I understand now why the Cheongmun Clan is rumored to have foul
        characters.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Their personalities have likely become rough due to preparing for the
        Immortal Combat Meeting within the clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        'It's a pity. If external members could also participate, one could
        raise their rank and receive a bounty of cultivation resources.'
      </p>
      <p>I licked my lips softly.</p>
      <p>That's when it happened.</p>
      <p>"Breaking news! Urgent news!"</p>
      <p>
        A collateral member of the Cheongmun Clan rushed into the cave where the
        discussion meeting was being held and shouted.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Jin Clan has finally usurped the throne of Yanguo, replacing the
        Makli Dynasty with the Jin Dynasty! The Jin Clan has now seized control
        of Yanguo’s political landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the main house has decided to send an envoy to congratulate
        the Jin Clan on their victory, and this envoy will be open to not only
        Cheongmun Clan members but also external members. Moreover, the envoy
        will get a chance to meet and learn from a Qi Building level figure who
        played a significant role in the Jin Clan's usurpation of the Makli
        Dynasty."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Huh, learning from an elder of the Jin Clan? Which elder might that
        be?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well... it was someone I heard of for the first time. The name was,
        Young-hoon, I believe.."
      </p>
      <p>I felt a smile form on my lips.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon has succeeded in this life too.</p>
      <p>"...How do I apply to join as the envoy?"</p>
      <p>
        "The Cheongmun Clan's way is always simple. Survival of the fittest! As
        it happened previously, the 20 spots for the envoy will be decided by
        making all the applicants fight, and the last 20 standing will be given
        the opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But you should just give up. You seem to be at about the Qi Refining 1st
        Star, so don't overdo it."
      </p>
      <p>However, I asked with a faint smile.</p>
      <p>
        "To apply, do I just do it like other things and apply to Elder
        Cheongmun Mok?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "That is correct but for this position, there will be many powerful
        cultivators who have been preparing for the Immortal Combat Meeting.
        Forget about it. Meeting a Qi Building figure won't change your life,
        will it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I passed him and walked towards the stone chamber where Cheongmun Mok
        was.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Life won't change, but... it's just about meeting an old friend from my
        hometown."
      </p>
      <p>
        If he helped the Jin Clan usurp the throne of Makli, then surely his
        martial arts realm must have reached at least the Five Energies
        Converging to the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>How far had he reached in this life?</p>
      <p>How much had his martial arts grown?</p>
      <p>
        For a long time, I had wanted to cross blades with a martial artist of
        equal or higher caliber.
      </p>
      <p>Joining the envoy was very simple.</p>
      <p>
        While everyone gathered in one place to fight, I used the Record of
        Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts to hide my
        presence, and at the last moment, I ambushed the most exhausted of the
        remaining 20, knocking them out and becoming the victor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some saw me and accused me of cowardice, but in truth, I could have
        annihilated all the Qi Refining 5th to 6th Star cultivators gathered
        there that day.
      </p>
      <p>'They should be thankful I didn't fight and stayed quiet.'</p>
      <p>I just didn't want to stand out and stayed a bit subdued.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the outcome, I was able to win the position.</p>
      <p>
        I headed to the Jin Clan as an envoy along with one of the Qi Building
        elders of the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>"Everyone aboard!"</p>
      <p>
        On the day the envoy departed, the Qi Building elder climbed onto the
        bow of a large ship-shaped magical artifact and shouted at us.
      </p>
      <p>
        I boarded the ship along with other members of the envoy at a strategic
        location within the Cheongmun Clan's tettirtory, and soon the ship rose
        into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>'It's always fascinating to see.'</p>
      <p>
        Although I could walk in the sky, flying in the void using the harmony
        of heaven and earth energy and air was a different principle from this
        flying artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heaven and earth energy itself was absorbed by the ship, generating
        a strange buoyancy.
      </p>
      <p>Then the ship gently floated up and suddenly zoomed forward.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The ship quickly rose into the sky, piercing through the clouds, grazing
        the sea of clouds with its dragon-like frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging by the speed of the magical artifact, it seems like we would
        reach Yanguo in about a day.
      </p>
      <p>'I can see why flying artifacts are popular.'</p>
      <p>It wasn't like using void stepping.</p>
      <p>It felt like being on a comfortable airplane.</p>
      <p>
        I leaned on the deck, admiring the underside of the ship grazing the
        clouds, lost in thought.
      </p>
      <p>'How far can a martial artist ascend?'</p>
      <p>
        Has Kim Young-hoon evolved the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and
        Martial Arts in this life?
      </p>
      <p>
        The realm of martial artists is third-rate, second-rate, first-rate, and
        then pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next is known as the peak of the pinnacle, Three Flowers Gather at the
        Summit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surpassing the Three Flowers Gather at the Summit is the Five Energies
        Converging to the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>That's the limit.</p>
      <p>
        Reaching the Five Energies Converging to the Origin is considered a
        legendary realm, achieved only once every few centuries, but no one has
        ever seen beyond it.
      </p>
      <p>Except for Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon has reached a realm of martial arts never seen before in
        the history of martial arts, akin to a miracle.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, the current state of martial arts is continually being pioneered."
      </p>
      <p>For a martial artist, there is no higher place.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a martial artist must create their own 'higher realm.'</p>
      <p>I slowly stroked the sword at my waist.</p>
      <p>
        Even as I entered the path of cultivation and practiced, I never once
        removed this sword from my side.
      </p>
      <p>
        While reciting mantras, I continuously trained with the sword, striving
        to find clues to the next stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I was still only at the early stages of Five Energies
        Converging to the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But even if I can't ascend further yet... Kim Young-hoon will show me
        the scenery beyond."
      </p>
      <p>
        And he will tell me that the time spent practicing martial arts was
        never in vain.
      </p>
      <p>I am now a cultivator.</p>
      <p>But at the same time, I am a martial artist.</p>
      <p>As both a martial artist and a cultivator,</p>
      <p>I will not give up and will continue to run endlessly.</p>
      <p>Because that is the life I desire.</p>
      <p>
        'I will climb and climb. And surely... end this cycle and live a proper
        life.'
      </p>
      <p>With that firm resolve, I gazed at the sky above the clouds.</p>
      <p>High and distant, yet clear and bright.</p>
      <p>A day later.</p>
      <p>We arrived at the Jin Clan's main house.</p>
      <p>'This is... the Jin Clan's main house!'</p>
      <p>It was a volcano.</p>
      <p>A live one, with lava bubbling up from below!</p>
      <p>The Jin Clan's main house was located at the center of it.</p>
      <p>'Were there volcanoes in Yanguo?'</p>
      <p>But I was surprised for another reason.</p>
      <p>
        In my several lifetimes, this was the first time I had seen a volcanic
        terrain.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Excuse me, do you know where exactly the Jin Clan's main house is
        located in Yanguo's geography?"
      </p>
      <p>I asked a fellow envoy.</p>
      <p>
        He answered me promptly, swallowing his saliva at the sight of the Jin
        Clan's main house below.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's said to be near Gyungang Province in Yanguo. I'm not too sure
        myself."
      </p>
      <p>
        'Gyungang Province? I've been there before, but there was no volcano.
        No, could it be...'
      </p>
      <p>I realized one possibility.</p>
      <p>
        'The entire volcano is covered with an illusion barrier, so it remained
        undiscovered until now!'
      </p>
      <p>
        I was astounded by the immense scale of Jin Clan's main house's barrier
        and gazed at the main house.
      </p>
      <p>"We're descending!"</p>
      <p>
        The Qi Building elder of the Cheongmun Clan lowered the ship, and we
        entered the Jin Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        We went into the Jin Clan and, led by the Qi Building elder, delivered a
        letter from the Cheongmun Clan's leader to the Jin Clan's leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to that, I saw a Core Formation cultivator closer than ever
        before in my life.
      </p>
      <p>'This is... Core Formation...'</p>
      <p>Zap, zap</p>
      <p>It felt like being near the fox.</p>
      <p>
        A vast area of about thirty zhang was covered by his spiritual power and
        consciousness. In the middle, a middle-aged man in red robes sat in the
        leader's seat, reading the letter from the Cheongmun Clan's leader.
      </p>
      <p>Zap, zap..</p>
      <p>
        Under the pressure openly emitted by the Core Formation cultivator, the
        Qi Refining cultivators of the Cheongmun Clan, except for me, looked as
        if they were about to be crushed.
      </p>
      <p>
        My skin tingled under the spiritual power of the Core Formation
        cultivator, but that was it.
      </p>
      <p>
        'At the level of Five Energies Converging to the Origin, I can easily
        deflect such pressure.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Using my consciousness, I subtly deflected the pressure being exerted on
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, formal greetings were exchanged, and finally, the moment
        I had been waiting for arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I will introduce the highest external member of the Jin Clan who made
        significant contributions during the recent change of the throne!"
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon stepped onto a small platform and greeted us.</p>
      <p>
        "Greetings to the distinguished guests from other clans. I am the
        martial artist known as Young-hoon."
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, he had already ascended to the Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin in this life. His intent evolved into the form of consciousness,
        and even his appearance seems younger.
      </p>
      <p>"A martial artist??"</p>
      <p>"What are you saying, isn't that person a cultivator?"</p>
      <p>"Are they mocking us?"</p>
      <p>Then, a smirk appeared on one of the Jin Clan's elders' lips.</p>
      <p>
        "He is definitely a highly accomplished martial artist. Undoubtedly, he
        played a significant role in the recent throne change. As mentioned
        earlier to the envoys, wouldn't it be a good idea to test the skills of
        each clan's talents against this martial artist for the sake of
        friendship between the clans?"
      </p>
      <p>I roughly understood the situation.</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan had usurped the throne and was using this opportunity to
        show off their strength to the surrounding cultivator clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what better way to elevate their pride than having their martial
        artist defeat other clans' cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Even so, how can a mere martial artist compete with cultivators..."
      </p>
      <p>"The Jin Clan is taking things too far..."</p>
      <p>
        The Cheongmun Clan's envoy, as well as envoys from other clans, looked
        displeased.
      </p>
      <p>Then, the Jin Clan's leader spoke up.</p>
      <p>
        "I vouch for his skills. Those who do not wish to participate in the
        martial contest may retire to their quarters."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        No one dared to object after that. To ignore the individual vouched for
        by the Core Formation leader would be akin to disrespecting the leader
        himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Before we start the banquet, we plan to have a brief martial contest as
        a form of entertainment. Does anyone have objections?"
      </p>
      <p>No one responded to the leader's question.</p>
      <p>
        "Seeing no objections, I guess everyone agrees. Let's start the martial
        contest."
      </p>
      <p>
        The first challenger was from the Gongmyo Clan of Byeokra, a Qi Refining
        cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Kim Young-hoon and the Gongmyo Clan cultivator faced off,
        discontented murmurs erupted here and there.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I joined as an envoy to receive teachings from a Qi Building figure but
        now..."
      </p>
      <p>"How did we end up competing with a mere martial artist..."</p>
      <p>
        "A martial artist as a Qi Building level figure? His consciousness seems
        only about the lower levles of Qi Refining... It would be more
        believable to say a grasshopper by the roadside is a high-ranking
        official of Yanguo."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Silence! How dare you speak like that in front of the Clan Leader!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cheongmun Clan's elder scolded, though his face was full of
        dissatisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>The martial contest began.</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon moved swiftly, and the Gongmyo Clan's Qi Refining
        cultivator who tried to cast a spell was knocked away.
      </p>
      <p>"....!"</p>
      <p>"What..."</p>
      <p>"That, that.."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon casually brushed off his hands and said,</p>
      <p>"The contest is over."</p>
      <p>Shock spread across the faces of the envoys.</p>
      <p>"How, how did..."</p>
      <p>"Did anyone see what happened?"</p>
      <p>
        The area became noisy instantly, and soon another challenger from a
        different clan stepped up.
      </p>
      <p>A Qi Refining 10th Star cultivator from the Byeok Clan.</p>
      <p>They sent a relatively strong late-stage cultivator.</p>
      <p>Everyone's attention focused again, and the contest resumed.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon charged at the Byeok Clan cultivator, who released a blue
        spell. Kim Young-hoon elegantly dodged all the spells and approached the
        cultivator, shattering his defensive spell with one move and throwing
        him aside.
      </p>
      <p>"It's over."</p>
      <p>
        Again, the cultivators gasped in shock, and the spectators became noisy.
      </p>
      <p>"How could that..."</p>
      <p>"That was definitely a martial arts technique."</p>
      <p>"How could a mere mortal..."</p>
      <p>No one doubted the Clan Leader's words anymore.</p>
      <p>The atmosphere started heating up.</p>
      <p>Each clan sent challengers to Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        It seems as if beating him had become a matter of pride for each clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Cheongmun Clan sent several late Qi Refining cultivators, but
        all were defeated by Kim Young-hoon within five seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The atmosphere, which had been heating up due to the consecutive defeats
        of the clans' late-stage Qi Refining cultivators to a mere martial
        artist from the Jin Clan, gradually turned gloomy.
      </p>
      <p>In contrast, the Jin Clan cultivators' pride was soaring.</p>
      <p>
        And again, when another Byeok Clan cultivator was defeated by Kim
        Young-hoon, it was the Cheongmun Clan's turn.
      </p>
      <p>"...Who will go?"</p>
      <p>No one responded.</p>
      <p>
        Everyone knew that sending anyone would only embarrass the Cheongmun
        Clan.
      </p>
      <p>"...Well, if no one else will..."</p>
      <p>"I'll go."</p>
      <p>I stood up.</p>
      <p>Wasn't this why I came in the first place?</p>
      <p>Seeing me, the elder of the Cheongmun Clan sighed and said,</p>
      <p>
        "...Well, if it's a Qi Refining 1st Star, even if he loses, everyone
        will just think it's natural."
      </p>
      <p>
        I walked down to the martial contest stage and met Kim Young-hoon's
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>Startled!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon jerked in surprise, as if he didn't expect to see me
        here.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh-</p>
      <p>I drew my sword.</p>
      <p>"Let's have an exciting fight."</p>
      <p>What realm has Kim Young-hoon reached in this life?</p>
      <p>What level of martial arts has he attained!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, though initially startled, smirked and for the first
        time drew his saber.
      </p>
      <p>"Alright, let's play."</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Our intents clashed in the air.</p>
      <p>Translator Notes:</p>
      <p>
        Translating the Qi Refining stars were a bit of a pain in the butt. Some
        of the terms are actually used irl like the Earthly Branches, Heavenly
        Stems, Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams, etc. You can google em if you want.
        Anyway, don't sweat it from the information overload. The story will
        slowly explain the Qi Refining stage and you'll better understand as we
        read further.

      <p>Chapter 98: Lotus (6)</p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>
        Facing the sandstorm of Cheon-saek City attached to the Heaven-Treading
        Desert, Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan packed a large cloth and
        scanned the area below.
      </p>
      <p>“If my memory serves right, that's where the lady lived..."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong's gaze turns to an alley.</p>
      <p>
        Inside the alley is the White Magic Lotus Artifact Store that I have
        seen before.
      </p>
      <p>“There it is."</p>
      <p>‘Could it be her?’</p>
      <p>I sigh softly, pondering what to do.</p>
      <p>
        “But Ryeong Hyung, aren't there other clans’ descendants in the alley?”
      </p>
      <p>“Hmm, indeed.”</p>
      <p>
        As stated, the alley is packed with cultivators possessing
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even cultivators appearing to be at the Qi Building stage are present.
      </p>
      <p>
        “These pathetic ones, chasing after a woman. Now that the Cheongmun Clan
        is involved, let’s snatch her away as flamboyantly as possible.”
      </p>
      <p>“Let's do that.”</p>
      <p>
        Then, Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan leap down from the flying magic
        artifact shaped like a ship, cutting through the sandstorm.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent is required by our main house, we
        will take her to the Cheongmun Clan!”
      </p>
      <p>“What..."</p>
      <p>“What is..."</p>
      <p>
        At the booming shout of Cheongmun Dan, the surrounding cultivators
        flinch and look up at the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one dares to stand against the mid Qi Building aura of Cheongmun Dan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even a cultivator at the early Qi Building stage grimaces but remains
        still.
      </p>
      <p>And when Cheongmun Dan unfurls the cloth,</p>
      <p>
        “I don’t know what business my daughter has with you, but that will be a
        bit inconvenient."
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>A surge of white spiritual energy approaches.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Dan flinches, crossing his arms to block the wave of spiritual
        energy, which writhes and transforms into a huge tiger, blocking
        Cheongmun Dan and Cheongmun Ryeong.
      </p>
      <p>The two retreat to the top of buildings, looking down at the tiger.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>‘This is, Qi Building late stage!?’</p>
      <p>The tiger made of spiritual energy also leaps into the sky.</p>
      <p>
        And from the dissipating spiritual energy tiger, a middle-aged man in
        white emerges.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wears a white robe, a blue ring turned necklace around his neck, and
        various glass magic artifacts on his wrists.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I am the guest elder of the Gongmyo Clan, Buk Joong-ho. I'm unsure what
        the Cheongmun Clan wants with my daughter, but I ask for a formal
        request rather than such rash actions.”
      </p>
      <p>“Hmm, a guest elder of the Gongmyo Clan."</p>
      <p>“The individual governing this Cheon-saek City.”</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan step back, and I remember him.</p>
      <p>
        ‘That Qi Building cultivator who tried to recruit me to the Gongmyo
        Clan...!’
      </p>
      <p>He was her father.</p>
      <p>“Our clan has come for..."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong slowly explains their purpose to Buk Joong-ho.</p>
      <p>After listening for a while, Buk Joong-ho nods.</p>
      <p>
        “So, you tried to kidnap my daughter for that reason. I'm a bit angry,
        but I’ll tolerate it for the sake of the Cheongmun Clan. Indeed, my
        daughter is in trouble because of the clan descendants..."
      </p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho frowns for a moment and then speaks.</p>
      <p>
        “However, even if I wanted to let my daughter go to the Cheongmun Clan,
        she will refuse to go."
      </p>
      <p>“Hmm? What do you mean?”</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong asks in surprise.</p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho rubs his temples, looking vexed.</p>
      <p>
        “It’s due to her mother’s last will. She told us to wait for a betrothed
        who promised to marry my daughter in Cheon-saek City and would come with
        a token. Hence, she won’t leave Cheon-saek City to honor her mother’s
        last will."
      </p>
      <p>“Hmm..."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong frowns and asks.</p>
      <p>
        “Is there no way? It's an important matter instructed by our clan
        head..."
      </p>
      <p>
        “If it’s for a few days, she might, but she won’t leave Cheon-saek City
        for several months for such a matter. If you try to kidnap her against
        her will, you’ll have to fight me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        After pondering for a moment, Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan both
        sigh lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We understand. We'll just have to study the magic artifacts in
        Cheon-saek City. What do you think, Daoist Seo?”
      </p>
      <p>“I have no objections.”</p>
      <p>“Well, then, let's do that..."</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong commands the clan descendants gathered in the alley
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You brats! The Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent artisan you're
        surrounding has an artifact commissioned by the formal order using the
        name of the Cheongmun Clan! It is a multi-year project, so anyone
        disturbing the artisan will be punished in the name of the Cheongmun
        Clan. Scram!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing that, most of the late-stage cultivators furrow their
        brows.
      </p>
      <p>It’s then.</p>
      <p>
        Among the late-stage cultivators, one who looks to be of a similar
        physical age to me, floats into the air and respectfully greets
        Cheongmun Ryeong.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It is an honor to meet Cultivator Cheongmun Ryeong, one of the three
        greats of Qi Building.."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, I am also honored to meet Cultivator Byeok Mun-seong, the most
        talented late-stage heir of the Byeok Clan. You just barely missed being
        selected for the official ascension group of the Righteous Path
        Alliance, didn’t you?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ha, I'm embarrassed."</p>
      <p>
        Byuk Mun-seong, clad in a brown robe, strokes his unique long ponytail
        as he continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, I have something to say to Cultivator Cheongmun Ryeong.
        Regardless of the Cheongmun Clan's affair, right now, several late-stage
        cultivators from various clans and she are in the middle of a bet.
        Cheongmun Clan's matter is important, but the bet cannot be delayed.
        Could you please wait just a little longer?"
      </p>
      <p>"A bet? What kind of bet?"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong furrows his brow and asks, to which Byuk Mun-seong
        replies with a sly smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        "She has made a deal that if any of us late-stage cultivators can
        properly handle the magic artifact she's making, she’ll end her long
        seclusion in Cheon-saek City and go on a trip with the cultivator who
        handled the magic artifact properly."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Huh, so you mean to say that right now, when the Cheongmun Clan’s
        affair is urgent, you plan to take the artifact artisan on a trip?"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Dan glares at Byeok Mun-seong with fiery eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong, still at early Qi Building, steps back with an awkward
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's not what I meant. Anyway, I just want to secure a promise. It's
        fine to go on the trip after the Cheongmun Clan's affair is settled."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm... Did Cultivator Buk not object to his daughter traveling with a
        young man?"
      </p>
      <p>At Cheongmun Dan's words, Buk Joong-ho calmly speaks..</p>
      <p>
        "I allowed it. I’m sad that my daughter is too confined to Cheon-saek
        City because of her mother's last words, so I told her to continue with
        the bet. Of course, I will accompany her."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Dan and Cheongmun Ryeong looks at me.</p>
      <p>"Is it okay with you, Daoist Seo?"</p>
      <p>I look at Byeok Mun-seong and ask.</p>
      <p>"How long will this bet take, approximately?"</p>
      <p>"Ah, well..."</p>
      <p>That's when it happens.</p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>A bright light bursts from within White Magic Lotus.</p>
      <p>
        "Ah! It seems the magic artifacts have just been completed. If you could
        wait just half a day, the bet will be over..."
      </p>
      <p>I nod.</p>
      <p>"Alright. That’s fine..."</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Dan and Cheongmun Ryeong also nod, and we decide to watch how
        the bet unfolds for half a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, I feel spatial fluctuations from the space inside the
        magic artifact store.
      </p>
      <p>
        'It feels similar to space compression... Perhaps the inside is larger
        than the outside.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I recall when I went to kill the previous emperor of Yanguo.. Even the
        emperor who was only at the Qi Refining stage had hidden in a pavilion
        that was larger on the inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Is that magic artifact store itself a kind of space-like artifact?'
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, the door of the magic artifact store opens, and the
        late-stage cultivators from various clans and Byeok Mun-seong enter the
        store.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan also enter the store after getting
        permission from Buk Joong-ho.
      </p>
      <p>I too enter the store after getting permission.</p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        As the spatial feature on the store itself activates, the appearance of
        the store completely changes from the last time I entered.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a large platform are flags, swords, mirrors, bells, scrolls, wheels,
        and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Numerous forms of magic artifacts are displayed, and as expected, she in
        white stands on the platform, looking down at us.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, indeed the magic artifacts of Miss Buk are different just from
        the aura they emit."
      </p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong exclaims in admiration as he looks at the artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Indeed, as promised. If someone can properly handle these magic
        artifacts, Cultivator Buk will agree to travel with that cultivator."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry, Cultivator Byeok. However, as I mentioned earlier, I will
        set the standard for 'properly handling.'"
      </p>
      <p>"Understood, I would like to hear the standards."</p>
      <p>
        She lifts a bell-shaped magic artifact and infuses it with spiritual
        power.
      </p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>
        A bright blue light emits from the bell, coloring the surroundings and
        casting a semi-transparent water curtain around her.
      </p>
      <p>Ten stripes appear on this water curtain.</p>
      <p>
        "The magic artifacts I have created will show one stripe for each tenth
        of their power unleashed. Thus, if any of you, with any magic artifact I
        made, can bring forth more than 60% of its power, I will consider the
        standards met."
      </p>
      <p>"Hahaha, 60%?"</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong laughs aloud.</p>
      <p>
        "How amusing. Even if the magic artifacts made by Cultivator Buk are
        impressive, do you think the distinguished heirs from various clans
        gathered here cannot draw out even 60% of a magic artifact’s power?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Not just Byeok Mun-seong, but snickers can be heard from around the
        room.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This means everyone will likely draw out 60%, so we should determine
        the winner of the bet by who can enhance the magic artifact's
        performance the most."
      </p>
      <p>A late-stage cultivator from the Gongmyo Clan chuckles.</p>
      <p>However, she looks at him coldly and says,</p>
      <p>
        "Well, I was worried that setting the standard at 60% might be too high
        and would be criticized. I wonder how many among you here can actually
        bring out even 20% of my magic artifacts’ power?"
      </p>
      <p>"What, what...!"</p>
      <p>
        The Gongmyo Clan cultivator’s face turns beet red upon hearing this.
      </p>
      <p>"Are you mocking me!?"</p>
      <p>"No, wasn’t it you who started the mockery?"</p>
      <p>Suddenly, her demeanor changes.</p>
      <p>
        The soft and gentle look disappears, replaced by a fierce glare that
        dominates the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How dare you stand before my magic artifacts and say that anyone can
        draw out 60% of their power? Do you think my magic artifacts are that
        easy?
      </p>
      <p>
        If there are those among you who saw the failures displayed in White
        Magic Lotus and thought my magic artifacts are trivial, please leave
        now. I do not wish to speak with those who cannot recognize the true
        value of my magic artifacts."
      </p>
      <p>
        Under her intense presence, the Gongmyo Clan heir seems to flinch and
        then, thumping his chest, steps forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Fine, then I'll be the first to test the magic artifacts! After all, a
        magic artifact is just a magic artifact, how impressive can it be?"
      </p>
      <p>He climbs onto the platform and grabs a flag-shaped magic artifact.</p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>And after a while...</p>
      <p>Fisss...</p>
      <p>
        The magic artifact looks to light up but then, just as quickly, the
        light goes out, and it droops lifelessly.
      </p>
      <p>"Wh-what?"</p>
      <p>
        "Full of confidence, yet you can't even activate the magic artifact."
      </p>
      <p>"No, no... Ugh! I'm just not used to a flag-shaped magic artifact!"</p>
      <p>
        The late-stage cultivator from the Gongmyo Clan goes around, touching
        other magic artifacts and infusing them with spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, just like the first, none of the magic artifacts light up; they
        just fizzle out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only one that even showed a sparkle was the mirror-shaped magic
        artifact he bragged he was most familiar with, but even that failed to
        produce a single stripe indicating 10% power.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Th-this is a scam! What kind of magic artifacts are these! It's not
        meant for use!"
      </p>
      <p>He shouts at her, but she just smiles and replies,</p>
      <p>
        "If you lack skill, at least have some manners. Please step down. There
        is not a single magic artifact here that you can handle."
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh...!"</p>
      <p>
        Spiritual power of the earth attribute escapes from around the Gongmyo
        Clan heir.
      </p>
      <p>I look at Buk Joong-ho and ask,</p>
      <p>"Shouldn't we intervene?"</p>
      <p>But Buk Joong-ho clicks his tongue and crosses his arms.</p>
      <p>
        "No need. My daughter's magic artifacts are all difficult to draw power
        from but..."
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>The Gongmyo Clan cultivator, unable to hold back, casts a spell.</p>
      <p>Kurururu...</p>
      <p>
        However, his spell is blocked by the water curtain produced by her magic
        artifact, disappearing without a trace.
      </p>
      <p>Ten stripes are floating on the water curtain.</p>
      <p>
        "If you can properly draw them out, it boasts considerable
        performance... In fact, even I, her father, can only draw up to 80% of
        the power from my daughter’s magic artifacts."
      </p>
      <p>Pride fills Buk Joong-ho's face.</p>
      <p>
        "A person without manners, skill, or character is trash. Please leave."
      </p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>
        At her gesture, several magic artifacts floats in the air, displaying
        ten stripes, and point at the Gongmyo Clan cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gongmyo Clan cultivator's face reddens and then turns pale, but he
        soon descends from the stage amidst the jeers of other clan descendants.
      </p>
      <p>"Kukkuk, knew that guy would be like this."</p>
      <p>"What was he thinking, trying to handle a magic artifact?"</p>
      <p>
        "Even in the Gongmyo Clan, known for their magic artifacts, he's famous
        for not being able to handle them."
      </p>
      <p>
        After rearranging the magic artifacts, she looks around the audience and
        asks,
      </p>
      <p>"Is there anyone else?"</p>
      <p>
        And then, without exception, everyone starts to challenge her magic
        artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>"An outstanding magic artifact artisan indeed."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong strokes his goatee and comments.</p>
      <p>"Absolutely trustworthy."</p>
      <p>
        "Isn't she somewhat of a magic artifact genius? It seems no one can
        properly draw out the power of the magic artifacts."
      </p>
      <p>Indeed.</p>
      <p>
        Many late-stage cultivators tried, but the one who managed to draw out
        the most power from a magic artifact could only reach 20%.
      </p>
      <p>However, Cheongmun Ryeong is unimpressed.</p>
      <p>
        "Outstanding, yes, but such magic artifacts can be crafted by any
        high-level refiner. Compared to Gongmyo Cheon-saek, who was absolutely
        wild, it’s clear she's still far behind. Gongmyo Cheon-saek used to brag
        to me about the magic artifacts he created, and compared to him, this
        law pattern artisan still has a long way to go."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong critically assesses her.</p>
      <p>
        "It seems she deliberately made the circuits of the magic artifacts
        complex and difficult, whereas Gongmyo Cheon-saek's are simple yet
        elegant."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong looks to have some expertise in magic artifacts,
        evaluating them from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Complex spiritual energy circuits allow one to create powerful magic
        artifacts from ordinary materials, but whether those are truly good
        magic artifacts is another question."
      </p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho nods somberly at Cheongmun Ryeong's words.</p>
      <p>
        "You are right. My daughter still falls short compared to Elder Gongmyo
        Cheon-saek. But there is a reason she makes the circuits complex, please
        understand that."
      </p>
      <p>"Alright. As long as she handles the clan matters properly."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong nods.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, a gloomy air falls over the faces of the many cultivators gathered
        in the magic artifact store.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, even the few outstanding ones couldn't draw out more than
        20% of a magic artifact's power, let alone 60%.
      </p>
      <p>As things turn out this way, some give up even before trying.</p>
      <p>"This is a scam!"</p>
      <p>"What nonsense is this!!!"</p>
      <p>
        The crowd's mood grows hostile, but they are subdued by the presence of
        Buk Joong-ho, Cheongmun Ryeong, Cheongmun Dan, and myself watching from
        the back.
      </p>
      <p>Then, breaking through the crowd, one person steps forward.</p>
      <p>"Cultivator Byeok has stepped up!"</p>
      <p>"That's right. If it's a Qi Building cultivator, maybe..."</p>
      <p>It’s Byeok Mun-seong, who had gathered the cultivators.</p>
      <p>
        "Truly living up to her reputation. I have seen the magic artifacts of
        Miss Buk. But, honestly, only drawing out 60% of a magic artifact’s
        power seems too easy, doesn’t it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        He chuckles and climbs onto the stage, examining the magic artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you're at Qi Building, understanding how to handle magic artifacts
        comes naturally. Even if you had set the condition at 90%, it would have
        been insufficient..."
      </p>
      <p>Then, Byeok Mun-seong lifts a flying sword magic artifact.</p>
      <p>"Let me show you the skill of a Qi Building cultivator!"</p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>His Pure Spiritual Force surges into the flying sword.</p>
      <p>The sword begins to shine, revealing stripes.</p>
      <p>One stripe, two...</p>
      <p>And then three!</p>
      <p>"Wow... three stripes!"</p>
      <p>"Is this what a Qi Building cultivator can do!"</p>
      <p>"No one else could draw out even 30% of the power!"</p>
      <p>But the stripes don't stop there.</p>
      <p>"Four stripes!"</p>
      <p>"Already 40%!"</p>
      <p>However, the smile gradually fades from Byeok Mun-seong’s face.</p>
      <p>'How far will this go...'</p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>
        As Byeok Mun-seong pours in more Pure Spiritual Force, a fifth stripe
        appears on the magic artifact.
      </p>
      <p>"50%!"</p>
      <p>"Look, Cultivator Byeok might just meet the standard!"</p>
      <p>
        But not only me, Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan, even Buk Joong-ho
        sneer or click their tongues.
      </p>
      <p>It’s evident that Byeok Mun-seong is struggling.</p>
      <p>
        "Tch, tch, pouring in power without understanding. I could draw out 70%
        myself..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong clicks his tongue and mutters, attracting the scornful
        glances of many.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, most recognize Cheongmun Ryeong as one of the top three in Qi
        Building, and many turn their heads back with murmurs.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Blink, blink...</p>
      <p>
        As Byeok Mun-seong's face reddens, the sixth stripe faintly flickers and
        appears on the flying sword.
      </p>
      <p>Then,</p>
      <p>Fisssh!</p>
      <p>The light on the flying sword goes out.</p>
      <p>
        "It's done! Look, Miss Buk. I have drawn out 60% of the flying sword's
        power!"
      </p>
      <p>However, her face remains cold.</p>
      <p>"60%? Are you sure what you've shown is really 60%?"</p>
      <p>"The stripes were visible, weren't they?"</p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        She seems to ponder for a moment, and the crowd becomes on edge,
        awaiting her decision.
      </p>
      <p>Frustrated, I blurt out without thinking,</p>
      <p>"The sword... why handle it like that?"</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>I flinch!</p>
      <p>I look around as numerous eyes are now focused on me.</p>
      <p>Unlike the looks directed at Cheongmun Ryeong, these stares linger.</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong, having heard my comment, looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        No one dares to speak recklessly to me, a Qi Building cultivator, but
        their faces are filled with dissatisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>Then Byeok Mun-seong, wiping sweat from his forehead, speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "Ha, it seems you're around my age, fellow cultivator. How can you be so
        presumptuous?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I apologize if it sounded unpleasant. I just spoke without thinking, as
        I usually handle the sword."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, you're a sword cultivator? But I, Byeok Mun-seong, pride myself on
        being a sword cultivator too. How can a stranger criticize my way?"
      </p>
      <p>"Sword cultivator?"</p>
      <p>
        It seems he’s referring to a cultivator who practices sword methods like
        flying sword skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        "So, Cultivator Byuk, you mean to say you've primarily trained in flying
        sword techniques?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, I'm known as the sword genius of the Byeok Clan, having entered
        the Qi Building stage. Seeing you're likely in early Qi Building, I
        suppose I have a higher understanding of swords than you, don't I? You
        shouldn't speak so thoughtlessly."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>I flinch.</p>
      <p>I was going to let it go.</p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>'Debating sword understanding in front of me?'</p>
      <p>In front of me?</p>
      <p>I approach the stage with a stern expression.</p>
      <p>"What..."</p>
      <p>
        I pick a sword-shaped magic artifact from among those on the stage and
        infuse it with Pure Spiritual Force.
      </p>
      <p>"Watch. The sword..."</p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>"Is used like this."</p>
      <p>As I infuse the sword with power, it emits light.</p>
      <p>Stripes appear one by one.</p>
      <p>The stripes reach three, four, and five.</p>
      <p>"Ha, haha... if that's all..."</p>
      <p>And then the sixth stripe appears.</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong and the late-stage cultivators from various clans widen
        their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>A clear sixth stripe!</p>
      <p>But I continue to infuse the sword with power.</p>
      <p>
        My Pure Spiritual Force is considerably stronger than Byeok Mun-seong's,
        and my understanding of the sword alone is enough to draw out the sword
        magic artifact's power.
      </p>
      <p>Koooooom!</p>
      <p>The seventh stripe appears.</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong stares at the sword I am holding as if his eyes will pop
        out, and she too looks at me with considerable interest.
      </p>
      <p>The eighth stripe.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan are also surprised, and Byeok
        Mun-seong forces out a deflated laugh.
      </p>
      <p>The ninth stripe.</p>
      <p>
        Buk Joong-ho, watching from behind, is also startled and focuses more
        intently on my sword.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Koooom!</p>
      <p>
        The sword magic artifact surges with energy, forming the final, tenth
        stripe.
      </p>
      <p>I have perfectly drawn out 100% of the magic artifact's power!</p>
      <p>"Ha, haha..."</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong steps back a few paces with a defeated expression, his
        face filled with defeat and a mix of anger and humiliation.
      </p>
      <p>Clap, clap, clap, clap...</p>
      <p>She smiles brightly and claps her hands.</p>
      <p>
        "Amazing. Until now, no one but the creator myself has been able to
        fully draw out the power of these magic artifacts..."
      </p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>
        I don’t pay attention to her words and infuse even more spiritual power
        into the sword.
      </p>
      <p>'Dare to talk about sword understanding in front of me?'</p>
      <p>I'll show them.</p>
      <p>What it means to be a sword cultivator!</p>
      <p>Forget everything except the sword in front of you!</p>
      <p>Koooom!</p>
      <p>
        The sword vibrates wildly, and above the ten stripes, an eleventh stripe
        appears.
      </p>
      <p>"Wha...!"</p>
      <p>Even she, who has been calm until now, changes her expression.</p>
      <p>"How...?"</p>
      <p>But I focus on the sword, not paying attention to her.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of spiritual energy circuits are visible within the sword.</p>
      <p>I don't concern myself with the unknown circuits.</p>
      <p>The important thing is the essence of the sword.</p>
      <p>A weapon for cutting, stabbing, and swinging.</p>
      <p>How to maximize the power of that tool to its limit?</p>
      <p>That is, to swing the tool until it becomes one with my arm.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, First Move, Transcending Peaks!</p>
      <p>Paaak!</p>
      <p>
        When I take the stance and swing the sword magic artifact, a total of
        twelve stripes appear on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        She completely loses her composure and stares intently at the sword in
        front of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How, how is this possible? I never set it to produce such output. 120%?
        What have you done?"
      </p>
      <p>"...I think 13, even 14 might be possible."</p>
      <p>Woong...</p>
      <p>I withdraw my Pure Spiritual Force and continue.</p>
      <p>
        "But the sword might break. It appears that 120% is the maximum limit
        for this magic artifact before it breaks. It's a good artifact."
      </p>
      <p>I hand the sword back and step away.</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong beside me avoids my gaze with a look of defeat and
        anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Far away, Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan look astonished by my
        skills, while Buk Joong-ho looks at me with an expression of disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>"...It seems the winner is decided. What is your name, sir?"</p>
      <p>
        She momentarily looks at the sword I have handed her and then speaks to
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "My name is Seo Eun-hyun, just call me Cultivator Seo. But initially, I
        was not a participant in this bet."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Not a participant? From the moment you entered the magic artifact shop,
        you were a participant. Among the others here, is there anyone who can
        draw out the power of magic artifacts like Cultivator Seo?"
      </p>
      <p>No one responds.</p>
      <p>
        "It seems there isn't. Then, as Cultivator Byeok previously spoken, I
        shall give the right to Cultivator Seo."
      </p>
      <p>"Do as you please."</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong spits out his words and then leaves the magic artifact
        shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many late-stage cultivators also follow him, and among them, the
        descendants of the Cheongmun Clan are caught by Cheongmun Dan and begin
        receiving discipline in a corner of the magic artifact shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, you have proven that you can handle my magic artifacts
        properly, so I will give all these magic artifacts to you."
      </p>
      <p>
        She points to the artifacts on the stage, and I look at them for a
        moment before saying,
      </p>
      <p>"I'm sorry, but I don't need them."</p>
      <p>"Excuse me?"</p>
      <p>"I don't use magic artifacts..."</p>
      <p>
        With an overwhelmingly superior alternative like the Formless Sword, why
        would I use something like a magic artifact?
      </p>
      <p>
        "By the way, do you remember me, Cultivator Buk? You once gave me water
        and clothes..."
      </p>
      <p>"Are you ignoring my magic artifacts now?"</p>
      <p>But my words change her mood.</p>
      <p>She’s feeling humiliated.</p>
      <p>"No, that's not it..."</p>
      <p>
        "Didn't you say you were a sword cultivator? Not using my magic
        artifacts means you find them unsatisfactory, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        'What's this...? Does having a similar talent to Mad Lord also mean
        she’s mad as well?'
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel perplexed and try to explain, but she speaks with an angry
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wait a moment, if you're not satisfied with these flying swords, I'll
        give you something better. I'll show you my successful creations...!"
      </p>
      <p>"No, that's not necessary..."</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        She runs into the back of the magic artifact shop, and Buk Joong-ho
        approaches, clicking his tongue.
      </p>
      <p>
        "My daughter is usually kind and gentle, but her personality changes a
        bit when it comes to magic artifacts. She has great pride in the magic
        artifacts she's created herself, so please understand."
      </p>
      <p>"Isn't this reaction a bit too much?"</p>
      <p>
        "Well, that's because you're the only one who has drawn out 120% of the
        power of her magic artifacts. Since you're the first person she's seen
        do this, it seems her pride won't allow her to accept you not using her
        magic artifacts."
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, she comes back from inside the shop, carrying an armful of sword
        magic artifacts, and lays them out in front of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each one emits a respectable spiritual aura and are so splendid they
        take one's breath away.
      </p>
      <p>
        "These are the sword magic artifacts I'm most proud of. Please try
        holding one and then decide!"
      </p>
      <p>Her face is brimming with confidence.</p>
      <p>Unable to bear her expression, I pick up one of the swords.</p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>
        As I infuse power into the sword, a rainbow of spiritual energy covers
        the inside of the magic artifact shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although stripes do not appear like before, I feel that I am drawing out
        more power than the magic artifact has.
      </p>
      <p>
        She too must feel it, as she looks at the sword I am holding with a
        mesmerized gaze.
      </p>
      <p>"I apologize, but I really don't need magic artifacts."</p>
      <p>"Excuse me?"</p>
      <p>I flinch!</p>
      <p>I sense a chill flash in her eyes.</p>
      <p>Her confident smile cracks, and veins throb on her forehead.</p>
      <p>
        "Hahaha, how do you feel crushing the pride of an artifact artisan,
        Daoist Seo?"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong flies onto the stage and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        When two Qi Building cultivators stand before her, she conceals her
        chilling demeanor and changes her expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Daoist Seo and I, would like to entrust the owner of White Magic Lotus
        and the person endowed with the Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent, with a
        task.”
      </p>
      <p>"What kind of task might that be?"</p>
      <p>
        "Daoist Seo and I intend to develop a certain formation, and for that,
        we need to create formation magic artifacts. Can you help us?"
      </p>
      <p>She nods in agreement.</p>
      <p>
        "Of course. However, isn't formation development a field that takes
        quite some time?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's right. Hence, Daoist Seo and I will stay in Cheon-saek City to
        work on this project with you. It might take several years."
      </p>
      <p>After nodding, she looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        "So, while developing the formation artifacts, I’ll also develop
        something that will satisfy Daoist Seo."
      </p>
      <p>"No, really, I don't need any..."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong pokes me in the waist to stop me.</p>
      <p>His telepathy reached my ears.</p>
      <p>
        [How much do you plan to crush the artisan's pride, Daoist Seo? Having a
        magic artifact wouldn't be bad, just accept it.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Alright then. I appreciate your effort, but I'm not in a position to
        afford such artifacts."
      </p>
      <p>
        “Since you didn’t like the artifacts you won for the bet, I’m making you
        a replacement. My pride is at stake and since Cultivator Seo has shown
        new potential for my artifacts, I will make it for free.”
      </p>
      <p>Speechless, I just stare at a spot in the magic artifact shop.</p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, I look forward to working with you. My name is Buk Hyang-hwa."
      </p>
      <p>"My name is Seo Eun-hyeon. I appreciate your cooperation."</p>
      <p>"Stay strong, Cultivator Byeok."</p>
      <p>
        "Our clan elders say that Cultivator Buk's talent corresponds to the
        Four-Pattern among the Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent. True demonic
        talent begins to manifest from One-Pattern. Four-Pattern is just
        considered a level of an outstanding prodigy, so there's no need to be
        too disheartened, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong is receiving consolation from the other cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>"Haha, thank you for your consolation, friends..."</p>
      <p>
        "Well, it's unfortunate this time, but if there's another fun event,
        please call me, Cultivator Byeok."
      </p>
      <p>"I'll see you later!"</p>
      <p>
        As Byeok Mun-seong's mood seems to brighten a bit, the cultivators each
        ride their flying artifacts and return to their clans.
      </p>
      <p>Later.</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong's face suddenly contorts in anger.</p>
      <p>
        "Fools... She's not just a simple Four-Pattern... Why did I drag those
        guys around, bothering and annoying her..."
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>He stomps in anger and gnaws his teeth.</p>
      <p>
        "I can't let some unknown guy take her... If I can make her, who
        possesses demonic talent like that monster, mine, becoming a clan head
        isn't just a dream...!"
      </p>
      <p>He bites his lips and walks into an alley.</p>
      <p>"Let's wait for her to go on a journey. I still have a chance..."</p>
      <p>"Serving Command Palace...?"</p>
      <p>In the inner meeting room of the magic artifact shop.</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa, who received the formation diagram, is startled.</p>
      <p>"The creation of the legendary artisan."</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. We need to create a formation that will stimulate growth for a
        spiritual tree inside, and you must create the formation artifacts for
        that."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong, Buk Hyang-hwa. and I sit at a table, discussing the
        formation.
      </p>
      <p>After a while, she asks seriously,</p>
      <p>
        "Can we enter Serving Command Palace? If I could see the dragon veins
        and qualities with my own eyes, it would be easier to create suitable
        magic artifacts."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        "Additionally, Serving Command Palace is known as a treasure. If we can
        borrow its power for the formation artifacts, we can create even more
        effective ones."
      </p>
      <p>However, Cheongmun Ryeong shakes his head.</p>
      <p>
        "Serving Command Palace only appears once every 400 years. It will be
        several hundred years before it appears again..."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, but I know a secret way to enter."</p>
      <p>"!"</p>
      <p>
        At my words, Cheongmun Ryeong looks surprised, and Buk Hyang-hwa's face
        brightens.
      </p>
      <p>"What kind of method is it?"</p>
      <p>"Ah, I just need to ask a friend of mine."</p>
      <p>I take out a communication device connected to Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>The day turns to evening.</p>
      <p>
        I reached out to Seo Ran, and along with Cheongmun Ryeong, we continued
        to discuss and sketch out the formation diagrams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa announced she would create the basic magic artifacts for
        the formation and entered her workshop.
      </p>
      <p>"Sigh..."</p>
      <p>
        After finishing the discussion with Cheongmun Ryeong, I briefly step out
        of the meeting room.
      </p>
      <p>'He always has an overwhelming number of questions.'</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong is known for his inquisitiveness, constantly asking,
        ‘Why do you think that way?’ This habit persisted even during our
        discussions on formations.
      </p>
      <p>
        His sharp questions can be piercing at times, but they also bring a
        sense of nostalgia, as if revisiting the past.
      </p>
      <p>'The past, once gone, never returns.'</p>
      <p>
        This fact remains true, even for someone who has experienced regression.
      </p>
      <p>Lost in such gloomy thoughts, I hear a noise.</p>
      <p>Clang, clang!</p>
      <p>
        From Buk Hyang-hwa's workshop inside the magic artifact shop, the sound
        of a hammer striking echoes.
      </p>
      <p>'Buk Hyang-hwa is quite remarkable.'</p>
      <p>
        To create magic artifacts, she hammers away beside the intense heat of
        the flames, her being a woman notwithstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I casually approach her workshop and stealthily observe her working.
      </p>
      <p>Creak, creak...</p>
      <p>
        She’s carefully engraving something on a formation flag artifact, and
        then she proceeds to hammer and shape something new.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, I notice something blossoming on her face.</p>
      <p>Fzzzt...</p>
      <p>It’s a four-colored pattern.</p>
      <p>
        This pattern, resembling tree branches, boar colors of gold, purple,
        light pink, and black.
      </p>
      <p>
        The black and purple patterns, interwoven, create a semi-blended
        appearance.
      </p>
      <p>'That must be Four-Pattern...'</p>
      <p>
        Amidst the sparks, her figure, forging magic artifacts while adorned
        with four colors, continually captivates my attention.
      </p>
      <p>In the midst of this,</p>
      <p>Suddenly, our eyes meet.</p>
      <p>
        "Ah, Cultivator Seo, have you come? I have something to ask of you."
      </p>
      <p>"What would that be?"</p>
      <p>"Here."</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        She goes deeper into her workshop and returns with a large box, placing
        it before me.
      </p>
      <p>Creak...</p>
      <p>
        Upon opening the box, it contains numerous unfinished sword magic
        artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "These are artifacts I made, inspired by seeing you with the previous
        swords."
      </p>
      <p>'All these, crafted in just half a day?'</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa, with a confident expression, adds,</p>
      <p>
        "These are specially made for you, Cultivator Seo. They're not finished
        yet, but I bet they won't easily unleash their full power this time. Why
        not try infusing them with your spiritual power?"
      </p>
      <p>With a slight smile, I pick up one of the swords.</p>
      <p>Once again, I channel Pure Spiritual Force into the sword.</p>
      <p>
        As expected, the sword glows, emitting more than 120% of its intended
        output.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I wonder if she will be disappointed... I feel sorry for defying her
        expectations.'
      </p>
      <p>As I’m about to speak to her,</p>
      <p>'Hmm?'</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa, in a daze, watches the sword as it releases strength
        beyond its limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her mouth continuously moves, muttering something about artifacts, and
        her eyes are fixated on the sword.
      </p>
      <p>'She must have gained some inspiration...'</p>
      <p>Just then,</p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>The four-colored pattern reappears on her skin.</p>
      <p>
        'Four-Pattern may only be considered equivalent to the level of a
        prodigy, but it seems to be a talent far surpassing ordinary magic
        artifact artisans...'
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, I shudder, observing her in her trance-like state.</p>
      <p>
        The intertwined purple and black patterns look to be merging together.

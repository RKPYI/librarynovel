      <p>Chapter 93: Lotus (1)</p>
      <p>Shudder!</p>
      <p>I’m frozen, unable to do anything.</p>
      <p>
        This isn't just a metaphorical expression, but literally, the energy
        throughout my body hardens, and I lose strength independently of my
        will.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Let's see, let's see, let's see... Such clarity and transparency. And
        the clear heart essence that protrudes outward. Swinging it around, did
        you defeat the Core Formation demon beast using that? And what is this,
        a mental restraint?]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>This crazy old man is fiddling with my head, examining me.</p>
      <p>
        [It's so strange. How can such a human being exist? What are you? Are
        you really human? Or a special kind of demon beast in human form?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hunting a Core Formation demon beasts due to the uniqueness of his
        consciousness, but the person himself isn't at the Core Formation stage.
        Just a mere mortal without any spiritual energy... Yet, the
        consciousness is at the late stage of Qi Building.]
      </p>
      <p>He looks at me curiously, examining me from every angle.</p>
      <p>'Damn it, why has this guy appeared already?'</p>
      <p>I ponder the reason.</p>
      <p>
        'If I think about it, the Heavenly Being cultivators and others like the
        Sea Dragon King all came from different directions. But the Mad Lord
        always flew in from the direction of the Ascension Gate.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe, the Mad Lord arrived at the Ascension Gate earlier than any other
        Heavenly Being cultivator and only came after Manager Kim awoke her
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Then, do I have to assume that this guy has been attached to the
        direction of the Ascension Gate since the beginning of the
        regression...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps he came to watch me fight due to the commotion of my fight with
        the fox, observing me and my unique form of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>Then, it happens.</p>
      <p>'Huh?'</p>
      <p>
        While reading the Mad Lord's intent, I am able to glimpse his heart
        essence.
      </p>
      <p>'Ugh...'</p>
      <p>
        I silently mutter a chant upon sensing the darkness in his heart
        essence.
      </p>
      <p>His heart essence is a withered tree.</p>
      <p>
        The blackened withered tree rooted in the darkness, without a single ray
        of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only a thin, pinkish life force remains in the withered tree, barely
        supporting it, and it seems to collapse at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time the withered tree is about to fall, the madness in the Mad
        Lord's eyes seems to flare up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The darkness and dampness felt from the withered tree, and its pain
        makes even me furrow my brows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it’s less disgusting than the Bloodwood Practitioner, the dark
        despair is of a greater magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>'Such a rotten heart.'</p>
      <p>
        It’s when I was observing the Mad Lord's heart essence, I suddenly catch
        his gaze
      </p>
      <p>I’m startled.</p>
      <p>
        When I’m observing the Mad Lord’s heart essence, he seems to realize I'm
        looking at him and trembles.
      </p>
      <p>[What... you.]</p>
      <p>There’s a hint of panic in his eyes.</p>
      <p>The energy holding my body releases, and I’m able to speak.</p>
      <p>"Did you read my heart essence?"</p>
      <p>[You, did you just read my heart essence?]</p>
      <p>
        While we are staring blankly at each other, Mad Lord suddenly bursts
        into crazy laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hahaha! You see it. I don't know what you did to achieve it, but you
        can see heart essence too, right?]
      </p>
      <p>'What...'</p>
      <p>I can only open my mouth in astonishment.</p>
      <p>Did that mean the Mad Lord also reached Beyond the Path to Heaven?</p>
      <p>However, I had observed the Mad Lord's behavior several times.</p>
      <p>He showed no signs of having learned martial arts.</p>
      <p>
        To reach Beyond the Path to Heaven, I practiced martial arts for
        hundreds of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who honed martial arts for that long of a time, there are
        some things I learned to recognize and learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to my observations, the Mad Lord is neither a martial artist
        nor has he honed martial skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hahaha, amazing. Really amazing. Another being with the same vision as
        me exists in this world. I thought I'd have to ascend to a higher realm
        to meet such a person... I'm very pleased!]
      </p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>He grabs my head.</p>
      <p>
        It isn't a cultivation spell or technique, but simply manipulating the
        heaven and earth spiritual energy unique to the Heavenly Being stage.
      </p>
      <p>Then, the Mad Lord's consciousness invades mine.</p>
      <p>'Damn it...!'</p>
      <p>
        [I really like you. I'll welcome you into my world and evolve you into a
        more superior being. Studying you will bring me one step closer to
        reuniting with her...!]
      </p>
      <p>Shudder!</p>
      <p>I feel goosebumps all over my body.</p>
      <p>This man is planning on turning me into his puppet.</p>
      <p>
        The consciousness of the Heavenly Being cultivator, filled with madness,
        is invading my mind.
      </p>
      <p>I begin to lose control of my body.</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>
        Inside my upper dantian, deep within my soul, a blood-red light aries
        and the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner begins to react.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble, rumble!</p>
      <p>
        The blood-red light, embodying the transformation of the Five Elements,
        drives out the Mad Lord's consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>"Ughhh!"</p>
      <p>
        An immense pain wraps around my mind, but due to the pain, my
        consciousness remains clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Five Elements Blood Curse Banner both suppresses and protects my
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm?]</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord furrows his brows and then releases me.</p>
      <p>
        [Oh, where have I seen this spell before... Ah, yes. That curse used by
        the snake-like fellow in the Heaven-Treading Desert, right?]
      </p>
      <p>He looks into my eyes and asks.</p>
      <p>
        [What's your relationship with that Core Formation kid from the
        Heaven-Treading Desert?]
      </p>
      <p>"That is..."</p>
      <p>[No, never mind.]</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord doesn’t listen to me and grabs my head again, chuckling.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'll find out on my own. What's the point of talking with someone who
        hasn't evolved into a superior being yet.]
      </p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>Again, his consciousness invades my mind.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner is stimulated.</p>
      <p>".....!"</p>
      <p>I am engulfed in excruciating pain.</p>
      <p>Then, the Mad Lord activates some sort of technique.</p>
      <p>Flicker, flicker...</p>
      <p>
        Blue spell symbols appear in the air and suddenly fly off towards a
        direction away from Ascension Gate.
      </p>
      <p>'Is that a curse?'</p>
      <p>
        Having learned the Yin Soul Ghost Incantation, I recognize the type of
        those spell symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord uses the energy emitted by my Five Elements Blood Curse
        Banner to trace back to its origin and sends a curse in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmm, is it not related to that Core Formation youngster? The roots are
        the same, but the reaction isn't strong. Ah, right. They’re probably
        from the same sect as that Core Formation youngster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haha, as expected, I'm a genius. Isn't that right, my wife? Thank you,
        you are truly beautiful.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord mumbles to himself, then reaches out into the empty air,
        caressing it as if touching a beloved.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought there might be something, but I couldn't sense anything with
        demon senses, the flow of intent, or heart essence.
      </p>
      <p>It seems like just an imaginary person in the Mad Lord's mind.</p>
      <p>'Damn it, to be caught by this crazy old man.'</p>
      <p>Do I have to be captured like this?</p>
      <p>
        I grit my teeth in front of the lunatic gazing distantly into the air
        with madness.
      </p>
      <p>Then, an idea crosses my mind.</p>
      <p>
        "Senior, I have something to report. The Core Formation youngster you
        mentioned, the one called Bloodwood Practitioner, is actually a
        disguised Nascent Soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        He’s waiting for the Heavenly Being cultivators to ascend, then plans on
        devouring this world. Isn't it unwise to leave such an ambitious person
        unchecked?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ah, are you talking about the treaty made under Seo Hweol's
        initiative?]
      </p>
      <p>The Mad Lord seems to come back to his senses and looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        [But so what? Even if his heart essence is filthy, Seo Hweol or others
        will take care of it.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Senior, if your relatives or clan are abused by the Bloodwood
        Practitioner, will it not be regrettable?
      </p>
      <p>[Ah, clan?]</p>
      <p>Ka ka ka</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord chuckles and says.</p>
      <p>
        [I eradicated my clan with my own hands hundreds of years ago. Why
        should I worry about it?]
      </p>
      <p>'What...'</p>
      <p>I am at a loss for words in my confusion.</p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord's eyes, speaking of his clan, are somehow filled with anger.
      </p>
      <p>His eyes, filled with rage, appear clear, devoid of madness.</p>
      <p>
        [The only being meaningful to me was her. The clan that killed her no
        longer exists on this earth. Why should I worry about such things?]
      </p>
      <p>I peer into the Mad Lord's heart essence.</p>
      <p>The darkness in his heart essence deepens, boiling as if alive.</p>
      <p>
        [But thank you. It's been a while since I've thought about those
        detestable things.]
      </p>
      <p>Tap, tap...</p>
      <p>He taps his head a few times.</p>
      <p>His eyes full of rage are seemingly clear of madness.</p>
      <p>
        [Anyway, if you possess the same spell as that Core Formation kid...
        Does that mean he might have something similar to you if I delve
        deeper?]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord strokes his chin and then extends his hand into the air.
      </p>
      <p>Flicker!</p>
      <p>
        A blue light flashes in the air, recalling the curse he had just
        launched.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>The curse lits up.</p>
      <p>
        [Yes, first I should extract his soul and study it. Now that I think
        about it, that Core Formation kid's consciousness was quite large...]
      </p>
      <p>Creak...</p>
      <p>He grasps the air tightly.</p>
      <p>The blue curse begins to turn red as if soaked in blood.</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>[Hmmm?]</p>
      <p>Mad Lord looks up at the sky.</p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble...</p>
      <p>Dark clouds gather in the sky and raindrops begin to fall.</p>
      <p>His gaze turns to the Deputy Manager Oh Hye-Seo.</p>
      <p>
        [What's this now? Summoning the wind and rain is the power of the Sea
        Dragon Tribe... Why is that girl using it? Also...]
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        A streak of blue lightning strikes, and suddenly, a fine young man in
        blue robes with a kind smile and a dignified air enters the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Who is this? Isn't this the Scorpion-Snake King, Seo Hweol? Hahaha, I
        heard he was planning to come late, but why rush here so crazily?]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, Mad Old Man. The reason for my delayed start was because there’s
        a child in my tribe who needs to stay in the lower realm. I was going to
        take care of him, but after talking, I realized he's strong enough to
        forge his own path..."
      </p>
      <p>[Enough with the small talk, get to the point.]</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>Mad Lord tightens his grip on the air.</p>
      <p>The curse he had cast turns even redder.</p>
      <p>Seo Hweol smiles kindly and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "Mad Old Man, don't intimidate these young ones. Why don't you release
        the one you're holding and ease up on those you're tormenting?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmm... So you rushed here because that Core Formation youngster from
        the desert is about to die. What are you scheming, you snake-like man?]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Mad Old Man, as a senior, isn't it unseemly to torment the weak? Let's
        release them and stop this now."
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol also reaches out and twist the air, and the curse that had
        turned red gradually shifts back to blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Is Yuan Li currently being strangled in the grasp of Heavenly Being
        cultivators?'
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter if Ascension Path lies above the Heaven-Treading Desert, the
        distance to the black castle where Yuan Li would be is hundreds of
        miles. Yet, they cross it instantly and are now fighting over him.
      </p>
      <p>'This is the power of a Heavenly Being cultivator...'</p>
      <p>
        "It would be wise to stop now, considering the unexpected calamity that
        has already injured him."
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>The curse cast by Mad Lord begins to fade.</p>
      <p>It’s clear that Mad Lord is being overpowered by Seo Hweol.</p>
      <p>Mad Lord chuckles and pulls out a small wooden box from his waist.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The box enlarges and falls beside the Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>
        [So you think my true power is inferior to yours and dare mock me? Fine,
        shall we have a go?]
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol's expression stiffens for a moment but then returns to normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Mad Old Man, how about we save such uninteresting discussions for after
        ascension? The Ascension Gate will open in a few days. Wouldn't it be
        better to avoid such actions during this auspicious time?
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of engaging in such inauspicious activities, why not talk a
        little about these talented individuals here?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol smiles kindly and pats Deputy Manager Oh Hye-Seo and my
        shoulders with one hand each.
      </p>
      <p>Unable to bear it any longer, I vomi.</p>
      <p>Ugh -</p>
      <p>
        I haven't eaten anything, so nothing came up but bile. Still, it was
        repulsive.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, it’s more than just revolting; the darkness is beyond imagination.
      </p>
      <p>'Insane, how can…this be a normal being's heart essence?'</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord's heart essence is a blackened withered tree, but Seo
        Hweol's heart essence, seen after reaching Beyond the Path to Heaven, is
        even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the Mad Lord's withered tree has a thread-like vitality, Seo
        Hweol's heart essence lacks any hint of hope.
      </p>
      <p>Everything is dark, dreary, revolting, and filthy.</p>
      <p>
        Beyond heartless and shameless, his heart essence seems like a monster
        wearing a human mask.
      </p>
      <p>Evil (惡).</p>
      <p>He is the embodiment of endless malice.</p>
      <p>A vast darkness incomparable even to Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>That is Seo Hweol.</p>
      <p>
        "Oh my, Mad Old Man. Look, the young ones can't withstand the aura of
        Heavenly Being cultivators and are suffering..."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hweol says to the Mad Lord, looking pitifully at me vomiting.</p>
      <p>
        However, the Mad Lord chuckles knowingly, as if he understands why I am
        vomiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Haha, what a masterpiece. Do you think he's retching because of our
        aura? Maybe he's nauseous from seeing something so disgusting. I feel
        like vomiting every time I see your face, so what about these 'fragile
        juniors'? You broken monster.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "I never quite understand what you're saying. Anyway, since this junior
        seems to catch your fancy, Mad Old Man, why not take him as your
        disciple? As for this young lady, she resonates with my bloodline and
        wields a unique power, so I intend to welcome her into the Sea Dragon
        Tribe."
      </p>
      <p>
        [You snake-like man, always changing the subject. What are you scheming
        with that Core Formation youngster from the desert, you filth...!]
      </p>
      <p>Creak...</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord begins to open the lid of the box.</p>
      <p>
        With the absence of other Heavenly Being cultivators and facing the Sea
        Dragon King alone, he shows no hesitation in opening it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Mad Lord, are you truly intending to bring down Ascension Path...!?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [If getting rid of one Ascension Path can clean up filth, it's not a bad
        deal. Even if there's trouble with the Ascension Gate, there's always
        the blessing of the Serving Command Seal, so what's the problem...?]
      </p>
      <p>Creak, click!</p>
      <p>And then, the Mad Lord's box fully opens.</p>
      <p>The next moment.</p>
      <p>'Many things' burst out of the Mad Lord's box.</p>
      <p>The Sea Dragon King is seen casting spells in haste.</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>'What?'</p>
      <p>Slosh, slosh...</p>
      <p>I look around in confusion.</p>
      <p>Water.</p>
      <p>It’s water.</p>
      <p>The entire Ascension Path is suddenly covered in water.</p>
      <p>
        Both I and my colleagues are caught off guard by the sudden flood over
        Ascension Path, opening our eyes wide and floundering.
      </p>
      <p>Roarrr!</p>
      <p>The water is not just there idly.</p>
      <p>
        There are currents in the water, and my colleagues and I are scattered
        in all directions in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>'What's happening...'</p>
      <p>Mad Lord opened the box, and Seo Hweol had done something as well.</p>
      <p>As I try to make sense of the situation.</p>
      <p>[Hahahahahaha!]</p>
      <p>
        Celestial energy resounds, and Mad Lord's voice spreads throughout the
        water.
      </p>
      <p>
        [To perform such a water technique in a place without water. Truly, you
        are the Sea Dragon King. Are you trying to protect Ascension Path from
        crumbling?
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't even released half of my Heavenly Being puppets, and only
        eight of [Her] limbs. Do you really think the entire Sea Dragon Tribe
        can handle me and [Her]?]
      </p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble!</p>
      <p>I feel like I’m going to lose my mind.</p>
      <p>
        The celestial energy boils of its own accord, reacting to the power of
        Mad Lord and Seo Hweol.
      </p>
      <p>'Is the entire Ascension Path now covered by Seo Hweol's spell?'</p>
      <p>
        Although Ascension Path is known as a forest, it's not small in size.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a massive territory, comparable to several cities of Yanguo put
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m astounded by the scale of Seo Hweol's spell, yet I have the feeling
        that he is currently being overpowered.
      </p>
      <p>
        [There. [She] has emerged up to the shoulders. Shouldn't the entire Sea
        Dragon Tribe appear by now?]
      </p>
      <p>Beyond the sky.</p>
      <p>
        Somewhere unseen, Seo Hweol and the Mad Lord are engaging in a fierce
        battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even amidst this, Ascension Path is thrown into chaos by Seo Hweol's
        spell, covered in water.
      </p>
      <p>'I need to find my colleagues.'</p>
      <p>
        I stretch out the Formless Sword in the water to stabilize myself and
        begin searching for my colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>'I saw Kim Young-hoon, there. And Jeon Myeong-hoon too.'</p>
      <p>
        I locate each of them in turn: Kang Min-hee, Oh Hyun-seok, Kim Yeon, and
        Oh Hye-seo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo seems to be affected by the power
        of the Sea Dragon King, shedding bloody tears and clutching her head.
      </p>
      <p>'Damn, what a mess this is.'</p>
      <p>
        I gather my colleagues who couldn’t breathe underwater, press their
        acupoints to help them last a bit longer in the water, and forcibly
        expel the water filled in their lungs with internal energy.
      </p>
      <p>'We have to hold on.'</p>
      <p>
        We have to wait until the end of the monstrous fight between those
        characters.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble...</p>
      <p>Somewhere above in the sky, covered by dark clouds.</p>
      <p>
        There, I sense the presence of other formidable beings gathering besides
        Mad Lord and Seo Hweol.
      </p>
      <p>'This aura...'</p>
      <p>
        Heavenly Being cultivators are flocking to the area above Ascension
        Path, sensing the anomaly.
      </p>
      <p>Not long after.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The water covering the entire Ascension Path drains away, and the dark
        clouds evaporate.
      </p>
      <p>Crackle, crackle!</p>
      <p>
        From the center of the dark clouds, Jin Byuk-ho in a golden robe is
        scattering golden lightning, evaporating the dark clouds like the sun.
      </p>
      <p>Shortly after, familiar faces appear beyond the sky.</p>
      <p>
        Centered around the Mad Lord, who has closed the lid of the box, are:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sea Dragon King Seo Hweol, Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect’s
        Master Jin Byuk-ho, Black Bone Valley's Grand Elder White Bone Ghost
        Devil Heo Gwak, Heaven Creation Sect’s founder and Cheungmun Clan’s
        ancestor Sir Chang-ho.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, there is a plump woman in white, a dried-up and irritable
        middle-aged man in brown, a rugged man in green with a beard like a
        lion's mane, and a skeletal, thin woman in black with long nails.
      </p>
      <p>
        [To have the masters of Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, Black Bone
        Valley, Heaven Creation Sect, Sea Dragon Tribe, Mighty Tiger Tribe, Holy
        Peng Tribe, Righteous Path Alliance, and Devil Path Alliance all
        gathered around this old man. What an honor.]
      </p>
      <p>The Mad Lord chuckles and looks around.</p>
      <p>The cultivators begin to speak one by one.</p>
      <p>
        [Don't cross the line, Mad Lord! If Ascension Path falls, who knows what
        will happen to the Ascension Gate! How can you be so arrogant!]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Why are you so reckless! If it weren't for the Sea Dragon King,
        Ascension Path and the Ascension Gate would have crumbled, crushing the
        dreams of countless Heavenly Being cultivators! Do you not know, or do
        you not care?]
      </p>
      <p>
        [You insane old man, we were about to let you be during this auspicious
        time, but you dare to bring 'that' out in Ascension Path? Do you think
        you'll be safe when we all come together?]
      </p>
      <p>
        Even amidst numerous Heavenly Being cultivators, Mad Lord just smirks
        and lays his hand on the box again.
      </p>
      <p>At this, all the Heavenly Being cultivators in the sky jolt.</p>
      <p>
        [Of course, if all your forces unite, I wouldn't stand a chance. But I'm
        prepared to self-destruct with [Her] at any time. Do you have such
        resolve?]
      </p>
      <p>[Eek, a senile old man saying things...!]</p>
      <p>
        The standoff between the Mad Lord and the group of Heavenly Beings
        continue for a while, until the Sea Dragon King begins to mediate with a
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Let's not do this, everyone. What's the gain in such behavior during
        this auspicious time?
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Old Man, wouldn't it be more beneficial for you to ascend to the
        higher realms for your lover?]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sea Dragon King goes around among the Heavenly Beings, mediating,
        and after a while, they seem to reach an agreement and form a
        non-aggression pact with the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho suddenly looks down below and locks eyes with Jeon
        Myung-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>[What, wait... is this...]</p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho, along with White Bone Ghost Devil and Sir Chang-ho, look
        down and repeat the same actions as before.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, however, along with Seo Hweol and the Mad Lord, the leaders
        of the Righteous and Devil Path Alliances, the Mighty Tiger Tribe, and
        Holy Peng Tribe are also present.
      </p>
      <p>
        They, too, recognize the talents of my colleagues and show interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ha, is this the Heavenly Golden Thunder Body from the Golden Divine
        Heavenly Thunder Sect's legend? The one that Golden Thunderbearer Yang
        Su-jin had? I'm somewhat interested too...]
      </p>
      <p>
        [The Ghostly Yin Transformation Immortal Root, huh? Rather than entering
        Black Bone Valley, I can teach her well as my disciple...]
      </p>
      <p>
        The leaders of the Righteous and Demonic Path Alliances eye Jeon
        Myeong-hoon and Kang Min-Hee, while the leaders of the Holy Peng and
        Mighty Tiger tribes drool over Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>[A human born with the Unique Holy Body? Ha, indeed...]</p>
      <p>
        [If given the True Origin Blood of the Mighty Tiger Tribe, we will
        welcome him as one of us...]
      </p>
      <p>However, Jin Byuk-ho growls and grabs Jeon Myeong-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        [You ragtag bunch, daring to snatch away a prospective disciple of my
        sect...? Knowing he has the same constitution as my sect founder? Do you
        really want to be at odds with my sect?]
      </p>
      <p>[Hm, Sect Master Jin. It's not like that...]</p>
      <p>
        [Just leave. Wait quietly in front of the Ascension Gate until it
        opens.]
      </p>
      <p>
        White Bone Ghost Devil also gives an eerie smile, watching the Demonic
        Path Alliance's leader who eyes Kang Min-Hee.
      </p>
      <p>[This child is destined to enter our valley.]</p>
      <p>[Must all talented individuals only go to Black Bone Valley...]</p>
      <p>[Do you want to taste the Nether Crossing Ship?]</p>
      <p>[Eek... Dog-like Black Bone Valley folks. Fine, do as you please!]</p>
      <p>
        The leaders of the Righteous and Demonic Path Alliances back away,
        unable to say anything in front of Jin Byuk-ho and White Bone Ghost
        Devil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mighty Tiger King and Holy Peng King eye Chief Oh with interest, but
        when Sir Chang-ho clears his throat, they avert their eyes from him and
        force an awkward smile.
      </p>
      <p>[Hehe... We can't upset the Cheongmun Ancestor.]</p>
      <p>[Yes, if it's Sir Chang-ho, he'll nurture him well.]</p>
      <p>
        However, Holy Peng King and Mighty Tiger King turn their attention back
        to Deputy Manager Oh Hye-Seo.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is bleeding through the seven orifices and seemed to cause not just
        the storm but also another phenomena.
      </p>
      <p>
        They can't tell exactly what it is, but greed is evident in the eyes of
        Holy Peng King and Mighty Tiger King.
      </p>
      <p>
        [After all, this woman seems to directly use the powers of a demon
        beast…]
      </p>
      <p>[It seems like an extraordinary trait for our demon race…]</p>
      <p>
        They approach Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo, but Seo Hweol subtly blocks
        them with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Seo Hweol speaks, they listen for a moment, nod their heads, and step
        back.
      </p>
      <p>[If that's what the Sea Dragon King suggests…]</p>
      <p>
        [Indeed, with the abilities of the Sea Dragon King, he can indeed better
        bring out the demon beast traits of this woman.]
      </p>
      <p>Eventually, everything flows as per destined fate.</p>
      <p>All colleagues go with their designated Heavenly Being cultivators.</p>
      <p>
        Among the Heavenly Being cultivators who are weaker in this competition,
        they can only suck their fingers in envy, watching the talented ones
        being taken by the stronger ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, when the members are distributed, the remaining ones turn their
        eyes to me, Kim Young-hoon, and Manager Kim Yeon.
      </p>
      <p>[Anyway, do those remaining have some other hidden talents…]</p>
      <p>
        [That human guy, despite being of human lineage, possesses a Demon
        Core…]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Maybe a demi-human? Let's scrutinize each one. We might discover some
        incredible talents…]
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the Heavenly Being cultivators reach out to us. Kim Young-hoon,
        Manager Kim Yeon, and I scream as our bodies are searched with celestial
        energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this, Manager Kim Yeon awakens her consciousness and becomes the
        disciple of the plump lady in white, the leader of the Righteous Path
        Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon and I are squeezed and oppressed in consciousness by
        other Heavenly Being cultivators, suffering all kinds of hardships.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, upon examination, I am deemed to have just a slightly unique
        constitution but no special talents, and Kim Young-Hoon is judged to be
        a normal mortal with no special constitution.
      </p>
      <p>Sir Chang-ho treats us, bringing the incident to a conclusion.</p>
      <p>
        [Unfortunately, these two don't seem to have any notable talents, so we
        should just leave them.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [This unique constitution is a bit interesting... how did a human come
        to possess a Demon Core…]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enough. Even if it's an unusual constitution, it's not mythically
        talented enough to be worth taking. Let's just go.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Beings chatter and soon prepare to fly back through the
        Ascension Gate.
      </p>
      <p>‘Damn, everything's been chaotic since the beginning of this life.’</p>
      <p>I frown, holding my head slightly.</p>
      <p>‘But there's something I shouldn't forget…’</p>
      <p>
        I am about to talk about the Bloodwood Practitioner, Yuan Li, hiding in
        the Heaven-Treading Desert.
      </p>
      <p>"Seniors, perhaps in the Heaven-Treading Desert, the Bloodwood..."</p>
      <p>Thump-</p>
      <p>It is then.</p>
      <p>The Sea Dragon King approaches and pats my shoulder familiarly.</p>
      <p>
        "This King knows him too. Despite being a human, he's ambitious and
        knows many interesting techniques. This king even learned a spell from
        him... It seems you too have inherited that spell."
      </p>
      <p>Shiver!</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a chill runs through my body.</p>
      <p>
        If I talk about the Bloodwood Practitioner, I'll be killed by the Sea
        Dragon King right now.
      </p>
      <p>There is no urge to kill in his eyes.</p>
      <p>Nor in his intent.</p>
      <p>But perhaps it’s intuition.</p>
      <p>It’s warning me of ominousness.</p>
      <p>Gulp...</p>
      <p>
        The Sea Dragon King pats my shoulder with a kind face and stands up.
      </p>
      <p>
        "As you have a demi-human lineage, this King cannot ignore you. Take
        this. It's a demon beast method suitable for demi-humans to learn. In
        exchange for this method, I'd like to ask a simple favor... Is that
        alright?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol shows a kind smile, extending Summoning Wind, Dragon
        Transformation, and the space-breaking bead to me.
      </p>
      <p>"...I understand. Thank you."</p>
      <p>I silently receive the method, dharma treasure, and task from him.</p>
      <p>Everything proceeds as fated.</p>
      <p>
        I can't say anything, and all my colleagues are captured by their
        predetermined captors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Manager Kim is unusually taken by the lady in white this time, but Mad
        Lord frequently glances towards the plump lady in white and Manager Kim
        Yeon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a feeling that the woman, the leader of the Righteous Path
        Alliance, will not live long.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord licks his lips at me but, this time, surrounded by numerous
        Heavenly Beings, flies obediently towards the Ascension Gate.
      </p>
      <p>Whooosh-</p>
      <p>A storm sweeps over us.</p>
      <p>‘...Still, something has changed.’</p>
      <p>
        This time, no one sent Kim Young-hoon and me through a spatial rift.
      </p>
      <p>Also, the fox's Demon Core remains in my hand.</p>
      <p>
        When the Heavenly Being cultivator of the Devil Path Alliance tried to
        snatch my Demon Core, Sir Chang-ho warned him not to rob a junior,
        saving it for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for Kim Young-hoon and me being abandoned in Ascension Path and
        the fox's Demon Core remaining with me, everything went as fate
        dictated.
      </p>
      <p>
        I calmly reassure the confused Kim Young-hoon, then look at the Demon
        Core in my hand.
      </p>
      <p>Within the Demon Core, immense spiritual energy is condensed.</p>
      <p>
        As it’s created by a Core Formation demon, absorbing the energy inside
        can grant me immense spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        I close my eyes, sit cross-legged holding the Demon Core, and begin
        absorbing the energy from within.
      </p>
      <p>Half a year passes in Ascension Path</p>
      <p>Rumble, Crack, Crackling!</p>
      <p>
        I look at the dark clouds scattered by my Formless Sword in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Celestial energy changes, granting me 300 years of lifespan.</p>
      <p>
        I succeed in absorbing the mid Core Formation fox's Demon Core,
        recovering to the 1st Constellation of Qi Building and creating the Horn
        Spiritual Star.

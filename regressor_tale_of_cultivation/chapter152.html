      <p>Chapter 152: Azure Heaven Creation Sect (3)</p>
      <p>Starlight Protecting Void Body.</p>
      <p>
        I skimmed through the essentials of the method and realized something.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This method, it seems it is only the middle part without the beginning
        or the end?"
      </p>
      <p>At my words, Azure Tiger Saint chuckles and strokes his beard.</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, you have a keen eye. Indeed, the original method is divided into
        three parts."
      </p>
      <p>He continues his explanation.</p>
      <p>
        "Azure Spirit Striking Origin Technique, responsible for attack and
        explosive power. Starlight Protecting Void Body, in charge of defense
        and stability. Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture, tasked with
        endurance, healing power, and regenerative ability. These three methods
        each represent the beginning, middle, and end of the original method."
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A blue light flickers above Azure Tiger Saint’s hand.</p>
      <p>It’s the life and healing energy of Wood spiritual energy.</p>
      <p>
        "Disciples of Azure Heaven Creation Sect typically begin their training
        with the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture, divided into five
        separate methods. They start by mastering methods corresponding to the
        attributes of the Five Elements. Once they become proficient, they move
        on to the Starlight Protecting Void Body. Finally, they are introduced
        to the Azure Spirit Striking Origin Technique. Upon reaching a certain
        level of mastery in these methods, they begin the formal transmission of
        the combined original method, the Azure Spirit Starlight Quintessence
        Great Method. As my direct disciple, I've observed your potential and
        decided to start your instruction directly with the Starlight Protecting
        Void Body"
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>After bowing to the Azure Tiger Saint, curiosity strikes me.</p>
      <p>
        "By the way, is it possible to know what teachings Chief Oh, no, Senior
        Brother Oh... is practicing?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, you mean Oh Hyun-seok?"</p>
      <p>
        After pondering for a moment, Azure Tiger Saint shows a somewhat
        mischievous smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It might be a bit unpleasant to hear for you, but he will be directly
        taught the Azure Spirit Starlight Quintessence Great Method soon."
      </p>
      <p>"Hoo."</p>
      <p>
        "Indeed, a Unique Holy Body is a Unique Holy Body after all. Even though
        his combat sense is still far inferior to yours, after getting beaten
        and healing repeatedly, his body quickly becomes stronger. The plan is
        to see how resilient he becomes without teaching him any techniques
        through sparring first, and then start teaching him the proper methods
        afterward."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        In other words, he’s saying that he will continue to beat Chief Oh up in
        the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I thought Chief Oh, who went to Azure Tiger Saint, would at least have
        the most enjoyable time..'
      </p>
      <p>
        It appears getting beaten up crazily will be the norm until he reaches
        the right state.
      </p>
      <p>
        After awkwardly greeting Azure Tiger Saint, who was quite excited about
        the prospect of beating up Chief Oh Hyun-seok, I took the stele with the
        Starlight Protecting Void Body written on it and returned to my place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading through the Starlight Protecting Void Body, I realized it’s no
        simple method.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Even if the spiritual energy of the Bright Cold Realm is abundant, I
        shouldn't overestimate my talent.'
      </p>
      <p>I have long understood the limits of my talent.</p>
      <p>
        How long will it take for a body like mine to properly learn the method?
      </p>
      <p>After pondering for a moment, I remember Azure Tiger Saint’s words.</p>
      <p>
        <em
          >'Disciples of Azure Heaven Creation Sect typically begin their
          training with the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture, divided
          into five separate methods.’</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>That means,</p>
      <p>
        Before learning the Starlight Protecting Void Body, it will be helpful
        to learn the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Right, instead of trying to learn everything at once, let's try it step
        by step.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I first go to look for the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture by
        visiting the Scripture Pavilion of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Let's see, the Scripture Pavilion was said to have been settled a few
        months ago...'
      </p>
      <p>Azure Heaven Creation Sect’s Summoning Peak.</p>
      <p>I head there to find the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture.</p>
      <p>And, as I walk towards Summoning Peak,</p>
      <p>"...?"</p>
      <p>I can see something strange.</p>
      <p>'Why does the Scripture Pavilion seem to be moving...?'</p>
      <p>When I cautiously arrive at the 'bustling' library,</p>
      <p>I see an unbelievable scene.</p>
      <p>"Senior…brother?"</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>Beneath the Scripture Pavilion building.</p>
      <p>
        There, a muscular man is puffing his breath, lifting the entire
        Scripture Pavilion up and down, training his upper body.
      </p>
      <p>A single blue cloud is engraved on his pants.</p>
      <p>
        Disciples of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect are classified by clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        A newly initiated disciple wears clothes with five clouds, known as a
        Five-Cloud disciple.
      </p>
      <p>
        A disciple who received some teachings and reached the Qi Refining stage
        is a Four-Cloud disciple.
      </p>
      <p>A disciple at the Qi Building stage is a Three-Cloud disciple.</p>
      <p>A Core Formation stage disciple is a Two-Cloud disciple.</p>
      <p>
        And a Nascent Soul stage disciple is treated as a One-Cloud disciple.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the One-Cloud disciple onwards, one has the privilege to challenge
        for the position of an elder in the Azure Heaven Creation Sect, a
        tremendously prestigious status.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality, the elders of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect are One-Cloud
        disciples, the class of disciples leading the sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Heavenly Being elders onwards, they wear only blue robes
        signifying the Azure Heaven (Azure Sky) without any clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...And Azure Tiger Saint, at the Four-Axis stage, simply goes around
        without a shirt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chief Oh Hyun-seok and I, in terms of cultivation realm, are actually
        Five-Cloud disciples, but thanks to our status as the direct disciples
        of Azure Tiger Saint, we are allowed to bear the Two-Cloud pattern.
      </p>
      <p>"Kuhuuuu..."</p>
      <p>
        At my call, the One-Cloud disciple training his upper body with the
        Scripture Pavilion building,
      </p>
      <p>A person named Cheon Hoon (踐薰) looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, aren't you the new disciple of the Ancestor? Let me see... in terms
        of seniority, what should I call you? ...Hmm, I'm not sure. Well, I'll
        just call you junior. Junior, what brings you to the Scripture
        Pavilion?"
      </p>
      <p>
        While holding up the building with one arm, he asks me, wiping sweat
        with the other.
      </p>
      <p>I cautiously ask, witnessing the terrifying sight.</p>
      <p>
        "...I came looking for the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture
        divided into five methods to learn..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, so you came for that. Haha, being the direct disciple of the
        Ancestor, you could start with higher methods, but it's nice to see you
        laying a solid foundation. Go to the second floor of the Scripture
        Pavilion, right at the entrance, the third yellow bookshelf, third
        compartment. Those are the basic methods of the Azure Heaven Creation
        Sect, so there's no problem in copying them to take away. However, if
        you want to take other scriptures, you need to prove your eligibility."
      </p>
      <p>"Prove eligibility?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, in the sect, it's discouraged for those unqualified to learn the
        methods. So, to learn higher methods, one must pass a test."
      </p>
      <p>"And how does one take this test?"</p>
      <p>At my question, Cheon Hoon grins and replies.</p>
      <p>
        "Simple. Bring the scripture to the librarian. After the librarian
        judges the importance of the scripture, you have to win a spar against
        them. Usually, for Qi Refining and Qi Building stage scriptures, if you
        win an arm wrestling match against the librarian, you're allowed to take
        them."
      </p>
      <p>"...And who is this librarian of the Scripture Pavilion?"</p>
      <p>
        I ask cautiously, inwardly hoping it wasn't the person in front of me.
      </p>
      <p>However, Cheon Hoon chuckled as if to say, ‘why even ask?’</p>
      <p>"Of course, it's me, why are you even asking?"</p>
      <p>
        I look at Cheon Hoon, who is flexing his muscles while holding the
        Scripture Pavilion with one hand.
      </p>
      <p>'Arm wrestle him to take the scripture?'</p>
      <p>Was this a way of saying not to cultivate?</p>
      <p>Noticing my gaze, Cheon Hoon continues.</p>
      <p>
        "Ah, just in case you're overly worried, for Qi Refining scriptures, you
        normally just need to beat my pinky finger in arm wrestling to take
        them. I'll only use my pinky, and you can use your whole body."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>I look at Cheon Hoon's pinky finger.</p>
      <p>It’s thicker than my thumb.</p>
      <p>
        "...So, I can just take the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture
        without any competition?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, of course. But you see, I'm in the middle of my upper body
        training, and it's a bit troublesome to put the building down. Could you
        just go in?"
      </p>
      <p>"...Yes, alright."</p>
      <p>With a leap, I jumped up and landed at the entrance held high.</p>
      <p>From below, Cheon Hoon's voice reaches me.</p>
      <p>
        "Thanks for understanding. And since I'll be lifting and lowering the
        pavilion a little for my upper body training, the Scripture Pavilion
        might shake a bit, just so you know."
      </p>
      <p>"...Do as you please."</p>
      <p>
        After giving up on understanding Cheon Hoon, I went up to the Scripture
        Pavilion's upper floor.
      </p>
      <p>Shortly after.</p>
      <p>
        I found the books titled 'Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture' at
        the place Cheon Hoon mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture is divided into 5 basic
        methods just like the Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation, with each
        representing a different element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fire Path Enduring Origin Scripture, Water Path Enduring Origin
        Scripture, Wood Path Enduring Origin Scripture, Metal Path Enduring
        Origin Scripture, Earth Path Enduring Origin Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first unfolded each of the scriptures and learned all the essentials.
      </p>
      <p>'So this is the feel of it...'</p>
      <p>
        After embedding all the essences in my head, I reached out for other
        methods on a different bookshelf.
      </p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>All the other scriptures have restrictions placed on them.</p>
      <p>Just when I pick up another book.</p>
      <p>
        [Ah, junior. If you wish to learn that, win an arm wrestling match
        against me, and I'll teach you how to lift the restriction.]
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        I quietly placed the book back in its original spot and left the
        Scripture Pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you for the help, senior brother. If I need to find something
        else in the future, I'll come to visit after learning these methods."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, do as you please. Oh, and if you're going to learn the Five
        Elements Enduring Origin Scripture, you might as well get some help at
        the Five Elements Hall."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheon Hoon points towards five mountain peaks far away with one hand.
      </p>
      <p>"You know what the Five Elements Hall is, right?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, I'm aware. It's said to be the place where the Azure Heaven
        Creation Sect's body cultivation is most actively conducted. A place to
        learn the body refining methods corresponding to each element."
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's right, that's right. Many senior brothers there started with the
        Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture, and they'll all be willing to
        help you with a good heart."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, thank you."</p>
      <p>I thanked Cheon Hoon.</p>
      <p>
        I had a rough idea of what the Five Elements Hall is, but I have never
        been there before.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took time to move the locations that were previously in the Head
        Realm to Azure Cold Island, so it was only recently restored.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        I left Cheon Hoon training with the Scripture Pavilion and went to find
        the Five Elements Hall.
      </p>
      <p>Five Elements Hall.</p>
      <p>Fire Path Body Training Hall.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>I instantly realize something is wrong.</p>
      <p>"Kahaha! Stoke the flames hotter!"</p>
      <p>"Arghhhhhh!"</p>
      <p>"Senior brothers, please spare us!"</p>
      <p>
        "Come on, what are you doing? Roast all the new recruits we've received
        this time!"
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Ever heard of burning at the stake?</p>
      <p>
        Setting up a log, tying a criminal to it, then stacking lots of firewood
        below and setting it on fire as a form of punishment and execution.
      </p>
      <p>And.</p>
      <p>
        At the Five Elements Hall, Fire Path Body Training Hall, supposedly to
        learn the Fire Path Enduring Origin Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        They had just tied up the disciples who had recently joined Azure Heaven
        Creation Sect and possessed the Fire Spiritual Root, to a row of logs,
        and were lighting fires under them.
      </p>
      <p>"I-I want to go back! I didn't know it was like this!"</p>
      <p>
        "Quiet! Everyone from the Head Realm got strong this way, that's why we
        have the mighty Azure Heaven Creation Sect of today! The spiritual
        energy of heaven and earth is dense in the Bright Cold Realm, so it
        should be even more effective! Light the fire!"
      </p>
      <p>"Arghhhhhh!"</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I dumbfoundedly watch the Qi Refining stage disciples being roasted by
        fire in the Fire Path Body Training Hall.
      </p>
      <p>Splash!</p>
      <p>
        And then, I turned my head towards the Core Formation stage Two-Cloud
        disciples training nearby.
      </p>
      <p>Crater!</p>
      <p>There’s a volcanic crater with lava boiling fiercely.</p>
      <p>"Everyone, dive in!"</p>
      <p>
        And the Two-Cloud disciples of the Fire Path Body Training Hall dove
        into the lava as soon as the One-Cloud disciples commanded them to dive.
      </p>
      <p>Splash, splash, splash!</p>
      <p>
        The Two-Cloud disciples went inside the lava and didn't surface for a
        while.
      </p>
      <p>"What's this! Why aren't they coming up!?"</p>
      <p>"They're all flowing away! Cheon Hae, pull them up!"</p>
      <p>"Yes!"</p>
      <p>
        A female disciple full of muscles and without a hint of hesitation dove
        into the lava, pulling out the Two-Cloud disciples whose bodies are
        red-hot from the heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        After watching the scene for a moment, I immediately run away from the
        Fire Path Body Training Hall.
      </p>
      <p>"It turns out the Fire Path doesn’t quite suit me after all.”</p>
      <p>
        I move towards the Metal Path Body Training Hall located on the adjacent
        peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Metal Path Body Training Hall is, of course, different from the Fire
        Path Body Training Hall.
      </p>
      <p>"Arghhh! Senior brothers, I don't want to die!"</p>
      <p>"Please spare us!"</p>
      <p>
        The newly initiated disciples were tied up with ropes, slowly being
        lowered into a small pit.
      </p>
      <p>Kagagagagagak!</p>
      <p>Kagagak!</p>
      <p>Kagagakak!</p>
      <p>
        Upon closer inspection, inside the pit where the disciples are entering,
        there are thousands of small shark-like fish with sharp teeth swarming.
      </p>
      <p>"Everyone, utilize the Metal Path Enduring Origin Scripture!"</p>
      <p>
        "Being bitten by the Gold-Tooth Sharks will allow you to feel the power
        of the Metal Spirit. If you grasp that feeling well and utilize the
        technique accordingly, there will be no problem!"
      </p>
      <p>"Arghhhhh! Stop talking nonsense! Crazy..."</p>
      <p>Splash!</p>
      <p>
        One of the Five-Cloud disciples who was panicking fell right into the
        midst of the Gold-Tooth Sharks.
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        Surprisingly, the Five-Cloud disciple, even while being bitten by the
        fish, did not die.
      </p>
      <p>
        He manages to survive, somehow thrashing madly inside, utilizing metal
        energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hurriedly leave the Metal Path Body Training Hall without looking
        back.
      </p>
      <p>'Are the other training halls like this?'</p>
      <p>It seems likely.</p>
      <p>
        '...Anyway, just in case there's a training method that suits me, I
        should at least look around.'
      </p>
      <p>I take a deep breath and head to the next hall.</p>
      <p>Water Path Body Training Hall.</p>
      <p>Splash!</p>
      <p>"Rrrghrghrgh!"</p>
      <p>
        Compared to the previous brutally harsh training halls, this one is
        visually more stable.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the Five-Cloud disciples at the Water Path Body Training Hall
        were dragged deep underwater by senior disciples, undergoing training to
        withstand immense water pressure.
      </p>
      <p>'...The depth is so great that it's out of sight.'</p>
      <p>"Next, go in!"</p>
      <p>
        "Wait a moment, please! The problem isn't withstanding the water
        pressure, but not being able to breathe..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Quiet! There's nothing impossible for a disciple of the great Azure
        Heaven Creation Sect!"
      </p>
      <p>Splash!</p>
      <p>"Rrrrghrrgh...!"</p>
      <p>
        A Five-Cloud disciple, with rocks as big as his head tied to his feet,
        plunged into the lake in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lake's depth is clearly dozens of meters, deep enough to make the
        Five-Cloud disciple who went down disappear after a while.
      </p>
      <p>I shake my head at this scene and head to the next training hall.</p>
      <p>Wood Path Body Training Hall.</p>
      <p>Thud, thud, thud, thud, thud!</p>
      <p>"Kuoaaaawwww!!"</p>
      <p>"Kugghhm"</p>
      <p>"Ughhm!"</p>
      <p>
        In the Wood Path Body Training Hall, Three-Cloud disciples infused their
        fists with the power of healing and life force, tying up Four-Cloud and
        Five-Cloud disciples to logs and mercilessly beat them.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the disciples from the Fire, Metal, and Water Halls could at least
        scream,
      </p>
      <p>
        The Four-Cloud and Five-Cloud disciples in the Wood Path Body Training
        Hall had gags in their mouths, only able to clench their teeth and
        endure the punches from the Three-Cloud disciples.
      </p>
      <p>Thud, thud, thud!</p>
      <p>
        Every time the Three-Cloud disciples beat the Four and Five-Cloud
        disciples, their bodies would bruise and bones would break, only to be
        healed and regenerated by the seniors' punches, continuously
        transforming their flesh into something even more robust.
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        I held my breath watching this scene and also fled from the Wood Path
        Body Training Hall.
      </p>
      <p>And, finally.</p>
      <p>Earth Path Body Training Hall.</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        The Earth Path Body Training Hall, unlike the other terrifying and noisy
        training halls, has a very quiet and serene atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        The One and Two-Cloud disciples are closing their eyes and practicing
        their body cultivation… though lifting rocks as big as the Scripture
        Pavilion or mountain peaks for training seems somewhat excessive.
      </p>
      <p>'But where are all the Three, Four, and Five-Cloud disciples?'</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, a hand emerged from the ground of the Earth Path Body Training
        Hall.
      </p>
      <p>"Cough! Cough! Cough!"</p>
      <p>Shortly after.</p>
      <p>
        The person who completely emerged is a Five-Cloud disciple wearing
        tattered clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gasping for breath, he climbed out of the ground and started running
        madly in my direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This place is insane! Everyone's insane! If I had known the Azure
        Heaven Creation Sect was like this, I wouldn't have come..."
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        One of the Two-Cloud disciples who had been quietly training with a
        mountain peak dropped it and landed in front of the fleeing Five-Cloud
        disciple.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Junior, where are you going? You need to continue today's training."
      </p>
      <p>"I-I don't want to... Save me..."</p>
      <p>At the same time, the Two-Cloud disciple rolled his foot.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>With his kick, a huge pit formed beneath his feet.</p>
      <p>
        He grabbed the fleeing Five-Cloud disciple by the nape and threw him
        directly into the pit.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now then. Climb back up using the Earth Path Enduring Origin Scripture.
        It'll be nothing once you get used to it, junior."
      </p>
      <p>
        As he forms a seal with his hands, the pit closes, and the Five-Cloud
        disciple is trapped underground just like that.
      </p>
      <p>'So that's why...'</p>
      <p>
        The reason the Earth Path Body Training Hall is quiet is because the
        lower-level disciples are buried underground.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that the training method of the Earth Path Body Training Hall
        involves enduring the pressure of the earth and climbing back up.
      </p>
      <p>
        After witnessing the sequence of training processes, I realized a
        belated truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I should just quietly go back to practicing the Starlight Protecting
        Void Body.'
      </p>
      <p>But then,</p>
      <p>
        "Wait, now that I think about it, aren't you... the one who recently
        became the direct disciple of the Founder?"
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, this is great. Seeing as you've come to the Earth Path Body
        Training Hall, you must be intending to learn the Earth Path Enduring
        Origin Scripture, right? It's truly commendable that you, as the
        Founder's disciple, would start from the basics despite being eligible
        for higher methods."
      </p>
      <p>Thud, thud, thud, thud!</p>
      <p>
        Behind me, to my sides, and in front of me, One-Cloud and Two-Cloud
        disciples block my way out.
      </p>
      <p>I awkwardly smile and reply.</p>
      <p>
        "...It seems I took the wrong turn, seniors. This junior is just on his
        way out, so if everyone can continue on happily with their training that
        would be…”
      </p>
      <p>"Haha, entering is as you please, but leaving is not."</p>
      <p>
        With that, the One and Two-Cloud disciples surrounding me charge towards
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time in a long while, I concentrate as if my life is at
        stake, reading their intent.
      </p>
      <p>Numerous paths and trajectories become visible to my eyes.</p>
      <p>'To freedom...!'</p>
      <p>Focusing all my willpower, I seize the Starting Form.</p>
      <p>
        Translator Notes: Honestly, after the depressing Mad Lord arc, this arc
        is a really nice change of mood.

      <p>
        Yin Soul Ghost Incantation is a method that can be explained in just a
        few words.
      </p>
      <p>Curse Method.</p>
      <p>Indeed.</p>
      <p>
        Isn't it a method where the practitioner themself must understand pain?
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Soul Ghost Incantation creates curse spells as much as one
        understands pain, scattering them to cause various status abnormalities
        and weaken the target.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Status abnormalities and weakening are the main focus of this method.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a method that can't be expected much in the way of direct
        confrontation.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Usually, it's a method learned in conjunction with devil path arts.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Ironically, it seems that even the founder of this method did not
        achieve great mastery in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand pain to the extent of mastering this method meant that one
        had endured that much pain.
      </p>
      <p>An ordinary creature would likely die from such levels of pain.</p>
      <p>Except for someone like me, who can't die even in death.</p>
      <p>As I look into the method manual, I think,</p>
      <p>
        'Strictly speaking, it's not a devilish method, but it's a method that
        easily falls into the devil path due to pain.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, understanding pain means not only having endured it but also
        having inflicted it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, there is the a possibility of falling into a path of destruction
        while trying to understand pain.
      </p>
      <p>'Pain...'</p>
      <p>
        In Yin Soul Ghost Incantation, for every pain understood, one can form a
        curse spell.
      </p>
      <p>
        These curse spells can be transformed into spiritual power, or can be
        activated with spiritual power
      </p>
      <p>'The founder of the method could handle 108 curse spells at once.'</p>
      <p>
        The number of curse spells one can handle at once depends on their
        understanding of pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        'The founder didn't achieve mastery, but if one did, it would become a
        method that's incredibly troublesome to deal with...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Undoubtedly, relentlessly bombarding the adversary with curse spells,
        especially if one is able to cast over 108 curses, would be exceedingly
        troublesome and irritating for the enfeebled foe.
      </p>
      <p>'But.'</p>
      <p>I finish reading the method and click my tongue.</p>
      <p>
        'The weakness is clear. There's almost no way to directly inflict
        damage.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It is written in the method manual that it is often learned as a
        supplementary method to devilish arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If used together with powerful devilish arts, it would certainly be
        effective, but it isn't particularly relevant to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Looks like I need to parallelly learn Yin Soul Ghost Incantation with
        another method...'
      </p>
      <p>And the method to be learned in parallel is only one at this point.</p>
      <p>Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea, given by my master.</p>
      <p>
        It is a method focusing on the subtleties of Understanding before
        Breakthrough, difficult to master but extremely powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        'While understanding pain through Yin Soul Ghost Incantation and
        breaking through the Qi Building stage, it will be best to learn
        Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea along the way.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Yin Soul Ghost Incantation to pave the way and fertilize the soil,
        then sprouting the seeds of Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea.
      </p>
      <p>That seems to be the most appropriate method.</p>
      <p>
        As I am comparing and reading the methods of Yin Soul Ghost Incantation
        and Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea, planning my future cultivation,
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran suceeds in decrypting what Song Jin left behind.</p>
      <p>"Seniors, please come here for a moment.</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>Around this time,</p>
      <p>
        The Nether Crossing Ship has already reached Seo Ran's abode, and we
        enter to have a conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though it’s underwater with a bit of a cold aura, it’s a much better
        environment than the constantly ghostly Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Hmmm!</p>
      <p>
        As Seo Ran sets up patterns in the air with Pure Spiritual Force, the
        spell given by Song Jin is engraved in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, as Seo Ran breathe consciousness into the spell, it
        activates and bursts forth.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>It’s a massive map.</p>
      <p>On that map, a red dot blinks, continually moving somewhere.</p>
      <p>"What is this map?"</p>
      <p>
        "Perhaps seniors have heard of it. This map shows the coordinates of
        Serving Command Palace."
      </p>
      <p>"Serving Command Palace?"</p>
      <p>"Ah, I guess I need to explain."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran goes to his library and brings back a book.</p>
      <p>As he opens the book, there’s an illustration in it.</p>
      <p>A giant palace with jade-colored tiles and pure white walls.</p>
      <p>
        Unusually, instead of the typical square style of palaces, it’s a
        unique, round palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below the illustration, the name 'Serving Command Palace' is written.
      </p>
      <p>
        "A long time ago. The heavenly artisan who created the original model of
        the Nether Crossing Ship, made this palace when he was still in the
        lower realm. It was one of his masterpieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside, there is space compression similar to the Nether Crossing Ship,
        and within the compressed space, there are spiritual lands growing all
        sorts of spiritual herbs and creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also storerooms filled with various magical items and
        treasures left by the ancient cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm!"</p>
      <p>Seo Ran continues, swallowing his saliva.</p>
      <p>
        "It is indeed a remnant of a Heavenly Being Cultivator. It goes without
        saying for Core Formation, but even Nascent Soul cultivators cannot find
        the coordinates of Serving Command Palace. They just wait for the rare
        days when the palace does appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems a Heavenly Being cultivator has left coordinates inside Serving
        Command Palace to detect it whenever desired."
      </p>
      <p>He says in admiration.</p>
      <p>However, I notice something odd in his words.</p>
      <p>
        "If what Daoist Seo says is true, then Serving Command Palace has times
        when it 'appears' and doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>So, the location Daoist Seo is tracking is when it's not visible?"</p>
      <p>
        "That's right. Serving Command Palace floats along the outskirts of
        space, only entering our world once every few hundred years, allowing
        many cultivators to find it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Then what use is this map? If it's on the outskirts of space, there's
        no way to reach it even if we track its coordinates in real-time."
      </p>
      <p>"Normally, that's true."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran grins.</p>
      <p>
        "But we have the Nether Crossing Ship, albeit damaged and usable only a
        few more times. Still, it's here."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran's explanation continues.</p>
      <p>
        "The original model of the Nether Crossing Ship is known to cross even
        the realm of the dead. The Nether Crossing Ship also has some of these
        properties, making it possible to transcend space."
      </p>
      <p>"Really?"</p>
      <p>
        "It seems likely. I've seen the battle at Black Ghost Valley from afar.
        When Black Ghost Valley was at a disadvantage, they led the Nether
        Crossing Ship across space and disappeared. If that's not transcending
        space, what is?"
      </p>
      <p>His words continue.</p>
      <p>
        "Therefore, my proposal is for seniors to accompany me to the Serving
        Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's too challenging for me alone, as I am still at the Qi Building
        stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the spatial ability of the Nether Crossing Ship, we might be able
        to reach it."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>I’m rather hesitant.</p>
      <p>'Spiritual herbs and pills are abundant there...'</p>
      <p>To be honest, it isn't very attractive to me.</p>
      <p>My way is to advance through Understanding before Breakthrough..</p>
      <p>External items will only be a hindrance.</p>
      <p>I was thinking of declining when,</p>
      <p>
        "I've heard that within Serving Command Palace, there's an immortal
        fruit that extends life by 100 years, the Longevity Fruit."
      </p>
      <p>"....!"</p>
      <p>I’m startled and look at him.</p>
      <p>"Really?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, the elders of the Sea Dragon Tribe sometimes attempt it whenever
        Serving Command Palace appears, and they've managed to get the Longevity
        Fruit."
      </p>
      <p>"Hoo..."</p>
      <p>If that’s true.</p>
      <p>I glance at Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>As far as I know, he only has about ten years left.</p>
      <p>
        While he could cut down the heavenly lightning, whether he could survive
        just by doing so is uncertain.
      </p>
      <p>If there's a way to extend life, it's right to seek it.</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it can be the key to extending Kim Young-hoon's life a bit more.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, Kim Young-hoon, and I ride the Nether Crossing Ship towards a
        certain location.
      </p>
      <p>The coordinates left by Song Jin are shining.</p>
      <p>'I wonder, can it really transcend space?'</p>
      <p>
        Among the controlling methods of the ship that Song Jin taught, there
        are indeed techniques to break through formations or transcend space.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s natural since I had to break through several barriers just to get
        the ship out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I learned how to break through space, and reaching the Serving
        Command Palace is a matter of properly inputting the coordinates and
        passing through.
      </p>
      <p>"We're here."</p>
      <p>"I see. Then, let's break through."</p>
      <p>
        I grab the helm of the Nether Crossing Ship and infuse my consciousness
        into it.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        The Nether Crossing Ship envelopes in ghostly energy for a moment, then
        breaks through something invisible.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, all sound and energy around us vanish, and we enter a
        completely dark world.
      </p>
      <p>In that dark world,</p>
      <p>Seo Ran, Kim Young-hoon, and I discover 'it'.</p>
      <p>
        A palace with jade tiles, a body like white jade, and a unique
        cylindrical shape.
      </p>
      <p>It’s Serving Command Palace.</p>
      <p>
        There is a huge jade door in Serving Command Palace, but it’s firmly
        closed, perhaps as it’s not the time to open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the entire palace seems submerged in some kind of prohibition,
        making it impossible to enter anywhere other than the main gate.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, this is tough..."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran licks his lips in frustration.</p>
      <p>
        "We need to find a weak point in the prohibition, decipher it, and break
        through to enter."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, can't we just break it?"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon swings his Surpassing Radiant Saber at the prohibition.
      </p>
      <p>Explosion roars, and light flashes.</p>
      <p>However,</p>
      <p>Crackle, sizzle...</p>
      <p>The prohibition only sparks a bit, not even wavering.</p>
      <p>
        'It's on a completely different level than the barriers protecting the
        abandoned Nether Crossing Ship...'
      </p>
      <p>
        I also strike various parts of the prohibition with my Formless Sword,
        but the result is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that at least a Nascent Soul cultivator is needed to affect
        this prohibition with force.
      </p>
      <p>'Tch, is there really no way...'</p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble!</p>
      <p>I try hitting a few more spots, but it’s all the same.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, by observing the prohibition's reaction, I can tell which
        parts are slightly weaker.
      </p>
      <p>But anything beyond that is too difficult.</p>
      <p>
        'What if I crash the Nether Crossing Ship into the prohibition and
        detonate it?'
      </p>
      <p>
        The thought crosses my mind, but actually detonating the Nether Crossing
        Ship would require someone to sacrifice themselves inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, Kim Young-hoon, and I try hitting and observing different parts
        of Serving Command Palace's prohibition for a while.
      </p>
      <p>After a long investigation, we return to the Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>
        "...I guess I'll have to see if any friendly demon beasts are skilled in
        formations. Of course, such individuals are rare among the demon race,
        and most of them have been captured in the recent conflict..."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran sighs.</p>
      <p>I clench my teeth in frustration.</p>
      <p>Having studied formations, I know roughly.</p>
      <p>This prohibition isn't a problem that one or two people can solve.</p>
      <p>
        It’s a matter that will require top-tier formation masters and
        prohibition experts to work on for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Seo Ran leaves, I dock the Nether Crossing Ship in a nearby valley
        and come down, feeling downcast.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon looks at me curiously.</p>
      <p>"By the way, Eun-hyun. Why are you so gloomy?"</p>
      <p>
        "...Kim Hyung hasn't mastered a method to reach the Qi Building stage,
        so you'll probably leave soon."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>At those words, Kim Young-hoon looks baffled.</p>
      <p>"Eun-hyun. Death is... a natural part of life."</p>
      <p>"That is true, but."</p>
      <p>"Why so down then?"</p>
      <p>
        "...My lifespan has now increased by another 300 years. If Kim Hyung
        goes, I'll have to spend those 300 years alone."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, that is true."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon nods.</p>
      <p>But after a moment,</p>
      <p>He looks up at the sky and smiles.</p>
      <p>"So what?"</p>
      <p>"Huh?"</p>
      <p>
        "I've reached the realm I've always pursued and realized something
        precious and important.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might not know, but ever since I obtained the Surpassing Radiant
        Saber, I felt like I could sense my own fate."
      </p>
      <p>"Really...?"</p>
      <p>
        "It feels like fate is whispering to me. Why I'm alive, where I should
        go... how I should live my life. It's like fate is supporting me.
      </p>
      <p>
        It sounds funny, but I feel like I've grasped my own destiny. Ha-ha,
        even the wisest of this world don't know their own fate. And here I am,
        a nobody, talking about such things..."
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, a vision flashes before my eyes.</p>
      <p>-The next Ender.</p>
      <p>
        -Entering this space means you've miraculously met the conditions I set.
      </p>
      <p>-Coming to Shattered Heaven Peak before grasping your fate...</p>
      <p>To grasp one's fate.</p>
      <p>
        Why did the condition mentioned by Yang Su-jin's remnant and Kim
        Young-hoon's talk of grasping his fate seem connected?
      </p>
      <p>What does it mean to grasp one's fate?</p>
      <p>
        And what exactly is the fate that Kim Young-hoon claims to have grasped?
      </p>
      <p>I’m extremely curious, but...</p>
      <p>-Never reveal the fate bestowed upon you.</p>
      <p>I dare not ask.</p>
      <p>
        I just listen to Kim Young-hoon happily talking about his mindset
        towards martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If I can live according to this fate, I'm okay with dying. Don't feel
        lonely and strive on your path too. Someday, you might grasp your fate
        as well."
      </p>
      <p>He smiles and lifts his saber.</p>
      <p>"How about a match, it's been a while?"</p>
      <p>"That sounds good. Do you think you can win again, Kim Hyung?"</p>
      <p>"I'll win this time as well!"</p>
      <p>"I think I went easy on you last time."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon and I, holding Formless Sword and Surpassing Radiant
        Saber, wreak havoc in the surrounding valley as we spar.
      </p>
      <p>And so.</p>
      <p>17 years have passed.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's aura has changed over these years.</p>
      <p>In the 17 years since he acquired the Surpassing Radiant Saber,</p>
      <p>He has far surpassed me in the realm of pure martial arts.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, I too have gradually become accustomed to the output of the
        Qi Building stage, not easily losing to Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>2054 fights, 2039 draws, 9 wins, and 6 losses.</p>
      <p>This is Kim Young-hoon’s record in our duels.</p>
      <p>Whoo-</p>
      <p>A vivid aura circles in Kim Young-hoon's eyes.</p>
      <p>
        He has the demon race senses and can perceive the flow of spiritual
        energy. Although not predicting fate, he can foresee things that might
        happen to him to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>"...Today seems like the day my life ends."</p>
      <p>He smiles.</p>
      <p>I can't say anything back.</p>
      <p>
        "Don't look so gloomy. I'm confident enough to cut the lightning.
        Confident enough to control my heart with Gang Qi. Ha-ha, how can
        someone like me not overcome my lifespan?"
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon confidently raises his saber.</p>
      <p>I can't hide my troubled feelings.</p>
      <p>
        For 17 years, we tried everything to break through Serving Command
        Palace's prohibition, but Seo Ran said it would take at least 50 more
        years of research to break through.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry. Even the heavens cannot stop me. No, it will not stop me.
        I feel so vividly that fate is on my side... how can I possibly die?"
      </p>
      <p>He smiles lightly.</p>
      <p>"I won't die."</p>
      <p>'Kim Hyung...'</p>
      <p>In my 500 years of life, I have learned one harsh truth.</p>
      <p>That fate sides with no one.</p>
      <p>Can Kim Young-hoon really overcome his fate?</p>
      <p>Can his martial prowess transcend the heavens?</p>
      <p>Thus, the end of Kim Young-hoon's life draws near.</p>

      <p>Chapter 56: Heavenly Thunder (3)</p>
      <p>Master resides in the main house of the Cheongmun Clan.</p>
      <p>
        Being part of the main house of the Cheongmun Clan, a family that values
        the Dao of Combat, meant one had to be within the top 50 in the Immortal
        Combat Meeting. It also implied that Master was in one of the most
        crucial positions in the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        For an ordinary clan, a nobody like me suddenly meeting an elder in one
        of the most important positions of the clan would be nearly impossible.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, that's if it were an ordinary clan.</p>
      <p>
        "Applicants for the training conference led by the Cheongmun Clan,
        please come this way!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cheongmun Clan, following in the footsteps of their founder Sir
        Chang-ho, revered the Dao of Combat. Apart from the Immortal Combat
        Meeting organized for the Cheongmun clan members, they gathered Qi
        Refining cultivators every few years for a training conference, a
        sparring competition to recruit external clan members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The winner, runner-up, and third place of the training conference would
        all enter the Cheongmun Clan as external members, while other finalists
        would gain the right to become the family's lower-ranking cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the most important thing was that the winner of the training
        conference could make a small wish to the Cheongmun Clan, such as
        meeting a Qi Building elder for a brief time to receive teachings.
      </p>
      <p>"Your registration is complete. Next!"</p>
      <p>I approached the registration desk and said to the officer,</p>
      <p>
        "My name is Seo Eun-hyun. Origin from Byeokra, Cheon-saek City. My
        cultivation is Qi Refining 9th star of the Five Elements. I am
        practicing an earth attribute method."
      </p>
      <p>"Huh? Qi Refining 9th star?"</p>
      <p>
        The officer looked at me with surprise. He was an external member of the
        Cheongmun Clan at the Qi Refining 6th star.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No... Senior? With your level, you don't need to participate in the
        training conference. Just apply for the external member recruitment and
        pass the interview, You'll be accepted right away."
      </p>
      <p>
        Most lower-ranking Qi Refining cultivators were around the 2nd or 3rd
        Star and most external members were between the 4th and 9th Star.
        Cultivators above that level were treated almost like blood relatives by
        the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the Ascension Gate opened, Qi Refining cultivators were common
        across the continent, and being at the 9th Star was considered ordinary.
        But now, with many powerful cultivation sects ascending to higher
        realms, cultivators have become rare, and even being at the 9th Sof Qi
        Refining is highly regarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The typical winners of the training conference were usually Qi Refining
        cultivators of the 5th or 6th Star, but now a heavy-hitter like me had
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I looked around, I could feel the other participants coughing and
        avoiding my gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, it seems that those who are new to the Cheongmun Clan
        registration desk get quite confused. Let me guide you to the right
        place..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, it's fine. I have always admired the Cheongmun Clan's training
        conference. Please allow me to participate."
      </p>
      <p>"But..."</p>
      <p>
        "I know that anyone can participate in the training conference hosted by
        the Cheongmun Clan, except for Qi Building cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>"Uh..."</p>
      <p>
        The officer, troubled by my insistence despite the difficulty of my
        participation, sighed and registered me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could see the varying thoughts of the other cultivators around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I stepped out of the registration area and left the building, I heard
        a sigh of relief from inside.
      </p>
      <p>"That's a nasty character."</p>
      <p>
        "He's just going to trample over the juniors and enter the Cheongmun
        Clan?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "How can we beat a Qi Refining 9th Star? Shouldn't we just give him a
        bye?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, even outside my area of consciousness, I could hear their
        complaints and frustrations, as my hearing had become sensitive after
        rejuvenation and forming the Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>'I'm sorry about this.'</p>
      <p>
        Typically, an ordinary external member wouldn't meet a Cheongmun Clan
        elder unless they make significant contributions. But as the winner of
        the training conference, it is a different story.
      </p>
      <p>'Besides, I don't plan to join the Cheongmun Clan in this life.'</p>
      <p>
        Not all winners of the training conference become external members. If I
        give up my eligibility, it will naturally go to someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Holding the participation plaque, I entered the Cheongmun Clan's
        territory to rest.
      </p>
      <p>One month later.</p>
      <p>The training conference was held.</p>
      <p>"...The winner, Seo Eun-hyun!"</p>
      <p>And naturally, I won.</p>
      <p>
        There was no real battle to speak of. The participants at the Qi
        Refining 2nd or 3rd Star gave up as soon as they met me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultivators at the 4th and 5th stars couldn't withstand a single strike
        from me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultivators at the 6th Star of Qi Refining, who have achieved the Eight
        Trigrams Completed Path, could only somewhat match me in a contest of
        spells, but they still lost due to the overwhelming difference in
        spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I was capable of overpowering lower-level Qi Refining cultivators
        with sheer strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I wish those at the 2nd and 3rd stars had challenged me more bravely;
        the Cheongmun Clan might have offered them a position after the
        competition.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the Qi Refining cultivators who conceded immediately upon
        facing me, I felt a bit of regret. Knowing the Cheongmun Clan's
        reverence for the Dao of Combat, I am certain they would have
        appreciated even a show of fighting spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The winner of the competition is granted an official recommendation to
        become an external member of the Cheongmun Clan and one wish. If a Qi
        Refining cultivator makes a fitting wish, the clan will surely grant it.
        Do you have anything in mind?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The person overseeing the competition was Cheongmun Buk, whom I had met
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        I told Cheongmun Buk that I wished to meet and receive teachings from
        Cheongmun Ryeong.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Cheongmun Ryeong, you say? He's my cousin, and indeed, there's no one
        better than him in basic spells and formations."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I would like to return the recommendation for external membership."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Elixir Refining, Artifact Refining, and Formations are the three arts.
        Cheongmun Ryeong is the leader of... Wait, what did you say?"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Buk's eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
      <p>
        "Entering this competition, my intention was to meet Grandmaster
        Cheongmun Ryeong, an expert in basic spells and formations."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You, you... Do you not understand the significance of becoming an
        external member of a cultivator clan?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I understand perfectly. But there are people I must meet without being
        bound by the rules of a cultivator clan."
      </p>
      <p>I also needed to check on my disciples' well-being in the Jin Clan.</p>
      <p>
        "Being the winner, you'd normally have one hour to meet with Elder
        Ryeong of the main family... If you become an external member, I can
        extend your meeting time to three hours. Still refuse?"
      </p>
      <p>"I apologize for declining your offer."</p>
      <p>"Tch! Fine, have it your way."</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Buk looked at me displeased, announced the second and third
        place of the competition, and declared that a smaller competition would
        be held in two days to award the recommendation I forfeited.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few days later, I entered the Cheongmun Clan's territory with
        Cheongmun Buk.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I was not an external member, we met in a less significant territory
        rather than the main house.
      </p>
      <p>I followed Cheongmun Buk to an old thatched house in the territory.</p>
      <p>The simple yet neat house seemed well-suited to my master.</p>
      <p>
        "Ryeong, here's the one who requested to meet you. I'll leave him here;
        take care of it. I'm busy, so I can't stay."
      </p>
      <p>"Take care, brother."</p>
      <p>
        From inside the house, a familiar voice responded, and Cheongmun Buk
        flew off on a flying artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a deep breath, knelt in front of the house, and bowed deeply.
      </p>
      <p>"What are you doing?"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong asked, sensing my actions through his consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>Smiling, I responded.</p>
      <p>
        "I am honored to meet Grandmaster Cheongmun Ryeong, a pioneer in
        formations and basic spells."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Slick talker. I don't like slick ones. Come in and let's see what you
        want to discuss."
      </p>
      <p>The door opened, and I cautiously entered.</p>
      <p>He didn't look at me but was busy annotating a book.</p>
      <p>Even on the day we meet he continues his routine work.</p>
      <p>'Really... You haven't changed.'</p>
      <p>
        "What is it? Don't just stand there with a sour face. If you have
        something to ask, ask. I'm busy, so make it quick."
      </p>
      <p>"Understood."</p>
      <p>
        I sat down and asked him about the things I didn't understand regarding
        the Qi Refining 11th Star of the Three Talents, the 12th Star of
        Yin-Yang Unity, and the 13th Star of the One Origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong, upon hearing my detailed questions, stopped annotating
        and looked at me.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, not as shallow as you look. Let's address your questions..."</p>
      <p>We discussed intensely for an hour.</p>
      <p>
        After an hour, Cheongmun Ryeong, who had the right to dismiss me,
        frowned and said,
      </p>
      <p>"Let's add another hour. You seem to have a lot of curiosity."</p>
      <p>Another hour passed.</p>
      <p>
        "Already an hour? I'll give you one more. Listen well. The concept of
        Yin-Yang Unity is about..."
      </p>
      <p>After three hours, he stroked his beard.</p>
      <p>
        "Teaching so shortly like this won't do. I'll give you three more hours!
        If you don't understand by then, be prepared for discipline!"
      </p>
      <p>Thus, I spent the entire night with Cheongmun Ryeong.</p>
      <p>The next morning.</p>
      <p>"I feel somewhat relieved. Did you understand the theory?"</p>
      <p>"Thanks to the Grandmaster, I understood it well."</p>
      <p>
        "I heard you refused to become an external member of the Cheongmun Clan.
        With your understanding, you could have risen in the ranks and been
        treated as a quasi-blood relative. Even if you've learned the theory,
        applying it is different. If you became an external member, I can
        formally teach you. How about it?"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong was offering to be my master again.</p>
      <p>I smiled slightly and spoke.</p>
      <p>
        "I appreciate your offer, Grandmaster. However, if I'm bound by the
        Cheongmun Clan's rules, there are people I will not be able to meet."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, can't help someone who won't eat what's served. Go on, you should
        have at least grasped the theory by now."
      </p>
      <p>I stood up, bowed respectfully, and said,</p>
      <p>
        “Teacher for a day, a father for a lifetime. Though today's lesson was
        brief, I will never forget your teachings."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You're a fool. If you were really going to treat me as a father, you
        should have just joined the main house. Go on, I have no attachment or
        interest in you beyond today."
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving Cheongmun Ryeong's house, I bowed once more towards his
        room and left the Cheongmun Clan's territory.
      </p>
      <p>'A teacher for a day, a father for a lifetime.'</p>
      <p>'I will not forget you, Master.'</p>
      <p>Even as I travel through the rivers of time repeatedly.</p>
      <p>
        I left the Cheongmun Clan's territory and headed towards the Jin Clan's
        domain to check on Kim Young-hoon and my disciples.
      </p>
      <p>News about Kim Young-hoon was easier to find than expected.</p>
      <p>He was known as the 'Heaven Cutter.'</p>
      <p>
        He was the one who beheaded the last emperor of the previous Makli
        Dynasty, Makli Jung, and a founding contributor to the current Jin
        Dynasty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, after receiving various martial arts from me, seem to
        have reached the Ultimate Pinnacle as in his previous life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon learning about the atrocities of the Makli Clan and that killing
        Emperor Makli Jung would reduce these atrocities, he brazenly stormed
        the palace and beheaded the emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Makli Clan was furious, sending cultivators after him, but they were
        killed by Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Qi Building cultivators died, and the Jin Clan, recognizing his
        potential, decided to protect him.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was information I heard from a lower-ranking cultivator of the Jin
        Clan.
      </p>
      <p>"Senior, is the tea to your liking?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, it's quite good."</p>
      <p>
        In Byeokra, I initially struggled to find the Cheongmun Clan's
        territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in Yanguo, having traveled extensively during my days in the martial
        world, I was familiar with various territories, including the Jin Clan's
        main house. The only place I didn't know was the Makli Clan's main
        house.
      </p>
      <p>
        This lower-ranking cultivator was someone I had a brief connection with
        during my days as chief advisor in the Wulin Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back then, he was someone who groveled before me and Kim Young-hoon,
        barely hanging on at the 36 Heavenly Gang Decrees of the Qi Refining 2nd
        Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he realized I had reached the Five Elements, he immediately bowed
        and called me "senior," offering me tea.
      </p>
      <p>
        I asked him a few questions and learned about the recent events in
        Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>"So, where are you at in the 36 Heavenly Gang Decrees?"</p>
      <p>"I'm currently consolidating the decree of 'Heavenly Ferocity'..."</p>
      <p>"Do you have any difficulties understanding it?"</p>
      <p>
        I shared detailed explanations about the 36 Heavenly Gang Decrees and
        provided guidance on his difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially interested, he soon showed signs of boredom and confusion, so
        I wrapped up the lecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'll stay here for a few days. Regarding Heaven Cutter, inform the Jin
        Clan about my arrival. While I'm here, I'm willing to answer any
        questions regarding cultivation"
      </p>
      <p>
        Relieved, the Qi Refining cultivator nodded and went to contact the Jin
        Clan.
      </p>
      <p>I understood why my master valued me.</p>
      <p>
        'Geniuses don't need his teachings, but those who do lack perseverance.'
      </p>
      <p>I felt a tinge of bitterness.</p>
      <p>A few days later, Kim Young-hoon arrived.</p>
      <p>"It's been a long time."</p>
      <p>"It has indeed."</p>
      <p>After 40 years, we stood awkwardly for a moment.</p>
      <p>
        "You seem to have become a cultivator. Your consciousness and spiritual
        power..."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, I've reached the middle-high level of Qi Refining."</p>
      <p>"Good. This world is suited for cultivators. How have you been?"</p>
      <p>
        "There have been various events. But Kim Hyung, no... Director Kim
        Young-hoon."
      </p>
      <p>I raised my hand, and a little star formed on top of my palm.</p>
      <p>"!"</p>
      <p>Astonishment appeared in his eyes.</p>
      <p>"Let's have a match."</p>
      <p>
        What kind of duel would it be, with both of us having reached the realm
        of Ultimate Pinnacle in martial arts?

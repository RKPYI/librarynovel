      <p>Demon Core?</p>
      <p>'Could he be talking about the Inner Core?'</p>
      <p>
        The only relevant Core Seo Hweol could be referring to was the Inner
        Core, as far as I know.
      </p>
      <p>"Why do you call this a Demon Core? This is..."</p>
      <p>
        As I tried to explain the Inner Core, I found myself at a loss for
        words.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Inner Core was something only high-level martial artists like Kim
        Young-hoon and I, who had reached the Ultimate Pinnacle, possessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world where even those at the stage of Five Energies Converging to
        the Origin are considered geniuses appearing only once every few hundred
        years, there were probably only two martial artists in the history of
        martial arts who had reached the Ultimate Pinnacle: Kim Young-hoon and
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        But how should I explain this Inner Core, which only a martial artist of
        Ultimate Pinnacle could create?
      </p>
      <p>
        "...On reflection, I realize I am not well-versed enough to understand.
        I would be grateful if the Sea Dragon King could enlighten me on what a
        Demon Core is."
      </p>
      <p>
        [The Demon Core is a spiritual essence formed by beings like me, an
        Enlightened Demon Beast. At the same time, it's the catalyst for regular
        demons and mystical beasts to start cultivating upon gaining intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        While humans are born with intellect, most beasts just instinctively
        absorb the heaven and earth spiritual energy until one day this energy
        forms a core in their body, which becomes a Demon Core, gradually
        granting them intellect and the ability to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dragon race, among a few others, can pass down the Demon Core, so we
        possess intellect from a very young age.]
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that what is typically known as a Demon Core is formed by
        demons and mystical beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now understood why Seo Hweol was referring to my Inner Core as a Demon
        Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If the aggregation of heaven and earth spiritual energy grants
        intellect to demons, then their Demon Cores are essentially
        concentrations of their own intellect and energy. My Inner Core was
        formed by the mingling of Gang Qi with the nature of the Dantian.'
      </p>
      <p>The Gang Qi was, in turn, another concentration of my own being.</p>
      <p>A kind of concentration of intellect, so to speak.</p>
      <p>In other words, it was convergent evolution.</p>
      <p>
        Though evolved under entirely different conditions and in different
        ways.
      </p>
      <p>The end results appeared similar.</p>
      <p>
        This seemed to be the case with my Inner Core and the Demon Cores of
        demon beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Humans, typically born with intellect, can't form a separate core of
        intellect, like a Demon Core. You don't see humans stuffing their brains
        into their dantian to converge it. Normally, only enlightened demons
        form Demon Cores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, hybrids of humans and demons can form them. But you formed
        a Demon Core and yet didn't know you were a hybrid?]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sea Dragon King, apparently misunderstanding my identity, kept
        asking me, thinking I was some sort of human-demon hybrid.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmm, I wonder what kind of hybrid you are, but it's about time for me
        to go. I must be on my way to the Ascension Gate.]
      </p>
      <p>
        After asking me a few things, the Sea Dragon King clicked his tongue as
        if in regret.
      </p>
      <p>
        He pushed Kim Young-hoon's body into a spatial rift and, persuaded by
        me, decided to take Manager Kim Yeon as well. He then looked at me.
      </p>
      <p>
        [But a human-demon hybrid, that's almost the first in a thousand years.
        This is also fate. Here is a demon beast cultivation manual. One of the
        decent cultivation methods passed down in my Sea Dragon Clan.]
      </p>
      <p>"...! How can I express my gratitude..."</p>
      <p>
        Shaking, I took the book he handed me. The book was bound in some
        beast's hide and emanated a cool aura.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>"...I apologize, but could you tell me what these characters are?"</p>
      <p>
        [Ah, that's the demon script. I suppose you, not knowing that you had a
        Demon Core or what kind of hybrid you are, wouldn't know the demon
        script either.]
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>‘Then what are you telling me to do?’</p>
      <p>
        'Maybe he could transmit the knowledge of the demon script using a
        spell..?'
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked at him hopefully, but Seo Hweol shook his head, noticing my
        gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The consciousness of humans and demons are quite different in
        frequency. Forcibly transmitting knowledge usually results in the weaker
        mind going insane. Unfortunately, it looks like you'll have to learn the
        demon script separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's see... If you go to the Black Wind Sea's Utmost Chaos Island,
        there's a descendant of mine, Seo Ran, who's of late-stage Qi Building.
        That child is proficient in both human and demon script. If you offer
        him something in exchange, he might teach you.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "As my knowledge is not broad enough, what if I turn out not to be a
        demi-human and get attacked?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [What are you even talking about? I’m telling you that you’re a
        demon-human hybrid. You've even condensed a Demon Core, so any sentient
        demon wouldn't dare treat you lightly. Well, I must be going. That
        cultivation manual is quite a decent demon beast method and should be
        helpful to a demi-human hybrid like you.]
      </p>
      <p>
        After saying this, Seo Hweol picked up Kim Yeon and Oh Hye-seo and left
        the cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        A while later, I saw Seo Hweol cutting through the dark clouds and
        flying away.
      </p>
      <p>I bowed my head towards the departing Sea Dragon King.</p>
      <p>'Demon beast methods you say...'</p>
      <p>Suddenly, I pondered the origin of martial arts.</p>
      <p>
        Most trace the origin of martial arts to cultivators' cultivation
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The internal energy methods were said to have been born from the
        cultivators’ spiritual energy cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, martial arts are not composed solely of internal methods and
        energy cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>Techniques.</p>
      <p>
        Where did the techniques that martial artists use to move their bodies
        come from?
      </p>
      <p>
        'The movements of beasts are the origin of countless martial arts
        techniques.'
      </p>
      <p>
        From the pouncing of tigers, the galloping of horses, the fluttering of
        bees, the solidity of turtles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans imitated those stronger than themselves to perfect their martial
        arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        They created internal methods by imitating cultivators and techniques by
        imitating beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        These techniques and internal methods merged over thousands of years to
        become fully integrated and become martial arts of today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, 'martial artists' firmly established their existence in this
        world.
      </p>
      <p>Is the Gang Sphere I created an energy method or technique?</p>
      <p>It could be seen as a clump of energy.</p>
      <p>Or a collection of techniques.</p>
      <p>
        Similar to that of cultivators, but also born from the movements of
        beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, my Inner Core shared similar traits with the Demon Cores of
        demon beasts.
      </p>
      <p>That meant,</p>
      <p>
        'Perhaps, by studying demon beast methods, I could discover the next
        stage of martial arts?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultivators' methods have evolved over thousands, tens of thousands,
        hundreds of thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Demon beast methods likely have a similar history, though not much is
        known.
      </p>
      <p>
        But martial arts, compared to them, have a much shorter history, even at
        their best.
      </p>
      <p>That's why martial arts are weaker, and their realms are limited.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's continuous effort to pioneer new realms wasn't in vain.
      </p>
      <p>Without it, martial arts could never reach new realms.</p>
      <p>
        'If I learn demon script, interpret demon beast methods, and inform Kim
        Young-hoon...'
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps he could see beyond much faster?</p>
      <p>I made up my mind.</p>
      <p>
        'Yes, first I will recover my past life's cultivation as quickly as
        possible in Ascension Path.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, I will set out to find the sea dragon named Seo Ran living
        in the place called the Black Wind Sea's Utmost Chaos Island to learn
        demon script.
      </p>
      <p>This was my goal for this life.</p>
      <p>
        The time it took to recover up to the 7th Star of Qi Refining was much
        faster than in my past life.
      </p>
      <p>Just about 7 years.</p>
      <p>It was almost gaining one star per year.</p>
      <p>
        Repeating the process of Understanding before Breakthrough from the
        beginning, my understanding of the stages deepened, accelerating my
        recovery.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I performed the Seven Stars Ritual again.</p>
      <p>A ceremony to receive celestial energy from the heavens.</p>
      <p>This time, too, I witnessed something familiar.</p>
      <p>The inevitable Heavenly Rejection.</p>
      <p>Dark clouds blocked my path.</p>
      <p>But I just smiled and raised my hand.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A burst of light and a hole in the sky.</p>
      <p>Starlight poured down, bestowing celestial energy upon me.</p>
      <p>I smoothly reached the 8th Star of Qi Refining.</p>
      <p>
        It took about 3 years to reach the 11th Star, Three Talents, from the
        8th Star of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, as I reached the stage of Three Talents, I noticed changes in
        the Gang Sphere again.
      </p>
      <p>"Heaven (天), Earth (地), Man (人)..."</p>
      <p>
        The Gang Sphere underwent changes in the Three Talents Stage in my past
        life as well.
      </p>
      <p>Back then, the feeling wasn't clear. Now, I somewhat understand it.</p>
      <p>Of course, it was still hard to explain verbally.</p>
      <p>Whirring!</p>
      <p>It seemed possible to induce changes in the Gang Sphere.</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>The Gang Sphere split into two.</p>
      <p>The left sphere became Earth (地), the right sphere Heaven (天).</p>
      <p>And myself, between the two spheres, became Man (人).</p>
      <p>Thus, making heaven and earth revolve around me.</p>
      <p>Whirr, whirr, whirr!</p>
      <p>The two Gang Spheres stabilized as they rotated around me.</p>
      <p>I lifted the two spheres in my hands.</p>
      <p>
        'The principle of Three Talents applied, and the Gang Sphere split.'
      </p>
      <p>Why was that?</p>
      <p>
        Why did the principle of Three Talents apply so perfectly to the Gang
        Sphere?
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>I lifted the two Gang Spheres in one hand.</p>
      <p>
        The two spheres, representing Heaven and Earth, revolved around each
        other and eventually merged into one.
      </p>
      <p>'The principle of Three Talents...'</p>
      <p>
        I pondered over the principle of Three Talents and tried splitting the
        Gang Sphere again.
      </p>
      <p>For now, I could only split the Gang Sphere into two.</p>
      <p>
        Without proper enlightenment, the two spheres would merge back into one
        if the force was released.
      </p>
      <p>
        I observed the Gang Sphere for a moment and then continued my practice
        of the Record of Surpassing Path and Martial Arts.
      </p>
      <p>About a year later.</p>
      <p>I successfully completed the 12th and 13th stars of Qi Refining.</p>
      <p>Yin-Yang Unity and the Unified Orgin.</p>
      <p>Bam!</p>
      <p>
        All spiritual meridians merged into one, and a single point of spiritual
        power gathered in the dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Completing the 14th Star of Qi Refining, Infinite Spiritual Cloud,
        grants eligibility to attempt Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stage of Infinite Spiritual Cloud was more like a bridge between Qi
        Refining and Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, having completed the Unified Origin and able to enter 14th
        stage, I had essentially reached the limit of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>"Finally."</p>
      <p>After about 11 years.</p>
      <p>I have fully recovered to the 13th Star of Qi Refining.</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>
        Clasping my hands, I formed a formation on the ground without even
        gestures or chants.
      </p>
      <p>I could now instantly create simple formations.</p>
      <p>What remained was to complete the 14th Star and enter Qi Building.</p>
      <p>'Entering Qi Building requires more thought.'</p>
      <p>
        With my current talent, it might not be achievable even with a lifetime
        of hard work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, as I had originally planned, I should meet Seo Ran in the
        Black Wind Sea to learn demon script.
      </p>
      <p>And learn the demon beast methods given by Seo Hweol.</p>
      <p>11th year of return.</p>
      <p>Having reached Qi Refining 13th Star, I jumped off Ascension Path.</p>
      <p>It was now time to explore the demon beast methods.</p>
      <p>

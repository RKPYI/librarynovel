      <p>Chapter 129: What You Trampled On / The Path You Have Tread (17)</p>
      <p>With a dazed expression, I walk through the city.</p>
      <p>Shhhhhhhh...</p>
      <p>The sound of rain somehow feels pleasant to my ears.</p>
      <p>
        And at the end of the path, in the rain, stands the person I dreamed of.
      </p>
      <p>No, perhaps it's more accurate to say she is floating.</p>
      <p>"Hyang...hwa..."</p>
      <p>With my throat parched and voice dry, I call out to her.</p>
      <p>A whirlwind of thoughts storm through my mind.</p>
      <p>"How...?"</p>
      <p>Suddenly, I feel a gaze and look to the side.</p>
      <p>There is no one there.</p>
      <p>It seems to have been an illusion.</p>
      <p>She smiles gently.</p>
      <p>[How? I became a wandering spirit, waiting for Orabeoni.]</p>
      <p>"Surely... back then..."</p>
      <p>
        I still remember the moment when her spirit ascended to the heavens.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, she glances where I had looked and smiles at me again.</p>
      <p>[But isn't there something more important?]</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>Right.</p>
      <p>One died, and one survived.</p>
      <p>But our hearts are still connected.</p>
      <p>I immediately understand what she means.</p>
      <p>
        [In Yeon-do City, I wanted to dance with Orabeoni, but it seems we end
        up dancing here.]
      </p>
      <p>"...Please wait just a moment. I will prepare immediately."</p>
      <p>
        I draw the Colorless Glass Sword from my waist and pour all my strength
        into it, infusing it with spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        The Colorless Glass Swords were originally made as gravestones for the
        people living in Cheon-saek City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following my will, three thousand glass swords return to their
        respective graves.
      </p>
      <p>After that, I reach out my hand towards her.</p>
      <p>We smile at each other without words.</p>
      <p>As we have no fans, we mimic holding one and take our positions.</p>
      <p>
        There is no music, but we dance slowly to the symphony of the rain,
        matching each other's steps.
      </p>
      <p>Our fingertips brush each other, as neither of us hold a fan.</p>
      <p>I take three steps to the left, completing a circle.</p>
      <p>
        She moves just like me, circling around, and our fingertips brush again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The living and the deceased dance slowly through the raining graveyard,
        where glass swords are planted.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong...</p>
      <p>
        The spectating souls slowly turn into orbs of light and ascend to the
        heavens one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong, Buk Joong-ho, and countless friends and neighbors,
        excluding Kim Young-hoon, appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        As their souls disappear, the rain gradually stops, and the clouds in
        the sky begin to recede.
      </p>
      <p>Just like the festival back then, I bring my hand to her face.</p>
      <p>Without the veil, my fingertips lightly brush her face.</p>
      <p>Our fingertips touch again.</p>
      <p>The sky is purple.</p>
      <p>The sunset is fading, and the night sky is beginning to rise.</p>
      <p>We take three steps to the right, completing another circle.</p>
      <p>
        Our fingertips brush several times, and finally, we return to our
        original positions.
      </p>
      <p>Drip, drip...</p>
      <p>Tears fall.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, it’s not the black tears I have shed for 200 years.</p>
      <p>For the first time in 200 years, I am crying clear tears.</p>
      <p>I look at Hwang-hwa in a daze.</p>
      <p>"I can't imagine living in a world without you."</p>
      <p>In the next life, perhaps for countless lives,</p>
      <p>I might just commit suicide without thinking.</p>
      <p>"I just... want to die."</p>
      <p>I want to kneel before the heavens.</p>
      <p>Begging with my hands, pleading,</p>
      <p>Please, please kill me.</p>
      <p>Now, I truly wish to die.</p>
      <p>'If I die in this life, maybe I can meet her in the Netherworld.'</p>
      <p>But death beyond this life is not permitted for me.</p>
      <p>
        The moment I try to reach the Netherworld, I will be sent to the next
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because I'm in front of her, I am barely holding back from weeping
        and begging.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>She lightly presses my cheeks with both hands.</p>
      <p>[You can't.]</p>
      <p>
        "Hyang-hwa... A world without you is a curse. Just being alive is a
        curse."
      </p>
      <p>[Then, were the moments we spent together also a curse?]</p>
      <p>She smiles and asks.</p>
      <p>I tremble and shake my head.</p>
      <p>"It wasn’t."</p>
      <p>[Then, was everything I left behind also a curse and suffering?]</p>
      <p>She points at the Colorless Glass Swords and asks.</p>
      <p>I shake my head again.</p>
      <p>[Then...]</p>
      <p>She closes her eyes and brings her lips towards mine.</p>
      <p>She kisses me.</p>
      <p>I stand stunned, feeling her cold, surreal lips for a moment.</p>
      <p>After she pulls away, she asks,</p>
      <p>[Was what I just gave you also a curse?]</p>
      <p>"...No, it wasn't."</p>
      <p>Hyang-hwa embraces me.</p>
      <p>
        [Whether I became a wandering spirit or someone opened the gates of the
        Netherworld, I came here for one reason.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing her next words, I feel as if something that had been buried deep
        within my heart for 200 years is being cleansed and swept away.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I love you. Not being able to say it directly was my lingering regret.]
      </p>
      <p>I embrace her, releasing the words that have knotted in my heart.</p>
      <p>"I love you, too."</p>
      <p>The human heart is indeed peculiar.</p>
      <p>
        As I utter the pent-up words and read her feelings in the rosy hues of
        intent, I realize the hidden aspect of the Yin Soul Ghost Incantation.
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps a realm unknown even to its creator.</p>
      <p>No, rather, a realm I discovered by far surpassing the creator.</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        The black curse spells that have been attached all over my body begin to
        reverse.
      </p>
      <p>Even if a person's life is filled with pain and curses.</p>
      <p>If the hearts of people connect and understand each other.</p>
      <p>Maybe that… can be an endless blessing.</p>
      <p>
        The black curse spells reverse all at once, revealing what was hidden.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm?"</p>
      <p>In the ruins of the black castle, where Yuan Li had died.</p>
      <p>
        Core Formation cultivators still scavenge through the remains for the
        treasures Yuan Li had hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Nascent Soul old monster's abode keeps yielding more treasures."
      </p>
      <p>
        "We almost died, but it was worth it... But where did Cultivator Seo Ran
        go?"
      </p>
      <p>One of the cultivators looked for Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, not sure. He flew off in a hurry somewhere. Maybe he found
        something... I wonder what treasure he found to make him fly off so
        madly with that usually empty expression."
      </p>
      <p>
        "That is curious... Well, it doesn't matter. We've gathered enough for
        ourselves anyway."
      </p>
      <p>
        While they were rummaging through Yuan Li's residence, one of them
        sensed something unusual.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm? Wait, what's that?"</p>
      <p>
        The Black Ghost Curse Banner used by Seo Eun-hyun to immobilize Yuan
        Li's body.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Black Ghost Curse Banner, a brilliant white light begins to
        emanate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sticks with black lumps that Seo Eun-hyun planted and left behind in
        the desert.
      </p>
      <p>The lumps on those sticks began to shine white brightly.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The lumps burst open, flowering like buds.</p>
      <p>
        The blooming flowers are covered in pure white, each with six petals.
      </p>
      <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>
        Following the path Seo Eun-hyun had walked, hundreds of white magnolias
        began to sprout in the desert.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>I laugh, watching the white spells bloom from my body.</p>
      <p>
        The white blessings appearing all around seem to have the opposite
        properties of the curse spells.
      </p>
      <p>[Look at that, you're alive and even created a new method.]</p>
      <p>
        "It's just the Yin Soul Ghost Incantation, expressed with the feelings I
        share with you."
      </p>
      <p>[Ah, but it's completely different.]</p>
      <p>We chat and laugh together.</p>
      <p>
        It’s my first laugh in 200 years, but strangely, it doesn't feel awkward
        at all.
      </p>
      <p>[If I may suggest, as a fellow co-creator, may I name this method?]</p>
      <p>"Feel free to do so."</p>
      <p>
        She reaches out towards the floating blessings, which seem to be
        transforming into the shape of white magnolias.
      </p>
      <p>
        [How about White Orchid Blessing Incantation (白蘭祝聖文)? Is that
        alright?]
      </p>
      <p>I support her hand with mine beneath it.</p>
      <p>"I will remember it."</p>
      <p>
        We watch the blessings float into the sky for a while, and then our eyes
        meet.
      </p>
      <p>Her soul is becoming increasingly transparent, rising into the air.</p>
      <p>[I won't forget either.]</p>
      <p>"...Yes."</p>
      <p>I can’t control my trembling voice.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, I open my storage artifact.</p>
      <p>I remember reading about it in Seo Ran's library.</p>
      <p>
        "...The immortals of the higher realms, when they form a union, do
        this."
      </p>
      <p>I take out the remaining bottle of White-Red Wine.</p>
      <p>"Will it be alright?"</p>
      <p>As she floats higher, she nods.</p>
      <p>I rummage through my storage artifact.</p>
      <p>There are no cups.</p>
      <p>
        I have no choice but to pour half of the White-Red Wine in front of her
        grave as a substitute.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I drink the remaining half in front of her.</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        As the White-Red Wine enters my nearly shattered Golden Core, its
        effects activate, reconnecting me with my dharma treasures.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        The three thousand Colorless Glass Swords planted around begin
        vibrating.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>
        As her soul turns into a small orb of light, losing its form and
        ascending to the sky,
      </p>
      <p>The orb of light spins around in the air.</p>
      <p>
        It’s as if she’s dancing the twin immortals dance with someone again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps she’s unconsciously recalling the memories of those days when
        she was alive, those happy moments, and their dance movements.
      </p>
      <p>I watch the sky endlessly, then slowly sit down.</p>
      <p>My strength is now fading away.</p>
      <p>I take her norigae from my waist.</p>
      <p>
        With the last of my strength, I heat her heirloom with Dan Fire,
        transforming it into a dharma treasure.
      </p>
      <p>I close my eyes and hold the norigae deeply to my heart.</p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s the lingering effects of the White-Red Wine or the norigae
        itself, I feel a strong connection forming.
      </p>
      <p>My strength begins to ebb away.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li's last desperate cry echoes in my mind.</p>
      <p><em>‘What is the difference between a blessing and a curse?’</em></p>
      <p>
        Maybe the difference between blessings and curses isn't life and death.
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps, if the hearts of people connect, that is a blessing.</p>
      <p>And if the hearts are severed, that is a curse.</p>
      <p>This life has been hell.</p>
      <p>But at the end of this hell, I connected my heart.</p>
      <p>Maybe hell and heaven.</p>
      <p>Curses and blessings.</p>
      <p>Are determined by the connection between people's hearts.</p>
      <p>With this realization, I escape from the last cry of Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>"I loved you... Thank you. For sharing your heart with me."</p>
      <p>With a faint smile, all energy drains completely from my body.</p>
      <p>
        My meridians and Golden Core, which should have collapsed long ago,
        begin to lose their strength.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, at the edge of hell, I close my eyes in heaven..</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        As Seo Eun-hyun closed his eyes, the Colorless Glass Swords scattered
        around started to rise into the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        The swords, now strongly connected to their owner, begin to return to
        his body one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three thousand Colorless Glass Swords, returning to the Golden Core
        of the smiling passed Seo Eun-hyun, begin to impale his body one by one.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun's norigae and the three thousand Colorless Glass Swords
        simultaneously emit a bright light.
      </p>
      <p>The mother of Buk Hyang-hwa.</p>
      <p>The wife of Buk Joong-ho, Yeon's tomb.</p>
      <p>
        There are two trees that have grown near the magnolia tree at the tomb.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two trees, which somehow grew for over 200 years, bloom their
        flowers on the same day.
      </p>
      <p>A quince tree and a white magnolia.</p>
      <p>From each of the two trees, a flower falls.</p>
      <p>
        The flowers of the two trees land on the altar prepared for a wedding
        ceremony 200 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>
        A gust of wind from inside the tomb carries the quince flower away from
        the altar, somewhere into the desert.
      </p>
      <p>
        The white magnolia remains in place, while the quince flower flies off
        to the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>This is Seo Eun-hyun's eleventh return.</p>
      <p>
        Translator Notes: There you have it. Honestly, I probably overdid it
        with the mass release considering the length of the chapters (almost
        25000 words) but I felt that reading it all at once is the best
        experience. With that said, I hope you all enjoyed and I’m gonna take a
        day or two off. See ya!

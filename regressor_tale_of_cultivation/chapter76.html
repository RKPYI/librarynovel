        [Ah, who might this be? Isn't this the trio? It seems like just
        yesterday when you three were at the Nascent Soul stage, and now you've
        grown so much!]
      </p>
      <p>[Mad Lord!!!!!!]</p>
      <p>
        White Bone Ghost Devil widens their eyes, scattering dark ghostly
        energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their sharp roar makes the four directions tremble and the heavens and
        earth quake.
      </p>
      <p>[You, you...!!!]</p>
      <p>
        "Hey, are we really going to make such a disgraceful scene before the
        Ascension Gate?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, that old man probably doesn't want to cause unnecessary trouble
        before the Ascension Gate opens either."
      </p>
      <p>
        As White Bone Ghost Devil is about to erupt, Jin Byuk-ho and Sir
        Chang-ho holds them back by their shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord chuckles at them and then leapes down from his puppet, landing
        in front of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Your words ring true. At this auspicious time when the heavens open, I
        don't want to create unnecessary trouble. So, if you hand over that
        mortal to me, I shall just leave.]
      </p>
      <p>
        At his words, the three Heavenly Being cultivators gave a cold laugh and
        stood in front of us, blocking his path.
      </p>
      <p>Jin Byuk-ho locked eyes with Mad Lord and spoke.</p>
      <p>
        "Sorry, but they all possess talents beyond imagination, so it's
        difficult to hand them over."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't be too greedy, old man. You've already taken the core of our
        Nether Crossing Ship. What more do you desire?"
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, Mad Lord chuckles and strokes his beard.</p>
      <p>
        [Ah, right. The power source I took from your stomach, it works
        brilliantly. I've modified and installed it as [Her] heart. Thanks to
        you, [She] has become more complete. I'm always grateful to your Black
        Ghost Valley]
      </p>
      <p>White Bone Ghost Devil's pale face turns crimson with anger.</p>
      <p>
        "You... installed the power source of the Nether Crossing Ship in a mere
        puppet..! That power source, stronger than the combined dragon veins of
        a major sect, in a mere puppet..!"
      </p>
      <p>[A mere puppet..?]</p>
      <p>Mad Lord's expression hardens.</p>
      <p>
        [Say it again. [She] is just a mere puppet..? [She] is alive. [She] will
        become a complete being. [She] is everything in my life..! You want me
        to smash the rest of the Nether Crossing Ships..!]
      </p>
      <p>Koong!</p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord takes out a wooden box from his bosom and throws it, making it
        expand to his size.
      </p>
      <p>He places his hand on the lid of the large wooden box.</p>
      <p>'A storage device..?'</p>
      <p>
        The same kind of spiritual energy fluctuation that comes from storage
        devices is flowing out of the box.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, it feels much heavier, as if it contains far more than
        a typical storage device.
      </p>
      <p>Creak-</p>
      <p>Just as Mad Lord is about to lift the lid of the wooden box.</p>
      <p>"It's better not to open that, Mad Lord..!"</p>
      <p>Chaaak!</p>
      <p>
        White Bone Ghost Devil opens the storage device at their waist, and
        black darkness spews out, releasing something huge.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaaang!</p>
      <p>
        The huge object takes shape in the air and turns into a massive gate,
        about ten meters in size, landing behind us.
      </p>
      <p>On the door of the gate, a giant ghost king is depicted.</p>
      <p>Creeeak!</p>
      <p>
        The door of the ghost king opens. Inside is filled with pitch-black
        darkness, and it emits the smell of the ocean breeze.
      </p>
      <p>Chalang, chalang...</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, it sounds like the space behind the door is filled
        with water, making splashing sounds.
      </p>
      <p>I sharpen my vision to look inside the door and am startled.</p>
      <p>
        Inside the door, two huge warships emitting thin ghostly and yin energy
        are floating above a dark sea.
      </p>
      <p>'The Nether Crossing Ships..!'</p>
      <p>
        Although it’s unclear inside the door, the ghostly energy emanating from
        the two Nether Crossing Ships is far more chilling than the wrecked one
        I saw in my past life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, I could feel the presence of beings with the same aura as
        White Bone Ghost Devil inside the two ships.
      </p>
      <p>
        'So the words about bringing his entire sect in compressed form are
        true..'
      </p>
      <p>
        White Bone Ghost Devil reveals the two Nether Crossing Ships and growls
        at Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you open that, I'll take it as a declaration of war right here. I
        warn you, do not open it..!"
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm…]</p>
      <p>Creak..</p>
      <p>
        However, Mad Lord looks at White Bone Ghost Devil with a meaningful gaze
        and opens the lid of the box slightly more.
      </p>
      <p>At this, Sir Chang-ho and Jin Byuk-ho's expressions also harden.</p>
      <p>
        "Mad Lord, the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect also warns you, do
        not open that. Even if you are a one-man army, do you think you can
        stand against all of us?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I, Chang-ho, also warn you. If you pull out those things, I won't just
        stand by! Are you really planning to obliterate the Ascension Path!?"
      </p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>
        As Jin Byuk-ho brings his hands together, it looks as though lightning
        energy is gathering, and from within the lightning, a small model of a
        palace appears.
      </p>
      <p>From inside the palace, there are clear signs of many presences.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Sir Chang-ho also pulls out a scroll from his waist
        and unfolds it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scroll floats into the air and unrolls on its own, revealing a
        landscape painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Numerous presences are also felt from within the landscape painting.
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord grins wickedly.</p>
      <p>[Hmmmmmmm.....]</p>
      <p>Creak...</p>
      <p>The lid of the box is lifted further.</p>
      <p>
        [You bastard..! Do you really think you can wage war against us..!?]
      </p>
      <p>[Do you not value your life!?]</p>
      <p>[Are you underestimating us too much!?]</p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble...</p>
      <p>
        Dark clouds gather in the clear sky, and the heavens and earth begin to
        shake.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three Heavenly Beings raise their spiritual power, pressuring the
        Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>However, Mad Lord remains calm under their imposing aura.</p>
      <p>
        [You ask if I value my life? Of course, I don't. My heart has long been
        dead; what more is there to living? You better not provoke me further
        and leave the mortal here. Quickly make your way to the Ascension Gate.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmph, you could barely destroy one Nether Crossing Ship and ran away
        when you fought with my sect... In the current situation with the Golden
        Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect and Heaven Creation Sect combined, are you
        saying our three sects are inferior to you?]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Haha, not obliterating you completely back then and merely giving you a
        little lesson was my mercy. Did you not realize that? And that was at my
        weakest moment. If you wanted to confront me, you should have joined
        forces at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that [Her] heart is completed, it's even harder to face me than
        before... Think carefully.]
      </p>
      <p>Creak...</p>
      <p>Mad Lord opens the lid further again.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, numerous types of spiritual energy burst from the gap in
        the box, and the three Heavenly Beings tense up, glaring at Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>Then, it happened.</p>
      <p>Swoosh-</p>
      <p>Rain begins pouring around us.</p>
      <p>"Huff.. Huff.."</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo suddenly turns red and
        collapses.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble...</p>
      <p>
        There were already dark clouds due to the clash of aura between the
        Heavenly Beings and Mad Lord, but the flow of the clouds accelerated.
      </p>
      <p>'What, she awakened her power today..?'</p>
      <p>I’m shocked, guessing why she’s reacting like this.</p>
      <p>This is also a day earlier than planned.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the eyes of the three Heavenly Beings and Mad Lord turn
        to Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo.
      </p>
      <p>[Oh, what's this... An interesting bloodline?]</p>
      <p>Mad Lord's eyes sparkle as he strokes his beard.</p>
      <p>
        The three Heavenly Beings also looked at Deputy Manager Oh with
        interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Reacting to the energy of my living puppets..? Ah, I see. There’s a
        puppet made from the royal family of the Sea Dragon Tribe. Is she
        reacting to the bloodline of that puppet? Haha, makes me want to dissect
        her.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord steps forward towards Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo, grinning, and
        the three Heavenly Beings raise their aura to block his path.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Do you think anyone here will hand over even a single person to you,
        Mad Lord!]
      </p>
      <p>
        [If you don't back down, I'll kill everyone here and replenish them with
        living puppets.]
      </p>
      <p>Creak...</p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord lifts the lid of the box further, and the faces of the three
        Heavenly Beings become even more distorted with fierce anger.
      </p>
      <p>Their aura alone seems enough to shatter heaven and earth.</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>
        Lightning flashes in the sky, and suddenly, a new figure appears in the
        arena.
      </p>
      <p>A young man with blue hair, wearing a blue robe.</p>
      <p>
        A small horn protrudes from his forehead, and he radiates a composed
        aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Well. The heavens are twisting and something calls to my bloodline, so
        I came early. Didn't expect to see familiar faces...]
      </p>
      <p>Sea Dragon King Seo Hweol.</p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, even he appeared at a different time than in my past life.
      </p>
      <p>
        [It's been a while, Golden Heavenly Lightning Sect Master. Elder of
        Black Ghost Valley. Heaven Creation Sect Leader. And...]
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hweol greets Mad Lord with a smile in his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        [Mad Lord is here too. While rushing over, I heard the wind say that
        there's a conflict between you and the three... May I mediate?
      </p>
      <p>
        Fighting here in Ascension Path during this auspicious time is something
        none of you would want, especially you, Mad Lord. Instead of trying to
        destroy the Ascension Path, why not close that thing?]
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon Seo Hweol's arrival, Mad Lord smirks in amusement, and the three
        Heavenly Beings show delight.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Haha, if the respectable Sea Dragon King says so, it must be credible.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Yes, the Sea Dragon King has resolved many conflicts and brought peace.
        We hope you'll advise that old man to keep his composure.]
      </p>
      <p>[I too find the Sea Dragon King trustworthy.]</p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho, White Bone Ghost Devil, and Sir Chango-ho greet Seo Hweol
        with trust.
      </p>
      <p>However, Mad Lord chuckles mockingly.</p>
      <p>
        [Puhuh, hahaha... What? That guy mediates disputes and brings peace?
        He's the one who spread discord and schemed across the continent. Are
        you all brainless?]
      </p>
      <p>Jin Byuk-ho refutes.</p>
      <p>
        [Don't slander the Sea Dragon King, Mad Lord! Unlike you, who lacks
        credibility, the Sea Dragon King has been mediating conflicts all this
        time.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hahaha! All of you are blinded from only looking after your own sects.
        You must roam freely like me to see the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does he seem kind and reputable? He's a broken man. He wears a thick
        mask, hiding his true self, even I can't see through him.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmph, isn't it natural for everyone to hide some of their thoughts?]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Heh, are you naive because you're young or unbroken? You know nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's something only those with broken hearts understand. I, too, am
        broken and know my kind! He's a monster, more twisted and rotten than
        me!
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol, did you think wearing your mask would fool everyone? I can
        see through it. I'm broken like you.]
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hweol simply smiles gracefully, not responding.</p>
      <p>
        [Seo Hweol, Seo Hweol. Just because your heart is dead, locking it in a
        mask will only worsen it. Wouldn't it be better to live freely, like
        me?]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Haha, I've lived as my heart desires. I have nothing to regret, so
        isn't this a life to be grateful for?]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Huh, the conflicts and pain you've caused by following your heart...
        You're turning more into a monster. Make your choices wisely.]
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hweol smiles silently without changing his expression.</p>
      <p>[Thank you for the advice, Old Man.]</p>
      <p>[You're older than me, Old Man. How hypocritical.]</p>
      <p>
        [Isn't it right to consider anyone with something to teach as a senior
        in life?]
      </p>
      <p>White Bone Ghost Devil scoffs at their conversation.</p>
      <p>
        [Sea Dragon King, you have a hard time. Such a great person being
        slandered by that senile monster. A 'heart disease'? More like that mad
        old man is the one with a diseased heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        He's a lunatic who turns normal people into puppets with his crazy
        logic!]
      </p>
      <p>
        [It's not my crazy logic, you fool. I've realized one of the world's
        principles and evolved others to implement it!]
      </p>
      <p>
        White Bone Ghost Devil look disgusted and stops arguing with Mad Lord,
        turning to Seo Hweol.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I don't want to fight with that mad old man anymore. Sea Dragon King,
        please mediate.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Understood. Old Man, and you three, is this dispute mainly about those
        mortals?]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Yes. We found them first, so we have the right to make them disciples.
        But that wretched old man keeps telling us to leave!]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Huh, do you think you can teach those kids well? Especially the one
        with the vast consciousness, only I can teach her the best. From my
        perspective, the woman using the Sea Dragon Tribe’s power to control the
        wind and rain, you, as a spiritual beast, can teach her the best.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord points at Manager Kim, indicating himself, then points at
        Deputy Manager Oh, indicating Seo Hweol.
      </p>
      <p>
        [What nonsense! Our Azure Ghost Valley lacks no elemental methods. Do
        you know how long our sect's history is?[
      </p>
      <p>
        [I don't care how old your Black Ghost Valley is. I know you have plenty
        of techniques, but do you have a proper teacher? Especially me, I've
        learned many consciousness related techniques in various ways. I can
        teach much more about controlling consciousness.]
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hwol speaks slowly to them.</p>
      <p>
        [Firstly, I want to ask you three. Realistically, can you withstand the
        spatial pressure if you add two more people each right now?]
      </p>
      <p>The three Heavenly Beings look concerned.</p>
      <p>Seo Hweol continues.</p>
      <p>
        [I suppose you've all put your full effort into ascending your sects
        this time. In each sect's building or ship, selected disciples are under
        the elders' guidance, resisting the spatial pressure.]
      </p>
      <p>[...Right.]</p>
      <p>
        [Adding one more person would be fine as you can bear their pressure,
        but adding more than two could disrupt the formation and increase the
        risk of failing the ascent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially since you're attempting the ascent during the widest opening
        of the Ascension Gate, failure is not an option.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol's calm explanation is met with expressions of regret on the
        faces of the three Heavenly Beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        [However, it is true that the three of you discovered these humans
        first. You acknowledge that, right, Old Man? I understand that Old Man's
        logic is different from the usual, but even in your logic, the sequence
        of time does not change.]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord chuckles at Seo Hweol's words and nods his head.</p>
      <p>[Well, let's just say that's correct for now.]</p>
      <p>
        [So, wouldn't it be right for Old Man to offer appropriate compensation
        to the three of you? In a way, Old Man is trying to snatch away the
        treasure you discovered, so it's only fair that you receive proper
        compensation.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, the complexions of the three Heavenly Men brighten.
      </p>
      <p>[Indeed, Seo Hweol, you are a wise judge!]</p>
      <p>[A truly excellent response.]</p>
      <p>[The future of the Sea Dragon Tribe is bright.]</p>
      <p>
        However, Mad Lord's eyes sparkle as he lifts the lid of the box further.
      </p>
      <p>[But what if I refuse?]</p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, the Sea Dragon King frowns as if he has a headache,
        and the three Heavenly Being's faces contort.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I belong to no sect and have no living beings to take along, so I bear
        almost no pressure. I could just smash all of you right here, along with
        the unique constitution individuals you've chosen, capture them all,
        dissect, and 'evolve' them for my world. Why should I bother
        negotiating?]
      </p>
      <p>At this, the Sea Dragon King takes a deep breath.</p>
      <p>Kuwoong!</p>
      <p>Wind begins to blow around him.</p>
      <p>
        [I made the best offer I could. If you continue to ignore my proposal,
        the Sea Dragon Tribe and I will join the three sects in attacking Old
        Man and retrieve the bodies of my kin whom Old Man kidnapped in the
        past.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmph, pretending to care about your kin just to secure a moral high
        ground. Isn't that just laying the groundwork for your argument?]
      </p>
      <p>
        After a brief stare-down between Seo Hweol and Mad Lord, Mad Lord smiles
        and closes the box.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Fine. I'll concede a bit today. If it’s just the three of you it’s
        unknown, but with the Dragon King involved, I might indeed lose. I need
        to ascend and complete [Her] this time, so I'll go along with your
        proposal.]
      </p>
      <p>He steps back and points at Kim Yeon.</p>
      <p>
        [I'll take her as my disciple. The compensation will be discussed later.
        I swear it in front of [Her].]
      </p>
      <p>Thump, thump, thump-</p>
      <p>Mad Lord taps on the wooden box and listens closely to its surface.</p>
      <p>Then, nodding solemnly, he speaks,</p>
      <p>[Did you hear that? [She] has also witnessed my oath.]</p>
      <p>
        The three Heavenly Beings watch Mad Lord's actions, their faces twisting
        in disdain.
      </p>
      <p>[What's this... A puppet speaking...]</p>
      <p>Seo Hweol sighs and says to the three Heavenly Beings.</p>
      <p>
        [You know that Old Man's logic is different from the norm. But from what
        I've observed, every oath sworn before [Her] by Old Man has been upheld.
        I guarantee it, so please trust me.]
      </p>
      <p>At this, the three Heavenly Beings click their tongues but nod.</p>
      <p>
        [Then I'll take this mortal as my disciple, and we'll discuss
        compensation later... What about that mortal?]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord points at Deputy Manager Oh.</p>
      <p>
        [From my insight, Seo Hweol seems most likely to draw out that mortal's
        potential. But I'm worried that the young mortal might learn only bad
        things from Seo Hweol. How about I take that her too?]
      </p>
      <p>At this, Seo Hweol's eyebrows twitch.</p>
      <p>
        But soon regaining his composure, he turns to Deputy Oh Hye-Seo with a
        pleasant smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        [To be honest, it would be too burdensome for any of the three
        cultivators to take two, and it wouldn’t be ideal to leave two with Old
        Man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would you permit me to take this woman? I too promise, staking my honor,
        to offer compensation later.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, the three Heavenly Beings glare at Mad Lord and
        speak.
      </p>
      <p>[Since the Dragon King has mediated, let's do so.]</p>
      <p>They seem displeased that Mad Lord is gaining more advantage.</p>
      <p>Then, Seo Hweol approaches Deputy Manager Oh.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I feel dizzy.</p>
      <p>'Why... has it come to this?'</p>
      <p>
        I asked them to awaken Manager Kim's talent, and sensing it, Mad Lord
        flew in, ready to confront the three Heavenly Beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord, having opened the box, released the energy of the biological
        puppets of the Sea Dragon Race's royal family, awakening Deputy Manager
        Oh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol, feeling Deputy Manager Oh's ability, arrived faster than
        expected, mediated, and distributed the personnel as originally fated.
      </p>
      <p>As originally fated.</p>
      <p>
        Everything, strangely enough, is flowing exactly as it should have been,
        according to the original history.
      </p>
      <p>I kneel before them with a hollow laugh.</p>
      <p>
        "Seniors, please hear my words. These people are my colleagues. Can you
        just let them stay with me?"
      </p>
      <p>Upon hearing this, Mad Lord flicks his finger.</p>
      <p>
        [I forgot about that. What are you? Why do you, a human, carry a Demon
        Core inside? This is new... I want to dissect you.]
      </p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>"Ah... Aaah!"</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, my Inner Core inside my dantian starts to ache as if
        being pulled out.
      </p>
      <p>Under Mad Lord's will, my Inner Core is being drawn outward.</p>
      <p>I feel like my abdomen would rip open any moment!</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>A gentle energy flows between me and Mad Lord, blocking his energy.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, the owner of the energy is Seo Hweol.</p>
      <p>
        [How can Old Man torment such a powerless being? It's better to refrain
        from such actions during this auspicious time.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [...Hmph! Such a hypocrite. Fine. It's just a Qi Building Demon Core
        anyway. It won't be much use for research. I'll leave it be.]
      </p>
      <p>"Tsk tsk, tough luck getting caught by the madman."</p>
      <p>Sir Chang-ho taps my shoulder.</p>
      <p>
        His touch heals the internal injury I sustained from Mad Lord in my
        dantian.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hweol looks at Mad Lord and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        [Swear that you won't bother these weak and pitiful beings after we
        leave.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [...What? Have you gone mad, Seo Hweol? What are you even talking
        about?]
      </p>
      <p>[Why torment the powerless during such an auspicious time?]</p>
      <p>
        At this, Mad Lord bursts into laughter after staring blankly at Seo
        Hweol for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hahaha! Disgusting, utterly disgusting. It's a pity that you all don't
        know the atrocities Seo Hweol has committed while being holed up in your
        sects. It's so revolting it almost makes me sick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fine! I swear, impressed by your disgustingness. Even [She] suggests to
        just empathize and let it slide.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord swore to [Her] that he would no longer bother us, then stepped
        back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol, with a kind smile, looks at me and says to the three Heavenly
        Beings,
      </p>
      <p>
        [I've seen on my way here that the three of you have also harmed many
        spirits of Ascension Path. What’s done is done, but please exercise
        restraint to avoid negativity during this auspicious time.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho, White Bone Ghost Devil, and Sir Chang-ho nod reluctantly.
      </p>
      <p>[We've embarrassed ourselves in front of the Dragon King.]</p>
      <p>[We'll exercise caution.]</p>
      <p>[How righteous you are, Sea Dragon King.]</p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol chuckles, exchanging pleasantries with them, then picks up
        Deputy Manager Oh and approaches me who is managing the pain in my
        dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I don't know the details, but you're undoubtedly of demi-human lineage.
        Since it's come to this, would you be willing to do me a favor?]
      </p>
      <p>"What is it?"</p>
      <p>Seo Hweol takes out a dark bead from his robe.</p>
      <p>
        [Due to sensing this woman's energy and arriving hastily, there is
        something I couldn't handle. I should have delivered this bead to one of
        my descendants remaining in the sea, but I failed to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you deliver this bead to my descendant, Seo Ran, who resides near
        Utmost Chaos Island?]
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        [If you agree to my request, as a reward, I will give you a special
        cultivation manual suitable for someone of your demi-human lineage.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol then takes out a demon beast method bound in demon beast
        leather and hands it to me.
      </p>
      <p>The title of the manual is Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation.</p>
      <p>'Ah, so this was why he saved me.'</p>
      <p>Now I understand Seo Hweol's intentions.</p>
      <p>
        Hiding my rising disgust, I put on a mask of gratitude in front of Seo
        Hweol and accept what he has given.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Tha, thank you, Dragon King... I will not forget the favor you have
        shown."
      </p>
      <p>[You're welcome. And remember...]</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>His gaze becomes fierce and intense.</p>
      <p>
        [Expressing your opinion like earlier is courageous, but it can also be
        reckless. Be sure to behave properly in front of those greater than
        yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        To answer your question, you and that other person are of ambiguous
        quality for taking. Leaving your colleagues behind means they are likely
        to be consumed by their mythical talents and perish.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a way to suppress those qualities, it's a good suggestion,
        but if not, it's better to stay quiet and remember this.]
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>His presence makes it hard to even breathe.</p>
      <p>
        The Dragon King gives me calm advice, then transforms into a dragon and
        flies towards the Ascension Gate. The other Heavenly Beings also take my
        colleagues and fly towards the Ascension Gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Left in the area are only Mad Lord, who had knocked out Manager Kim Yeon
        trying to escape, and me with Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>I stare blankly into space.</p>
      <p>Why did everything turn out this way?</p>
      <p>As Mad Lord looks at me and Kim Young-hoon, a spatial rift opens.</p>
      <p>
        [Tsk, such a hypocritical dragon. If he’s going to talk like that, he
        should at least send them outside Ascension Path...]
      </p>
      <p>"Ha, ha..."</p>
      <p>
        In a past life, I had managed to send Kim Young-hoon away through Seo
        Hweol's hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in this life, everything returned to how it originally was, like a
        rubber band snapping back.
      </p>
      <p>Probably, Mad Lord will send me and Kim Young-hoon back.</p>
      <p>Again.</p>
      <p>The same way.</p>
      <p>To Yanguo.</p>
      <p>"Senior."</p>
      <p>I ask Mad Lord, unable to hide my feeling of futility.</p>
      <p>"Does fate really exist?"</p>
      <p>
        At my question, Mad Lord strokes his beard with an intrigued expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Fate does exist. I'm not sure if you've learned any special techniques,
        but when you perform the Qi Refining Seven Stars Ritual, everyone
        realizes that there is such a thing called fate.]
      </p>
      <p>He points to the sky.</p>
      <p>[What is fated to happen, [will] happen. That is fate.]</p>
      <p>"Then, can humans not change their fate?"</p>
      <p>At this, Mad Lord smirks.</p>
      <p>
        [You don't seem to understand the structure of fate. No, that's not the
        case. Every living being can change their fate.]
      </p>
      <p>"...Yes?"</p>
      <p>
        [Have you ever wondered why cultivators learn the principles of the
        Seventy-Two Earthly Sha, Thirty-Six Heavenly Gang, Seven Stars, and the
        Spiritual Energy Star during Qi Building? Why do they learn the
        principles of the stars in the sky?]
      </p>
      <p>His finger stabs towards the end of the void.</p>
      <p>
        [Have you ever questioned why cultivators are 'against the heavens'?]
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's... isn't it obvious? Because they defy the lifespan given by the
        heavens.."
      </p>
      <p>
        [Then 'why' can cultivators defy the lifespan, the fate, given by the
        heavens?]
      </p>
      <p>"That's..."</p>
      <p>I have never thought about this before.</p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord draws in the air with Pure Spiritual Force from his fingertip.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You poor thing, let this great being explain the structure of fate to
        you, as [She] also suggests.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Translator Notes: Mad Lord is such a troll. Dude’s insane but he’s
        strangely more amiable then a lot of cultivators. This doesn’t change
        the fact that he’s insane and highly dangerous though.

      <p>Chapter 158: Master's Grace (4)</p>
      <p>It's peculiar.</p>
      <p>
        But rather than chasing after that strange sense of unease, Oh Hyun-seok
        began to think of something else first.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>The light burning from Oh Hyun-seok’s body enters within.</p>
      <p>
        He has completed the early Core Formation stage, the Heavenly Market
        Enclosure, and entered the mid stage of Supreme Palace Enclosure.
      </p>
      <p>'Mid stage of Core Formation.'</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok looks up at the sky and raises his fist.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugugugu!</p>
      <p>And as he thrusts his fist towards the sky,</p>
      <p>The entire blue sky seems to ripple.</p>
      <p>"Huuh…"</p>
      <p>Paaaat!</p>
      <p>
        Around Oh Hyun-seok, the blue light of the Azure Spirit Striking Origin
        Technique, the starlight of Starlight Protecting Void Body, and the Five
        Elements of the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture shine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under his focus, all the energies floating around his body merge into
        one, transforming into the power of Primordial Chaos.
      </p>
      <p>Patsutstst!</p>
      <p>
        The power of Primordial Chaos mixing inside Oh Hyun-seok's body suddenly
        turns purple.
      </p>
      <p>But after a while,</p>
      <p>
        The purple covering Oh Hyun-seok's body disappears, and once again, the
        light emitted by the Azure Spirit Starlight Quintessence Great Method
        covers his body.
      </p>
      <p>'Was it called the Unique Holy Body?'</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok recalls the ability he had just used to summon 'Primordial
        Chaos' power from within himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authority of the Unique Holy Body was already fully conveyed to Oh
        Hyun-seok by Azure Tiger Saint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the capabilities of the Unique Holy Body he was told, there was no
        ability to manifest Primordial Chaos like just now.
      </p>
      <p>'My talent is not merely the Unique Holy Body.'</p>
      <p>
        Somehow, Oh Hyun-seok feels that the Unique Holy Body is just an
        'additional feature'.
      </p>
      <p>His true talent lies elsewhere.</p>
      <p>'...Well, for now, that's all I can know.'</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok contemplated his body for a while and then stood up.</p>
      <p>
        'If there's a way to maintain this state of Primordial Chaos... I feel
        like I can even defeat Seo Eun-hyun if I keep drawing upon it.'
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok licks his lips regretfully and looks somewhere.</p>
      <p>
        Anyway, whether it's due to the Unique Holy Body or the Azure Spirit
        Starlight Quintessence Great Method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok can tell that he had gained an enormous increase in power
        by advancing to the mid stage of Core Formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now, I possess power that surpasses the Grand Perfection of Core
        Formation."
      </p>
      <p>He isn't sure if it reaches the Nascent Soul stage.</p>
      <p>
        But anyway, he has definitely surpassed the ordinary Core Formation
        stage.
      </p>
      <p>"Wait for me, Seo Eun-hyun."</p>
      <p>Today, of all days.</p>
      <p>He is determined to defeat him.</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok thought so.</p>
      <p>Patt!</p>
      <p>Heaven and earth flashes</p>
      <p>
        On Azure Tiger Saint’s training ground, small mountains rise up as Oh
        Hyun-seok rolls his feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to Azure Tiger Saint's mountains that fill a radius of ten li,
        Oh Hyun-seok’s mountains are quite small in size.
      </p>
      <p>But still, a mountain is a mountain.</p>
      <p>Over 20 large terrains spread out in all directions.</p>
      <p>And, dodging those terrains, a man is rushing towards Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, look, how about it! My power has definitely surpassed Core
        Formation! Am I a bit worthy to face you now!?"
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok rushes towards Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok, transforming into sheer power itself, charges at Seo
        Eun-hyun with a body slam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun dodges, and the mountain where Oh Hyun-seok collided with
        explodes and shatters completely.
      </p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>"Second Wing!"</p>
      <p>In the middle of the exploded mountain,</p>
      <p>
        A blue light bursts forth from its center, and two pairs of wings spread
        out behind Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>
        The offensive technique of the Azure Spirit Starlight Quintessence Great
        Method, Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter, starts from a single pair of wings,
        First Wing, to nine pairs, Ninth Wing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tenth pair, the legendary Tenth Wing, exists in legend but is just
        that—a legend.
      </p>
      <p>
        First Wing allows a mid Core Formation cultivator to deliver a late Core
        Formation level strike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second Wing enables a late Core Formation cultivator to exert power
        surpassing Grand Perfection.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Oh Hyun-seok is already unfolding Second Wing at the Mid Core
        Formation stage.
      </p>
      <p>Zzzzng!</p>
      <p>Space ripples around Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>
        Even without using Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter, his normal punches
        already surpass Grand Perfection of Core Formation!
      </p>
      <p>
        With Second Wing, Oh Hyun-seok boasts the power of the early Nascent
        Soul stage!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Be on your guard! Even you cannot remain unharmed if you take this
        hit!"
      </p>
      <p>He proclaims confidently.</p>
      <p>But Seo Eun-hyun remains expressionless, standing still.</p>
      <p>
        "...In my opinion, it might be more feasible to settle this with close
        combat rather than wasting energy."
      </p>
      <p>"Ha! Quiet! Take this!"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok throws a punch.</p>
      <p>Kiiiiing!</p>
      <p>Blue light explodes, creating a vortex.</p>
      <p>The swirling ligh fly towards Seo Eun-hyun as if to engulf him.</p>
      <p>
        But Seo Eun-hyun dodges again without direct confrontation, simply
        moving his feet.
      </p>
      <p>But just when Seo Eun-hyun dodged.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        A vortex of light pours again towards the spot Seo Eun-hyun dodged to.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun smiles with a hint of interest in his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "You've read my intent. Are you finally entering my world of vision?"
      </p>
      <p>He dodges Oh Hyun-seok's attack once more.</p>
      <p>'He dodged…again.'</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok inhales deeply, looking at Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>But this time, he isn't as dejected as before.</p>
      <p>
        'Previously, he just leisurely evaded my attacks with his footwork.'
      </p>
      <p>But today is different.</p>
      <p>When Seo Eun-hyun dodged his last attack, there was no leisure.</p>
      <p>
        In addition to his usual footwork, he had to hurriedly combine it with
        the Flying Escape Technique to dodge in a hurry.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mountain so high it pierces the clouds and whose peak is invisible.
      </p>
      <p>If that was Seo Eun-hyun until now.</p>
      <p>
        For a moment, Oh Hyun-seok felt as if the clouds had briefly cleared,
        revealing the summit.
      </p>
      <p>"Be on your guard, Seo Eun-hyun!"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok shouts as if pleased.</p>
      <p>"The day when you and I can truly spar isn't far off!"</p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>In front of Oh Hyun-seok, who was shouting like that.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun appears swiftly.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun extends his hand with a faint smile.</p>
      <p>It’s slow and soft.</p>
      <p>But somehow, Oh Hyun-seok feels it is impossible to dodge the hand.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Koong!</p>
      <p>
        As Seo Eun-hyun's hand touches Oh Hyun-seok's body, Oh Hyun-seok spits
        blood and is knocked away.
      </p>
      <p>'He's smiling for the first time in a long while.'</p>
      <p>"...That's good. Please grow quickly."</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun says.</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok thinks to himself, watching Seo Eun-hyun return to his
        quarters.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Did you only smile in anticipation of properly sparring someday, Seo
        Eun-hyun?'
      </p>
      <p>A person who responds to everything indifferently.</p>
      <p>
        Always training madly, as if endlessly busy, with an expressionless face
        and profound eyes.
      </p>
      <p>Only when he truly fights,</p>
      <p>Or when a worthy opponent appears, does he occasionally smile.</p>
      <p>'Just how broken are you?'</p>
      <p>Is that truly human?</p>
      <p>Is that the life of a proper human being?</p>
      <p>How broken must a person be to lose their smile except in battle?</p>
      <p>Over the past 10 years.</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok, training and sparring by Seo Eun-hyun's side, felt this
        more and more clearly.
      </p>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun is definitely broken!</p>
      <p>'I don't know why you're so broken, but...'</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok clenches his fist.</p>
      <p>
        'I'll train even harder to stand on equal ground, in order to ask you
        properly!’
      </p>
      <p>
        With a firm resolution, Oh Hyun-seok immediately recovers and goes to
        find Azure Tiger Saint.
      </p>
      <p>"Master, I request to spar! Please instruct me!"</p>
      <p>
        "Hahaha! You've got a good look in your eyes recently, Hyun-seok.
        Alright, shall we continue today?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok fully prepared himself to be beaten by Azure Tiger Saint,
        clenching his fist.
      </p>
      <p>‘Let's become steel.'</p>
      <p>
        To be beaten and to beat in return, to become even more hardened steel.
      </p>
      <p>
        So that he can become a shield to protect that once junior from becoming
        more broken.
      </p>
      <p>To become such an adult.</p>
      <p>Thus, 5 years passed.</p>
      <p>Paaaat!</p>
      <p>
        As the spiritual energy of heaven and earth connected, Oh Hyun-seok
        completed the mid stage of the Supreme Palace Enclosure and entered the
        late stage of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        A stage where he himself becomes a priest connecting his body to the
        heavens, and the king of his own flesh as a nation.
      </p>
      <p>Late stage of Core Formation.</p>
      <p>Purple Forbidden Enclosure!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok half-opens his eyes and stands up.</p>
      <p>A lot has happened over the past 5 years.</p>
      <p>
        Since reaching the mid Core Formation stage, Oh Hyun-seok traveled
        around Azure Cold Island, carrying out missions for the sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun did the same, traveling here and there on missions. There
        were no missions that Oh Hyun-seok and Seo Eun-hyun undertook that ended
        in failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Recently, that guy’s been traveling all around Azure Cold Island
        collecting something…’
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past 5 years, while taking on the sect's missions, Seo Eun-hyun
        had been collecting certain materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of these materials are quite expensive, and it has become quite the
        topic of conversation throughout Azure Heaven Creation Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint appears to know why Seo Eun-hyun is doing so, but when
        Oh Hyun-seok asked, he always responded with ‘Ask him yourself.’
      </p>
      <p>
        When Oh Hyun-seok directly asked Seo Eun-hyun, he never gave a straight
        answer, only mentioning he was making something to save a comrade.
      </p>
      <p>‘Such a secretive guy…’</p>
      <p>
        Despite being busy with training, he’s learning and making something in
        the meantime?
      </p>
      <p>‘He’s more versatile than I thought.’</p>
      <p>
        After pondering about Seo Eun-hyun for a moment, he got up and went to
        Azure Tiger Saint.
      </p>
      <p>"Master, I've reached the stage of Purple Forbidden Enclosure."</p>
      <p>
        "Hahaha, my disciples indeed! Both Eun-hyun and you always exceed my
        expectations! It hasn't even been 50 years since you reached Core
        Formation, and now you're already in the late stage..."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, it's all thanks to Master’s grace."</p>
      <p>"Nonsense, it's all thanks to your tireless efforts."</p>
      <p>"Haha, the one who truly works tirelessly is Seo Eun-hyun."</p>
      <p>Word for word.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun trained as if possessed, not even speaking to Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was it some kind of obsession? He always trained with an anxious face,
        constantly practicing.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, he has now entered the peak of the Purple Forbidden
        Enclosure.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, he might even advance to the stage of Grand Perfection.</p>
      <p>"Well, Seo Eun-hyun is indeed a rare breed."</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. Anyway, since I've reached the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, we
        should celebrate, shouldn’t we?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok asks with a sly look, and Azure Tiger Saint laughs
        heartily, standing up.
      </p>
      <p>"Right! To celebrate, let's enjoy a spirited spar!"</p>
      <p>And the two prepared themselves in the training ground.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint's mystical technique signaled the start of the battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he moved, the entire training ground transformed into a forest,
        becoming a battlefield that emitted dense wood spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, Azure Tiger Saint vanished from sight.</p>
      <p>
        However, Oh Hyun-seok was not flustered and used the Five Elements
        Enduring Origin Scripture to trace the flow of spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>"There you are!"</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok's punch strikes somewhere in the forest.</p>
      <p>
        A corner of the forest flies off, revealing Azure Tiger Saint who
        chuckles.
      </p>
      <p>"Hiding is no longer effective against you."</p>
      <p>Ta-at!</p>
      <p>The two muscular giants charge at each other.</p>
      <p>Kwaang, Bang, Kwaang!</p>
      <p>What follows is a relentless physical brawl!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok and Azure Tiger Saint aim their fists at each other.</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, now you're definitely at the level of the Nascent Soul stage!"
      </p>
      <p>Space ripples where Oh Hyun-seok's fist passes.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, where Azure Tiger Saint's fist passes, space and everything
        else is torn apart.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang, Bang, Kwaang!</p>
      <p>Their fists collide repeatedly.</p>
      <p>
        Each time, blood spurts from Oh Hyun-seok's arms, while Azure Tiger
        Saint's healing power flows, regenerating the battered Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, Oh Hyun-seok becomes tougher as he is beaten.</p>
      <p>At a certain moment.</p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok's momentum changes.</p>
      <p>‘Here I go.’</p>
      <p>Kwaang, Kwaang, Kwaang!</p>
      <p>Explosions echoe in all directions.</p>
      <p>
        When Oh Hyun-seok's fist hits Azure Tiger Saint, the ground behind him
        collapses under the impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even without a direct hit, the aftermath alone drastically alters the
        landscape.
      </p>
      <p>Chachak, Chachak, Chachachak!</p>
      <p>
        Continuously being hit by Azure Tiger Saint's attacks and having flesh
        torn away, Oh Hyun-seok steps forward, looking at Azure Tiger Saint.
      </p>
      <p>An even fiercer storm of punches envelops Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>But he steps forward again.</p>
      <p>One step, second step, third step…</p>
      <p>And eventually.</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok, amidst the storm of punches, can see something flickering
        before his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>‘Now, I can see it clearly.’</p>
      <p>Red lines.</p>
      <p>Following these lines indicate where the opponent will strike.</p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>After dodging Azure Tiger Saint's fist,</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok clenches his own as hard as he can.</p>
      <p>Blue lines.</p>
      <p>
        Following these lines allows him to attack the opponent with the maximum
        power he can muster.
      </p>
      <p>Until now, these lines were only fleetingly visible.</p>
      <p>But at this moment!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok can finally see the lines he wants, when he wants.</p>
      <p>Wooong!</p>
      <p>"Third Wing."</p>
      <p>Three pairs of wings unfold behind Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok concentrates all his energy into his arm and launches at
        Azure Tiger Saint, following the blue line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint's eyes glow with fighting spirit as he thrusts his own
        bare fist directly at Oh Hyun-seok's punch.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaaaaang!</p>
      <p>A thunderous noise erupts, turning the world upside down.</p>
      <p>Blue brilliance swallows the land.</p>
      <p>After a while,</p>
      <p>When the light subsides.</p>
      <p>Shuuuuu...</p>
      <p>
        "Amazing. Setting aside the fact that you've unfolded Third Wing, how is
        the power of Third Wing equivalent to the late Nascent Soul stage?"
      </p>
      <p>"It just happened like that."</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok chuckles in response.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, Azure Tiger Saint launches a fist towards Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok dodges Azure Tiger Saint's fist with minimal movement,
        similar to how Seo Eun-hyun had effortlessly dodged his attacks until
        now.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing this, Azure Tiger Saint laughs heartily.</p>
      <p>"You've entered it too, that vision!"</p>
      <p>"Embarrassingly, I've only just managed to enter."</p>
      <p>
        "Hahahaha! What are you talking about? It took me 80 years just to
        properly see intent, and you've reached that stage in less than 50
        years. You have talent for martial arts after all. Having reached the
        vision of a peak martial artist, you'll definitely see the third color
        in a few decades."
      </p>
      <p>The Azure Tiger Saint laughs heartily, crossing his arms.</p>
      <p>
        "It took me 80 years to enter the world of intent, and another 60 years
        to barely see the third color, but it seems you also have talent in this
        area. Having such outstanding disciples makes me beam with pride!"
      </p>
      <p>"You flatter me. But, Master."</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok looks at Azure Tiger Saint with serious eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "With the realm I've achieved, do you think I can defeat Seo Eun-hyun in
        your opinion, Master?”
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>To that, Azure Tiger Saint ponders before responding.</p>
      <p>
        "You will definitely lose. However, if you continue to diligently
        progress, it's certainly possible. Eun-hyun's growth seems to have
        slowed down recently, but your growth rate is still steadily increasing,
        is it not?"
      </p>
      <p>"Is that so."</p>
      <p>
        'Definitely lose. That means the gap between him and me is that
        significant.'
      </p>
      <p>However, Oh Hyun-seok grins.</p>
      <p>'Master said, "definitely lose."'</p>
      <p>
        Until now, when asked about the gap between him and Seo Eun-hyun, he
        wasn't given such a clear outcome.
      </p>
      <p>He was just told to continue diligently progressing.</p>
      <p>
        In other words, until now, a fight between him and Seo Eun-hyun wasn't
        even considered feasible.
      </p>
      <p>'But now, at least it means a spar is possible!'</p>
      <p>Which means,</p>
      <p>'I can somewhat stand up to him.'</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok's face is filled with competitive spirit as he thinks of
        Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>'The time is soon!'</p>
      <p>Kuong!</p>
      <p>Once again, Seo Eun-hyun and Oh Hyun-seok face each other.</p>
      <p>'His surroundings are...'</p>
      <p>Completely red.</p>
      <p>And without any gaps</p>
      <p>
        Reading Seo Eun-hyun's intent, Oh Hyun-seok finally understood why Azure
        Tiger Saint declared his certain defeat.
      </p>
      <p>Hundreds, thousands, millions perhaps?</p>
      <p>Countless red threads envelop Oh Hyun-seok.</p>
      <p>'And each one is a lethal blow.'</p>
      <p>Getting hit by even one means death.</p>
      <p>
        When his realm was too low, he couldn't comprehend how formidable Seo
        Eun-hyun was.
      </p>
      <p>But as his realm improved, he finally understood.</p>
      <p>'So, aspiring to defeat him from the start was arrogance.'</p>
      <p>Let it go.</p>
      <p>Abandon the thought of defeating him and humbly accept defeat.</p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>'I'll learn what I can from him!'</p>
      <p>Taatt!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok and Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>The two clash once again.</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok rolls his feet, seizing the surrounding Five Elements.</p>
      <p>
        The terrain around him changes constantly, providing a battlefield
        suited for Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok charges at Seo Eun-hyun like a storm, throwing his punches.
      </p>
      <p>Jjeong, Jjeong, Jjeoreong!</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok's strike tears through the ground, altering the terrain.
      </p>
      <p>‘He's avoiding everything.'</p>
      <p>However, Oh Hyun-seok never manages to hit Seo Eun-hyun even once.</p>
      <p>The blue lines are ineffective against Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>
        Every blue line is nullified and blocked by Seo Eun-hyun's red lines
      </p>
      <p>‘But…’</p>
      <p>Wo-woong, wo-woong, Bo-oong!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok further accelerates his speed.</p>
      <p>
        Along with the speed of his body, the Flying Escape Technique overlaps
        with his movements, making Oh Hyun-seok seem like a beam of light as he
        chases after Seo Eun-hyun, throwing punches.
      </p>
      <p>
        His speed reaches that of a Nascent Soul cultivator's Flying Escape
        Technique!
      </p>
      <p>'How about that! Do you think you can avoid this too!?'</p>
      <p>
        No matter how much one blocks the opponent's attacks with intent, it's
        useless if the body cannot keep up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, as Oh Hyun-seok increases his speed, Seo Eun-hyun, who had
        been avoiding the attacks with ease, begins to narrowly dodge Oh
        Hyun-seok's strikes.
      </p>
      <p>‘It's working.’</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok smiles broadly.</p>
      <p>
        Previously, a match with Seo Eun-hyun would have been decided in at most
        10 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>But what about now!</p>
      <p>
        Although he hasn't properly landed an attack, Seo Eun-hyun also couldn't
        fully exploit his openings, creating some semblance of a match!
      </p>
      <p>They are actually having a fight!</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun, who has been dodging Oh Hyun-seok's attacks, smiles
        faintly.
      </p>
      <p>"You’ve grown remarkably. Now then…"</p>
      <p>At the same time, a bright light emanates from Seo Eun-hyun's body.</p>
      <p>"I’ll get a bit more serious."</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Over Seo Eun-hyun's movements, the gleam of the Flying Escape Technique
        is layered.
      </p>
      <p>Along with that, Seo Eun-hyun's speed surges tremendously.</p>
      <p>‘What!’</p>
      <p>In the next moment.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun's hand pinpoints various vital points throughout Oh
        Hyun-seok's body.
      </p>
      <p>Kurung!</p>
      <p>
        Sharp energy burrows into Oh Hyun-seok's vital points, disrupting the
        flow of Qi within his body.
      </p>
      <p>"Kughk!"</p>
      <p>And, it’s over.</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok lets out a hollow laugh.</p>
      <p>
        ‘So up until now, he's been avoiding all my attacks just with his
        physical speed, direction of intent, and a bit of footwork, without even
        using the Flying Escape Technique.’
      </p>
      <p>He is overwhelmingly powerful.</p>
      <p>Yet, Oh Hyun-seok grins.</p>
      <p>'I made him use the Flying Escape Technique with my power.'</p>
      <p>He laughs, not disheartened, and thinks.</p>
      <p>'Next time, what else can I make you draw out?'</p>
      <p>"Now, it’s my victory…"</p>
      <p>Crack, crackle!</p>
      <p>
        In a state where his vital points were targeted, Oh Hyun-seok forcibly
        moves his body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The energy Seo Eun-hyun infused stimulated his vital points, hindering
        Oh Hyun-seok's movements. Oh Hyun-seok’s forceful move caused blood to
        spurt, though the wounds healed almost instantly.
      </p>
      <p>"If you can take even this, I'll admit your win today!"</p>
      <p>Chalak!</p>
      <p>Three pairs of wings sprout from Oh Hyun-seok's back.</p>
      <p>And before Seo Eun-hyun can react.</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok throws a punch.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>It’s qualitatively different from before.</p>
      <p>A tremendous storm of fist force!</p>
      <p>Both the force and speed are on a different level.</p>
      <p>‘Perhaps, can you avoid this too!?’</p>
      <p>It's unavoidable!</p>
      <p>This time, for sure!</p>
      <p>In the next moment.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun, covered in the Flying Escape Technique, explodes the
        energy in his body and simultaneously wraps himself in an energy as
        sharp as a sword.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun turns into light for an instant, flying through the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok watches, laughing.</p>
      <p>‘This time, you had no leisure?’</p>
      <p>He somehow felt it.</p>
      <p>
        That strike just now, Seo Eun-hyun had to exert considerable effort to
        avoid it.
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps, he avoided it with all his might.</p>
      <p>But the Azure Wing Heavenly Shatter can strike twice.</p>
      <p>Kwagwagwang!</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok's next punch connects towards Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>For the first time.</p>
      <p>
        For the very first time, Seo Eun-hyun extends his hand in the air to
        meet it.
      </p>
      <p>Shukang!</p>
      <p>And Oh Hyun-seok's punch is cut.</p>
      <p>That is the end.</p>
      <p>Something sharp, without a sound, sliced apart his strike.</p>
      <p>He couldn’t even perceive it.</p>
      <p>Just like that, it was over.</p>
      <p>"…Ha, hahaha!"</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok laughs joyfully.</p>
      <p>'It's enjoyable.'</p>
      <p>Enjoyable!</p>
      <p>
        Initially, he aimed to become strong to have an equal conversation with
        the broken Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>But, at some point.</p>
      <p>
        He enjoyed the process itself of becoming stronger, moving his body, and
        the very act of sparring with Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>And with all the things he enjoyed doing up until now.</p>
      <p>
        Finally, for the first time, Seo Eun-hyun could not avoid his attack and
        was forced to counter.
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, I lost."</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok smiles brightly.</p>
      <p>"But next time, I hope you and I can properly exchange blows."</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun looks at him for a moment and then smiles bitterly.</p>
      <p>"...I look forward to it."</p>
      <p>Azure Tiger Saint approaches them laughing.</p>
      <p>
        "Now, since both of you have grown to a usable level, I think it's time
        to assign a new mission."
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok and Seo Eun-hyun look at Azure Tiger Saint.</p>
      <p>
        "There are two missions for you. You can take whichever you prefer.
        Recently, the Mad Lord Jo Yeon has been slaughtering various races and
        turning them into living puppets. Because of that, the Heaven Tribe’s
        Grand Alliance has intensified the bounty on the Mad Lord."
      </p>
      <p>At Azure Tiger Saint’s words, Seo Eun-hyun frowns and asks.</p>
      <p>
        "...Grand Cultivators at the Integration stage should be able to capture
        the Mad Lord. Why aren't they taking action?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well... I don't know the reason either. However, the Grand Cultivators
        are currently all gathered in the vicinity of our Human Territory,
        searching for something. Hence, there seems to be a shortage of people
        to confront the Mad Lord."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "Therefore, the Heaven Tribe’s Grand Alliance has issued a mission. It
        involves surveilling the Mad Lord near his Wonderfully Mysterious
        Fortress, gathering information about him."
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok asks Azure Tiger Saint.</p>
      <p>"You said there are two missions, what's the other one?"</p>
      <p>
        "The other one is related to the True Devil Realm. There's a devil that
        crossed over from the True Devil Realm to the Bright Cold Realm, and the
        mission is to capture it."
      </p>
      <p>"Should we each take on these missions?"</p>
      <p>To Oh Hyun-seok's question, Azure Tiger Saint shakes his head.</p>
      <p>
        "No, both missions are extremely dangerous, so both of you will have to
        go together. In addition to you two, three disciples of the First-Cloud
        and ten disciples of the Second-Cloud will join. I asked because I
        wanted to know where you two would like to go together."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>As Oh Hyun-seok ponders, Azure Tiger Saint furrows his brows.</p>
      <p>
        "Honestly speaking, as your master, I hope you don't take on the mission
        related to the Mad Lord. It doesn't make sense to gather information by
        scouting that madman. Besides, it's too dangerous. Of course, I respect
        your choice, but personally, I hope you take on the mission related to
        the True Devil Realm."
      </p>
      <p>At his words, Oh Hyun-seok looks at Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>"Master said so, so I plan to follow his advice. What about you?"</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun meets Oh Hyun-seok's eyes.</p>
      <p>‘...!’</p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok flinches.</p>
      <p>'Emotion'.</p>
      <p>
        For the first time in a long while, 'emotion' is visible in Seo
        Eun-hyun's eyes.
      </p>
      <p>"I... would like to go to the Mad Lord."</p>
      <p>At that, Azure Tiger Saint's eyebrows twitch.</p>
      <p>"Why?"</p>
      <p>"Because my colleague is under the Mad Lord."</p>
      <p>"Ah, that was indeed the case."</p>
      <p>At Seo Eun-hyun's words, Oh Hyun-seok shivers.</p>
      <p>'That's right, Team Leader Kim was there.'</p>
      <p>He heard stories about the Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>The most dangerous lunatic in the world.</p>
      <p>
        After hearing the stories about Kim Yeon being captured by that madman,
        what has that guy done until now?
      </p>
      <p>
        'That’s right. So he was worried about Team Leader Kim being under such
        a person.’
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time in a long while, Oh Hyun-seok sees a human side in
        Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, he looks at Azure Tiger Saint with firm resolve.</p>
      <p>
        "As Master knows, Seo Eun-hyun and I are from the same hometown. She who
        is captured by the Mad Lord is also my colleague, so I will go as well!"
      </p>
      <p>"...Haaaah."</p>
      <p>Azure Tiger Saint lets out a soft sigh.</p>
      <p>"Alright, I respect your choice."</p>
      <p>
        Thus, with twisted fate, Oh Hyun-seok, who was originally supposed to
        undertake the mission to capture the devil from the True Devil Realm,
        ended up joining the expedition to spy on the Mad Lord’s Wonderfully
        Mysterious Fortress.

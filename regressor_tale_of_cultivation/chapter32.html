      <p>Chapter 32: Life (7)</p>
      <p>
        On the day of the decisive battle, during the waiting time outside the
        Imperial City, I began to read a book carefully.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, but why did you ask for that?"</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon asked, looking puzzled as he saw me reading.</p>
      <p>
        The book I was reading had no title. It was a manuscript written by Kim
        Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first regression, Kim Young-hoon, who became the best martial
        artist in the world and reached the Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin realm, created the Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts in order to allow martial artists to escape from
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Record was further improved upon and evolved into the Record of
        Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts by the second regression
        Kim Young-hoon. It was meant to give martial artists a lifeline against
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Record became Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts
        Scripture after the third regression Kim Young-hoon added 6 volumes
        regarding his insights fighting and escaping from cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fourth regression Kim Young-hoon integrated and simplified the six
        volumes into the Secrets of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial
        Arts which paved the way for a new realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nameless book I was reading right now was the evolved version of the
        Secrets of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts, further
        advanced by this regression’s Kim Young-hoon through endless battles
        against cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Scripture and Secrets discussed transition from the Five Energies
        to the next realm, the nameless book detailed the ‘extreme resentment’
        (極恨) seen in the new realm
      </p>
      <p>Of course.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t understand even when I’m reading it.’</p>
      <p>
        The complexity of this martial art system, evolved again from the
        Secrets of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts, was beyond my
        comprehension.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon, noticing my struggle, clicked his tongue and said.</p>
      <p>
        “You don’t need to force yourself to understand. This is not a completed
        martial art.”
      </p>
      <p>“Not completed?”</p>
      <p>
        "Mhmm, martial arts should be passed down. Even though I've become an
        unparalleled great master, I will die someday. But my martial arts live
        on as my legacy, proving my existence. Thus, the completion of a martial
        art is in its transmission," he explained, glancing at the book in my
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Its minimum entry requirement is Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin. Just as a first-rate cannot understand the world of the pinnacle
        and an early peak cannot understand the world of Three Flowers Gather at
        the Summit. Anyone below Five Energies cannot comprehend this martial
        art system. It's incomplete because it can't be properly transmitted."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, so it's complete but incomplete due to its extremely high entry
        barrier?" I summarized.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Right. This martial art needs to be adapted so that it can be
        understood even by those at the level of Three Flowers..."
      </p>
      <p>As I listened, I smiled slyly.</p>
      <p>
        "Is there a need for that? In my opinion, just give it to a warrior who
        can reach the Five Energies or someone with Kim Hyung’s level of talent.
        There’s no need to simplify it for them."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, Eun-hyun. Talent like mine in martial arts comes once in a
        thousand years. I assure you, my talent is almost implausibly high..."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, that is true."</p>
      <p>
        This is how I felt seeing him evolve his martial arts to a new realm
        every regression and faster each time.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘But don't worry, Kim Hyung. I'll pass down this martial art to you in
        the next regression"
      </p>
      <p>
        His martial arts will always be passed down without the need for
        simplification.
      </p>
      <p>Because I will always ensure its transmission</p>
      <p>"...Anyway, how about naming this martial art?" I suggested.</p>
      <p>"Hmm, a name," he pondered and then smiled.</p>
      <p>
        "Gazing at cultivators (眺修), eventually surpassing the limits of
        martial arts (越武), and condensing these Secrets (訣). The creator of
        Secrets of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts (眺修越武訣)
        probably spent his life just observing cultivators, and that's how it
        ended. He could never surpass them.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I have surpassed the Secrets of Gazing Cultivation and
        Exceeding Martial Arts and discovered the possibility of surpassing
        cultivators. With my current level, I won't be inferior in a battle
        against late-stage Qi Building cultivators! If I ambush a Core Formation
        cultivator, I can inflict significant injuries..."
      </p>
      <p>
        He wrote characters in the air. The energy flowing from his fingertips
        beautifully illuminated the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Surpassing cultivators (越修), surpassing the martial arts framework
        (越武) and recording (錄) the achievements!"
      </p>
      <p>Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts(越修越武錄).</p>
      <p>That was the name of the newly evolved martial arts record.</p>
      <p>'Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts...'</p>
      <p>
        Reminiscent of the combination of Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts and Record of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding
        Martial Arts. Seeing the name, I recalled the Young-hoons of the 1st and
        2nd regressions.
      </p>
      <p>Their unfulfilled wishes were slowly being realized.</p>
      <p>
        With a slow smile, I put the fully read Record of Surpassing Cultivation
        and Martial Arts in my chest pocket. Having memorized the Record, I
        could pass it on again, even if I died today.
      </p>
      <p>"Let’s go, Kim Hyung."</p>
      <p>"Yes, it’s about time."</p>
      <p>Today, the Imperial Family of Yanguo will change.</p>
      <p>Whoooosh!</p>
      <p>
        In the skies above Seokyung City, blue and red lights flashed. It
        signaled the end of the agreement between the Jin and Makli Clans.
      </p>
      <p>'Now, we just need to enter.'</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Blue lights burst from the eastern, western, southern, and northern
        gates of Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, red lights also burst from the southeast, southwest,
        northwest, and northeast directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lights from the Makli and Jin Clan cultivators intermingled above the
        city, casting their magical influence over Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble...</p>
      <p>
        A barrier conjured by the two cultivator clans enveloped the city. As it
        formed, ordinary pedestrians began to stagger and collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone below the mid first-rate lost consciousness and fell on the
        streets, while late first-rate warriors barely resisted the barrier's
        influence with their weapons.
      </p>
      <p>But even they would succumb if they lost focus for even a moment.</p>
      <p>
        Now, only the masters who had entered the world of intent remained
        conscious inside Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even among them, those who had recently entered the Pinnacle Realm and
        couldn't constantly operate in the world of intent would soon faint.
      </p>
      <p>'Terrifying.'</p>
      <p>
        The terror of cultivators wasn't just about individual strength. It was
        about their formations and mystical abilities!
      </p>
      <p>
        A formation powerful enough to seize a city in an instant, laid by just
        eight Qi Building cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even that was because the Jin and Makli Clan cultivators were mutually
        restraining each other. In reality, just four of them could have set up
        this formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        'No wonder they treat ordinary people like insects. They wouldn't even
        acknowledge or listen to us.'
      </p>
      <p>But still...</p>
      <p>There is basic human decency.</p>
      <p>
        Being born human, asserting oneself as a human, there are obligations
        that come with it.
      </p>
      <p>I clenched my teeth, recalling the atrocities of the Makli Clan.</p>
      <p>'As long as I can, I will stop you.'</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        As soon as the barrier formed, I used my movement technique towards the
        Imperial City. Simultaneously, my disciples and Kim Young-hoon’s
        followers, who were lying in wait around Seokyung City, picked up their
        weapons and moved out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, over a hundred cultivators from the Jin Clan in red robes
        flew above us on their flying devices.
      </p>
      <p>Whirr!</p>
      <p>
        Inside the barrier of Seokyung City, a deep blue barrier spread around
        the Imperial Palace.
      </p>
      <p>The defensive barrier looked thick at first glance.</p>
      <p>
        Inside, cultivators from the Makli Clan in blue robes strengthened the
        formation and prepared their spells.
      </p>
      <p>Just then, Kim Young-hoon took flight.</p>
      <p>Boom, boom!</p>
      <p>He stepped on the air, rising, and stretched out his hand.</p>
      <p>"Everyone, prepare to enter!"</p>
      <p>His voice seemed to cover the entire Seokyung City.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon, floating in the air, gently extended his palm.</p>
      <p>A round sphere of Gang Qi emerged from his hand.</p>
      <p>'That is...'</p>
      <p>I observed the new realm he had achieved.</p>
      <p>The bright sphere split into three.</p>
      <p>Three Gang Qi spheres!</p>
      <p>But they split again around Kim Young-hoon, forming nine spheres.</p>
      <p>Nine Gang Spheres lined up behind him.</p>
      <p>Then, they arranged around him.</p>
      <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>
      <p>
        The nine spheres struck the barrier over the Imperial Palace, creating
        nine holes.
      </p>
      <p>"Enter!!"</p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivators threw their talismans which stuck to the holes
        in the barrier, preventing its repair.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivators from the Makli Clan seemed surprised by the size of the
        openings created by Kim Young-hoon’s strike.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I used Mountain Lord’s Soaring Flight, scaling the outer wall of the
        Imperial Palace and entering through the hole Kim Young-hoon had made.
      </p>
      <p>"A mortal has entered! Block..."</p>
      <p>Severing Vein Saber Method, Mountain Wind!</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>
        My piercing strike, filled with Sword Gang, penetrated the shouting
        Makli cultivator’s mouth, creating a hole in his medulla.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Ninth Move.</p>
      <p>Landscape Painting.</p>
      <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>My sword filled with Sword Gang wildly slashed in every direction.</p>
      <p>
        Though it seemed haphazard, each strike followed the optimal trajectory!
      </p>
      <p>
        Each perfect trajectory smashed the defensive spells of the lower-grade
        cultivators of the Makli Clan, tearing their bodies apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the hole at the outer wall of the Imperial Palace where I was
        located, a mist of blood formed around me in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ugh, a peak martial artist! Everyone, use the Jiangshi as shields and
        prepare spells from the rear!"
      </p>
      <p>Screech, screech!</p>
      <p>
        Thus, the battle unfolded with an intensity that shook the very
        foundations of Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>Second Move, Entering Mountain (入山).</p>
      <p>Fourteenth Move, Qi Mountain, Heart Heaven (氣山心天).</p>
      <p>Connecting Technique (連繫技).</p>
      <p>Qi Mountain’s Entry Path (氣山入路)!</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Switching to a lower stance, I opened up the meridians, expanding the
        force of my energy and slicing widely through my opponents.
      </p>
      <p>Swish Boom!</p>
      <p>
        In a single move, the attacking Jiangshi had their legs severed and fell
        to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>'Deep Mountain (深山). Ascending Vein (登脈).'</p>
      <p>
        Charging in with Mountain Lord’s Soaring Flight, I entered the embrace
        of a cultivator chanting from behind, and cut him upwards.
      </p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>
        My Sword Gang pierced through the cultivator's defensive spell,
        splitting his body diagonally.
      </p>
      <p>''Ah, ah... How can this mortal...!''</p>
      <p>The other astounded cultivators used some kind of spell.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>Fwoom!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        A water orb and wind blades, along with a yin ring, were cast towards me
        from different directions.
      </p>
      <p>'Secluded Valley (幽谷).'</p>
      <p>
        Along with Secluded Valley, I used Record of Gazing Cultivation and
        Exceeding Martial Arts to penetrate the intents behind the spells,
        twisting the direction of their power.
      </p>
      <p>Rotating in place, I neutralized all three spell attacks.</p>
      <p>The spells didn't even brush my clothes.</p>
      <p>‘'What, what...'’</p>
      <p>'Bouldered Cliff (塊巖).'</p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>
        Spinning in place, I shot circular Sword Gang at the confused
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before they could use another spell, they were shredded by my Sword Gang
        breaking through their defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flesh and blood sprayed in all directions, filling the air with the
        scent of blood.
      </p>
      <p>My commotion drew the attention of all the cultivators.</p>
      <p>"Stop that martial artist first!"</p>
      <p>"Deploy all the Jiangshi!"</p>
      <p>"Drive him out!"</p>
      <p>Hundreds of Jiangshi, oozing with poison, rushed towards me.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, others began to enter through the hole behind me.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>314 of my disciples, each armed, lined up behind me.</p>
      <p>"Clean up. I'll go inside first."</p>
      <p>After giving a brief order, I headed below the outer wall.</p>
      <p>
        Led by Man-ho, my disciples nodded briefly before clashing with the
        horde of Jiangshi.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>I jumped down from the outer wall.</p>
      <p>A cool wind rose from below.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A spear was hurled at me with a breaking sound.</p>
      <p>
        'It's awkward to dodge, and if I parry in mid-air, I'm at a
        disadvantage.'
      </p>
      <p>Quick judgment.</p>
      <p>In an instant, I swung my sword against the outer wall.</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>
        After emitting sword silk and embedding my sword into the wall, I used
        it as a support to leap up again.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I powered my legs and deflected the spear with a spin.</p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        My counterattack, optimally executed, sent the spear flying back, and I
        quickly pulled my sword from the wall, using Heavy Fall Technique to
        quickly land on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Martial artists, including the one who threw the spear at me, started to
        gather around.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, long time no see, everyone."</p>
      <p>"Shut up, villain! We've never seen someone like you!"</p>
      <p>Faces I had seen during my time in the Shadow Guards.</p>
      <p>
        The chief and deputy chief of the Imperial Outer Defense Force, the
        admiral and deputies of the Golden Army, and the generals of the United
        Guard.
      </p>
      <p>Faces I had occasionally seen.</p>
      <p>
        Although their relationship with the Shadow Gaurds was indifferent, as
        we were supposed to hide in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>'It's a bit tricky to kill them.'</p>
      <p>They were just following orders. What fault did they have?</p>
      <p>Each was simply acting out of the loyalty they were taught.</p>
      <p>"Don't worry. I won't kill you."</p>
      <p>It's harder not to kill cultivators due to their defensive spells.</p>
      <p>But against these people, it's much easier.</p>
      <p>Fling!</p>
      <p>Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique, Straight Snake!</p>
      <p>
        The quickly thrown weapon lodged in the shoulder of the Outer Defense
        Force chief.
      </p>
      <p>Coated with poison, he would soon be paralyzed.</p>
      <p>
        I took an antidote from my pocket and scattered paralysis powder in all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique, Illusionary Snake Mist!</p>
      <p>
        Several weapons accurately grazed the bodies of the deputy chief and
        United Guard generals beyond the paralysis powder.
      </p>
      <p>
        I coated my sword tip with poison, and using Deep Mountain, I lunged at
        the generals of the United Guard and the admiral of the Golden Army,
        lightly cutting their skin.
      </p>
      <p>What remained were the deputies of the Golden Army.</p>
      <p>Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique, Double Killing Snake</p>
      <p>Swish, swish!</p>
      <p>
        Two weapons flew in different trajectories towards them, and in that
        moment, I re-grasped my sword stance.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Vein Saber Method, Mountain Wind!</p>
      <p>Fling!</p>
      <p>
        A rapid thrust pierced the deputies trying to block the hidden weapons,
        and the poison on my sword tip entered their bodies, causing them to
        collapse soon after.
      </p>
      <p>
        'They're not fatally poisoned, so they can be detoxified later in the
        Imperial Medical Hall. The Imperial physician is a bit better than me,
        so he should be able to decipher the mixture.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I left the twitching peak masters lying in foam behind me and surveyed
        the layout of the surrounding buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
        'The emergency shelter for the Emperor in case of emergency is the
        Hidden Dragon Hall. Officially, that is.'
      </p>
      <p>
        But as the former deputy-leader of the Shadow Guards who closely guarded
        the Emperor, I knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        'The actual shelter is the Glowing Scenery Pavilion, located beyond the
        northwest corner of the Imperial City...'
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time in the Shadow Guards, I didn't understand why I had to
        guard a cultivator emperor.
      </p>
      <p>Nor did I understand why such a shelter existed.</p>
      <p>
        After all, neither the commoners' rebellion nor the army could match up
        to them, so why the need for such a shelter?
      </p>
      <p>But now I understand.</p>
      <p>
        'It's a place prepared in case other cultivator clans conspire to usurp
        the Imperial Throne.'
      </p>
      <p>Screech!</p>
      <p>
        More Jiangshi than I saw from the outer wall screamed and rushed towards
        me.
      </p>
      <p>Easily hundreds in number.</p>
      <p>
        Apparently, they were just released en masse to entangle any intruders.
      </p>
      <p>Snap-</p>
      <p>How many people were sacrificed to create these Jiangshi?</p>
      <p>I gritted my teeth and gripped my sword.</p>
      <p>'It should be about time now...'</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>
        At that thought, my disciples jumped down from the outer wall below.
      </p>
      <p>"Any casualties?"</p>
      <p>"None at all."</p>
      <p>"Thank you. Have you cleaned up everything?"</p>
      <p>
        "We've only dealt with the Jiangshi; the remaining Makli cultivators are
        engaged in combat with the martial arts experts brought by Sir Kim and
        the Jin Clan cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Good, from now on, everyone will follow me. We will go to where the
        Emperor is."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes!"</p>
      <p>At my words, my disciples shouted excitedly.</p>
      <p>
        "First, we break through the Jiangshi horde. Since they're just to
        entangle us, there's no need to kill them all. Everyone, form a wedge!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Leading the way, my disciples lined up behind me in a triangular
        formation.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's break through!"</p>
      <p>"Yes!!!!!"</p>
      <p>
        Peak masters of this level, with their internal energy, is equivalent to
        a cavalry in terms of power and speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although fewer in number, their strength and speed are in no way
        inferior.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ran ahead, allowing my disciples to follow, infusing my sword with
        Sword Gang.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Fourth Move.</p>
      <p>“Flowing Ridge(流陵)!"</p>
      <p>
        As I called out the sword moves, just like we practiced during training,
        my disciples assumed their appropriate stances and connected their
        positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        While a standard formation typically unifies weapons, to peak masters
        who can read intent, such variability is not a flaw.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, they break through by compensating for each other’s weaknesses!
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Initially a straightforward stabbing technique, it transformed with the
        force of breakthrough, erupting like a clash of chariots, shattering the
        Jiangshi before us.
      </p>
      <p>Qi Mountain, Heart Heaven!</p>
      <p>I opened my meridians wide and pulled forth even more Sword Gang.</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Leading from the front, I mowed down the Jiangshi, making my way
        through.
      </p>
      <p>
        The disciples on my flanks also infused energy into their weapons,
        shaking off and breaking through the Jiangshi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hundreds of peak masters carved a path through the black ocean of
        Jiangshi.
      </p>
      <p>'This is it!'</p>
      <p>
        As we tore through, the dividing wall of the Imperial Palace came into
        view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Mountain and Valley Transformation!
      </p>
      <p>
        Unleashing Sword Gang, I demolished the wall and altered the nearby
        landscape. I then positioned myself at the forefront and made my way
        through the collapsed wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        My disciples on the flanks quickly closed in from a wedge formation to a
        parallel 'I' formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following through the gap I created, my disciples streamed in like a
        tail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering through the wall, the Imperial Garden, Guhwawon, came into
        sight.
      </p>
      <p>'Formations lie ahead.'</p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, they weren’t too strong, and I knew all the life gates of
        the formations.
        <em
          >(Life gates in cultivation stories are basically the exit points in
          formations and arrays)</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>"Everyone, follow exactly behind me!"</p>
      <p>
        Recalling the life gates spread around Guhwawon, I stepped through them,
        unraveling the formations as I went.
      </p>
      <p>
        My disciples followed precisely, and the Jiangshi, lacking this
        knowledge, aimlessly entered Guhwawon but couldn’t penetrate the
        interior, just circling around.
      </p>
      <p>At the edge of Guhwawon, another wall appeared.</p>
      <p>
        Having already shaken off the Jiangshi, instead of hastily breaking the
        wall, I used Mountain Lord’s Soaring Flight to leap over it and landed
        on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>A quiet, small pavilion floated on a little lake, devoid of people.</p>
      <p>My disciples also streamed in behind me.</p>
      <p>"...Master, there’s no one here..."</p>
      <p>
        Without a word, I raised my Sword Gang and launched it towards the
        pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, my Sword Gang collided with an invisible barrier around
        the pavilion and dissipated.
      </p>
      <p>"This is the place! Kae-hwa, shoot the flare!"</p>
      <p>
        Before I finished speaking, a crackling sound came from behind and a
        flare shot up into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh - Bang!</p>
      <p>A five-colored cloud exploded in the sky.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, about five Jin Clan cultivators in red robes flew
        towards us on their flying devices.
      </p>
      <p>"The Emperor is here!"</p>
      <p>"Well done! We'll dismantle the formation!"</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivators, still on their flying devices, took positions
        around the pavilion and cast their spells.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        A bright light burst, shattering the invisible wall, revealing the
        Emperor and the Palace Guards, previously hidden in the pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dozens of cultivators in blue robes from the Makli Clan were waiting in
        the pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>The face of Makli Jung twisted like a vengeful ghost.</p>
      <p>
        "Damn it! How did you find this place? Only the Palace Guards and the
        Shadow Guards know about the Glowing Scenery Pavilion!"
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        As Makli Jung shouted, one of the Jin Clan cultivators who had
        dismantled the formation launched another flare.
      </p>
      <p>This time, a white smoke cloud.</p>
      <p>A signal that the Emperor has been confirmed to be found.</p>
      <p>At the same time.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Dozens of Jin Clan cultivators who were pushing back the Makli Clan
        cultivators on the outer wall began flying towards us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivators arriving at the lake quickly took up positions.
      </p>
      <p>As light burst forth, they formed a formation.</p>
      <p>"Heat!"</p>
      <p>Roar!</p>
      <p>A fireball the size of ten meters appeared in the sky.</p>
      <p>"Go!"</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the fireball created by the Jin Clan’s formation plunged
        towards the pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Besides the illusion formation hiding its appearance, several other
        barrier formations, seemingly layered, enveloped the pavilion in a blue
        sphere.
      </p>
      <p>Hiss-</p>
      <p>
        However, the fireball evaporated all the water around the pavilion,
        wrapping the area in steam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the steam, wind and yin spells shot towards the Jin Clan
        cultivators in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>The Makli Clan cultivators inside the barrier started to move out.</p>
      <p>A Jin Clan cultivator cast a spell and shouted at me.</p>
      <p>
        "Hey, mortal! We'll handle the cultivators; you break through the Palace
        Guards! The barrier is weakened enough by the previous attack; you
        should be able to penetrate it with your Sword Gang!"
      </p>
      <p>"Understood!"</p>
      <p>
        I responded to the Jin Clan cultivator and dived into the now-dry lake
        towards the pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>As I neared the pavilion,</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>A halberd thrust out from the shadow beneath the pavilion.</p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>I deflected the halberd and smiled at my opponent.</p>
      <p>
        "Leader of the Shadow Guard, Tiger Slaughtering Halberd, Kwak Il-guk.
        Long time no see."
      </p>
      <p>
        Translator notes: Regarding the part about 'Record of Surpassing
        Cultivation and Marital Arts' being a combination of the previous
        records is because Exceeding, Transcending, and Surpassing are all the
        same word in the raws, as I mentioned before in a previous translator
        note. So the direct translation of the new martial art would be 'Record
        of Surpassing Cultivation and Surpassing Martial Arts' or 'Record of
        Transcending Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts', a combination of
        the words 'Transcending Cultivation' and 'Exceeding Martial Arts.' Of
        course, I translated it as Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts to
        make it easier to differentiate and it's shorter to type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Translated phonetically, Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Marital
        Arts is 'Wol-su-wol-mu-rok.' The previous records are
        'Wol-su-gung-mu-rok' (Transcending) and 'Jo-su-wol-mu-rok' (Gazing).
        Hence, you can see why Seo Eun-hyun said that the new record is a
        combination of the previous records' names.
      </p>
      <p>On that note, I <strong>rant</strong>:</p>
      <p>
        This bastard Kim Young-hoon can’t name for his life. Of all 5 (and even
        more books later on), they’re all a pain in the ass to type and I can
        barely remember their names in the Korean raws. They're all 'wol' this
        and 'wol' that. I have to use the fricken wiki to make sure I get them
        right…

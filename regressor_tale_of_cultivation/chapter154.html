      <p>Chapter 154: Azure Heaven Creation Sect (5)</p>
      <p>I organized my thoughts as I looked at the two techniques.</p>
      <p>‘They can complement each other.’</p>
      <p>Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll.</p>
      <p>Its content is roughly as follows:</p>
      <p>After obtaining a dharma treasure or magic artifact.</p>
      <p>
        One closely links their consciousness with that dharma treasure,
        stimulating the dharma treasure's spirituality slowly through this
        connection, eventually forming the dharma treasure’s Artifact Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Artifact Spirit can be shaped from something that made a deep
        impression on the user. Depending on how well the user understands the
        subject, the spirit can mimic the power of that subject to some extent
        using the power of the dharma treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the form of the artifact spirit created in this way is not
        clearly visible to others except the user, appearing only as a vague
        mist.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no particular limit to the number of spirits one can form. By
        slowly accumulating artifact spirits and strengthening the dharma
        treasure while simultaneously gathering the energy of the spirits formed
        from the dharma treasure, one can elevate their cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who master this technique can summon numerous spirits around them
        whenever they use their dharma treasure, making it appear as if they are
        commanding a legion of devils. Hence the name Devil Legion Terracotta
        Scroll, implying that the practitioner's Dharma Treasure effectively
        contains thousands of these strange, devil-like entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Indeed, it’s originally a method from Black Ghost Valley, and since the
        cultivators of Black Ghost Valley primarily practice ghost path
        methods…’
      </p>
      <p>
        Their dharma treasures and the spirits they created through their
        connected consciousness would all spread ghostly and devilish energy.
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't for no reason that it was named "Devil Legion."</p>
      <p>
        ‘If it's not a devilish cultivator but someone who learned righteous
        path methods using Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll to form spirits, it
        might as well be called Spirit Legion Terracotta Scroll.’
      </p>
      <p>Of course, that isn't the important part.</p>
      <p>
        Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll is a method that starts from the Qi
        Building stage and can eventually stimulate the soul with numerous
        spirits to reach the Nascent Soul stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, what I’m paying attention to is a section that describes the
        method of reaching the Nascent Soul stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘After forming several artifact spirits, gather them into one powerful
        artifact spirit and stimulate the soul with that spirit.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, it’s possible to merge hundreds of artifact spirits into one.
      </p>
      <p>That’s the important point.</p>
      <p>I read the technique of the Three Spirits Technique.</p>
      <p>
        It’s a technique that creates three avatars to aim for revival in the
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading the methods of both Three Spirits Technique and Devil Legion
        Terracotta Scroll, I hypothesize that it might be possible to combine
        the 'avatars' of Three Spirits Technique with the 'artifact spirits' of
        Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This means, the weakness of Three Spirits Technique, which can only
        create up to three avatars, is practically non-existent.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if creating more than three avatars weakens their power, I can just
        merge the artifact spirits using the essence of Devil Legion Terracotta
        Scroll, simply recombining them when needed.
      </p>
      <p>In other words, both survival and combat power can be guaranteed.</p>
      <p>Above all, what I’m looking forward to is something else.</p>
      <p>
        ‘If the Three Spirits Technique, which stores cultivation for revival
        with the help of avatars, and Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll, which
        creates artifact spirits for the dharma treasure, are combined, maybe…’
      </p>
      <p>I think of the Colorless Glass Sword within me.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Maybe, it's possible to store cultivation in the Colorless Glass Sword
        itself with these two techniques, so it can be carried into the next
        life?’
      </p>
      <p>That alone will be an immense gain.</p>
      <p>After some thought, I decided to first learn both methods.</p>
      <p>‘But first, let’s enter Qi Building.’</p>
      <p>
        My current state is being at the absolute peak of Qi Refining before
        encountering Heavenly Lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I managed to break through the Heavenly Rejection last time with the
        mass-produced version General Seo. Still, I’m a bit worried about
        drawing attention, let alone dispelling the Heavenly Tribulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though thinking some more, there’s a high chance of Chief Oh Hyun-seok
        encountering Heavenly Tribulation when breaking through Qi Building. It
        should be fine if I reach Qi Building alongside him.
      </p>
      <p>‘Alright. Then for now, let’s go with that.’</p>
      <p>Creak...</p>
      <p>
        I organized my plans for the future and began practicing the Water Path
        Enduring Origin method again in the depths of my concentration.
      </p>
      <p>Trudge, trudge...</p>
      <p>Late at night.</p>
      <p>At a lodging in Azure Heaven Creation Sect.</p>
      <p>A figure with smoke rising thickly from their body returned.</p>
      <p>Ssshhhh...</p>
      <p>
        I shook my head as I looked at the heat emanating from my entire body.
      </p>
      <p>Tuduk, duk.</p>
      <p>
        A piece of lava that had been stuck in my head splattered in all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>'The Fire Path Body Training Hall is always hot.'</p>
      <p>Whether in the morning or at night, there’s no difference.</p>
      <p>
        The Azure Heaven Creation Sect venerates body cultivation, and thus, the
        Five Elements Hall is always bustling with people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, if one learns methods other than the Five Elements Enduring
        Origin Scripture, there’s no need to go there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is, to learn other methods besides the Five Elements
        Enduring Origin Scripture, one has to arm-wrestle the 'librarian' in the
        Scripture Pavilion and win.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the time one becomes strong enough to win an arm-wrestling match
        against the 'librarian,' the individual is likely already so worn down
        by the thrilling training at the Five Elements Hall that the other
        methods available in the Scripture Pavilion lose their significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, while the Five Elements Hall is always crowded, Three-Cloud and
        Two-Cloud disciples have been frequenting the Hall even more recently,
        inspired by my constant visits regardless of night or day. As a result,
        there have been times when the Five Elements Hall is so packed that
        there’s literally no room left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, too, I was planning not to return to my lodging for about a week,
        but had to because the Five Elements Hall was so full of seniors that
        there was no room.
      </p>
      <p>Sigh...</p>
      <p>As I open the door and entered my lodging, I sense someone inside.</p>
      <p>"Have you been well, Yuan Yu?"</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Yu (援痏), the Blood Body I named, dressed in a red robe and with
        an expressionless face, approaches me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meaning, the legacy (痏) left by Yuan Li (援), Yuan Yu stays in my
        lodging, cleaning and recovering its cultivation using the spiritual
        energy of the Bright Cold Realm.
      </p>
      <p>It almost fully recovered to the peak of the Core Formation stage.</p>
      <p>I have Yuan Yu fetch a glass box.</p>
      <p><em>Clank.</em></p>
      <p>Yuan Yu brought the glass box and placed it in front of me.</p>
      <p>
        Inside the glass box, a centipede, now grown to the size of a pinky
        finger, is feasting on an Insect Feeding Pill provided as food.
      </p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle...</p>
      <p>
        Seemingly without any awareness, it doesn't seem to notice me watching.
      </p>
      <p>"Eat well and grow well."</p>
      <p>
        Even if it doesn't attain spiritual awareness and become a demon beast
        in this life, I have no intention of forgetting the grace I received in
        my past life.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will live a bit longer than its natural lifespan due to the immense
        spiritual energy of the Bright Cold Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take out another Insect Feeding Pill made for insects and place it in
        front of it, then have Yuan Yu put the glass box back in its place.
      </p>
      <p>'Recently, there was another Heavenly Rejection.'</p>
      <p>
        It was in the territory of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect, where the sun
        always shone brightly since I completed the Seven Star Qi Refining
        stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, recently, a corner of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect's land was
        briefly covered in dark clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it was quickly pierced through by something that rose from
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Seeing the Heavenly Rejection means Chief Oh Hyun-seok must have also
        completed the Seven Stars Ritual.'
      </p>
      <p>That means soon,</p>
      <p>'It will be time to enter the Qi Building stage.'</p>
      <p>
        Instead of explaining to Azure Tiger Saint that I’ll face Heavenly
        Tribulations every time I advance my cultivation, having him experience
        it from Chief Oh will save me a lot of hassle.
      </p>
      <p>Kuak</p>
      <p>I clench and unclench my fist.</p>
      <p>'Can I withstand the Heavenly Tribulation?'</p>
      <p>
        Although it’d be simple using Yuan Yu, who is practically mine, or
        General Seo in the Nascent Soul stage, I’m curious if I can overcome the
        Heavenly Tribulation with the physique I had trained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly, after all the hardship and training in the Five Elements Hall
        to learn the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture, it’d be
        disappointing if I can't withstand the Heavenly Tribulation.
      </p>
      <p>'In terms of pure power, I’m at the mid Qi Building stage.'</p>
      <p>
        It will be difficult to fend off the Heavenly Tribulation. Even a Core
        Formation stage cultivator, not a mid Qi Building stage cultivator, will
        find it challenging.
      </p>
      <p>'I need to find a way.'</p>
      <p>It isn't just about testing my physique with stubbornness.</p>
      <p>'I can't just let the Formless Sword go to waste.'</p>
      <p>
        I hadn’t used it at all until now due to fear of being suspected as a
        Heart Tribe spy.
      </p>
      <p>
        But not being able to use the Formless Sword, a part of my life and
        essentially my identity, has been a significant psychological pressure
        for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if I explain to Azure Tiger Saint that the Formless Sword is a
        martial art, he wouldn't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who reached Three Flowers Gather at the Summit, Azure Tiger
        Saint knows all too well the limits of regular martial artists. It’d be
        fortunate if I don’t get beaten up for spouting nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though Azure Tiger Saint doesn't know the Heart Tribe Methods,
        pretending it’s just a unique method and practicing the Formless Sword
        is foolish.
      </p>
      <p>'There’s an Administrator on Azure Cold Island.'</p>
      <p>
        Each Sky Island has an Administrator, dispatched by the Human Race Grand
        Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Administrator’s use a special technique to monitor the entire Sky
        Island to ensure nothing suspicious goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, given the scope, the precision is said to be terrible. Still,
        they can roughly know what's happening throughout Azure Cold Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Even if the Administrator's spell has low precision, if I were to be
        caught using the Formless Sword by them…'
      </p>
      <p>It would be the end.</p>
      <p>
        The Administrator's cultivation is said to be at the very peak of the
        Heavenly Being stage, at least according to what I've heard.
      </p>
      <p>It's even rumored that they stepped into the Four-Axis stage.</p>
      <p>
        '...Until the true General Seo is completed, with the materials being
        gathered slowly, I can't act rashly.'
      </p>
      <p>I turn my gaze towards the basement.</p>
      <p>
        There lies my past life's body, which I am slowly attempting to recreate
        with expensive materials.
      </p>
      <p>The true General Seo is being crafted.</p>
      <p>
        However, the materials used by the Mad Lord to modify me into General
        Seo are outrageously expensive, so properly making General Seo isn't
        easy.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, only laying the framework is possible.</p>
      <p>
        For this reason, I decided to face the upcoming Heavenly Tribulation
        with my bare body, pondering a way to use the Formless Sword without
        drawing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If I can generate the Formless Sword within my body and immediately
        reach Treading Heavens Beyond the Path, maybe I can avoid detection.'
      </p>
      <p>
        'Or if I can unfold the Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts with the Formless Sword within my body, maybe I
        won't be detected.'
      </p>
      <p>
        'What about applying the Hidden Consciousness Technique or Wonderfully
        Mysterious Innate Heart Canon?'
      </p>
      <p>
        'If I mix the Formless Sword into the body refining methods, maybe it
        won't be recognized.'
      </p>
      <p>I reflect on the Formless Sword itself, constantly pondering.</p>
      <p><em>Squeeze...</em></p>
      <p>Just as many have said, Oh Hyun-seok has a mythical physique.</p>
      <p>It won't take long for him to reach Qi Building</p>
      <p>
        'Within that time, let's find a way to naturally use the Formless
        Sword.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I raise the Formless Sword within my heart essence and close my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>Time passed again, and another three months went by.</p>
      <p>It’s exactly one year since my return.</p>
      <p>"Hahaha, look at you, Deputy Seo. It's been quite a while."</p>
      <p>"...Chief…Oh?"</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, I found myself able to see Chief Oh Hyun-seok, now as tall as
        Azure Tiger Saint.
      </p>
      <p>Ssshhhh...</p>
      <p>
        He’s shirtless, similar to Azure Tiger Saint, and his muscles are as
        defined as if sculpted.
      </p>
      <p>But what’s more surprising is,</p>
      <p>In just one year, he too reached the extreme of Qi Refining.</p>
      <p>
        "Under Master's special training over the past year, I've learned about
        this world and trained my body while practicing cultivation methods. How
        about you? Have you become a bit more accustomed to this world?"
      </p>
      <p>He laughs heartily and pats my shoulder warmly.</p>
      <p>"Ah, yes. I've come to understand this world to some extent..."</p>
      <p>
        "Good, good. Honestly, I was a bit surprised at first, but knowing that
        the other colleagues are also diligently practicing at their individual
        sects is reassuring."
      </p>
      <p>"...Indeed."</p>
      <p>
        "If there’s something worrying, it’s that? I’m a bit worried about
        Director Kim left alone in the lower realm. But well..”
      </p>
      <p>"He'll probably be doing well."</p>
      <p>
        By now, he might have broken through Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin or even Ultimate Pinnacle based on the martial art principles I
        provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I hope so. Anyway, Master said that once we reach the Qi Building
        stage, both you and I will proceed with our training together."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        The Five Elements Hall is intimidating enough, but what would direct
        training from Azure Tiger Saint be like?
      </p>
      <p>I’m nervous, yet somehow looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>
        "By the way, it seems you've also reached the extreme of the Qi Refining
        stage as expected. Master set a day to reach the Qi Building stage,
        saying he wants to see. How about it? Since you're also Master’s direct
        disciple, shall we ascend to Qi Building together?"
      </p>
      <p>At his question, I grin and reply.</p>
      <p>"Of course."</p>
      <p>
        It’s time to test the enlightenment I had gained from my contemplation
        on the Formless Sword, despite the short amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>A few days later.</p>
      <p>
        I am summoned before Azure Tiger Saint, alongside Chief Oh Hyun-seok.
      </p>
      <p>It’s time to reach the Qi Building stage.</p>
      <p>
        "Both of you have excellently mastered your methods. Especially Seo
        Eun-hyun. Oh Hyun-seok has grown quickly under my intensive guidance,
        but you found the Five Elements Hall on your own and trained day and
        night without my attention, for which I, as a Master, feel sorry."
      </p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint proudly pats my shoulder with his hand as large as a
        pot lid.
      </p>
      <p>
        It felt like my shoulder would dislocate for a moment. Thankfully, I
        could withstand it by tensing my body.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I will personally observe both of you reaching the Qi Building stage.
        After breaking through, I will focus on both of you with intensive
        guidance. Once again, I must say, Seo Eun-hyun, I am sorry for not being
        able to pay attention to you until now."
      </p>
      <p>Oh Hyun-seok shudders at the mention of 'intensive guidance.'</p>
      <p>
        Seeing his reaction, I anticipate that Azure Tiger Saint's intensive
        guidance will not be easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now, come to this spiritual vein in front of you. Let's see you reach
        the Qi Building stage."
      </p>
      <p>Azure Tiger Saint laughs heartily and stands up.</p>
      <p>Out of caution, I ask the Azure Tiger Saint.</p>
      <p>"Master, do we need to consume Qi Building Pills?"</p>
      <p>"Hm? Why do you ask that?"</p>
      <p>
        "Well, I trust the cultivation I've been practicing more than Qi
        Building Pills, so if you were planning to give us any..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You've entered the Azure Heaven Creation Sect and still don't know?"
      </p>
      <p>At my words, Azure Tiger Saint looks puzzled and continues.</p>
      <p>
        "Our sect does not deal with such frivolous actions as breaking through
        cultivation by consuming pills. If one hasn't reached the Qi Building
        stage, it means their cultivation is lacking. Just throw those who have
        reached the extreme of Qi Refining into the deepest parts of the Five
        Elements hall for about a year, and they'll reach the Qi Building stage
        on their own out of sheer desire to live."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "I too have shaped this body without resorting to things like Qi
        Building Pills, and I take infinite pride in that. To hear you share the
        same sentiment, I am very pleased as your master."
      </p>
      <p>Bang, bang!</p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint heartily laughs and pats my back. I barely managed to
        suppress the urge to cough up blood, forcing a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now, my disciples. If you encounter any obstacles, I am here to help
        you. Commence your rise to Qi Building!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Following Azure Tiger Saint's command, we each take our places on the
        spiritual vein.
      </p>
      <p>"Hooo..."</p>
      <p>
        I exhale the clouds of spiritual energy from the method I practiced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clouds swirl around me, and far off in the distance, abnormal
        phenomenons begin to appear in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        I half-open my eyes, beginning to utilize the Formless Sword I had honed
        up until now.
      </p>
      <p>'In front of Azure Tiger Saint, a Four-Axis stage cultivator.'</p>
      <p>
        If I can remain undetected even in front of him, I won't need to worry
        about the Administrator, who can only roughly monitor Azure Cold Island.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>A sharp energy begins to gather throughout my body.</p>

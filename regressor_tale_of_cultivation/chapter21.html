      <p>Chapter 21: Peak Master (4)</p>
      <p>Cut!</p>
      <p>Fight!</p>
      <p>
        Squeezing out every bit of my willpower, I lunged at the cultivator's
        leg with my sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivator, who had been relaxed until now, contorted his face in
        shock as my Sword Gang penetrated his defensive spells.
      </p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>Shuck! Crack, crack!</p>
      <p>
        The Sword Gang, created by draining all my internal energy, extinguished
        like a candle in the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        My energy was insufficient. Despite pouring decades worth of internal
        energy into it, lacking enlightenment, I couldn't maintain the Sword
        Gang for more than a second.
      </p>
      <p>
        My sword barely nicked the cultivator's leg, cutting through his clothes
        and inflicting a minor wound.
      </p>
      <p>Ugh...</p>
      <p>
        As the Sword Gang extinguished, my sword could no longer penetrate his
        defensive spell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the backlash of using all my internal energy hit me,
        causing blood to spill from my mouth, draining my strength, and leaving
        me collapsed on the spot.
      </p>
      <p>"Cough! Cough!"</p>
      <p>Blood splattered with each cough.</p>
      <p>It felt like my insides were being churned.</p>
      <p>"You, you filthy mortal...!"</p>
      <p>
        Enraged by my attack, the cultivator scattered talismans that
        transformed into glowing daggers, stabbing my arms and legs.
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh...argh!"</p>
      <p>
        I endured the pain, trying to grasp my sword, but the cultivator stomped
        on my hand.
      </p>
      <p>"You filthy, mortal scum!"</p>
      <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>
      <p>
        He stomped on my hand mercilessly, spreading a more powerful defensive
        barrier around us.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How dare you, how dare you attempt to cut me! You, of all people! I am
        a noble descendant of the cultivator clan, not someone lowly mortals
        like you can touch! How dare you, how dare you!!"
      </p>

      <p>
        After crushing my hand for a while, he reached into his pouch and
        scattered another handful of talismans.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I planned to toy with you before killing the Makli Clan's branch family
        but I've changed my mind. I'll tear all of you mortals to shreds like
        insects!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Flames engulfed the talismans, transforming them into fireballs, and
        started shooting towards the guards.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Watch carefully, insect. You'll see all your comrades torn to death
        before I chew you up. You insects, no matter how much you struggle, are
        meaningless before cultivators!"
      </p>
      <p>"Cough, cough..."</p>
      <p>More blood gushed out of me.</p>
      <p>
        My internal organs were shaken from expending all my internal energy at
        once, blurring my vision.
      </p>
      <p>But my hearing was still clear enough to catch a few words.</p>
      <p>Insect.</p>
      <p>Meaningless.</p>
      <p>'Yes, I am nothing but an insect.'</p>
      <p>Compared to those truly talented, to the cultivators.</p>
      <p>"But, but..."</p>
      <p>I struggled.</p>
      <p>With my crushed hand, I grabbed the cultivator's ankle.</p>
      <p>
        "I may be an insect, but even an insect's struggle is not
        meaningless!!!"
      </p>
      <p>"You filthy thing, let go of me!"</p>
      <p>Fire erupted in the cultivator's hand again.</p>
      <p>It would have incinerated me instantly, but...</p>
      <p>'It's time.'</p>
      <p>The fireball extinguished as time passed.</p>
      <p>"…What? Why isn't it…"</p>
      <p>Blood flowed from the cultivator's eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>
      <p>'The poison works!'</p>
      <p>
        I smirked at the bewildered cultivator, grabbed his ankle tighter, and
        pulled hard.
      </p>
      <p>He collapsed.</p>
      <p>"Ah, antidote..."</p>
      <p>He reached for his pouch.</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>I knocked the pouch away.</p>
      <p>"Gurgle..."</p>
      <p>Blood foam rose from his mouth as he tried to chant a spell.</p>
      <p>But I wasn't going to let him.</p>
      <p>
        I climbed on top of him, shoving my crushed hand into his mouth,
        preventing him from chanting.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You see, your death will be just as meaningless as those you looked
        down upon."
      </p>
      <p>After struggling for a while, the cultivator died.</p>
      <p>
        His dead body wasn't much different from the insects he had looked down
        upon all his life.
      </p>
      <p>In death, everyone is equal.</p>
      <p>The defensive barrier collapsed.</p>
      <p>
        The leader and other guards, having watched from outside, quickly came
        to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The black barrier set by the cultivator disappeared, and I lost
        consciousness, seeing this as my last sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I opened my eyes, I was in my room. The leader was beside me,
        smoking a pipe.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, you're awake."</p>
      <p>"…Yes. But is it okay to smoke tobacco next to a patient?"</p>
      <p>"What are you talking about? Tobacco is a healthy herb."</p>
      <p>
        'I can't believe this,' I thought, remembering this was a medieval-like
        era.
      </p>
      <p>"How's the situation with that cultivator?"</p>
      <p>
        "You killed him yourself, Deputy-leader Seo Eun-hyun. He's dead. I've
        reported to His Majesty that you bravely sacrificed yourself to kill the
        cultivator, so don't worry."
      </p>
      <p>"I've completed my mission today as well."</p>
      <p>
        I nodded, checking my body's condition. My right hand was still numb,
        and there was some damage to my vital energy channels, but it was
        stable. The wounds from the cultivator's daggers had all healed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Emperor ordered the Imperial physician to treat you. Be thankful
        for His Majesty's grace."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Imperial physician healed me cleanly. I wish I could learn his
        medical skills."
      </p>
      <p>I admired the physician's skill and circulated my internal energy.</p>
      <p>Lying in bed, my body felt a bit refreshed.</p>
      <p>"About your right hand…"</p>
      <p>The leader looked at my hand and hesitated.</p>
      <p>
        "It might still be usable, but not like before, is what the physician
        said. It's not fully healed, so don't strain it."
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it was the hand that the cultivator had crushed and chewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Honestly, I didn't expect it to be fine. Just being able to use it is a
        blessing."
      </p>
      <p>
        "…Good. You're positive, which is great. Also, His Majesty was impressed
        by your bravery and decided to award you. Since a Shadow Guard can't be
        officially rewarded, he asked me to pass this on. I hereby present you
        with an award on behalf of the Emperor."
      </p>
      <p>I kneeled as I received a small silk box from the squad leader.</p>
      <p>
        "His Majesty decrees: 'Deputy-leader Seo Eun-hyun, for bravely
        protecting the sacred throne, we grant this reward to remind you of your
        heavy responsibility.''
      </p>
      <p>Inside the silk box was a small pill with a reddish hue.</p>
      <p>
        "It's said to be made from the same ingredients as the pills eaten by Qi
        Refining Cultivators during their transition to Qi Building. I don't
        understand it all, but…"
      </p>
      <p>I realized what the pill was.</p>
      <p>'Leftovers from a pill.'</p>
      <p>
        Working in a medical center, I knew that leftover materials from making
        elixirs were often used for detox or sold to fake spiritualists.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's said to extend life by about ten years when taken by mortals."
      </p>
      <p>"Ten years?"</p>
      <p>I was astonished.</p>
      <p>"Just leftovers can extend life by ten years?"</p>
      <p>The pill looked different now.</p>
      <p>"Be forever grateful for the Emperor's grace."</p>
      <p>After he left, I thought, 'The Imperial family sure knows welfare.'</p>
      <p>
        I planned to take the pill when my life was almost over, to test its
        full effect.
      </p>
      <p>"Always grateful for His Majesty's grace."</p>
      <p>Ten years later.</p>
      <p>Thirty years since my return.</p>
      <p>The pain in my hand had become familiar.</p>
      <p>
        My swordsmanship and hidden weapon skills improved, and I was close to
        uncovering the cultivators' secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Cultivators of the Jin Clan hide in powerful formations. They gather
        talented mortals and train them to peak masters for assassination.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I understood why I never heard of these peak masters in my previous
        lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If the Jin Clan rises to power again, maybe it'll be slightly better
        than these filthy Makli cultivators.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to focus more on my martial arts and Kim Young-hoon's
        movements.
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Click!</p>
      <p>A figure entered through the window.</p>
      <p>"Young-hoon Hyung?"</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hun had entered the palace at night.</p>
      <p>
        "I was just reading your letter. Knowing about the cultivators'
        domain..."
      </p>
      <p>
        He interrupted, "That letter was sent a month ago. But I've discovered
        something more critical in the past month. There are two cultivator
        clans in this country. The Makli and the Jin."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Makli Clan ousted the Jin Clan a century ago. Since then, the Jin
        Clan has been planning to assassinate the Emperor using peak masters
        trained from mortals."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, I know that."</p>
      <p>
        "But do you know why the Jin Clan could produce so many peak masters?
        They forced the spirits of the dead family members of the assassins into
        the assassins, sacrificing their vitality to enhance their talents."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Makli Clan is worse. For 20-30 years, they've been capturing the
        poor to make a forbidden elixir that extends cultivators' lives using
        their blood and vital energy!"
      </p>
      <p>Horrified, I shouted.</p>
      <p>"Makli Clan is eating people!"</p>
      <p>
        I instantly decided to join Kim Young-hoon in fighting these heinous
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        That night, I left the palace with Kim Young-hoon, ready to fight
        against the corrupt Makli Clan.

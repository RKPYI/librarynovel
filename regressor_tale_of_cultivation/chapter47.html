      <p>Chapter 47: Forbidden (3)</p>
      <p>I infused spiritual energy into a palm-sized flying paper boat.</p>
      <p>Buzzing!</p>
      <p>
        As the spiritual energy was injected, the paper boat swelled in size,
        took on color, and transformed into a wooden boat.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's go."</p>
      <p>
        I jumped onto the wooden boat, infused it with spiritual energy, formed
        hand seals, and at the same time, magical runes rose from the boat as it
        swiftly kicked through the air.
      </p>
      <p>Three days later.</p>
      <p>
        I arrived at the border of Byeokra and Yanguo using the flying artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Flying artifacts at the Qi Refining stage travel at the speed of a
        normal boat...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently, to reach the speed of an aircraft, one would need a flying
        artifact at the Qi Building stage or at least have the personal flying
        skills of Core Formation cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>I enjoyed the scenery and feeling the wind on the paper boat.</p>
      <p>I looked around.</p>
      <p>"There it is."</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        As soon as I spotted my target, a brilliant white Saber Gang surged
        towards me.
      </p>
      <p>I swung my hand, emitting my own Sword Gang.</p>
      <p>
        Our Blade Gangs weaved through the air like snakes, clashing several
        times, and after a while, the Saber Gang that was shot at me was
        neutralized.
      </p>
      <p>Jump!</p>
      <p>
        I leapt down from the air and used the Light Fall Technique to fall
        slowly.
      </p>
      <p>"It's been a while."</p>
      <p>"Yes, your sword control has improved since I last saw you."</p>
      <p>"I've never stopped practicing sword control."</p>
      <p>
        Dual Energy Sword Control isn't just about making a sword move through
        the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        It involves elevating the control over the sword to a realm beyond unity
        with the sword, mastering every aspect of the sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the sound and material of the sword, to the aura emitted by one's
        martial arts, Sword Energy, Sword Gang, mastering everything with
        consciousness!
      </p>
      <p>That's what Dual Energy Sword Control is.</p>
      <p>Therefore,</p>
      <p>
        From the moment one achieves Dual Energy Sword Control, a martial artist
        at the Five Energies Converging to the Origin can freely manipulate not
        only the sword but also the Sword Gang in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, manipulating a sword that's not in my hand fundamentally
        means projecting my consciousness from a distance into the sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference in the Five Energies Converging to the Origin realm is
        how naturally one can move a distant sword.
      </p>
      <p>"But you still have much to learn. Keep training."</p>
      <p>"Yes, I will."</p>
      <p>I nodded and withdrew the flying boat still hovering in the sky.</p>
      <p>
        "Kim Hyung, I heard you started cultivating recently, and it seems
        true."
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt the pressure of his spiritual power and the size of his
        consciousness and asked.
      </p>
      <p>He smiled awkwardly and said.</p>
      <p>
        "Well... since cultivation techniques are quite convenient in daily
        life... like flying artifacts. Of course, I'm only at Qi Refining 2nd
        Star. I have no intention of going beyond that, just using it to assist
        my martial arts...
      </p>
      <p>
        It's more useful for me to hone my martial arts than to rely on such
        miscellaneous techniques."
      </p>
      <p>"I see..."</p>
      <p>
        His martial arts talent was unparalleled, but it seems his aptitude for
        cultivation was still better than mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even without a good master like me and focusing more on martial arts, he
        still reached Qi Refining 2nd Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Recently started, so being at Qi Refining 2nd Star means his aptitude
        is a little better than mine.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon chatted casually about how he almost went mad learning
        the Seventy-Two Earthly Sha True Words, then asked me worriedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Are you sure you're okay with this? Agreeing to such an extreme
        request?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's fine. I'm happy to contribute to the Cheongmun Clan, and I agree
        with your view."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you. Those guys... the sooner one of them disappears from this
        world, the better."
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Makli Clan lost Yanguo’s imperial authority to the Jin
        Clan, the Makli Clan's main family wasn't significantly damaged, just
        lost their influence over Yanguo and the right to oppress its mortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan stopped interfering with the Makli Clan's affairs after
        obtaining the imperial authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Qi Refining cultivators from each clan dying in skirmishes wasn't
        much of a concern unless they were high-ranking, it was a principle to
        release Qi Building elders caught in battle after receiving a ransom.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Jin Clan obtained imperial authority, Kim Young-hoon had
        little he could do for justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he didn't give up and found loopholes in the agreements between
        the Jin and Makli clans, and other surrounding cultivator clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        "According to what I found, if cultivators from the Jin or Makli clan at
        the Qi Building stage clash and are captured within Yanguo, they are
        released after the clans pay a ransom. However, if a cultivator invades
        the territory of another country, even at the Qi Building stage, they
        can be killed by cultivators from that country's clan."
      </p>
      <p>He smiled bitterly.</p>
      <p>
        "In a few days, I'll drive a cultivator from the Makli Clan to the
        border of the Byeokra. Once I exhaust the Makli Clan cultivator's
        strength, you can step in and finish them off. That way, I can get rid
        of scum, and you can kill an invader from Yanguo's Makli Clan without
        any issues of righteousness!"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, that makes sense."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon excitedly explained his plan, and I listened calmly.</p>
      <p>After hearing all his plans, I made a request.</p>
      <p>
        "Kim Hyung, I gave you the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial
        Arts previously."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, the unparalleled martial arts you gave me steadily led me to the
        Ultimate Pinnacle. I've also added my annotations to the Record of
        Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Then, knowing your character, you would still have the manual with your
        annotations... Could you let me read it?"
      </p>
      <p>"Well, that's not impossible."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon seemed to have recently acquired a new method of storage,
        as he pulled a thick manuscript from a fist-sized pouch at his waist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts had clearly
        thickened since I had given it to him.
      </p>
      <p>"The title hasn't changed."</p>
      <p>
        Considering the added content, I would have thought he'd want to leave
        his mark by changing the title.
      </p>
      <p>But Kim Young-hoon smiled bitterly and said,</p>
      <p>
        "I couldn't change it... I've been following this martial arts manual,
        merely adding annotations here and there. I added some content, but it's
        mostly records of trial and error about advancing beyond the Ultimate
        Pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't surpassed this martial art. How could I dare change the title
        of such a martial art by only adding a few lines of trial and error?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Looking at the thickness, it seems more than a few lines of trial and
        error."
      </p>
      <p>
        The book was three or four times thicker than when I first gave it to
        him.
      </p>
      <p>It's more than just a few annotations or trial and error.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon had poured all his effort into trial and error, trying to
        find a way to surpass the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial
        Arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, even though it's thicker, the fact that I failed remains true."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But with this much, it seems different from the original Record of
        Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts... Why not change the title a
        bit for distinction?"
      </p>
      <p>"If you insist..."</p>
      <p>He said with a self-deprecating smile.</p>
      <p>
        "Then let's call it not the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial
        Arts, but the Record of Surpassing Path and Martial Arts (월도월무록)."
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's the original title or the new one, the meaning of
        transcending the path of cultivation remains unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        He only changed one character in the title, which hardly made any
        difference from the original.
      </p>
      <p>'It's a bit disappointing, but...'</p>
      <p>If he doesn't want to change it, what can I do?</p>
      <p>I read and memorized the entire manuscript.</p>
      <p>
        Maybe it's because I became a cultivator and learned things like the
        Seventy-Two Earthly Sha True Words, or perhaps cultivating enhances
        memory as it expands consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>As my consciousness expanded, my memory improved significantly.</p>
      <p>
        I used to have to read and reread thick manuscripts several times in my
        previous lives to engrave them in my mind, but now, just reading once
        was enough to imprint everything in my memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wait here for a few days. I'll drive the cultivator from the Makli Clan
        to the Byeokra border soon..."
      </p>
      <p>"I'll wait."</p>
      <p>I sat down and adjusted my physical condition.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon handed me the Record of Surpassing Path and Martial Arts
        to read more if I wished, then took out his flying artifact and flew off
        towards Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>"The weather is nice."</p>
      <p>
        According to the astronomical and Heavenly Mechanism knowledge I learned
        from my master, the sky would remain clear until the time Kim Young-hoon
        mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>"Then, let's take this time to slowly write and organize..."</p>
      <p>
        I climbed onto a reasonably wide rock, spread out a basic formation to
        prevent anyone from approaching, and took out a desk, paper, inkstone,
        and brush from my storage device.
      </p>
      <p>I began writing my will, a letter to leave for my master.</p>
      <p>
        Even though Kim Young-hoon will exhaust the Qi Building cultivator's
        strength, those at the Qi Building stage didn't reach their positions
        through luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each one was an extraordinary being, a formidable foe not to be
        underestimated.
      </p>
      <p>Even if they're weakened, my life would be in danger.</p>
      <p>But I didn't care.</p>
      <p>I came here to die.</p>
      <p>
        A disciple who struggled all his life and achieved nothing, just to be
        rejected by the heavens and die when his lifespan ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn't imagine how painful and helpless it would be for my master.
      </p>
      <p>
        How much had I despised and felt powerless about myself in my past life
        for not being able to guide my disciples properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, if a disciple foolishly fights an overpowering opponent and dies in
        battle,
      </p>
      <p>
        While the master might feel resentment and sorrow, he won't feel
        self-loathing.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, I won't die by the fate set by the heavens.</p>
      <p>After all, I'm going to die soon.</p>
      <p>
        I'll foolishly fight against an overwhelming opponent and die in that
        way.
      </p>
      <p>That's what I decided.</p>
      <p>Slowly, I continued writing my will.</p>
      <p>
        Although it's a will, I couldn't let my master find out that I was going
        to die.
      </p>
      <p>
        I intended to make it seem like I was just patrolling the Byeokra border
        and asking about my master's wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After writing and erasing my will several times, I finally composed one
        that was satisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>"When should I send this?"</p>
      <p>
        Using a transmission talisman, I could send small items with little mass
        and not require much spiritual energy to a designated person.
      </p>
      <p>
        The transmission talisman's speed was similar to a flying artifact. If I
        sent it now, it would reach my master in about three days.
      </p>
      <p>'...Sending it before the battle starts would be most appropriate.'</p>
      <p>
        If I send it now, my master, upon receiving the letter early, might
        calculate the Heavenly Mechanism and arrange a ritual for me to perform
        near the border.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I send it after the battle starts and my lifespan is about to end in
        a few days, then the letter will reach my master three days later,
        sparing him from witnessing his disciple's death.
      </p>
      <p>'Yes, let's do that.'</p>
      <p>
        I carefully folded the letter, attached the transmission talisman, and
        prepared it so that it could be sent to my master with just a burst of
        spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>Days passed.</p>
      <p>The day Kim Young-hoon promised arrived.</p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble...</p>
      <p>
        In the distance, dark clouds filled with Yin energy were approaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it was much smaller in scale than a typical Heavenly phenomenon
        and seemed artificial.
      </p>
      <p>'They're coming...!'</p>
      <p>
        A Qi Building cultivator from the Makli Clan, bringing clouds with him,
        was approaching.
      </p>
      <p>Flash, flash!</p>
      <p>
        Behind him, beams of light burst forth as someone chased after the Qi
        Building elder.
      </p>
      <p>It was Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>'It starts now.'</p>
      <p>The last chapter of this life.</p>
      <p>The time for one final thrilling moment.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I infused spiritual energy into the letter with the transmission
        talisman. It glowed blue and transformed into the shape of a blue hawk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blue hawk-shaped transmission talisman flew at incredible speed
        towards the direction of the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts and Hidden
        Consciousness Technique to erase my presence and consciousness, and even
        used the Earth Dwelling Method to hide underground.
      </p>
      <p>Shortly after.</p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble!</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>Dark clouds covered the sky, and rain began to fall.</p>
      <p>Hidden underground, I looked at the center of the dark clouds.</p>
      <p>The Qi Building elder there had a familiar face.</p>
      <p>'That person is...'</p>
      <p>When we established the Palace of Heavenly Demons.</p>
      <p>
        He was one of the fifty Qi Building elders who came to destroy the
        Palace!
      </p>
      <p>That Qi Building elder.</p>
      <p>
        Remembering the old days, I recalled establishing the Palace, evading
        the bounty placed by cultivators, and killing them one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, we defeated an early-stage Qi Building cultivator and
        rejoiced with Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, fifty Qi Building cultivators surrounded and crushed the
        Palace like exterminating pests.
      </p>
      <p>
        That Makli Clan elder lured Kim Young-hoon with flattery, recalling the
        despair, regret, and plight of the weak...
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, that fearsome Qi Building elder from that time was not present.
      </p>
      <p>"Curses, these damn Jin Clan bastards!"</p>
      <p>
        Distorted with anger, he desperately waved a flag-shaped artifact
        controlling the dark clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wearing tattered blue robes and bleeding from all over, he was nothing
        more than prey.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You, you bastards! Can't you stop? According to the treaty between the
        Jin and Makli clans, you can't kill me! I demand to be treated as a
        legitimate prisoner of war! Stop attacking immediately!"
      </p>
      <p>"Form the array!"</p>
      <p>"Yes, Elder!"</p>
      <p>
        Several Qi Refining cultivators from the Jin Clan waved their formation
        flags behind Kim Young-hoon, creating a barrier filled with fiery
        energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Makli Clan elder was trapped in the barrier, and Kim Young-hoon flew
        towards him with a sneer.
      </p>
      <p>
        "When you turned innocent villagers' towns into bloody pools, you felt
        nothing... Now that your life is in danger, you struggle? You scum...
        Die!"
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Several Saber Gangs flashed around Kim Young-hoon and flew towards the
        Makli Clan elder.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't be absurd! Just because I harvested a few pests for materials,
        you're trying to kill a Qi Building elder like me!? You're making a big
        mistake! If you kill me, do you think you'll be safe?"
      </p>
      <p>Roar!</p>
      <p>As the Makli Clan elder waved his flag, the dark clouds moved.</p>
      <p>
        The clouds coalesced into a Cloud Dragon in the sky, lunging at Kim
        Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>'He's stronger than Makli Wangshin!'</p>
      <p>
        I assessed the Qi Building cultivator's skill based on his cultivation
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, Saber Gangs and the Qi Building elder's spells clashed.
      </p>
      <p>And then...</p>
      <p>Slash!</p>
      <p>"Argh..!"</p>
      <p>
        A gust of Yin wind from the Makli Clan elder tore off Kim Young-hoon's
        arm and waist, while a Saber Gang from Kim Young-hoon broke through the
        elder's defensive spells and similarly tore a chunk from his waist.
      </p>
      <p>'That wound is... dangerous!'</p>
      <p>
        Qi Building cultivators, being more than human, could withstand such
        injuries, but Kim Young-hoon, at the early stage of Qi Refining 2nd
        Star, only has a mortal's physical body.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, hadn't Kim Young-hoon fainted from such injuries when he faced
        Makli Wangshin in the previous cycle?
      </p>
      <p>But then it happened.</p>
      <p>"Support the elder!"</p>
      <p>"Hurry!"</p>
      <p>
        The Qi Refining cultivators from the Jin Clan, who had set up the
        barrier, each took out a handful of talismans from their storage
        artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>Flash, flash!</p>
      <p>
        Dozens, maybe even hundreds of healing talismans flew to Kim
        Young-hoon's wounds, sticking to them profusely, and several Jin Clan
        cultivators performed healing spells from beyond the barrier, suturing
        his wounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Ah, I see. The Jin Clan brought along Qi Refining cultivators skilled
        in healing as backup.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's condition was fully restored, and he began to shoot
        Saber Gangs with a renewed face.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Y-you bastards! You just trample on the treaty between the Jin and
        Makli clans whenever you feel like it! You can't kill me! I demand to be
        treated as a proper prisoner of war! Stop this attack at once!"
      </p>
      <p>"Silence!"</p>
      <p>
        "We won't be punished according to the clan rules, and instead will be
        recognized for reducing the Makli Clan's forces and receive rewards."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Crazy fools... Already upset over the massacre in the Heaven-Treading
        Desert, and now you commit the insane act of killing a Qi Building
        elder! Do you think you will be safe..."
      </p>
      <p>While remaining hidden, I found an opening on the Makli Clan elder.</p>
      <p>'Now.'</p>
      <p>I concentrated my consciousness.</p>
      <p>Refined my energy.</p>
      <p>The opening was small, but it was there.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I needed to widen it!</p>
      <p>Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts, the essence.</p>
      <p>'Lurking in the Shadows, Endless Attack!'</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        My focused consciousness shot towards the Makli Clan elder like a ray of
        light.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, he clutched his head and screamed.</p>
      <p>"Arghhh!"</p>
      <p>"Hmm...!"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Kim Young-hoon also concentrated and used the same
        technique of Lurking in the Shadows, Endless Attack on the elder!
      </p>
      <p>
        With two masters unleashing the decisive move of Lurking in the Shadows,
        Endless Attack, it must feel as if his head is being chopped.
      </p>
      <p>'I won't miss this chance!'</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship</p>
      <p>Deep Mountain!</p>
      <p>
        Releasing all the Qi I had gathered at once, I burst through the ground
        and soared into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>In an instant, I dove into the embrace of the Makli Clan elder.</p>
      <p>'This ends now!'</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Brilliant Sword Gang formed on my drawn sword.</p>
      <p>My Sword Gang slashed at him from within his embrace.</p>
      <p>
        Normally, a Qi Building cultivator would subconsciously emit protective
        Gang Qi, but the Makli Clan elder, having exhausted his spiritual power
        fighting Kim Young-hoon, had weaker defenses than even a Qi Refining
        cultivator!
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        My Sword Gang pierced through his thin protective Gang Qi, severing his
        neck.
      </p>
      <p>'Cut!'</p>
      <p>In that fleeting moment.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>A blue light burst forth from within his embrace.</p>
      <p>'A life-saving artifact!'</p>

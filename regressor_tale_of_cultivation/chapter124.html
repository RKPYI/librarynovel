      <p>Chapter 124: What You Trampled On / The Path You Have Tread (12)</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the Mysterious Flame Jade liquor, my initial encounter with a
        dharma treasure felt intuitively simple, as if mastery came
        effortlessly.
      </p>
      <p>Woo-woong!</p>
      <p>The battle began.</p>
      <p>The Colorless Glass Swords began to move.</p>
      <p>Kwang, kwang, kwang!</p>
      <p>
        The Colorless Glass Swords plunge straight into the earth, furiously
        excavating the terrain around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it’s a fragile dharma treasure made of glass, its strength is
        extremely poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, once overlaid with the Formless Sword, it boasts the same
        strength and tenacity as the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>[Argh...!]</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li dodges the Colorless Glass Swords, glaring at me, and also
        glances at Manli Min-lap, who is gathering energy for the main cannon of
        the Nether Crossing Ship in the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also takes a long look at Byeok Cheon-gi, who is gathering energy in
        the talisman and preparing for an attack.
      </p>
      <p>"...?"</p>
      <p>
        I’m momentarily puzzled, but focus my mind and move the Colorless Glass
        Swords.
      </p>
      <p>Chalalalalak!</p>
      <p>Three thousand Colorless Glass Swords move at my will.</p>
      <p>A storm of glass began to rage.</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li counters with his seventeen bone daggers, the crystal skull
        staff, the blood-leaf fan, and the blood-red spear dharma treasure from
        within his body.
      </p>
      <p>
        A ghost king leaps out of the blood-red spear, grabs the spear, and
        swings it around.
      </p>
      <p>
        The seventeen dagger dharma treasures also seem to have their own will,
        dispersing attacks in his vicinity. Each time Yuan Li unleashes a blood
        wind with the leaf fan, the surroundings shake violently.
      </p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>Kwagwagwagwa!</p>
      <p>
        The storm of three thousand glass swords devours everything, approaching
        Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their seemingly erratic flight, not a single glass sword strikes
        another, their movement being orderly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dharma treasure of Colorless Glass Sword is three thousand swords as
        one set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unified as one, overlaying them with the Formless Sword endows them with
        the complete implementation of the Formless Sword's freedom of
        trajectory and orbits.
      </p>
      <p>And that’s not the end.</p>
      <p>"Colorless Glass Sword, first form."</p>
      <p>
        There are three forms to the Colorless Glass Sword, and their abilities
        change depending on the form.
      </p>
      <p>"Color."</p>
      <p>
        The first form, Color, of the Colorless Glass Swords is to interconnect
        the spiritual energy circuits engraved on each of the three thousand
        glass swords.
      </p>
      <p>Chalalalak!</p>
      <p>Three thousand glass swords disperse.</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy circuits engraved on the glass swords begin to
        interconnect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, each Colorless Glass Sword has a single spiritual energy
        circuit, but the design of these circuits are subtly different according
        to the rules set by Buk Hyang-hwa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, each glass sword emits different colors when interconnected
        due to these subtle differences.
      </p>
      <p>Paah!</p>
      <p>
        The Colorless Glass Swords, drifting in every direction, start to
        radiate a spectrum of colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole world seems to be covered in a kaleidoscope of brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not just a change in color, but the temperament of each glass sword
        itself changes
      </p>
      <p>All three thousand swords project distinct temperaments.</p>
      <p>
        And the range of changes that these temperaments undergo within the
        storm of three thousand glass swords is,
      </p>
      <p>Infinite!</p>
      <p>They echo the limitless freedom of the Formless Sword!</p>
      <p>
        One temperament, when in a different position, becomes a completely
        different tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single glass sword continuously changes its position according to my
        manipulation and strikes relentlessly.
      </p>
      <p>This continuously changing glass sword is three thousand in number.</p>
      <p>[Argh, this bastard...!]</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li unleashes a blood wind with his blood-colored leaf fan, blocking
        the glass swords.
      </p>
      <p>But I manipulate the glass swords even more precisely.</p>
      <p>Infinite change is in my hands.</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword only gains freedom of trajectory, not of temperament.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, by obtaining the Colorless Glass Swords, the Formless Sword
        reaches a more complete realm of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>Chalalalak!</p>
      <p>
        Sharp temperament, soft temperament, a moderate temperament between the
        two, hard temperament, flowing temperament...
      </p>
      <p>
        The energy of those innumerable temperaments all move according to my
        will, dying the surroundings in a brilliance of colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those changes devour Yuan li’s blood storm, gradually swallowing him up.
      </p>
      <p>[Hmph, don't make me laugh!]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li scoffs, infusing energy into his dagger dharma treasures.</p>
      <p>
        The seventeen bone daggers rotate crazily around him, scattering bright
        red streaks.
      </p>
      <p>The bright red streaks seem to completely engulf him.</p>
      <p>But I just smile.</p>
      <p>It’s laughable.</p>
      <p>Shoong!</p>
      <p>Among the numerous changes, my vision accurately finds a gap.</p>
      <p>
        No matter how tightly the streaks surround him, there is always enough
        room to penetrate.
      </p>
      <p>The Colorful Glass Swords rush towards him.</p>
      <p>Kuwa Kwang Kwang!</p>
      <p>The streaks repel the glass swords.</p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>[Argh…!]</p>
      <p>Paang!</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the barrier of steaks is broken, and Yuan Li is exposed from
        within.
      </p>
      <p>His body is already embedded with dozens of glass swords.</p>
      <p>
        The Color form of the Colorless Glass Sword initially gleams with
        numerous colors when activated, but thereafter, it can revert to
        colorless at the user's will. Yet, the qualities created when the swords
        bore color do not disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means it is possible to confuse the enemy's vision with transparent
        Colorless Glass Swords and then strike.
      </p>
      <p>
        I channel the Formless Sword housed in the Colorless Glass Sword into
        Yuan Li's body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Layered Mountains, Qi Mountain Heart
        Sky!
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword, flowing into his body, expands massively with
        thorns.
      </p>
      <p>[Aaargh…!]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li briefly screams, trying to regenerate his body.</p>
      <p>
        However, the curse spells I sent with the Colorless Glass Sword mingle
        inside him, preventing proper regeneration and causing decay.
      </p>
      <p>"Die."</p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>
        Three thousand Colorless Glass Swords again rush towards him, now
        defenseless.
      </p>
      <p>[Kughaaaah!]</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The two blood cloud ghost kings who had fled earlier from the heavenly
        lightning and the bizarre ghost beast combined from seven demon souls.
      </p>
      <p>
        The combined power of these three entities, now reduced in cultivation
        due to the Serving Command Palace’s restraint, but still at the Core
        Formation level, defends against the storm of glass.
      </p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>Yuan Li regenerates his body in the given time.</p>
      <p>[Good, quite impressive.]</p>
      <p>He sneers.</p>
      <p>
        [To push me this far, I give my respects. I too will properly fight
        now.]
      </p>
      <p>
        He then reaches into his storage artifact, pulls something out, and
        throws it into the air.
      </p>
      <p>Squirm.</p>
      <p>My brows twitch upon seeing it.</p>
      <p>Crack…</p>
      <p>I grind my teeth, veins bulging on my forehead.</p>
      <p>I recognize that familiar aura.</p>
      <p>It’s Kim Young-hoon's Inner Core.</p>
      <p>
        His remains, not found in Kim Young-hoon's body, were unsurprisingly
        taken by Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        [This Demon Core’s owner was truly impressive. I don’t understand why
        the Heavenly Being seniors didn’t take such a monster with such growth
        potential... In the midst of that battle he was growing in real-time,
        and at the brink of death… even my heart skipped a beat.]
      </p>
      <p>Whirr!</p>
      <p>
        Strange incantations, possibly engraved by Yuan Li, are etched onto Kim
        Young-hoon's Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>The incantations glow red, emitting a strange attraction.</p>
      <p>
        [To understand the source of his talent, I dissected his body… but
        couldn’t find anything. No unique spiritual roots, no unique physique…
        Eventually wondering if it was an issue of personality, I tried to
        extract and refine his soul, but couldn’t find the soul either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Out of frustration, I extracted and refined his Demon Core instead… and
        discovered something interesting.]
      </p>
      <p>Squirm, squirm….</p>
      <p>The bizarre ghost beast.</p>
      <p>The two blood cloud ghost kings.</p>
      <p>
        The three ghosts are drawn to the Inner Core’s attraction, beginning to
        merge around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Harmonizing Power! This Demon Core can mix and circulate completely
        different forces in its vicinity. It possesses overwhelming harmonizing
        power, able to assimilate any energy. So...]
      </p>
      <p>
        Around Kim Young-hoon's Inner Core, the bizarre ghost beast and the
        ghost kings merge, transforming into a three-headed Asura.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li forms a seal, and his spear, leaf fan, and crystal skull staff
        fly into the six arms of the Asura.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        The ghost kings and the bizarre ghost beast initially showed the
        cultivation that was dropped from early Nascent Soul to early Core
        Formation. But now, their cultivation increases from mid to late Core
        Formation as they merge.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Pop, pop, pop!</p>
      <p>Seventeen bone dagger dharma treasures..</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li embeds sixteen of these daggers into various parts of the Asura.
      </p>
      <p>As for the last remaining dagger,</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li cut off three of his fingers, feeding them one by one into the
        Asura's mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li's self-amputated fingers do not regenerate, and the Asura's
        cultivation surges even more after consuming them.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>Core Formation Grand Perfection!</p>
      <p>The Asura's power reaches just short of Nascent Soul.</p>
      <p>
        [With his Demon Core, I’ve created this excellent result. You, his
        friend, have learned a similar strange method despite appearing
        different. You must have a similar Demon Core, right? I’ll extract it
        and make good use of yours too…!]
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li manipulates the Asura from behind, shouting.</p>
      <p>[Bring it on!]</p>
      <p>"Colorless Glass Sword, Second Form. Natural."</p>
      <p>
        I release the second form of the Colorless Glass Sword while looking at
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Colorless Glass Sword, Second Form, Natural, has a simple effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Colorless Glass Swords become more strongly interconnected, creating
        a perfect link of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three thousand Glass Swords, in their connected state, begin to
        circulate energy among themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        This circulation seamlessly incorporates my Formless Sword, allowing it
        to flow in unison with them
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, they achieve a more profound interconnectedness, facilitating a
        unified energy circulation.
      </p>
      <p>That is the second form of the Colorless Glass Sword, Natural.</p>
      <p>
        The greatest advantage of "Natural" is, of course, the ability to
        instantly circulate the Formless Sword to the desired location in
        accordance with the circulating energy, concentrating or dispersing the
        power of the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>The Colorless Glass Swords line up in a row.</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword housed within the glass swords focus its energy at
        the tip of the lined-up swords due to the circulation of "Natural."
      </p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        Driven by sword control, the glass swords pierce directly into the
        Asura.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's uncertain whether the Asura feels pain or not, as it shows no
        expression while gripping and swinging its spear.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the glass swords quickly disperse and reposition themselves,
        and once again under my control, they begin flying around the Asura,
        inflicting wounds on its body.
      </p>
      <p>Numerous changes occur.</p>
      <p>
        The Asura swings the blood-colored leaf fan on one side, the
        blood-colored spear on another, and the crystal skull staff on yet
        another, scattering various spells.
      </p>
      <p>Explosions resonate, distorting the area in all directions.</p>
      <p>
        But I continue on, controlling the storm of glass to pressurize the
        Asura.
      </p>
      <p>"Colorless Glass Sword. First Form. Second Form. Combine."</p>
      <p>
        And thus, the true strength of the Colorless Glass Sword begins to
        emerge.
      </p>
      <p>First Form, Color.</p>
      <p>Second Form, Natural.</p>
      <p>When both forms are activated simultaneously,</p>
      <p>The terror of the Colorless Glass Sword is fully revealed.</p>
      <p>
        The interconnected Glass Swords activate their spiritual energy
        circuits, shining in various colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, in that state, the energy of the Glass Swords begin to circulate.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        The different temperaments within the Glass Swords begin to circulate,
        swapping places between each sword.
      </p>
      <p>A sword that once emitted black turns white.</p>
      <p>
        The Colorless Glass Swords, each originally having their unique hue,
        begin to continuously share and change colors without pause.
      </p>
      <p>
        A cascade of colors dance, forming a luminous tempest that envelopes the
        Asura.
      </p>
      <p>
        The infinite trajectory of the Formless Sword merges with the endless
        shifts of temperaments of the Colorless Glass Sword.
      </p>
      <p>Together, they display an array of transformations beyond words.</p>
      <p>The blood-colored Asura is but a small moth trapped in a storm.</p>
      <p>Flick, flick!</p>
      <p>Gradually, more wounds appear on the surface of the Asura.</p>
      <p>
        The storm of glass seems wildly chaotic, but each sword follows the
        group of swords.
      </p>
      <p>Sizzle!</p>
      <p>
        The wounds on the Asura's body multiplies, soon covering it entirely.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>Twenty-Second Move.</p>
      <p>Ultimate Technique.</p>
      <p>
        Three thousand Colorless Glass Swords begin to enact a sword technique
        while revolving around the Asura.
      </p>
      <p>"Severing Mountain!"</p>
      <p>
        The ultimate technique of Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, channeled
        through the three thousand Colorless Glass Swords, converges into a
        singular, devastating strike.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Colorless Glass Swords unleash Severing Mountain, the Formless
        Sword housed within them amplifies the transformative power in Severing
        Mountain, grinding the Asura from all angles.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>A burst of light erupts, and the Asura explodes completely.</p>
      <p>
        I rush forward, snatching Kim Young-hoon's Inner Core from the center of
        the Asura, then control the Colorless Glass Swords.
      </p>
      <p>"Disperse!"</p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>
        The Glass Swords scatter in all directions, clearing a path, and at the
        end of the path stands Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>"Fire!"</p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the Nether Crossing Ship's main cannon, which had been
        gathering energy, fires.
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li tries to dodge, but I form a seal.</p>
      <p>Kududuk!</p>
      <p>
        While distracted, I had stealthily placed a cluster of curses behind
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The curses, like tentacles, envelop his body, preventing him from
        escaping.
      </p>
      <p>It isn't just me.</p>
      <p>
        Countless Core Formation cultivators, now at Qi Building stage, under
        the command of Cheongmun Jung-jin, coordinate to bind Yuan Li with
        various spells.
      </p>
      <p>Dozens, hundreds of spells, not just curses, tightly bound him.</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin shouts.</p>
      <p>"Byeok Clan head, now! Use it now!"</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Cheon-gi also throws the talisman infused with spiritual power
        towards Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>The talisman emits light as it flies towards Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, reduced to a mere early Core Formation stage, is hit squarely
        by the main cannon of the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!!!</p>
      <p>Light erupts in all directions.</p>
      <p>We all stare at the center of the explosion.</p>
      <p>
        Manli Min-lap, too, focuses on the center without making any remarks
        like ‘We've killed him this time.’
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Shhhh...</p>
      <p>The light subsides.</p>
      <p>Silently, we look at the spot where Yuan Li had been.</p>
      <p>The dust settles.</p>
      <p>At the spot where the light and dust clears, Yuan Li still stands.</p>
      <p>
        But on the faces of all the cultivators present, there is a glimmer of
        hope.
      </p>
      <p>No more spiritual pressure can be felt from Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>Not a single trace of spiritual energy.</p>
      <p>"Finally…."</p>
      <p>It’s when Cheongmun Jung-jin sighs in relief.</p>
      <p>Creeaak</p>
      <p>The gates of the Serving Command Palace begin to open.</p>
      <p>
        "Eh? Who is it? Didn't I say not to open the gates of Serving Command
        Palace until the operation is completely finished?!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin frowns, looking towards the entrance of the Serving
        Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>The ones opening the gate are Five Eastern Lords.</p>
      <p>I notice something strange.</p>
      <p>The color of their intent is odd.</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>[Excellent.]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li raises both arms.</p>
      <p>
        [Excellent, excellent, so very excellent. You all fought so
        magnificently, I am moved by your resolve. I pay my respects to this
        First War. I, Bloodwood Practitioner Yuan Li, recognize your valor.]
      </p>
      <p>
        As the gates of Serving Command Palace open, the Core Formation
        cultivators inadvertently look up at the sky outside the gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dark clouds have disappeared, and the celestial energy is still
        ominous.
      </p>
      <p>"Close it! Close the gates of Serving Command Palace!"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin urgently shouts, but the five lords who opened the
        gates just cross their arms.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        The tribal chiefs of the Northern Grasslands gather, and suddenly, the
        Blue Sky Heavenly Net begins to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        The four tribal chiefs who have been the mainstay of the formation
        suddenly break off their spiritual connection and cross their arms.
      </p>
      <p>I quickly read their intent.</p>
      <p>
        Until now, I had no time to read detailed intent due to the battle with
        Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, the intent of those cultivators begin to change, different
        from the others.
      </p>
      <p>It’s a golden hue, the intent of joy.</p>
      <p>"What is this! Are you betraying us!?"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin, enraged, summons a blue glow from his body.</p>
      <p>
        "Cultivators of the Northern Grasslands and Eastern States, please
        suppress these traitors! The three Western Countries, along with the
        western cultivators will handle the old monster…."
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>Green ghost-like figures block our path.</p>
      <p>
        Black chains of light wrap around me, Cheongmun Jung-jin, and the
        cultivators from Shengzi, Yanguo, and Byeokra.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jinlu Yeon-cheon approaches the chained Cheongmun Jung-jin, caressing
        his neck with a seductive voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, Orabeoni. Everything went according to plan. Sir Bloodwood has
        won."
      </p>
      <p>
        Makli Hwang-cheon, manipulating the jiangshi, approaches the chained
        clan head of the Jin Clan, kicks him down, and tramples on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Byeok Cheon-gi stands beside Yuan Li with a triumphant expression.
      </p>
      <p>"B-Bye-Byeok Clan head...!!!?"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin’s eyes, seeing one of the three most important people
        in the war against Yuan Li, Byeok Cheon-gi, standing beside Yuan Li,
        bulge with rage.
      </p>
      <p>Byeok Cheon-gi chuckles and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "How is it, Lord Bloodwood? The effects of the Heaven-Sealing Talisman
        are quite useful, aren't they?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [Good. This is truly the defensive power of the Heavenly Being stage.
        Not a single strand of spiritual energy is leaking from the whole body,
        quite an amusing feeling.]
      </p>
      <p>Indeed.</p>
      <p>
        What Byeok Cheon-gi threw to Bloodwood Practitioner at the last moment
        was not a Heaven-Striking Talisman that delivers a blow of Heavenly
        Being level,, but a Heaven-Sealing Talisman that provides Heavenly Being
        level defense.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>Outside the Serving Command Palace.</p>
      <p>
        From Yuan Li's black castle, the same crimson river that had come
        earlier enters through the gates of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>
        As Yuan Li absorbs the crimson river, his spiritual power begins to rise
        again. Seemingly displeased, he moves his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        [To make me use so much of my precious Long Source True Power…. The Long
        Source True Power I've gathered for hundreds of years…. Well, it doesn't
        matter. There won't be many chances to extract so much life force from
        Core Formation cultivators like today.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, Sir Bloodwood. There's only about a moment left until Serving
        Command Palace’s restraint releases."
      </p>
      <p>
        Byeok Cheon-gi looks around us with a flattering expression and
        continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Please show us the defensive and offensive power of the Heavenly Being
        stage."
      </p>
      <p>[I will do so.]</p>
      <p>Crack, crack!</p>
      <p>
        I break the black chains with my Formless Sword and unleash my Formless
        Sword and Colorless Glass Sword at him.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>Ping, ping!</p>
      <p>
        The glass swords and Formless Sword are all repelled by the strange
        energy surrounding Yuan Li, which prevents even a single strand of
        spiritual energy from leaking.
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li laughs.</p>
      <p>
        [I'll remember you especially. Such an unyielding fellow. But it's
        useless. As long as the Heaven-Sealing Talisman is activated, I can use
        the defensive power of a Heavenly Being until my Nascent Soul power
        returns. And….]
      </p>
      <p>He speaks to Byeok Cheon-gi.</p>
      <p>
        [Hand over the Heaven-Striking Talisman. Today, right here, let's
        demonstrate the power of Heavenly Being.]
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, Lord Bloodwood."</p>
      <p>I clench my teeth.</p>
      <p>Crunch!</p>
      <p>So hard that I feel like my gums will bleed.</p>
      <p>
        <em
          >-Three cultivator clans in the west of the Treading-Heaven Desert
          have sworn allegiance to me. Four tribes of the Northern Grasslands
          have prostrated before me.The five lords of the Eastern States have
          declared they will follow me.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>In my past life, Yuan Li said so.</p>
      <p>
        I thought Yuan Li only subdued them by implanting the Five Elements
        Blood Curse Banner after the first battle.
      </p>
      <p>But it wasn't so.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li, even before the battle.</p>
      <p>
        Over 200 years ago, the three cultivator clans in the West of the
        Treading-Heaven Desert.
      </p>
      <p>The four tribes of the Northern Grasslands.</p>
      <p>The five lords of the Eastern States.</p>
      <p>He had them under his control all along.</p>
      <p>
        Jinlu Yeon-cheon strokes Cheongmun Jung-jin’s body, who is tightly bound
        by the secret dharma treasure of the Jinlu clan due to the sudden
        betrayal.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, Orabeoni. Finally, this day has come. The day I take you as mine.
        I've been waiting for so long. We can obtain the lineage of the great
        Cheongmun Sunwoo, Azure Tiger Saint’s lineage. Finally, the two clans
        can truly become one. Byeokra will be handed over to the Byeok Clan and
        the Cheungmun Clan will move to Shengzi. The remnants of the other six
        clans will be taken by Lord Bloodwood, so I'll give all their lands to
        you, Orabeoni.
      </p>
      <p>
        For how long the Jinlu Clan was forced to shamefully share with these
        scums in an alliance, you know, don't you? Orabeoni, now, Shengzi is
        ours. Together, we'll monopolize its resources and reach the Nascent
        Soul stage together."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin spits on Jinlu Yeon-cheon's face with a twisted
        expression akin to a malevolent ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You've crawled under the enemy who killed my family, Jinlu Yeon-cheon!"
      </p>
      <p>"Mhm, mhm…"</p>
      <p>
        Jinlu Yeon-cheon wipes the spit from her face, licks it, and embraces
        Cheongmun Jung-jin.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry. I'll make you think of nothing else but me. Just live in
        our clan's underground for a few months, and you'll think of no one but
        me."
      </p>
      <p>"This…"</p>
      <p>
        Jinlu Yeon-cheon embraces Cheongmun Jung-jin, while Makli Hwang-cheon is
        stepping on Jin Yeo-woon's head.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Finally... Finally, I have triumphed in the long competition against
        the Jin Clan in my generation."
      </p>
      <p>
        Makli Hwang-cheon tramples on Jin Yeo-woon's head with a joyous
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ancestors, this Makli Hwang-cheon has toppled the Jin Clan in my
        generation. I will recapture Yanguo and lead the golden age of the Makli
        Clan...!"
      </p>
      <p>"You, bastard...! Ke, keuk...!"</p>
      <p>
        Jin Yeo-woon grits his teeth and looks up at Makli Hwang-cheon, who
        mockingly shoves a shoe into his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>"You should get used to calling me master now."</p>
      <p>"Ugh, ugh...!"</p>
      <p>
        Additionally, Byeok Cheon-gi is flattering the Bloodwood Practitioner,
        promising to help him rule Byeokra.
      </p>
      <p>Traitors of the East.</p>
      <p>
        Traitors of the North are also seen stomping on their other competitors
        restrained by the Jinlu Clan's chains.
      </p>
      <p>"You bastard..!"</p>
      <p>
        Manli Min-lap, who fought alongside them, had his main cannon of the
        Nether Crossing Ship taken by one of the other Eastern lords.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Manli Min-lap, the traitor brought the main cannon of the Nether
        Crossing Ship to Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        [We'll do the reward distribution later. Bring the Heaven-Striking
        Talisman quickly. We need to wipe these fools out and collapse the
        entire Serving Command Palace to obtain the Serving Command Seal….]
      </p>
      <p>
        When Yuan Li urges Byeok Cheon-gi, he nods and shouts to the other Byeok
        Clan Core Formation cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>"Bring the Heaven-Striking Talisman!"</p>
      <p>
        The Heaven-Striking Talisman is among a Byeok Clan Core Formation
        cultivator who recently entered the stage.
      </p>
      <p>It’s Byeok Mun-seong.</p>
      <p>
        Just as I’m about to attack with the Formless Sword to prevent him from
        bringing the Heaven-Striking Talisman, I sense something off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong takes out the Heaven-Striking Talisman from a storage
        artifact.
      </p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>And he activates the talisman.</p>
      <p>"Hm?"</p>
      <p>
        [What are you doing? No need to activate it. How much can you do with
        your Qi Building cultivation….]
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong shouts.</p>
      <p>"I'm sick of it! Clan head!"</p>
      <p>With those words.</p>
      <p>
        The young Core Formation cultivators of the Byeok Clan, centered on
        Byeok Mun-seong, form a formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "1000 years ago, we were a subordinate clan to the Jo Clan. 200 years
        ago, a subordinate force to the Righteous Path Alliance. Now, we are
        joining under the Nascent Soul old monster? Why can't the Byeok Clan
        stand alone, rather than sharing Byeokra with the Cheongmun and Gongmyo
        clans?"
      </p>
      <p>"Wh-what?"</p>
      <p>[Hmm….]</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong yells.</p>
      <p>
        "Look, clan head! If only you hadn't betrayed us, that old monster would
        have fallen just now. We could have led our clan to victory in the war,
        not needing to be under anyone, standing proudly as a single force,
        leading honor and victory!"
      </p>
      <p>"Have you lost your mind?"</p>
      <p>
        "No, I have not. It's not just me, but the other descendants as well. We
        all believe the same. Where is the guarantee that after this war is
        over, that old monster won't boil the hunting dogs? Why, clan leader,
        are you supporting the victory of the old monster!"
      </p>
      <p>Byeok Cheon-gi's face contorts.</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong shouts.</p>
      <p>
        "We've made a different choice for the future of our clan. The operation
        was in progress until just before the old monster's death. Without that
        damned Heaven-Sealing Talisman, we could have hunted the old monster!
        It's you, clan leader, who needs to come to your senses!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "You, you're out of your mind! Come to your senses! If you do so now, it
        can be passed off as a mere deviation! The power Lord Bloodwood is
        hiding isn't all you’ve seen!"
      </p>
      <p>Byeok Cheong-gi continues.</p>
      <p>
        "Ri-right. Haven't you been getting along well with the descendants of
        the Jin and Gongmyo clans recently? Now that both clans are the losers,
        you can do as you please with them. Calm down and…"
      </p>
      <p>"The one I favored."</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong speaks with a voice as if he’s spitting each word out,
        activating the Heaven-Striking Talisman.
      </p>
      <p>"Is not them."</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Heaven-Striking Talisman.</p>
      <p>
        A strike that releases the power of a Heavenly Being, shoots towards
        Yuan Li wrapped in the Heaven-Sealing Talisman.
      </p>
      <p>Kuguguguguang!</p>
      <p>One side of Serving Command Palace is torn away.</p>
      <p>
        A whirlwind rages, and it looks as if the light between heaven and earth
        is converging towards Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the radiance between heaven and earth, I see the Heaven-Sealing
        Talisman wrapped around Yuan Li being stripped away.
      </p>
      <p>Ta-datt!</p>
      <p>The Colorless Glass Swords come together.</p>
      <p>I exchange glances with Byeok Mun-seong as I pass by him.</p>
      <p>In this strike, I pour everything.</p>
      <p>"Colorless Glass Sword, final form."</p>
      <p>The last form of the Colorless Glass Sword.</p>
      <p>Beyond Color and Natural</p>
      <p>Finally reaching the ultimate.</p>
      <p>Three thousand Colorless Glass Swords merge into one.</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy circuits etched into each sword converge within a
        single blade, forming myriad spiritual energy circuits within the
        Colorless Glass Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more circuits, the greater the power, even if the quality of
        materials is poor.
      </p>
      <p>Colorless Glass Sword.</p>
      <p>Third Form.</p>
      <p>"All Heavens."</p>
      <p>
        The Colorless Glass Sword, shining in All of Heavens’ Natural Colors,
        stabs into Yuan Li's dantian.

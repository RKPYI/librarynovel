      <p>Chapter 145: Madman (5)</p>
      <p>
        "It was a few years ago.... When we were about to conquer the Cold
        Spirit Race, I wondered why the Integration cultivators didn't stop the
        Mad Lord, remember?"
      </p>
      <p>Her words continue.</p>
      <p>
        "I heard that near the Human Territory , a massive upheaval of fate
        shook the entire Bright Cold Realm. Rumor has it that a portal to the
        Immortal Realm opened, diverting the attention of all Integration
        cultivators to the Human Territory ."
      </p>
      <p>Kim Yeon playfully taps my shoulder.</p>
      <p>
        "And only recently, the rumors about the Immortal Realm were sorted out.
        Can you guess what happened?"
      </p>
      <p>She takes a deep breath.</p>
      <p>
        "The Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, where Section Chief Jeon
        Myeong-hoon had gone, was annihilated by a True Immortal’s attack. The
        upheaval of fate, the opening of the portal to the Immortal Realm, it
        was all a precursor to the True Immortal seeking the Golden Divine
        Heavenly Thunder Sect. Haha... Section Chief Jeon was the only one to
        survive the horrifying True Immortal’s bombardment. He became
        half-crazed, wandering here and there. Strangely, wherever he goes,
        lightning strikes, earning him the title 'Lightning Harbinger.'"
      </p>
      <p>There’s a bittersweet expression on her face.</p>
      <p>
        "Lightning Harbinger Jeon Myeong-hoon wanders around searching for
        something, annihilating anyone who blocks his path, be it an individual
        or race. This has caused him to accrue much enmity, being pursued here
        and there, then seeking revenge in turn and annihilating entire races...
        He's been repeating this for years, earning quite the infamous
        reputation... But, of course, not as much as us."
      </p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>
        With a flick of her finger, puppets move, bringing the corpses of a race
        in front of us.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Above, [She] is emanating an Integration stage aura, looking down in all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        After conquering the Cold Spirit Race and strengthened with materials
        from the Light Spirit Pond,
      </p>
      <p>
        [She] and the puppets in the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress have all
        significantly increased in power.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, since all the Integration cultivators flocked to the Human
        Territory , our forces in the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress have grown
        stronger, and he’s already created several Integration stage puppets...
        Escaping the Mad Lord's grasp seems even more distant now."
      </p>
      <p>A blood-stained battlefield.</p>
      <p>
        The puppets are busy clearing the battlefield, and Kim Yeon sits on a
        throne made of puppets, placing 'me' beside her as she talks.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, I'd like to meet Section Chief Jeon sometime. Will he
        understand my feelings? The feeling of losing someone precious?
        Ahaha..."
      </p>
      <p>She laughs weakly and buries her head on my chest.</p>
      <p>
        "Min-hee Unnie is currently traveling the Bright Cold Realm with the
        Black Ghost Valley, honing her skills. I heard she controls millions of
        ghosts with one hand... Now, in the entire Bright Cold Realm, there's no
        one who doesn't know of her. If we're famous for our infamy, she's
        famous for her tremendous reputation. There were even attacks on her by
        spies from the True Devil, Blood Yin, and Nether Ghost Realms.
        Hahaha..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Through Kim Yeon's words, the whereabouts of our companions emerge one
        after another.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Chief Oh is making a name for himself in the Azure Heaven Creation
        Sect. As the direct disciple of the sect founder, Azure Tiger Saint,
        he's known for his heroism. Maybe, he'll join an alliance to confront
        the Mad Lord in the future. Haha... It wouldn't be bad to be saved by
        the hands of our colleagues, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        She kept looking at me as she spoke, yet 'General Seo' didn’t look back
        but kept watching the battlefield as commanded by the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hye-seo, Hye-seo Unnie... I haven't heard much about her. Rumors say
        she married Seo Hweol, the Sea Dragon King, and became the Dragon
        Queen... Seo Hweol is active as a military advisor in the True Dragon
        Alliance, but there's no news about Hye-seo Unnie. It's strange, right?
        Even the dragons in the True Dragon Alliance don't know much about
        her... It's as if the information is deliberately blocked. Haha... Mad
        Lord said Seo Hweol must have intervened, that he's the most cunning in
        the world or whatever... I wonder if a madman is qualified to talk ill
        of others."
      </p>
      <p>Squeeze...</p>
      <p>
        She grips General Seo's body, which she had been tapping and stroking.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Director Kim... Well, of course, there's no news. If there was a way to
        contact him in the lower realm... I'm not even sure if he's alive. Oh,
        now that I think about it, wasn't he sent somewhere by Mad Lord with
        Eun-hyun Oppa? Eun-hyun Oppa, what do you think happened to Director
        Kim?
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>"Oppa?"</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>"...I'm asking you."</p>
      <p>Creak....</p>
      <p>Kim Yeon's intent becomes unstable.</p>
      <p>
        “I’m asking you, so answer me…Why aren’t you answering me! Why! Answer!
        Answer! Seo Eun-hyun! I’m telling you to answer me!”
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>As she rages, the sky trembles and the earth shakes.</p>
      <p>
        Though she is merely at the Heavenly Being stage, her power, amplified
        by her vast consciousness, reaches the Four-Axis level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Natural disasters occur, and the world in all directions is in turmoil.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just why! Why did you leave me behind! Why! Please answer me! Eun-hyun
        Oppa, I've told you about our colleagues, haven't I? Isn't there
        anything else you're curious about? I'll tell you. Please, just answer
        me... Comfort me like you did back then..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Yeon, in a frenzy, sobs uncontrollably, clutching General Seo's
        shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>"Waaaaaaah!"</p>
      <p>
        And I, feeling her intense pain beside me, grit my teeth internally.
      </p>
      <p>It’s been 80 years since I became General Seo.</p>
      <p>
        Eighty years since I started trying to take over General Seo's spiritual
        circuits.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        I have managed to gain control over some circuits inside the upper
        dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, when I move up to the upper dantian, I can instantly crush and
        utilize the clumps of spiritual energy replicating my soul as my
        resources.
      </p>
      <p>Yet, I still can't express anything externally.</p>
      <p>
        I haven't yet gained control over the circuits in the facial or neck
        areas, and as I gain control over more circuits, more consciousnesses
        linked to them emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these consciousnesses, more and more of the 'murmurs' of the
        Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress reach me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord has been rampaging across the Bright Cold realm for 80
        years, conquering races and creating puppets.
      </p>
      <p>One billion.</p>
      <p>
        Around one billion new puppets have joined the Wonderfully Mysterious
        Fortress, and their 'murmurs' grow louder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time I take control of a circuit, another gateway for murmurs
        opens, and the murmurs only grow louder over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The immense pressure almost drives me mad, but I persevere, clenching my
        teeth.
      </p>
      <p>"Please answer me! Respond..."</p>
      <p>'I can't accept your heart.'</p>
      <p>But,</p>
      <p>'Even so, you keep giving your heart to me...'</p>
      <p>This heart.</p>
      <p>'Someday, I will surely return it.'</p>
      <p>If I don't repay the one who weeps for me,</p>
      <p>This life will be worthless.</p>
      <p>Even if I have no intention of accepting their heart,</p>
      <p>I hope that the one who weeps for me will someday find salvation.</p>
      <p>For that, I must survive...!</p>
      <p>
        I acknowledge Kim Yeon sobbing beside me and exert more effort to take
        over the circuits.
      </p>
      <p>And then,</p>
      <p>500 years passed.</p>
      <p>Kim Yeon reached the Four-Axis stage.</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord's Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress grew even more, and now
        there are over fifteen Integration stage puppets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord became famous across the entire Bright Cold Realm, and his
        direct disciple, Kim Yeon, became well-known too.
      </p>
      <p>
        But her eyes lost more and more light, and she increasingly spent time
        clutching General Seo, sobbing madly or lost in madness, repeating 'I
        love you.'
      </p>
      <p>
        "Eun-hyun Oppa, there's news about our colleagues again. Do you want to
        hear it?"
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>"Thank you for listening. As always, you're all I have. Hehe..."</p>
      <p>At some point,</p>
      <p>Kim Yeon started muttering to herself while looking at me.</p>
      <p>
        I spoke nothing, but she seemed to be imagining and making up
        conversations on her own.
      </p>
      <p>500 years.</p>
      <p>
        During this time, having lost me and living alone with the residents in
        the Mad Lord's Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress,
      </p>
      <p>She has gone mad, accepting the madness of the Fortress.</p>
      <p>
        "Lightning Harbinger Jeon Myeong-hoon became famous as a mass murderer.
        Anyone who provokes him ends up annihilated along with their entire
        race. Well, Jeon Myeong-hoon was already famous like that before..."
      </p>
      <p>Crunch, crunch...</p>
      <p>Kim Yeon continues, biting her fingers.</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, Min-hee Unnie! Ah, poor Min-hee Unnie. She mastered the Ghost Path
        Method and reached the level of controlling billions of ghosts. But, she
        took in too many ghosts and went insane. She devoured her own sect, the
        Black Ghost Valley, annihilating it, and swallowed the entire territory
        of Black Ghost Valley. Only a single Nether Crossing Ship managed to
        escape from there. Now, cultivators who have reached the Integration
        stage are gathering to subdue Min-hee Unnie. Kiek kiek… Even though they
        dare not challenge the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, they go after
        poor, ambiguous Min-hee Unnie…. After consuming and commanding numerous
        ghosts, and becoming a powerful ghost monster, Unnie is currently
        establishing her base in the middle of the Swiftwind Domain, undergoing
        metamorphosis into something more powerful. Huhu…”
      </p>
      <p>Chew, chew...</p>
      <p>Biting her fingers, Kim Yeon continues.</p>
      <p>
        "After Azure Tiger Saint died, Chief Oh seemed to have become mentally
        unstable. Indulging in alcohol, women, drugs, and all kinds of
        pleasures. Who would have thought that such a dependable man at the
        company would fall apart like that? He looked happiest under Azure Tiger
        Saint, and to think he would break down so much after the death of just
        one person…... Well, it's true that anyone can fall apart when a
        precious person dies."
      </p>
      <p>Crunch, crack….</p>
      <p>From her fingers, blood flows.</p>
      <p>
        “There’s no news of Director Kim as always, well, he must’ve died.
        Keke…and Hye-seo Unnie…”
      </p>
      <p>Crunch Craaackk!</p>
      <p>"Still, there's still no news! No news!"</p>
      <p>Crunch!</p>
      <p>"I’m saying it’s good news!"</p>
      <p>Craaak!</p>
      <p>
        "It's good, right? Isn't it? Hye-seo Unnie, answer me. With Director Kim
        probably dead, me insane, Section Chief insane, Min-hee Unnie insane,
        and Eun-hyun Oppa like this! Hye-seo Unnie, at least you! You're living
        happily! Right? Everyone has become madmen. Only Hye-seo Unnie!"
      </p>
      <p>Cruuunch!</p>
      <p>
        "The situation is not so miserable, right? She must be living happily,
        loved, by the side of the Sea Dragon King, right? Tell me that's true.
        With all of us ending up like this, there should be at least one person
        who is happy, right? Isn't that so, Eun-hyun Oppa?"
      </p>
      <p>Crunchh..</p>
      <p>Before I know it, her hand has become completely mangled.</p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>Ssshhhh....</p>
      <p>
        Spiritual energy wriggles, regenerating her flesh that reached the
        Four-Axis stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oppa... please…Please just answer me. Please... Until when, until
        when..."
      </p>
      <p>Her consciousness chaotically spreads in all directions.</p>
      <p>
        She has not achieved completion in the Wonderfully Mysterious Innate
        Heart Canon.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she had, there's no way our eyes wouldn't have met, even now, within
        the puppet of the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only in front of the Mad Lord, I hide my heart essence with the
        enlightenment of Treading Heavens Beyond the Path.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of Kim Yeon, I always reveal my heart essence, so if she did
        reach completion, she would have recognized it.
      </p>
      <p>I know the reason.</p>
      <p>
        'The puppets of the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, who she controls in
        a sane state of mind, are gradually driving her mad with their
        ‘murmuring.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from the madness of the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, the
        Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon itself is an excellent
        consciousness method.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, becoming insane with madness before achieving completion, she
        couldn't take that last step.
      </p>
      <p>
        'It’s very likely the Mad Lord went insane after achieving completion.’
      </p>
      <p>Watching her with clouded, maddened eyes, I sort out my feelings.</p>
      <p>Over the past 500 years.</p>
      <p>Controlling General Seo's circuits, I learned some things.</p>
      <p>
        First, the puppets created by the Mad Lord all have artificial souls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the puppets made from corpses that died before their souls could be
        replicated, or from inanimate objects like wood, stone, or metal.
      </p>
      <p>
        They all contain mass-produced lumps of spiritual energy, mimicking
        other puppets' artificial souls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such artificial souls, lumps of spiritual energy, allow the puppets to
        emit spiritual energy waves similar to intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord's spiritual energy circuits connect with other puppets'
        circuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this connection, the puppets exchange intent-mimicking spiritual
        energy flows.
      </p>
      <p>
        These flows bind the puppets together, enabling the Mad Lord, whose
        consciousness isn't as vast as Kim Yeon's, to control the entire
        Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linked together, the puppets 'live their daily lives' within the
        fortress, strengthening the intent-mimicking connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artificial souls emitting joy, child puppets playing together – these
        weak, but slightly amplified energy waves, when performed by billions of
        puppets, increase tremendously.
      </p>
      <p>
        This amplified, strange flow of spiritual energy ties the entire
        Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress together, gradually converging towards
        its center.
      </p>
      <p>
        Towards the center, emotional vibrations increasingly compress and
        amplify, resembling real intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ‘intent’ in the center of the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress,
        combined from billions of artificial souls, is nearly indistinguishable
        from real emotions.
      </p>
      <p>In the center of this emotional whirlwind, [She] exists.</p>
      <p>
        Inside Mad Lord's puppet, tracking and observing his actions, I can
        guess his goal.
      </p>
      <p>'Maybe the Mad Lord is creating real intent, to create [Her] soul.'</p>
      <p>[She] has no soul.</p>
      <p>No, based on what I learned over 500 years under the Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>[She] isn't even a living puppet.</p>
      <p>
        Just an ordinary puppet, created with various precious materials,
        strongly reflecting the appearance of his lover.
      </p>
      <p>Just a puppet, nothing more.</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord has two ultimate puppets.</p>
      <p>
        Both from the lower realm, now advanced to the peak of the Integration
        Stage from the Four-Axis stage.
      </p>
      <p>[Her].</p>
      <p>And the [Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress].</p>
      <p>
        Through the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, he controls his numerous
        puppets, weaving replicated emotions from artificial souls into real
        intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the fortress, he processes intent, gradually completing [Her]
        soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Yet, will a lover created by his own hands still be his original
        lover...'
      </p>
      <p>I scoff inwardly at the Mad Lord's insane goal.</p>
      <p>I’m not really interested in his purpose.</p>
      <p>
        Creating a human soul is a great taboo, but honestly, I’m more focused
        on breaking free from his control.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason for taking control of the spiritual energy circuits is also
        to ensure that it no longer obeys the Mad Lord's command.
      </p>
      <p>
        And after 500 years, I finally managed to somewhat control the upper
        body of General Seo's spiritual energy circuit.
      </p>
      <p>Even now, I can move my arm and pat Kim Yeon.</p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>'The Mad Lord will notice.'</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy circuit is interconnected with the other puppets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the interconnected circuits, the spiritual energy waves
        intertwine, and within the Mad Lord's hands, [She] is being completed
        through the entire Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, no matter how isolated I am, no matter if I take full control
        of General Seo's spiritual energy circuit,
      </p>
      <p>
        If I act independently against the Mad Lord's command, he will notice
        right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        'And if the Mad Lord realizes this fact, he will try to completely
        extract my soul from this puppet.'
      </p>
      <p>That must not happen.</p>
      <p>Then, what should I do?</p>
      <p>Over the past 500 years, I had found a way.</p>
      <p>
        'Through the interconnected circuits, I will gradually take control of
        other puppets of the Mad Lord.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s possible through the Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon.
      </p>
      <p>
        'As long as I properly execute only the commands given by the Mad Lord,
        there's no reason to be caught.'
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no need to control the entire Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress.
      </p>
      <p>Just the puppets around General Seo.</p>
      <p>I only need to control the area where those puppets reside.</p>
      <p>
        'Although the puppets strictly follow the Mad Lord's command, a few
        minor errors are inevitable, and such errors are corrected internally by
        the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, without information reaching the
        Mad Lord.'
      </p>
      <p>After controlling one area,</p>
      <p>By accumulating small errors and pushing them all onto General Seo,</p>
      <p>
        For a brief moment, I can theoretically escape the Mad Lord's sight and
        control General Seo's body.
      </p>
      <p>'Surely, it's possible.'</p>
      <p>
        Already, besides General Seo, I have controlled the spiritual energy
        circuits of eight thousand puppets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regrettably, I had to indirectly control the puppets through General
        Seo's spiritual energy waves, not my own consciousness, so taking
        control was slower than expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if I project my consciousness outward, the Wonderfully Mysterious
        Fortress will notice, so I can't even talk to Kim Yeon.
      </p>
      <p>"Hu, huhu…."</p>
      <p>I look at her for a moment, lost in thought.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>'With around eight thousand, I can't move General Seo's body.'</p>
      <p>I decided.</p>
      <p>'But... one arm...'</p>
      <p>Click, click, click....</p>
      <p>
        Eight thousand puppets, all at once, made a very slight, insignificant
        error.
      </p>
      <p>'I've found the method to some extent....'</p>
      <p>
        And such small errors are corrected internally by the Wonderfully
        Mysterious Fortress.
      </p>
      <p>Click, click, click....</p>
      <p>
        Through the interconnectedness of the puppets, I concentrate all those
        errors into one of General Seo's arms.
      </p>
      <p>Click, click, click!</p>
      <p>
        General Seo's arm seems to twist, but my consciousness takes control of
        the arm.
      </p>
      <p>And then…</p>
      <p>'It took a long time.'</p>
      <p>But forgive me.</p>
      <p>Starting today, I will continuously express my existence to you.</p>
      <p>Pat, pat….</p>
      <p>"...?"</p>
      <p>
        General Seo's arm, after 500 years, patted Kim Yeon's shoulder following
        my will.
      </p>
      <p>'By using the errors, I can even control the mouth a little....'</p>
      <p>It's risky, but if it’s just for a fleeting moment.</p>
      <p>When Kim Yeon's gaze turns towards me.</p>
      <p>I slightly lift the corner of General Seo's mouth.</p>
      <p>
        And though the error is quickly corrected and my actions return to
        normal.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Yeon's eyes widened in surprise.</p>
      <p>"Oppa...?"</p>
      <p>Her eyes, soaked in madness, clears up momentarily.</p>
      <p>She might not truly believe it.</p>
      <p>She might just need something to comfort herself.</p>
      <p>But as if clinging to a lifeline of hope.</p>
      <p>
        She who saw my small gesture, trembling, raises both hands, and grabs
        General Seo's arm.
      </p>
      <p>"Are you... there?"</p>
      <p>As a disciple of the Mad Lord for 500 years.</p>
      <p>
        She knows all about how the puppets are made and what happens to beings
        turned into puppets.
      </p>
      <p>"Behind…the artificial soul…are you there?"</p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>
        Knowing that fact, still holding onto hope, she looks at me and asks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though I have used up all the errors I could mobilize for the moment and
        couldn't respond, tears well up in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>Different from the murky tears she had been shedding until now.</p>
      <p>
        "Aaah, you're there, aren't you? Eun-hyun Oppa, finally, you responded,
        didn’t you?”
      </p>
      <p>Drip, drip....</p>
      <p>
        Having received a response for the first time in 500 years, she bites
        her lips and embraces General Seo's body.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, for responding... for staying..."</p>
      <p>It might’ve been a very small signal.</p>
      <p>But she clings to it, endlessly thanking me.</p>
      <p>In the Mad Lord's Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress.</p>
      <p>One of the madmen in the fortress of the insane.</p>
      <p>Began to find her way back.</p>
      <p>Psssttt....</p>
      <p>Her consciousness clears.</p>
      <p>And as the madness that hindered her achievement disappears,</p>
      <p>
        Kim Yeon's Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon fully blossoms.
      </p>
      <p>'Aaah...'</p>
      <p>Finally.</p>
      <p>My eyes meet with hers.</p>

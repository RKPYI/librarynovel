      <p>Chapter 4: Director Kim is a Martial Genius (1)</p>
      <p>
        After confirming my location, I approached Director Kim, who was still
        unconscious, and shook him awake.
      </p>
      <p>"Director, Director Kim!"</p>
      <p>"Uh, umm..."</p>
      <p>Director Kim slowly got up and looked around.</p>
      <p>"...Deputy Manager Seo. Where are we now...?"</p>
      <p>"...Here."</p>
      <p>I briefly explained the situation to the Director.</p>
      <p>
        After the hunchbacked old man had thrust us through the spatial rift, we
        found ourselves in this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed to be a world resembling medieval China, where martial artists
        really exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...So many things have happened, I can't even tell what's what
        anymore."
      </p>
      <p>"Indeed."</p>
      <p>"I wish someone would tell me this is all just a dream..."</p>
      <p>Director Kim's face seemed to have aged ten years in an instant.</p>
      <p>
        "...I'm not sure if it's fortunate or not, not having any abilities or
        talents. I wonder if it's good that we weren't taken by those monstrous
        beings, or if we were just abandoned..."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>I had no answer for him either.</p>
      <p>
        In my past life, I was just an ignorant herb collector who knew nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though I had survived comfortably for three days with others in
        this life, it was all thanks to my regression.
      </p>
      <p>As a person, I'm not that remarkable.</p>
      <p>"First, we can't stay in this alley forever. Let's go out."</p>

      <p>"...Um, okay."</p>
      <p>
        Director Kim and I went out to the bustling streets of Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seokyung City's bustling area, teeming with all kinds of people, was as
        crowded as a modern-day shopping district.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Umm, I can't understand what they're saying. It all sounds like
        Chinese, and why are people glancing at us?"
      </p>
      <p>"Probably because of the clothes we're wearing."</p>
      <p>
        I had burned the shirt I was originally wearing at Manager Kim's
        farewell meal to use as fuel, so now I only had an undershirt left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Director Kim was conspicuously dressed in completely out-of-place hiking
        gear.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...This is trouble. By the way, Deputy Manager Seo, do you happen to
        speak Chinese...?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, fortunately, I've had Chinese language training. Listening to
        them, it sounds similar to a southern Chinese dialect. I think
        communication should be possible to some extent."
      </p>
      <p>"Wow... That's incredibly lucky...!"</p>
      <p>Of course, that was a lie.</p>
      <p>
        The language of this world, starting from oracle bone script, was
        entirely different from Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's traditional, simplified, or any regional dialects of China,
        they won't work here.
      </p>
      <p>
        'In my past life, I had to beg and cling to nearby beggars for two
        months just to learn basic communication...'
      </p>
      <p>I wouldn't need to do that now.</p>
      <p>
        "But since these clothes will attract attention, let's buy new ones."
      </p>
      <p>
        "How are we going to buy clothes? I doubt our money will work here..."
      </p>
      <p>I smiled wryly and replied.</p>
      <p>
        "Money might not work, but wherever people live, medicine is needed."
      </p>
      <p>
        I entered a nearby pharmacy and sold various herbs like hemostatic
        herbs, warming herbs, and fever-reducing herbs.
      </p>
      <p>
        These were the most common and low-grade herbs I had gathered in
        Ascension Path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, these herbs, having absorbed a lot of spiritual energy and
        not been touched by human hands for a long time in the forest, were
        three to four times larger than ordinary herbs, and I received a
        considerable amount of money from the pharmacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, Deputy Manager Seo. As expected, your abilities work even here.
        Did you, did you receive a lot?"
      </p>
      <p>"...It seems so."</p>
      <p>Still, I frowned upon seeing the money given by the pharmacy owner.</p>
      <p>'They've really undercut the price.'</p>
      <p>It was because of our suspicious appearance.</p>
      <p>
        The herbs were large and abundant, so we received this much, but we
        might not have gotten anything if they were less.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, this amount was enough to buy new clothes.</p>
      <p>
        I immediately went to the most shabby-looking fabric store nearby and
        bought two sets of worn clothes.
      </p>
      <p>We changed into these plain-looking clothes and stepped outside.</p>
      <p>'The cost of living here is immense.'</p>
      <p>
        It seemed to be three to four times more expensive than in Lianshan
        City.
      </p>
      <p>As a result, we had to spend all the money we had.</p>
      <p>"So, what now? Deputy Manager Seo."</p>
      <p>
        "Just wait a moment, Director. It seems I will need to sell more herbs."
      </p>
      <p>I went to another pharmacy and again sold herbs.</p>
      <p>
        This time, they didn't cut the price because of our suspicious
        appearance, but still significantly undercut the price.
      </p>
      <p>
        I once again went back to the fabric store and bought slightly better
        clothes, then went to another pharmacy and sold herbs again.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, the owner of the pharmacy, seeing my clothes, bought the
        herbs at a proper price.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last time, I went back to the fabric store and this time bought
        a silk outfit. Dressed in the new clothes, I wandered around the
        bustling streets of Seokyung City and entered a considerably large
        pharmacy to sell the yellow bamboo roots.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, my lord. To sell such a precious elixir to our pharmacy..."</p>
      <p>
        The owner of the pharmacy reverently took the yellow bamboo roots from
        me, who was dressed in silk.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In my opinion, this yellow bamboo root must be at least eight hundred
        years old. At the very least, it should fetch ten pieces of horse-shaped
        silver."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Of course! In fact, it should be worth fifteen pieces for such
        quality!"
      </p>
      <p>"Right, it should be. Bring them quickly."</p>
      <p>
        I received the owner's gratitude and left the pharmacy with fifteen
        pieces of horse-shaped silver.
      </p>
      <p>"Heh, heh. Incredible. Deputy Manager Seo. Is this all?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, well."</p>
      <p>There were still a few more roots of yellow bamboo left.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the one I sold was the smallest.</p>
      <p>
        After buying a silk outfit for Director Kim, I went to the government
        office, gave a bribe to an official, and obtained a residence permit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, after buying a small house and land on the outskirts of Seokyung
        City, I was left with only one piece of horse-shaped silver.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Let's live here from today onwards. We've secured basic housing, and
        I'll teach you how to read and write, Director."
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Deputy Manager Seo. No, that's not right."</p>
      <p>He seemed a bit embarrassed as he spoke.</p>
      <p>
        "Now that we're not colleagues, it doesn't seem right to call you Deputy
        Manager. What should I call you...?"
      </p>
      <p>"...Just call me by my name."</p>
      <p>"Thank you, Seo Eun-hyun."</p>
      <p>We decided on the form of address and discussed our future plans.</p>
      <p>
        "The reason we could gather such an amount of money so quickly is
        because we sold the herbs we gathered in the forest. If we run out of
        herbs, we'll have problems with food and shelter, so we need to find a
        way to make a living."
      </p>
      <p>
        "How should we continue to make a living... How about doing business by
        selling herbs and buying silver?"
      </p>
      <p>Certainly.</p>
      <p>
        With the substantial initial funds we now have, Director Kim Young-hoon,
        who was a mid-level executive in a fairly large company, should be able
        to do business well enough to make ends meet.
      </p>
      <p>'But that's not enough.'</p>
      <p>Since I've regressed.</p>
      <p>Shouldn't I aim a little higher?</p>
      <p>'Director Kim Young-hoon is a martial arts genius.'</p>
      <p>
        He became a powerful warrior by mastering third-rate martial arts sold
        on the streets in just a few months.
      </p>
      <p>
        He gradually learned advanced martial arts to eventually become the
        number one in the martial arts world of Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>What if I taught him advanced martial arts from the beginning?</p>
      <p>
        'I could advance the birth of the greatest swordsman by 30 years...!'
      </p>
      <p>And I would benefit as much as possible from his success.</p>
      <p>
        "Director, this place actually has a world of martial arts and martial
        skills."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm...!"</p>
      <p>
        "Innocently doing business in such a place, we could end up being swept
        by the competition between martial sects at any time. Wouldn't it be
        better to learn at least some self-defense martial skills?"
      </p>
      <p>"That makes sense..."</p>
      <p>He asked me, his face lighting up with excitement.</p>
      <p>
        "Ha, but martial arts are usually not taught to outsiders, right? How
        can we easily learn them?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing about learning martial arts, Director Kim used a term from
        martial arts novels and his eyes sparkled.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I just received fifteen pieces of silver for one herb. Isn't there
        nothing that can't be solved with money?"
      </p>
      <p>"Huhem...!"</p>
      <p>
        "Of course, before that, you'll need to learn the language and
        characters."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        For the next three months, I taught Director Kim the language and
        characters while living off the money from selling one more herb. He
        seemed to relieve his depression from being separated from his
        colleagues in this strange world by learning with all his might.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, I taught him a breathing technique called Cheonji
        (Heaven Earth) Heart Method, a third-rate internal martial art, as a
        health exercise.
      </p>
      <p>And after three months.</p>
      <p>
        "Lately, I've been feeling a tingling sensation in my lower abdomen.
        Even though I just sit at home, I feel bursts of energy..."
      </p>
      <p>'Amazing.'</p>
      <p>I could confirm Director Kim's incredible progress.</p>
      <p>
        Cheonji Heart Method, literally a basic internal martial art, focuses
        not on 'accumulating' internal energy but on 'feeling' it by
        establishing the foundation in the Dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took Director Kim only three months to feel the Qi inside his body,
        which usually takes ordinary people eight months with the Cheonji Heart
        Method.
      </p>
      <p>'He has mastered the Cheonji Heart Method.'</p>
      <p>At the same time, I felt a bit of self-deprecation.</p>
      <p>
        I took about thirteen months to feel Qi using the Cheonji Heart Method
        method. This means I'm considerably slower than an average person. When
        it's only third-rate martial arts, the difference is only four times,
        but as we progress to higher-level martial arts, the gap between his
        talent and mine will become strikingly apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...Well, since you seem to be getting the hang of the language and
        characters, let's look for a sect to join."
      </p>
      <p>"Let's do that. Haha, are we going to learn martial arts now...!"</p>
      <p>
        While I spent three months teaching Director Kim letters and language, I
        researched the martial arts sects of Seokyung City in Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Demon Slaying Sect(斬魔宗), Self-binding Temple (系俺寺), Surpassing
        Bird House (越鳥房), Seven Mysteries Gate(七玄門), Wolf Fang Gang
        (牙狼團), Dark Night Association (暗夜會), and Dragon Fighting
        Stronghold (鬪龍堡) are considered the seven major sects of Seokyung
        City."
      </p>
      <p>I explained each of the sects to him.</p>
      <p>
        Demon Slaying Sect, Self-binding Template, Surpassing Bird House, and
        Seven Mysteries Gate were classified as righteous sects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wolf Fang Gang, Dark Night Association, and Dragon Fighting Stronghold
        were famous unorthodox forces in Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>
        The four righteous sects and three evil sects were collectively referred
        to as Four Stars Three Demons (四星三魔) in Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Demon Slaying Sect mainly practiced sword and blade techniques,
        Self-binding Temple was a religious sect of Buddhism, Surpassing Bird
        House was an information organization like Hao Moon (Korean murim
        organization that consists of thieves, pickpockets, prostitutes,
        etc<em>)</em>, and Seven Mysteries Gate had a long history and
        encompassed various martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wolf Fang Gang specialized in strong and practical fighting techniques,
        Dark Night Association developed stealth and movement techniques through
        illegal activities in Seokyung City, and Dragon Fighting Stronghold
        primarily focused on unarmed fighting techniques.
      </p>
      <p>"Director, which sect appeals to you the most?"</p>
      <p>
        Regardless of the sect, Director Kim's talent would ensure his success.
      </p>
      <p>Without any hesitation, Director Kim made his choice.</p>
      <p>
        "Demon Slaying! Let's go with the Demon Slaying Sect. Afterall,
        swordsmanship for a heroic warrior, blade techniques for a man, is it
        not?
      </p>
      <p>
        'Just like in his past life, he chooses the same path as his first
        martial art.'
      </p>
      <p>A good choice indeed.</p>
      <p>The second coming of the greatest swordsman from my previous life.</p>
      <p>Together, Director Kim and I headed towards the Demon Slaying Sect.</p>
      <p>
        The Demon Slaying Sect’s main branch was located in the eastern part of
        Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the large compound of the sect, loud shouts of energy could be
        heard. At the entrance, two warriors wearing swords and blades guarded
        the gate.
      </p>
      <p>"Halt, what brings you to our sect?"</p>
      <p>
        The guard warriors cautiously inquired, noticing the silk clothes we
        were wearing.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This gentleman here is my... elder brother. He has come to learn the
        martial arts of Demon Slaying, having heard of its reputation."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>The gatekeeper's eyes turned towards Director Kim.</p>
      <p>A middle-aged man with half-balding hair and a plump belly.</p>
      <p>
        "...Um, I apologize, but at that age, it won't be easy to learn martial
        arts."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha. Still, let us talk to the higher-ups. Even basic self-defense
        martial arts would be fine."
      </p>
      <p>I gently smiled and replied.</p>
      <p>
        Although I mentioned self-defense martial arts, within a few months,
        they will be pleading with Director Kim to learn advanced martial arts
        on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gatekeepers exchanged looks, sighed, and then opened the gate for
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after, Director Kim and I were facing the Hall Master of the
        Demon Slaying Hall, named Heo Baek.
      </p>
      <p>"So, you wish to learn self-defense martial arts..."</p>
      <p>"Yes, if possible, the best self-defense martial arts..."</p>
      <p>I handed over a prepared silk case to Heo Baek.</p>
      <p>
        It contained fifteen of the twenty silver ingots I had acquired from
        selling all the yellow bamboo roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heo Baek opened the case, checked the silver ingots, coughed, and said,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hm, hm... I will admit him as an outer disciple of the Demon Slaying
        Sect. If he wants, I can also teach a couple of our inner disciple
        martial arts. However, he will be treated as an outer disciple. There
        are no privileges for those who enter through donations. Also... we will
        only accept one of you as an outer disciple."
      </p>
      <p>"Um..."</p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        Director Kim, surprised by the stingy offer, started to rise. I gently
        pressed his shoulder, stopping him, and replied to Hall Master Heo Baek,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you for the honor, Hall Master. That will be sufficient. As an
        outer disciple, my elder brother here... will join."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, then come to the Hall of External Disciples, shortly."</p>
      <p>Heo Baek left us with a dismissive gesture and went away.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon, looking confused, said to me,</p>

        "Eun-hyun, what's the point if I'm the only one learning martial arts?
        If I knew it would be this expensive, we could have just gone to another
        sect..."
      </p>
      <p>"No, it might be better for you to learn martial arts."</p>
      <p>
        "No, you, being younger, would be more suitable for learning martial
        arts..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "...I've always been bad at physical activities. I'll support you, Mr.
        Kim, with the remaining silver ingots through business. That's my job
        and my role. You just need to fulfill your role."
      </p>
      <p>"But..."</p>
      <p>
        After showing a slightly apologetic face, Kim Young-hoon decisively
        said,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Alright. If you say so, I too will do my best to learn martial arts and
        help you. It would be lucky if this old body can even learn the basics."
      </p>
      <p>"Believe in yourself."</p>
      <p>"Thank you..."</p>
      <p>
        Thus, Kim Young-hoon became an outer disciple of the Demon Slaying Sect,
        learning a few outer disciple and three inner disciple martial arts as a
        privilege for his substantial donation.
      </p>
      <p>Seven months later.</p>
      <p>The Demon Slaying Sect was in an uproar.</p>

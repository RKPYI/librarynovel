        <p>Chapter 23: Refining (2)</p>
        <p>"Kim Hyung."</p>
        <p>"What is it?"</p>
        <p>"Why are those called cultivators so heartless?"</p>
        <p>"... How would I know that?"</p>
        <p>I frowned, thinking about the conduct of cultivators.</p>
        <p>From the monsters we encountered at the beginning of the regression, who ignored everything we said.</p>
        <p>To the cruel method of pill-making by the Makli Clan.</p>
        <p>And the cultivators of the Jin Clan who rummaged through the dead and criticized us for trying to bury them.
        </p>
        <p>'I can understand searching the bodies, a hundred times over.'</p>
        <p>But why do they think burying the dead is a waste of time?</p>
        <p>Why are their thought processes so different?</p>
        <p>"... Perhaps, since they have been seeing the world of the Five Energies Converging to the Origin from birth,
            their way of thinking is different from ours. Plus, they've spent their whole lives not treating mortals as
            humans."</p>
        <p>I sighed, frustrated.</p>
        <p>The cultivators of the Jin Clan informed us of the next gathering place and left the village, closing the
            formation of the Makli Clan territory and flying away on their flying devices.</p>
        <p>We were currently following them.</p>
        <p>"... A difference in perspective?"</p>
        <p>Or is it the inherent arrogance of cultivators?</p>
        <p>Or is it that all cultivators turn out that way?</p>
        <p>I wondered if it was right for me to become a cultivator.</p>
        <p>We continued to follow the guidance of the Jin Clan's cultivators, destroying one stronghold of the Makli
            Clan after another.</p>
        <p>Five years had passed since I left the Imperial Palace.</p>
        <p>"Ha, look, Eun-hyun, it's your face."</p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>I saw my face on a wanted poster, wandering around the marketplace.</p>
        <p>Not just mine.</p>
        <p>Kim Young-hoon, as well as countless martial arts masters who followed him, were on wanted posters.</p>
        <p>The charge was treason.</p>
        <p>"Treason. What nonsense. After all, it's just the lower forces of the cultivator clan. Even if they issue
            wanted posters, we can walk around the streets without any problems, thanks to the facial manipulation
            technique you created."</p>
        <p>"That's good to hear."</p>
        <p>Over the past five years, I had developed a technique called Reverse Appearance Technique, using my medical
            knowledge and transformational skills to manipulate facial muscles and change appearances.</p>
        <p>Thanks to that, we could walk around the streets freely, even though we were wanted.</p>
        <p>"So, where's the next stronghold?"</p>
        <p>"It's on the western side of Lianshan City, on the hills. One of Makli Clan's pill-making furnaces is located
            there. This time, the furnace we are going to destroy is especially huge, so there will probably be a lot
            more cultivators from the Makli Clan."</p>
        <p>"That's likely."</p>
        <p>"And from what I've heard, there are also a significant number of peak martial artists raised by the Makli
            Clan. They are not just simple Jaingshi but actual peak martial artists, so we need to be a bit more
            cautious."</p>
        <p>Peak martial artists.</p>
        <p>I looked up at the sky.</p>
        <p>35 years since regression.</p>
        <p>It took around 10 years to reach the mid stage of the Pinnacle Realm since the regression and now 25 years
            later…</p>
        <p>My realm had not changed.</p>
        <p>'Is my talent not enough to reach the Three Flowers Gather at the Summit?'</p>
        <p>Three Flowers Gather at the Summit.</p>
        <p>Kim Young-hoon and other experts of that realm have been consistently giving me clues regarding it.</p>
        <p>"The third color."</p>
        <p>Red thread signifying hostility.</p>
        <p>Blue thread signifying self-intent.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, the need to find and see the third color to reach that realm.</p>
        <p>But.</p>
        <p>"In a fight, there's me and you. What else is there beyond that?"</p>
        <p>There's definitely something beyond me and you.</p><!--sse-->

            <div id="pf-6108-1">
                <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6528c948fadfcc003f9827ee", id: "pf-6108-1" })</script>
            </div>
        </div><!--/sse-->
        <p>The very existence of the Three Flowers realm itself proves it.</p>
        <p>Ugh.</p>
        <p>Ignoring the screaming pain in my hand, I held the sword and felt the thread of those around me as I walked
            down the street.</p>
        <p>I can see others' threads.</p>
        <p>I can see my own threads.</p>
        <p>But beyond that, no matter how hard I look, I can't see anything.</p>
        <p>"Enlightenment still hasn't come."</p>
        <p>Even when I asked Kim Young-hoon about Three Flowers Gather at the Summit, I couldn't understand his words
            well.</p>
        <p>Originally, when Kim Young-hoon reached the peak, he didn't go through the early or middle stages but
            directly achieved Three Flowers .</p>
        <p>Asking him about transitioning from the middle stage to Three Flowers was nonsensical.</p>
        <p>Of course, I asked other masters of Three Flowers how to transition into it, but the answers I got were:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Immerse yourself in the state of selflessness."</li>
            <li>"Understand that there is no you and no me."</li>
            <li>"Contemplate the purity of martial arts."</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>All of these answers were metaphysical in nature.</p>
        <p>"Someone is staying in this place because they don't want to fall into a state of selflessness."</p>
        <p>Ignoring the tearing pain in my hands, I swung my sword for years.</p>
        <p>No matter how much I maintained the unity of sword and body, and fought life-threatening battles multiple
            times.</p>
        <p>The miracle of suddenly leaping to a higher realm never happened to me.</p>
        <p>While it wasn’t as despairing as when I first reached the peak, climbing higher required tremendous talent
            and effort again.</p>
        <p>"There are many masters at the peak here..."</p>
        <p>The stronghold of the Makli Clan, located to the west of Lianshan City.</p>
        <p>"If there are many masters, I might gain something by fighting them."</p>
        <p>Somehow, I felt that the stronghold discovered by the Jin Clan this time seemed like a trap.</p>
        <p>It was a judgment I made after hearing from one of the Jin Clan cultivators about how they found the
            stronghold and its level of force.</p>
        <p>"The Makli Clan wants to capture Kim Young-hoon as well as the Jin Clan."</p>
        <p>And me, a traitor to the Imperial family.</p>
        <p>That's why I thought this time they would be fully prepared to face us.</p>
        <p>"But I'm not worried."</p>
        <p>I glanced at Kim Young-hoon walking beside me.</p>
        <p>He had been writing a book recently.</p>
        <p>The title of the book was ‘Secrets of 'Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martials Arts”</p>
        <p>"Condensing the deep understanding of the 6 volumes of 'Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts
            Scripture', and integrating it into one complete book of understanding," he had said.</p>
        <p>Like the 'Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts', 'Record of Gazing Cultivation and
            Exceeding Martial Arts', and 'Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Scriptures', it was a book of
            profound knowledge that I couldn't understand even when I looked at it.</p>
        <p>But one thing was certain.</p>
        <p>Kim Young-hoon had surpassed his previous life’s realm.</p>
        <p>Such a person could now inflict significant damage on a Core Formation cultivator and quickly escape!</p>
        <p>"A trap is of no use."</p>
        <p>We would easily destroy their stronghold this time as well.</p>
        <p>Lianshan City.</p>
        <p>‘This is the place I fell in my very first life before regression.’</p>
        <p>It had been a very long time since I had visited.</p>
        <p>‘Here I made soap, gathered herbs, brewed liquor, begged robbers to spare my life…’</p>
        <p>Memories of those miserable times came flooding back.</p>
        <p>"Let's go west."</p>
        <p>"…Yes."</p>
        <p>I wonder if the daughter of the Ju family has been born.</p>
        <p>Is the house of Lord Geum still filled with servants strutting around arrogantly?</p>
        <p>I wonder if the persimmon tree of the Sung family still bears fruit well.</p>
        <p>After looking at Lianshan City for a while, I ran west following Kim Young-hoon.</p>
        <p>Memories that no one but I remember.</p>
        <p>Memories that only I know of, changed by my power of regression.</p>
        <p>A miraculous, incredibly grateful ability.</p>
        <p>But that's why this ability has to disappear.</p>
        <p>These memories that only I will know will continue to accumulate, and the more they do, the harder it will be
            for my mind to endure.</p>
        <p>Hence, I will definitely go to the previous world and eliminate this power.</p>
        <p>Until then, I will strive to be human.</p>
        <p>As a human, I will live a human life.</p>
        <p>Absolutely.</p>
        <p>I will not become corrupted by evil paths like the cultivators of the Makli Clan, nor act against human
            morals.</p>
        <p>Of course.</p>
        <p>"Those filthy evil path bastards, they can't make me dance less."</p>
        <p>Those who violate human morals, as long as I can reach them, must be punished.</p>
        <p>Tadat!</p>
        <p>Arriving at the destination with Kim Young-hoon, there were already Jin Clan cultivators in red robes and
            other peak masters gathered.</p>
        <p>"The opinion that this Makli Clan's stronghold is likely a trap came out in the Jin Clan's elder council.
            Therefore, one-third of the Jin Clan's elder council has personally come forward.</p>
        <p>Thus, you martial artists must also fight with all your might."</p>
        <p>Among the red-robed cultivators, a considerable number of Qi Building cultivators with substantial
            consciousness were mixed in.</p>
        <p>"I understand. Do not worry. I always fight with my best."</p>
        <p>"Hmm, good. Then, let's open the formation."</p>
        <p>Woong―</p>
        <p>As one of the elders of the Jin Clan completed a hand seal, the air began to distort.</p>
        <p>We followed the elders of the Jin Clan into the formation and soon saw the village, just like before.</p>
        <p>This village was about twice the size of any territory of the Makli Clan we had seen before, with not just
            straw houses but also a significant number of tiled mansions.</p>
        <p>And then,</p>
        <p>"...It was a trap after all."</p>
        <p>The cultivators of the Makli Clan were forming a formation and sealing spells in front of the village.</p>
        <p>"Seal (結)!"</p>
        <p>The cultivators of the Makli Clan simultaneously formed their hand seals and shouted an incantation.</p>
        <p>At the same time, an enormous barrier, unlike any we had seen before, surrounded the territory of the Makli
            Clan.</p>
        <p>"Water (水)!"</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, dozens of cultivators formed another hand seal and used a different spell.</p>
        <p>Shaaaah!</p>
        <p>A massive surge of water gushed from behind the cultivators, rushing towards us outside the barrier.</p>
        <p>The water reeked of rotting corpses, and I had a feeling that even a single drop touching me would be
            disastrous.</p>
        <p>"Elders, to the front!"</p>
        <p>The Qi Building cultivators of the Jin Clan stepped forward and formed their hand seals.</p>
        <p>"Flame (炎)!"</p>
        <p>Hwarurururu!</p>
        <p>A wall of flames appeared.</p>
        <p>The giant wall of fire blocked the water flow and began to evaporate it.</p>
        <p>"Push forward!"</p>
        <p>Chiiiiii―</p>
        <p>As the cultivators of the Jin Clan stepped forward one by one, the giant wall of fire also moved forward in
            sync.</p>
        <p>"Mortals! We will clear the way, so break through the barrier!"</p>
        <p>"Understood!"</p>
        <p>Pang!</p>
        <p>Kim Young-hoon sprinted forward, kicking off the ground.</p>
        <p>He leapt into the air and, stepping on thin air, headed towards the barrier.</p>
        <p>Woong!</p>
        <p>As Kim Young-hoon extended his hand, energy seemed to gather in it, and a sphere of Gang Qi burst forth from
            his palm.</p>
        <p>'That must be the realm Kim Young-hoon achieved by condensing and integrating the 6 volumes of the Scripture'
        </p>
        <p>The Gang Qi didn't gather chaotically in the air but was released cleanly from his body, forming a sphere in
            an instant.</p>
        <p>I don't know for sure, but he must have reached and surpassed the realm the previous Kim Young-hoon stepped
            foot in.</p>
        <p>'The preparation time for compressing Gang Qi is much shorter than last time!'</p>
        <p>Before the battle began, I remembered the Secrets of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts that Kim
            Young-hoon had given me.</p>
        <p>'If I pass this technique on to Kim Young-hoon in the next life.'</p>
        <p>He would surpass this realm again.</p>
        <p>Kwaang!</p>
        <p>Kim Young-hoon launched the sphere at the barrier.</p>
        <p>A loud explosion roared, and a gust of wind blew.</p>
        <p>However, this time the barrier only shook slightly and remained steadfast.</p>
        <p>'As expected, the Makli Clan was thoroughly prepared this time!'</p>
        <p>Kim Young-hoon, without any sign of panic, extended his palm again.</p>
        <p>And another sphere of Gang Qi burst forth.</p>
        <p>Kwaang!</p>
        <p>The barrier was hit by consecutive explosions.</p>
        <p>Cracks began to form in the barrier.</p>
        <p>Kim Young-hoon extended his palm once more.</p>
        <p>Kwaang!!</p>
        <p>More cracks appeared in the barrier.</p>
        <p>Kim Young-hoon extended his palm again.</p>
        <p>With each attack, more and more cracks appeared in the barrier.</p>
        <p>At some point.</p>
        <p>Pakang!</p>
        <p>Unable to withstand Kim Young-hoon's attacks any longer, a hole was blown open in the barrier.</p>
        <p>"Everyone, head towards the barrier!"</p>
        <p>"Burn down the Makli's business!"</p>
        <p>The cultivators of the Jin Clan rushed towards the hole created by Kim Young-hoon, and the peak masters also
            rushed through the gap into the inside of the barrier.</p>
        <p>"Die, you devils."</p>
        <p>When I, too, entered the barrier with my sword,</p>
        <p>Pang!</p>
        <p>The sound of air tearing apart, and something long rushed towards me.</p>
        <p>It was a halberd.</p>
        <p>Kaang!</p>
        <p>I exerted sword silk and blocked the halberd. I could see the face of the person holding the halberd in front
            of me.</p>
        <p>I couldn't stop my pupils from shaking.</p>
        <p>"...Leader?"</p>
        <p>Leader of the Shadow Guards.</p>
        <p>My former superior was blocking me.</p>
        <p>Behind him, the members of the Shadow Guards were lined up, holding various weapons.</p>
        <p>"...It's been a while."</p>
        <p>"...I don't know a traitor like you."</p>
        <p>Vroom!</p>
        <p>The leader swung his halberd.</p>
        <p>Seven red threads emanated from his halberd.</p>
        <p>I countered his red threads with my own blue threads.</p>
        <p>My blue and his red crossed in the air.</p>
        <p>"A traitor, you say. Leader, do you know what the current Imperial family is doing?"</p>
        <p>"...I know."</p>
        <p>Vroom!</p>
        <p>He swung his halberd again.</p>
        <p>I parried his halberd with my threads while dodging and swinging my sword silk.</p>
        <p>"You know and yet you're loyal? Is that what a human should do?"</p>
        <p>"...Before being human, we are the limbs of His Majesty the Emperor. Limbs do not think. They move as
            commanded! Since His Majesty has ordered me to capture you, I will not think either."</p>
        <p>"How frustrating! In the eyes of the Emperor, mortals like us are not the same humans as him! We are not his
            people but livestock he raises!"</p>
        <p>Leader spun with his halberd, thrusting it three times, then extended Qi Silk towards me.</p>
        <p>I danced the Transcendent Peaks Step to dodge Leader's attacks and countered with Landscape Painting,
            covering my sword with sword silk and striking back at his qi silk.</p>
        <p>"Loyalty should be given to someone deserving, not to him. All that comes from serving him is the death of
            helpless commoners!"</p>
        <p>Our threads of red and blue intertwined.</p>
        <p>Then, breaking through my defense, Leader aimed his knee at my waist.</p>
        <p>"Keuk!"</p>
        <p>I was hit by Leader’s kick and floated in the air, turning once before landing.</p>
        <p>'He's improved. The Leader... he's in the realm of Three Flowers'</p>
        <p>"...Is it different for you?"</p>
        <p>Leader asked me with a gloomy face.</p>
        <p>"Those from the Jin Clan who you are with, are they different?"</p>
        <p>"They're better than those devils..."</p>
        <p>"No. The Jin Clan you're with are also cultivators. The only difference from the current Imperial family is
            the degree; they both see mortals as bugs! Do you think you're on the side of justice? Wrong! It's just a
            matter of scope and degree.</p>
        <p>Those people will also grind down the people of Yanguo. They're no different but all the same!"</p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>Woosh, woosh, woosh!</p>
        <p>As he swung his halberd, the wind seemed to be sucked into the Leader's chest.</p>
        <p>His qi silk swirled and shot towards me.</p>
        <p>'I can't block it!'</p>
        <p>Like my ‘Qi Mountain, Heart Heaven,’ an attack that can't be stopped even if anticipated.</p>
        <p>"If there's no difference, at least I won't turn my back on the loyalty I've given now!"</p>
        <p>The movement of his halberd converged to one point and shot towards me.</p>
        <p>The Qi silk on his halberd strengthened and began to evolve.</p>
        <p>Paaat!</p>
        <p>A brilliant light burst forth.</p>
        <p>Gang Qi!</p>
        <p>"...If that's your belief."</p>
        <p>Seeing the Gang Qi rushing towards me, I relaxed the power in my sword.</p>
        <p>"I will respect that as well."</p>
        <p>As I removed my intent, the sword silk around my sword disappeared, leaving only pure sword energy.</p>
        <p>I placed my sword against the incoming halberd, absorbing its power into my sword.</p>
        <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
        <p>Echoing Valley!</p>
        <p>"...!"</p>
        <p>Surprise flickered in the Leader’s eyes.</p>
        <p>I rotated, redirecting his Gang Qi back at him.</p>
        <p>Flash!</p>
        <p>Light flashed.</p>
        <p>And where the storm of light subsided, Leader stood, his right hand severed.</p>
        <p>"...I've lost. Your swordsmanship is always hard to predict, no matter how many times I see it."</p>
        <p>"...It is a swordsmanship I am still lacking in."</p>
        <p>"Still lacking? Impossible. Even your move just now had the enlightenment of Three Flowers Gather at the
            Summit. It was the most beautiful technique I've ever seen."</p>
        <p>He smirked.</p>
        <p>"I spent my life practicing martial arts, hoping to reach Three Flowers, but once I did, I realized I was
            just a lesser version of a cultivator. Unless it's the legendary realm of Five Energies Converging to the
            Origin, martial arts will always be secondary to cultivators. Hahaha, Seo Eun-hyun. Do you understand?
            Nothing matters in front of cultivators."</p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>"Since nothing in martial arts matters, all that's left is the meaning I give to it. I chose loyalty, and my
            object of loyalty happened to be the current Emperor."</p>
        <p>He smiled sadly.</p>
        <p>"That you and I have different beliefs... is a shame... only."</p>
        <p>Cough, cough...</p>
        <p>Leader coughed up blood and collapsed.</p>
        <p>No more life flowed from him.</p>
        <p>He was dead.</p>
        <p>"...Why didn't you join the fight?"</p>
        <p>I asked the other members of the Shadow Guards.</p>
        <p>If they had intervened while I was fighting Leader, I might have died.</p>
        <p>"...It was Leader's request. If we joined, deputy-leader would start using hidden weapons and poison, so he
            asked us to let him have a pure martial duel."</p>
        <p>"...You still call me deputy-leader"</p>
        <p>"Once a superior, always a superior. Once loyalty is given, it is forever."</p>
        <p>"Yes, you too remain loyal to the current Imperial family."</p>
        <p>I gave a sad smile to my former subordinates.</p>
        <p>"I am sorry."</p>
        <p>I might have to kill you today.</p>
        <p>Papabat!</p>
        <p>As soon as I finished speaking, all members of the Shadow Guard drew their weapons and charged at me.</p>
        <p>Chak!</p>
        <p>First, I scattered poison and drew out hidden weapons.</p>
        <p>Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique.</p>
        <p>Double Killing Snake.</p>
        <p>Pying, Pying!</p>
        <p>I threw two hidden weapons, each coated with a different poison, at the Shadow Guards.</p>
        <p>All eleven Shadow Guards avoided the poisoned hidden weapons with minimal movements.</p>
        <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
        <p>Landscape Painting.</p>
        <p>Entering Mountain.</p>
        <p>Flowing Ridge.</p>
        <p>Deep Mountain.</p>
        <p>After wielding my sword in the Landscape Painting style, I shifted to a low stance, aiming for balance, and
            made a serpentine thrust for control.</p>
        <p>I then lunged in for the attack.</p>
        <p>"Hah!"</p>
        <p>However, the Shadow Guards quickly dodged and each wielded their weapons against me.</p>
        <p>Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique.</p>
        <p>Triple-Headed Snake.</p>
        <p>Shuk!</p>
        <p>I fitted three hidden weapons on my left hand and swung them like a whip at the closest guard.</p>
        <p>After swinging three times to create distance, I coated the hidden weapons with poison and fired them in
            succession.</p>
        <p>Pying, Pying, Pying!</p>
        <p>While the three Shadow Guards who were charging at me dodged the hidden weapons, others leaped over them,
            swinging their weapons.</p>
        <p>Sword, blade, curved sword, chain sword, dagger.</p>
        <p>Different weapons rushed towards me.</p>
        <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
        <p>Strange Stone.</p>
        <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>
        <p>I spun my body, wielding my sword in an all-encompassing defensive and offensive posture.</p>
        <p>At the same time, I took out poison powder from my pocket and spread it around.</p>
        <p>Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique.</p>
        <p>Illusionary Snake Mist.</p>
        <p>Amongst the poison powder, I sent other poisoned hidden weapons targeting the Shadow Guards.</p>
        <p>Taking advantage of their moment of distraction to dodge the hidden weapons.</p>
        <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
        <p>Entering Mountain.</p>
        <p>I shifted to a low stance to aim for balance.</p>
        <p>"Ugh!"</p>
        <p>"Damn, to be at the same level as a mid peak master..."</p>
        <p>"Truly the skills of deputy-leader."</p>
        <p>Crack.</p>
        <p>I took out and chewed an antidote pill while gripping my sword tightly enough to break my hand.</p>
        <p>Ignoring the pain that felt as if my hand would break I spoke.</p>
        <p>"Don't open your mouth. Use your energy sensing technique if you want to live. The poison powder I just
            spread doesn't poison through the skin."</p>
        <p>Quickly applying paralysis powder to a cloth, I covered the sword blade and prepared another move.</p>
        <p>'It's not a sword technique, but a saber technique.'</p>
        <p>But since they share the same root, they can be used similarly.</p>
        <p>Severing Vein Saber Method.</p>
        <p>Mountain Wind.</p>
        <p>Five Consecutive Strikes.</p>
        <p>Pying!</p>
        <p>A series of thrusts at a terrifying speed, too fast to react, cut through the air five times.</p>
        <p>"Guk, gurk..."</p>
        <p>Five members of the Secret Guards collapsed after being hit by my sword coated with paralysis powder.</p>
        <p>'Six left.'</p>
        <p>As I faced the six Shadow Guards charging at me, I grasped another hidden weapon.</p>
        <p>Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique.</p>
        <p>Red Snake.</p>
        <p>I threw three hidden weapons at the approaching soldier wielding dual swords, each timed differently.</p>
        <p>The first targeted his forehead,</p>
        <p>The second, immediately following, aimed at his ankle.</p>
        <p>The third, following that, targeted his lower abdomen.</p>
        <p>The trajectory of these hidden weapons was akin to a red snake.</p>
        <p>Ting!</p>
        <p>His dual swords deflected two hidden weapons, but he couldn't deflect the third.</p>
        <p>I swiftly charged in, using Transcending Peaks Steps and employing Transcending Peaks.</p>
        <p>Chak!</p>
        <p>With the front of the Shadow Guards chest slightly cut, he soon collapsed from paralysis.</p>
        <p>"Are you going to keep coming at me?"</p>
        <p>I asked the remaining members.</p>
        <p>"Truly the skills of deputy-leader."</p>
        <p>"Truly a seasoned veteran."</p>
        <p>"The difference in skills coming from that vast combat experience is simply insurmountable..."</p>
        <p>They smiled at me, each holding a spear, moon blade, dual heavy swords, staff, and sword.</p>
        <p>"If all cultivators are the same anyway, let's at least be good to the one we're currently loyal to," they
            said, agreeing with Leader’s view.</p>
        <p>I smiled bitterly.</p>
        <p>"That's right."</p>
        <p>Even if the Jin Clan regains control of the Imperial family, the situation for mortals like us might not
            change.</p>
        <p>But still, just maybe, it could be a little better.</p>
        <p>With that slim hope, I pushed on with my actions.</p>
        <p>"Come at me, all of you."</p>
        <p>A staff swung at me.</p>
        <p>A spear pierced towards me.</p>
        <p>A moon blade swung from the opposite side of the staff.</p>
        <p>The guy wielding the dual broadswords swings his swords from the opposite side of the spear.</p>
        <p>The guy with the sword leaps up as if flying and strikes down at me.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, countless thread trajectories target me.</p>
        <p>Red and blue lines draw numerous orbits around me.</p>
        <p>It felt like my brain was going to burn.</p>
        <p>How can I escape this crisis?</p>
        <p>How can I!</p>
        <p>Just then, amidst those numerous trajectories, I suddenly saw 'a third color.'</p>
        <p>Puk!</p>
        <p>The spear grazed my waist.</p>
        <p>The energy on the spear tore the flesh from my waist.</p>
        <p>Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique.</p>
        <p>Triple-Headed Snake.</p>
        <p>Pying!</p>
        <p>I put three hidden weapons on my fingers, each coated with paralysis poison, and threw one at the Shadow
            Guard who swung the spear.</p>
        <p>My hidden weapon easily penetrated his trajectory and hit his shoulder.</p>
        <p>The staff spins targeting my head.</p>
        <p>I threw a hidden weapon to alter the trajectory of the staff, and then threw the last hidden weapon at the
            guy who threw the staff.</p>
        <p>Again, my hidden weapon easily penetrated his trajectory and embedded in his thigh.</p>
        <p>Two of the guards became incapacitated.</p>
        <p>Three left.</p>
        <p>I see something.</p>
        <p>Between their threads and mine.</p>
        <p>A third color, neither red nor blue.</p>
        <p>Shuk!</p>
        <p>The dual broadswords swing from right to left below.</p>
        <p>I bent my waist to dodge the broadsword.</p>
        <p>But a long cut appeared from my forehead to my left jaw from the sword energy on the broadsword.</p>
        <p>The moon blade targets my waist.</p>
        <p>If I dodge upwards, I’ll become a target for the guy striking from above, and if I dodge downwards, I’ll be
            cut by the dual broadswords preparing their next move.</p>
        <p>But amidst the red and blue threads,</p>
        <p>In this life-or-death fight, my focus was on the emerging third color.</p>
        <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship,</p>
        <p>Secluded Valley.</p>
        <p>Heavenly Lake.</p>
        <p>Using the Secluded Valley I twisted and deflected the trajectory of the guy striking down with the sword, and
            with Heavenly Lake, I momentarily stopped the action of the guy swinging the moon blade.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the dual broadswords wielder who had completed his next move swung his broadswords at me
            again.</p>
        <p>In an instant, I threw hidden weapons coated with paralysis poison at the arms and legs of the Shadow Guards
            with the moon blade and sword.</p>
        <p>Then, I swiftly extended my sword toward the dual broadswords soldier.</p>
        <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
        <p>Echoing Valley!</p>
        <p>Between the blue and red.</p>
        <p>The color that appeared was purple.</p>
        <p>The Shadow Guards' and my thread.</p>
        <p>That purple color, whose origin was indiscernible, showed me a new path between him and me.</p>
        <p>I followed this new path, countering the dual broadswords soldier's move with Echoing Valley.</p>
        <p>Kaang!</p>
        <p>My sword cleanly sliced through his dual broadswords.</p>
        <p>As his weapon was severed, the gaurd seemed about to draw a dagger and charge, but I was faster in throwing
            my hidden weapon.</p>
        <p>“Ke, keuk… It was that movement. As if I was facing Leader.”</p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>"…You could have killed all of us. It would have been much easier and painless. Why did you choose such a
            difficult path? Even if you didn't kill us, it would have been easier to subdue us if you were prepared to
            sever an arm or leg!"</p>
        <p>I briefly replied to the fallen dual broadswords soldier.</p>
        <p>"You called me deputy-leader</p>
        <p>"…Keuk. You are an interesting person."</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>"That movement just now. It looked similar to Leader’s. An attack that suddenly breaks through the
            trajectories… I didn't see a red line, but suddenly the ability to penetrate the trajectory… Did you gain a
            new perspective? Have you… reached Three Flowers Gather at the Summit?"</p>
        <p>I shook my head bitterly at the question.</p>
        <p>"No. I am sorry, but I haven’t reached that realm."</p>
        <p>"Then…"</p>
        <p>"I’m getting a sense of it. Slowly entering that realm."</p>
        <p>The third color.</p>
        <p>The purple thread was sometimes visible, sometimes not.</p>
        <p>It didn't appear consistently.</p>
        <p>So, to see purple consistently,</p>
        <p>I would need to continue fighting life-or-death battles.</p>
        <p>Just then.</p>
        <p>Someone approached me.</p>
        <p>Someone familiar to me.</p>
        <p>From my time in the Shadow Guards, someone I had guarded a few times and my job more difficult.</p>
        <p>The Crown Prince.</p>
        <p>Makli Hyun.</p>
        <p>"It's amazing. Deputy-leader’s skills are to this extent. There was a reason why my father sent me."</p>
        <p>"It's been a while, Your Highness. If you've been watching since earlier, why didn't you intervene?"</p>
        <p>"Why intervene? It wouldn't be fun if I did. And don't call me 'Your Highness.' Today, I'm here representing
            a branch of the Makli Clan, not as a member of the Imperial family."</p>
        <p>"Fun… You realize the entire Shadow Guards could have died at my hands. Is that fun for you, Your Highness?"
        </p>
        <p>"Don't call me 'Your Highness'… Well, since you keep calling me that, I'll tell you something. Do you know
            why I became the Crown Prince?"</p>
        <p>The Crown Prince began to expand his domain.</p>
        <p>His red threads started to engulf the surrounding space.</p>
        <p>"I reached the same Qi Refining 4th Star as my father at a young age! Regardless of Three Flowers Gather at
            the Summit or whatever, they can barely compete against Qi Refining 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Star. Do you think
            you, who is not even in the Three Flowers Gather at the Summit, can defeat me?"</p>
        <p>"…I'll ask again. Do you find this fun?"</p>
        <p>"Tch, it's not fun. Enough talk, come at me."</p>
        <p>As always, that annoying guy who used to bother the Shadow Guards when I was guarding the Emperor.</p>
        <p>He always questioned our necessity while speaking arrogantly.</p>
        <p>But he had the right to be arrogant.</p>
        <p>Because he was strong.</p>
        <p>So strong that not even a group of peak martial artists could stand against him.</p>
        <p>Even ordinary Three Flowers Gather at the Summit masters would have to risk their lives against him.</p>
        <p>However, I hadn't entered Three Flowers, just barely stepping into its boundary.</p>
        <p>Fighting against him would surely lead to my death.</p>
        <p>But why?</p>
        <p>I can feel a smile forming on my lips.</p>
        <p>'Ah, yes.'</p>
        <p>Because it's okay even if I die.</p>
        <p>I've grasped the clue to enlightenment, so what does it matter if I die the next moment!</p>
        <p>"…Take care, all members of the Shadow Guards. I am now… going to die."</p>
        <p>I attained the Way in the morning.</p>
        <p>So, it's fine if I die in the evening.</p>
        <p>To embody this enlightenment.</p>
        <p>I am going to die today.</p>
        <p>I ran towards the Emperor's son, the Crown Prince, with my sword in hand.</p>
        <p>Seeing the faint purple thread, I felt like I could do something I never dared to attempt even after several
            regressions.</p>
        <p>I swung my sword.</p>
        <p>The martial art that had always been in my head, but I could never understand.</p>
        <p>Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts!</p>
        <p>As I entered the red divine consciousness of the Crown Prince, I used the martial art I had long longed for.
        </p>
        <p>"Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts."</p>
        <p>The next moment, Seo Eun-hyun's form disappeared like a phantom.</p>

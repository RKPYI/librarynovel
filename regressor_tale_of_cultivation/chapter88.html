      <p>Chapter 88: Living Flower (1)</p>
      <p>-Gang Sphere is in fact one.</p>
      <p>-Martial arts and I are one entity.</p>
      <p>That is the first phrase in the writings left by Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>It’s a riddle-like statement.</p>
      <p>
        But instead of forcibly interpreting it, I accept the sentence as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        For martial artists of our realm, explaining in detail will only ruin
        its implied meaning.
      </p>
      <p>'Gang Sphere is in fact one…'</p>
      <p>I display nine Gang Spheres around me.</p>
      <p>
        Are these Gang Spheres, which appear to be nine, actually one in
        essence?
      </p>
      <p>After all, they all originate from me.</p>
      <p>They are one within the framework of myself.</p>
      <p>Whooosh―</p>
      <p>
        The Gang Spheres begin to change, melting into the air and transforming
        into Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        'However, realizing that the Gang Spheres are one within me is no
        different from the enlightenment of the Formless Sword. Do I need a
        different kind of enlightenment?'
      </p>
      <p>Martial arts and I are one entity.</p>
      <p>“Hmm…”</p>
      <p>I grasp the Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        The phrase 'Martial arts and I are one entity' is also difficult to
        comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword and I are already essentially the same existence.
      </p>
      <p>An actual avatar!</p>
      <p>
        Already being one, what more can be done to become even more unified?
      </p>
      <p>I continue to ponder while holding the Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>“...I don’t know.”</p>
      <p>Let's find out slowly.</p>
      <p>There is plenty of time.</p>
      <p>I continue to read the writings left by Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        If the first phrase is about martial arts, the rest are just letters of
        well-being sent to me.
      </p>
      <p>Eat well and live well.</p>
      <p>
        Take it easy sometimes, don’t live life too harshly, and try to woo a
        lady friend.
      </p>
      <p>Try to live a bit more amusingly.</p>
      <p>Etc.</p>
      <p>―You boring guy.</p>
      <p>It’s as if Kim Young-hoon is speaking right in front of me.</p>
      <p>
        ―I intentionally wrote the martial arts secrets confusingly so that you,
        with your stupid head, would dive into it and live more leisurely.
      </p>
      <p>―There’s a way of life where you grind every moment like you, but.</p>
      <p>
        ―How could that be the only way to live? Life is joy, so try living by
        doing what makes you happy.
      </p>
      <p>“...He’s nagging.”</p>
      <p>
        ―And that porridge you made, it was terribly tasteless. Practice cooking
        a bit. You dull guy. I’m off.
      </p>
      <p>“Hahaha…”</p>
      <p>―Eat well and live well.</p>
      <p>The end of the writing.</p>
      <p>That is the end.</p>
      <p>There’s no farewells like 'I’m leaving' or 'Take care'.</p>
      <p>As if we can meet again someday, giving me hope.</p>
      <p>“...I’ll endure.”</p>
      <p>No matter how long the remaining time is.</p>
      <p>With the hint you gave.</p>
      <p>I look at the spatial rift, nod my head, and then turn around.</p>
      <p>I, too, do not say goodbye.</p>
      <p>
        After imprinting the location and shape of the footprints left by Kim
        Young-hoon in my mind,
      </p>
      <p>I emerge from the vicinity of the Ascension Gate.</p>
      <p>From that day on.</p>
      <p>
        I settle in Ascension Path, forgetting to eat and sleep, and begin
        training.
      </p>
      <p>Yin Soul Ghost Incantation and Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea.</p>
      <p>
        Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea is a Wood attribute Dao of Combat method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Soul Ghost Incantation is a method applying the Five Elements to the
        Eight Trigrams, a method applying the Earth attribute to the ☷ of the
        Eight Trigrams.
      </p>
      <p>
        ☷ is interpreted as Yin, so it’s a method of accumulating spiritual
        power based on the Earth attribute to cultivate Yin (陰) spiritual
        power.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Wood and Earth have the relationship of Wood overcoming Earth. They are
        mutually antagonistic relationships. But...’
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of mutual generation and overcoming does not only consist of
        generating and overcoming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The roots of a tree dig into the earth below, disrupting the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at the same time, the roots of the tree grasp the ground, making it
        even more solid.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you pour water onto fire, the fire goes out, but the fire can also
        burn more fiercely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Metal melts when it meets fire, but fire is needed to refine the metal
        to be even more solid and detailed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, the relationship of overcoming (剋) also means control (制御).
      </p>
      <p>Earth controls Water,</p>
      <p>Water controls Fire,</p>
      <p>Fire controls Metal,</p>
      <p>Metal controls Wood,</p>
      <p>Wood controls Earth.</p>
      <p>
        Mutual overcoming means that even though they may not strengthen each
        other's energy, it is possible to intricately manipulate and control one
        energy with another.
      </p>
      <p>Whooosh…</p>
      <p>
        I generate spiritual power using the Yin energy of Yin Soul Ghost
        Incantation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dark curses rise around me, enter through my nose and mouth, and are
        absorbed as spiritual power into the Spiritual Energy Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next to the Horn Spiritual Energy Star, a new Neck Spiritual Energy Star
        begins to form from the power of the curse.
      </p>
      <p>
        I watch this birth and then move from practicing Yin Soul Ghost
        Incantation to Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Green spiritual power gathers, mixing with the power created by the
        curse.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power of Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea, following the effects of
        mutual generation and overcoming, subdues the energy of Yin Soul Ghost
        Incantation, controlling the Yin energy of Yin Soul Ghost Incantation
        from spreading recklessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I alternate between practicing Yin Soul Ghost Incantation and Thousand
        Lustrous Forest Sea, half-opening my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>'This is... Yin Soul Ghost Incantation... Definitely.'</p>
      <p>It seems to be a method that suits me very well.</p>
      <p>A method of contemplating pain, is it not?</p>
      <p>A method that creates curses based on my own pain?</p>
      <p>Murmuring...</p>
      <p>
        As I recite the mantra, the power of Yin Soul Ghost Incantation gathers,
        forming a curse.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh—</p>
      <p>
        Even though I only formed one curse, the temperature around me drops,
        and my whole body tingles.
      </p>
      <p>But this tingling sensation is quite familiar to me.</p>
      <p>
        It’s my usual feelings of despair and pain towards myself, and my anger
        and misery towards this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Soul Ghost Incantation is a method that forces the opponent to fight
        within the same pain as mine.
      </p>
      <p>'Ha, the battle will be decided by who is more accustomed to pain.'</p>
      <p>
        Although it is mainly used as an auxiliary method in devilish arts, I
        wonder how many can actually master it.
      </p>
      <p>'To feel pain every time you use a curse.'</p>
      <p>
        Of course, if you master the entire latter part of Yin Soul Ghost
        Incantation, you can transfer more than 90% of your pain to a
        pre-designated target through the curse.
      </p>
      <p>
        But to master it to that extent, you must become accustomed to pain, and
        even if you can transfer the pain, you still have to feel the 10%..
      </p>
      <p>'What a ridiculous method.'</p>
      <p>
        I chuckle bitterly and convert the curse back into spiritual power to
        absorb it again.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s the worst method that a normal person will never learn, but for me,
        it’s the best.
      </p>
      <p>Whooosh—</p>
      <p>'Is it right for spiritual power to accumulate this fast?'</p>
      <p>
        I originally accumulated spiritual power at a rate comparable to a
        cultivator with the Hidden Consciousness Technique with Mixed Spiritual
        Roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, with Yin Soul Ghost Incantation, the spiritual power is
        accumulating at a speed comparable to someone with True Spiritual Roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I pave the way with Yin Soul Ghost Incantation, and then
        consolidate the roots with the power of Thousand Lustrous Forest Sea,
        controlling the Yin energy.
      </p>
      <p>'At this speed...'</p>
      <p>
        Maybe I can complete the 1st Constellation of Qi Building in this
        lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>I solidify the earth with the pain I have accumulated so far.</p>
      <p>
        I sow seeds and sprout with the method taught by my master who believed
        in me.
      </p>
      <p>A forest is gradually growing in the field of my heart.</p>
      <p>"...How many years has it been?"</p>
      <p>
        I’m startled as I practice Yin Soul Ghost Incantation, Thousand Lustrous
        Forest Sea, and Formless Sword in Ascension Path.
      </p>
      <p>Time has flown by so quickly.</p>
      <p>[Senior, can you hear me, can you hear me?]</p>
      <p>The communication device Seo Ran gave me is ringing.</p>
      <p>
        [Senior, I don't know where you are. I contacted you to let you know
        that I have found a way to break the weakest part of the barrier outside
        Serving Command Palace.]
      </p>
      <p>It’s almost time for Seo Ran's promise to break the prohibition.</p>
      <p>
        [If you come, we can enter Serving Command Palace. If you join me with
        the Nether Crossing Ship on the outer edge of space, we can enter
        Serving Command Palace and take the Longevity Fruit. I will wait for
        your response.]
      </p>
      <p>"...Longevity Fruit."</p>
      <p>I chuckle to myself.</p>
      <p>"I don't need such things anymore."</p>
      <p>I look at the void for a moment, then smile and stand up.</p>
      <p>Right.</p>
      <p>
        Even though I don't need it now, it wouldn't be bad to know the method
        to break the barrier and the location of the Longevity Fruit.
      </p>
      <p>It will all be a foundation for the future.</p>
      <p>I leave Ascension Path and jump down below.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        As I scatter Formless Sword, the Nether Crossing Ship buried in the sand
        reveals itself.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble rumble!</p>
      <p>
        As a result of practicing Yin Soul Ghost Incantation and Thousand
        Lustrous Forest Sea, three Spiritual Energy Stars are twinkling in my
        dantian now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Spiritual Energy Stars of Horn, Neck, and Root are twinkling,
        emitting Pure Spiritual Force.
      </p>
      <p>
        The output and duration of use of Formless Sword has significantly
        increased.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>The sand is completely dug up.</p>
      <p>
        I swing the Formless Sword rapidly in all directions, but have to click
        my tongue in frustration.
      </p>
      <p>"Tch."</p>
      <p>
        What good is such strong power if there is no one to share a fight with?
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if I find out the method to obtain the Longevity Fruit in this life
        and pass it to the Kim Young-hoon in the next life.
      </p>
      <p>He is, in fact, a completely different person.</p>
      <p>
        The Kim Young-hoon who trained with me in this life, watched me obtain
        the Formless Sword, enlightened me.
      </p>
      <p>
        He who obtained enlightenment before me and left for the beyond,
        preventing me from being by his deathbed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon of the next life will be essentially a different being.
      </p>
      <p>Actually, that's the case with everyone..</p>
      <p>Doesn’t Kim Young-hoon miss his family?</p>
      <p>I long and yearn for a life that would not cease.</p>
      <p>I feel lonely.</p>
      <p>
        In the middle of the desert, I activate the Nether Crossing Ship,
        turning the steering wheel towards the coordinates sent by Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>There’s almost no energy left in the Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>It will fall apart after one or two more voyages.</p>
      <p>Rumble rumble!</p>
      <p>The Nether Crossing Ship moves.</p>
      <p>'But, lonely as it may be, I cannot stop.'</p>
      <p>Life may be painful, but someday, surely.</p>
      <p>
        If I can escape from all these attractions of fate, I will find a life
        that is truly not negated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Longevity Fruit I find in this life may be meaningless, but it will
        be significant from the next life onwards.
      </p>
      <p>Nothing is in vain.</p>
      <p>I muse this thought as I head towards Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>"Senior, happy news. We can now find the Longevity Fruit!"</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran holds a scroll with strange magical symbols engraved on it, his
        expression excited.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I contacted my friends, even invited a human cultivator who is an array
        master, and barely completed it. It's the barrier-breaking scroll of
        Serving Command Palace!"
      </p>
      <p>"Is that so?"</p>
      <p>"Now, if we find the Longevity Fruit..."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, who is talking excitedly, lowers his voice as he senses the
        atmosphere emanating from me.
      </p>
      <p>"Senior."</p>
      <p>"What is it?"</p>
      <p>"Your friend, the other senior..."</p>
      <p>I smile at Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>What happened to Kim Young-hoon?</p>
      <p>"He ascended."</p>
      <p>Yes, that must have been the case.</p>
      <p>Becoming an immortal, he must be waiting for me in the far heavens.</p>
      <p>Seo Ran lets out a low sigh.</p>
      <p>"I should have broken the barrier sooner. It's my fault."</p>
      <p>
        "No. Daoist Seo need not worry. He surely... must have really ascended."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>We observe a moment of silence.</p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, there must be something to gain by entering Serving Command
        Palace, so let's give it a try."
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p>
      <p>
        I board the Nether Crossing Ship and take the helm towards the
        coordinates shown by Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>Now, it’s time to enter this place called Serving Command Palace.</p>
      <p>Rumble rumble!</p>
      <p>The Nether Crossing Ship leaps through space.</p>
      <p>
        In the pitch-black darkness, we arrive at the outskirts of space and
        reached the Serving Command Palace floating there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Serving Command Palace still floats on the edge of space, unchanged in
        its appearance.
      </p>
      <p>"Senior, I'll break the barrier."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran flows next to the jade-colored gate of Serving Command Palace,
        takes out the scroll he brought, and holds it up.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        A strange light emanates from the scroll, meeting the Serving Command
        Palace's prohibition.
      </p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>
        Numerous magical symbols flow from the barrier, resisting the light from
        the scroll.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the light from the scroll intertwines, pouring out magical
        symbols identical to those on the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>
        The magical symbols of the barrier are neutralized by those from the
        scroll, and a crack starts appearing in one corner of the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The barrier has cracked, Senior! Please break through that spot with
        your strength!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I raise the Formless Sword and break through the outer wall of Serving
        Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>Seo Ran follows me in, and I look around the interior of the wall.</p>
      <p>'The inside is overwhelmingly larger than the outside.'</p>
      <p>It looks like space is massively compressed.</p>
      <p>Numerous corridors and buildings stretch out.</p>
      <p>"Wow, it's incredible."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran enters and looks around.</p>
      <p>Creak...</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, when I turn around, spiritual energy gathers at the broken
        outer wall, starting to automatically repair it.
      </p>
      <p>It seems to have an automatic repair function as well.</p>
      <p>"Will there be no problem getting out?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, I brought one more barrier-breaking scroll."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran takes out another scroll.</p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        I look at the scroll, memorizing the formation and magical symbols
        engraved on it for use in the next life.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Based on the information given by an elder of the Sea Dragon Tribe who
        visited Serving Command Palace before, I'll guide you to the arboretum
        where the Longevity Fruit is said to be,"
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran says, pulling out an old map from his pocket.</p>
      <p>The map looks decades old, fragile and worn.</p>
      <p>
        I silently follow Seo Ran, observing various corridors of Serving
        Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>And then, I sense something odd.</p>
      <p>'It's like...'</p>
      <p>
        It feels like the first time I entered the abandoned Nether Crossing
        Ship.
      </p>
      <p>It’s quiet.</p>
      <p>And many of the structures are somehow all destroyed.</p>
      <p>"...Daoist Seo."</p>
      <p>"Yes, Senior?"</p>
      <p>"Doesn't something seem strange?"</p>
      <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
      <p>I point at a collapsed hall with a giant slash mark engraved on it.</p>
      <p>
        "Were the structures inside Serving Command Palace always built like
        this?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ah..."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran looks confused and awkwardly scratches his head.</p>
      <p>"Actually, I've only heard about it and never entered before..."</p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>I frown.</p>
      <p>It’s an odd feeling.</p>
      <p>
        And this strange feeling grows as we pass a pile of debris in the
        corridor.
      </p>
      <p>'Mad Lord’s... puppets?'</p>
      <p>
        The debris have the same engravings as those I had seen inside the
        Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only the debris of Mad Lord’s puppets, but other remains are also
        visible.
      </p>
      <p>Stone statues with the same energy as Serving Command Palace.</p>
      <p>"This is..."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran, too, feels uneasy and frowns.</p>
      <p>
        "Daoist Seo. Think about it, wasn't it too easy to get here? For a relic
        of this size, there should be some kind of guardians protecting it..."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes. Everything... is completely destroyed."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran’s face darkens.</p>
      <p>
        "Not just the traces of the Mad Lord. The slash marks we saw earlier,
        the places that have lingering evil energy, areas that are completely
        shattered, and those torn apart roughly."
      </p>
      <p>I look at him and voice the most ominous theory I can think of.</p>
      <p>
        "If Serving Command Palace is floating inside a spatial rift and appears
        once every few centuries, could it be possible that before the Ascension
        Gate opened, the Heavenly Being cultivators raided and looted all the
        treasures inside Serving Command Palace?"
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran’s face contorts.</p>
      <p>"That can't be..."</p>
      <p>
        Could it be that the wretched ghost gave such false information on
        purpose?
      </p>
      <p>'No, that can't be.'</p>
      <p>The last heart essence of Song Jin truly wanted to help Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        'Maybe, Serving Command Palace appeared after Song Jin's death.
        Afterwards, the Heavenly Being cultivators raided everything without his
        knowledge,, so he gave Seo Ran the coordinates not knowing it’s
        empty...'
      </p>
      <p>"Let's go to the arboretum for now."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran suggests stiffly, forcing a smile.</p>
      <p>
        "Who knows. Maybe there’s still some useful spiritual plants left in the
        arboretum..."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>With a heavy heart, I follow Seo Ran to the arboretum.</p>
      <p>Upon arriving at Serving Command Palace's arboretum, I sigh softly.</p>
      <p>'Curse those Heavenly Being cultivators.'</p>
      <p>
        The arboretum is dug up in several places, and the remaining trees are
        bare, their fruits plucked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran looks stunned as he leads to where the Longevity Fruit should
        be.
      </p>
      <p>The Longevity Tree.</p>
      <p>There are no fruits on the Longevity Tree.</p>
      <p>Instead, several branches are even cut off.</p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Being cultivators have thoroughly looted Serving Command
        Palace.
      </p>
      <p>"Damn it."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran curses bitterly.</p>
      <p>I, too, sigh deeply.</p>
      <p>'In the next life, will Kim Young-hoon’s lifespan...'</p>
      <p>Is there no answer?</p>
      <p>
        I wander around the arboretum with a heavy heart, looking up at the
        ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>Desolate.</p>
      <p>
        Although the dragon vein flowing through the arboretum is substantial,
        the spiritual plants and trees that absorb its energy and grow are
        plucked and cut.
      </p>
      <p>"Tch."</p>
      <p>
        Is Kim Young-hoon fated to never escape the constraints of lifespan?
      </p>
      <p>Even after several lifetimes, his limitations...</p>
      <p>As I walk through the arboretum.</p>
      <p>"Huh?"</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, among the trees stripped of their fruits and cut branches.
      </p>
      <p>I find a tree emitting a unique spiritual aura.</p>
      <p>"That is..."</p>
      <p>It’s the same species as the Longevity Tree I saw earlier.</p>
      <p>
        The difference is that this tree looks younger, much smaller in size.
      </p>
      <p>"!"</p>
      <p>But what catches my eye is not that.</p>
      <p>"Wait, wait... Daoist Seo! Come here..."</p>
      <p>I hurriedly run towards the young Longevity Tree.</p>
      <p>On the young Longevity Tree, a few flowers are blooming.</p>
      <p>
        And beneath one of the flower buds, something is swelling up, resembling
        something like a fruit.
      </p>
      <p>"Daoist Seo!"</p>

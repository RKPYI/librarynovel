      <p>Chapter 132: Mad Lord's Grasp (2)</p>
      <p>I bite my lip.</p>
      <p>'First, the Mad Lord ascends in a few days.'</p>
      <p>
        That means, if I can escape his grasp for just a few days, I can
        survive.
      </p>
      <p>Boooom!</p>
      <p>Kuaaang!</p>
      <p>
        As the wasp-winged puppet opens its mouth, a massive explosion occurs,
        creating a mushroom cloud in the desert.
      </p>
      <p>'I’m not sure if I can last even a few days…'</p>
      <p>
        In fact, in the case of the Mad Lord’s puppets, they can be quickly
        neutralized by severing their circuits with the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I refrain from rashly doing so, wary of arousing further
        interest from the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Even if he isn't interested, if he gets enraged about his creation
        being damaged and starts chasing me personally…'
      </p>
      <p>That alone is a terrifying prospect.</p>
      <p>Buzz Buzz Buzz!</p>
      <p>
        I dodge the puppets' attacks, flying over the Heaven-Treading Desert day
        and night for three days.
      </p>
      <p>The puppets are indeed troublesome.</p>
      <p>They don't tire.</p>
      <p>Although I have some confidence in my stamina,</p>
      <p>It’s not enough right now.</p>
      <p>
        'It hasn’t been long since I underwent complete transformation. I didn’t
        have time to train, nor have I reached the Qi Building stage to fortify
        my endurance.'
      </p>
      <p>I grit my teeth.</p>
      <p>'I hope the Mad Lord leaves as soon as possible…'</p>
      <p>And then, seven more days pass.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The number of Mad Lord’s puppets chasing me has doubled.</p>
      <p>I grit my teeth even harder.</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord is still pursuing me, even past the original time he’d
        ascend.
      </p>
      <p>'Damn, this won’t work.'</p>
      <p>I need a way to completely shake him off.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Before I knew it, I had left the Heaven-Treading Desert, passed small
        tribes beneath the desert, and finally arrived at the Black Wind Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, I begin to see puppets in the shape of fish chasing me from
        the sea.
      </p>
      <p>'Right, I feel sorry for Song Jin but...'</p>
      <p>I think to myself as I face the wind of the Black Wind Sea.</p>
      <p>'I need to borrow the Nether Crossing Ship for a while.'</p>
      <p>
        If it’s the Mad Lord, Song Jin will understand given the circumstances,
        right?
      </p>
      <p>
        I fly towards the sea area where the Nether Crossing Ship is hidden.
      </p>
      <p>Just like that, another three days pass.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Dodging the bombardment from the swarm of puppets behind me, I twist my
        body and force my way through with the Formless Sword, heading towards
        the location where the Nether Crossing Ship is sealed.
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>
        The puppets, that have been silently chasing me for days, suddenly echo
        the Mad Lord’s voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmm. Unfortunately in twenty days, the Ascension Gate will completely
        close. It's about time for me to pursue other matters, so I shall
        leave.]
      </p>
      <p>'Finally…!'</p>
      <p>
        Finally, it seems the Mad Lord is giving up on me and preparing for
        ascension.
      </p>
      <p>But his next words are beyond my imagination.</p>
      <p>
        [However, she said your story is too touching, and she really wants you
        to join us. Therefore…]
      </p>
      <p>Kiiik Kikikiik Kiiiiiik</p>
      <p>Suddenly, far away.</p>
      <p>The sky is tearing open.</p>
      <p>
        [She and I have decided to work together to capture you. We will
        definitely, definitely invite you!]
      </p>
      <p>Click!</p>
      <p>And what appears through the crack.</p>
      <p>Is a white, human-like finger.</p>
      <p>Just a finger!</p>
      <p>Kuuuuung!</p>
      <p>
        As the finger moves, the sea splits, and the earth seems to flip upside
        down.
      </p>
      <p>“…!”</p>
      <p>The clouds in the sky split, and the winds of the sea stills.</p>
      <p>'What is this…'</p>
      <p>[She is wanting for you. Come here at once.]</p>
      <p>I realize the identity of that finger.</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord's [Her]!</p>
      <p>Zap Zap….</p>
      <p>
        'The main energy source of the Nether Crossing Ship, implanted inside a
        puppet, the Mad Lord's greatest creation…!'
      </p>
      <p>Whirrrr!</p>
      <p>
        Starting with [Her] finger, a slender white hand gradually crosses over
        through the crack.
      </p>
      <p>Shiver!</p>
      <p>'This is madness, this won’t do.'</p>
      <p>From that one hand.</p>
      <p>
        From just the palm, am I feeling the same pressure as I did from Song
        Jin?
      </p>
      <p>I realize now.</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord's [Her] is no ordinary Heavenly Being puppet.</p>
      <p>
        Even though I’m just a beginner in the Core Formation Realm with limited
        insight,
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with my ignorance, the intuition developed over 900 years of life
        is not to be underestimated.
      </p>
      <p>[She] is probably…</p>
      <p>'A Four-Axis puppet!'</p>
      <p>The prowess of the Mad Lord sends chills down my spine.</p>
      <p>
        Can this monster, from whose palm I feel the same pressure as Song Jin,
        be anything but a Four-Axis puppet?
      </p>
      <p>I made up my mind.</p>
      <p>'Fleeing this insane genius for up to 20 days?'</p>
      <p>Impossible.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Through the spatial rift, not just [Her] slender hand but hordes of
        puppets begin to cross over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I know it, the sky over the sea is filled with the Mad Lord’s
        puppets, creating an illusion that the spatial rift is pouring them out.
      </p>
      <p>I grit my teeth.</p>
      <p>I made a mistake.</p>
      <p>
        I shouldn't have told the Mad Lord and Her my story, trying to gain
        their sympathy.
      </p>
      <p>What should I do now?</p>
      <p>I ponder for a moment, then open my eyes.</p>
      <p>'This life will probably be the shortest.’'</p>
      <p>
        I imagine being captured by the Mad Lord, trapped in a body unable to
        die or decay for thousands of years, turned into a living puppet.
      </p>
      <p>Even with an extraordinary mental state, I can't bear such madness.</p>
      <p>'I should commit suicide.'</p>
      <p>
        The thought of abandoning this precious life is excruciating, but the
        conversation with Yuan Li helped me solidify my understanding of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life is not a blessing in itself. It becomes a blessing when hearts are
        given and received within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following this belief, since I haven’t formed significant connections or
        shared hearts with anyone yet, I can forsake this life.
      </p>
      <p>I steel my resolve.</p>
      <p>'I will die.'</p>
      <p>Dying is far simpler than figuring out how to live.</p>
      <p>There are countless ways to die immediately.</p>
      <p>It’s when I’m about to blow up my head to end this cycle.</p>
      <p>‘...Wait.’</p>
      <p>
        I suddenly remember the Colorless Glass Sword sleeping in my Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>'What happens to this Colorless Glass Sword if I die now?'</p>
      <p>
        Will it follow me in regression even if I die again, since it recognized
        me as its owner?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, since it didn't connect with the White-Red Wine in this timeline,
        will it just remain and disappear here if I die?
      </p>
      <p>Jolt!</p>
      <p>A worst-case scenario flashes through my mind.</p>
      <p>‘That can never happen.’</p>
      <p>Suicide is easy.</p>
      <p>But I can’t just kill myself right now.</p>
      <p>‘I need to consume White-Red Wine first!’</p>
      <p>Yes, at least I should drink White-Red Wine before dying!</p>
      <p>
        I frantically dodge the puppets' attacks and fly towards the Nether
        Crossing Ship as originally planned.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        [Her] slender hand only reveals up to the wrist, occasionally launching
        immense ranged attacks at me.
      </p>
      <p>Since the hand doesn't have eyes, its accuracy is incredibly low.</p>
      <p>Of course, the just aftermath is nearly lethal.</p>
      <p>'Damn it.'</p>
      <p>
        I grit my teeth and enter the sea area where the Nether Crossing Ship is
        sealed.
      </p>
      <p>I see the barrier of the Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        Using the Formless Sword wrapped around my body, I break through the
        barrier and charge towards the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        I finally land on the deck of the Nether Crossing Ship and quickly move
        to the control room.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't touched the helm of the Nether Crossing Ship for a long time,
        but I remember it clearly.
      </p>
      <p>"Nether Crossing Ship, start!"</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Following my will, the Nether Crossing Ship begins to rise into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>'I must go to Serving Command Palace!'</p>
      <p>Just when I’m clenching my teeth.</p>
      <p>[This… bastard…!]</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>From below the Nether Crossing Ship, a familiar face appears.</p>
      <p>It’s Song Jin.</p>
      <p>
        [How dare this thief! What are you planning to do with the Nether
        Crossing Ship…?]
      </p>
      <p>
        Without saying much, I sail the Nether Crossing Ship into the sky and
        reply.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Mad Lord is chasing me, senior. While fleeing and dodging him, I
        ended up coming here. I beg for your understanding."
      </p>
      <p>[What…?]</p>
      <p>Hearing the name 'Mad Lord,' Song Jin's eyes blaze furiously.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Finally, Mad Lord’s puppets break through the barriers of the sealing
        area of the Nether Crossing Ship and reach us.
      </p>
      <p>Kuakuakuang!</p>
      <p>Countless puppets of the Mad Lord swarm in.</p>
      <p>Seeing them, Song Jin’s eyes flare with blue fury.</p>
      <p>
        [This… Mad Lord…! Bastard..! How dare you come here again! Haven’t you
        stolen enough from the Nether Crossing Ship!?]
      </p>
      <p>His voice Is laced with mixed wrath.</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin looks as if he would devour the Mad Lord on the spot,
        descending to the deck of the Nether Crossing Ship to confront the
        puppets.
      </p>
      <p>And when countless puppets try to board the Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Dark ghostly mist surrounds the Nether Crossing Ship, and it enters the
        void.
      </p>
      <p>"Phew…"</p>
      <p>I sigh and speak.</p>
      <p>“I apologize, senior. As I mentioned…"</p>
      <p>[Enough! You're being chased by the Mad Lord, aren't you?]</p>
      <p>"Yes, yes."</p>
      <p>His eyes blaze with blue fury.</p>
      <p>
        [As insane as the Mad Lord is, he wouldn't abandon ascension to chase
        you… In this period when the Ascension Gate is opened, just hold on a
        bit longer.]
      </p>
      <p>"Then…."</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Whirrrr!</p>
      <p>On one side of the void.</p>
      <p>A spatial rift connected to the mortal realm opens.</p>
      <p>A familiar slender hand emerges from it.</p>
      <p>Seeing this, Song Jin shouts.</p>
      <p>[This damned thing! Why didn’t you say [She] is chasing you too!?]</p>
      <p>"Uh…?"</p>
      <p>
        [Damn it, it's all over. If Mad Lord brought out even that puppet to
        capture you, then you're done for. I can't help you anymore.]
      </p>
      <p>The situation is serious enough for even Song Jin to say so.</p>
      <p>‘As expected….’</p>
      <p>I ask Song Jin while looking at him,</p>
      <p>"Senior, perhaps suicide is the right choice?"</p>
      <p>
        [Oh, what an ingenious method. If you die, your soul will be sealed in
        the Nether Crossing Ship to pay for sailing it without permission, so be
        aware of that.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of Song Jin's growling, I grab the helm of the Nether
        Crossing Ship. I already know the coordinates of Serving Command Palace
        at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Then, if I'm going to commit suicide, I might as well use the Nether
        Crossing Ship a bit more before I do."
      </p>
      <p>[What…!?]</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        I glance at the dazzling, space-distorting slender hand in the distance
        and move the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Flash….</p>
      <p>
        The Nether Crossing Ship enters the space in the mortal realm, and from
        there, I direct it towards the coordinates of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>'What a tumultuous time in such a short duration.'</p>
      <p>
        I click my tongue, seeing Serving Command Palace floating in the void in
        front of me.
      </p>
      <p>Whirr!</p>
      <p>
        I weave Pure Spiritual Force and create the barrier-breaking scroll.
      </p>
      <p>When I finish creating the scroll…</p>
      <p>Whirrr!</p>
      <p>
        Again, a space rift connected to the mortal realm opens, and [Her]
        slender hand stretches out.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        After annihilating the prohibition, I enter the interior of Serving
        Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>'The floor with White-Red Wine…!'</p>
      <p>
        I frantically ascend to the upper floors of Serving Command Palace,
        searching for the immortal wine.
      </p>
      <p>'I found it…!'</p>
      <p>Kuang! Kuang!</p>
      <p>
        Using the Formless Sword, I cut all the main circuits inside the barrier
        and furiously hammer it.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>One side of Serving Command Palace begins to crumble.</p>
      <p>Shiver!</p>
      <p>
        What appears, as the wall of Serving Command Palace crumbles, is [Her]
        slender hand, which has already emerged up to the wrists!
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel a chill from the explosive force emanating from [Her] slender
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>'Quickly, quickly!'</p>
      <p>Snap!</p>
      <p>[She] spreads her hand.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kuang!</p>
      <p>My Formless Sword finally breaks the barrier.</p>
      <p>I already know which jar contains White-Red Wine.</p>
      <p>Pop!</p>
      <p>
        I hastily open the lid of the White-Red Wine and gulp it down directly
        from the jar.
      </p>
      <p>Whirr!</p>
      <p>
        Once again, the dharma treasures placed inside my body buzz, deepening
        their connection with me.
      </p>
      <p>‘Certainly…’</p>
      <p>
        I distinctly feel the connection between my soul and the dharma
        treasures.
      </p>
      <p>It’s then.</p>
      <p>Whirr!</p>
      <p>A tremendous gravitational force is felt from [Her] hand.</p>
      <p>It feels like I’m being directly sucked in!</p>
      <p>‘Ugh…!’</p>
      <p>Indeed, my body is being drawn towards [Her] hand.</p>
      <p>Resistance is impossible!</p>
      <p>‘Damn, no, this won't do!’</p>
      <p>I need another method!</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        In the distance, Song Jin-ho holds the helm of the Nether Crossing Ship
        and crosses into the mortal realm.
      </p>
      <p>I clench my teeth and take the Starting Form.</p>
      <p>
        In the life before last, I followed Kim Young-hoon's footsteps,
        discovering Treading Heaven Beyond the Path.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in my last life, I finally killed Yuan Li, fully reaching Treading
        Heaven Beyond the Path.
      </p>
      <p>Certainly, I have entered a different path than Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        That's why, instead of his space-transcending Surpassing Radiant Saber,
        my Formless Sword evolved to cut only what I want.
      </p>
      <p>But….</p>
      <p>‘I’m certain, my Formless Sword cut through space that one time.’</p>
      <p>For a moment, it became Kim Young-hoon's Surpassing Radiant Saber!</p>
      <p>That means.</p>
      <p>Perhaps….</p>
      <p>
        ‘Can those who have reached Treading Heaven Beyond the Path mimic
        others’ Treading Heaven Beyond the Path?’
      </p>
      <p>Think it through…!</p>
      <p>Find a way in your mind…!</p>
      <p>Whirr!</p>
      <p>I ignite the upper dantian with Gang Qi, awakening it.</p>
      <p>
        The flow starts from my Baihui point, heading towards the Yin Tang
        point, igniting the upper dantian with Gang Qi.
      </p>
      <p>“Uoooooh!”</p>
      <p>I recall that sensation.</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword originates from Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, and
        the Surpassing Radiant Saber from Severing Vein Saber Method.
      </p>
      <p>And the root of both martial arts are actually one.</p>
      <p>
        Then, tracing back the Formless Sword, is it truly impossible to
        temporarily reach the space-cutting Surpassing Radiant Saber?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it’s impossible to completely obtain the Surpassing Radiant
        Saber.
      </p>
      <p>However, if it’s just mimicking the ability for a brief moment…</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously with my focused diligence, [She] suddenly looms before my
        eyes, her hand gripping something.
      </p>
      <p>
        I, with all my strength in the empty void, slash down with what is held
        in my hand.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword, for an instant, shines with a brilliant golden
        radiance.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>I escape the void and reach the mortal realm.</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        Far off, Song Jin, who had just escaped the void like me, is seen
        grasping the helm of the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>I fly towards the Nether Crossing Ship and catch my breath.</p>
      <p>
        [What is this, didn't you say you were going to commit suicide? If
        you're going to kill yourself, do it after getting off the Nether
        Crossing Ship…!]
      </p>
      <p>Song Jin shouts, seemingly afraid of [Her] pursuing us again.</p>
      <p>Gasping for air, I suddenly become curious about something.</p>
      <p>
        "…Perhaps, do you know any techniques that can attach a ghost to the
        depths of the soul?"
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm? I do know something like that.]</p>
      <p>"Can you perform it on me?"</p>
      <p>[Why should I do that for you?]</p>
      <p>'Damn it…'</p>
      <p>
        I forgot that to Song Jin, I’m a stranger who briefly hijacked his
        Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Just then..</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        A spatial rift tears open, and [Her] slender jade hand emerges once
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, as if determined not to let go, her arm extends up to the
        elbow.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Damn it! Get off the Nether Crossing Ship now! Hurry! Alright, fine!
        I'll perform that spell for you!]
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin takes out a ghost from the Nether Crossing Ship and injects it
        directly into my upper dantian.
      </p>
      <p>―Kiyaaaaa!</p>
      <p>
        With an unpleasant foreign sensation, I feel the ghost's soul attach to
        me, guided by Song Jin's power.
      </p>
      <p>For a moment, the ghost and I are connected.</p>
      <p>[Get off now!]</p>
      <p>
        And, as if obeying Song Jin's command, the ghost, now linked with my
        soul, forcibly controls my body and makes me jump off the Nether
        Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        [Her] hand reaches out towards me, and at the very last moment, I
        concentrate the energy of the Formless Sword towards my head.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>That is my twelfth return.</p>

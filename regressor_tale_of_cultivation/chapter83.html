      <p>Chapter 83: Deathbed (1)</p>
      <p>
        The momentum of the Formless Sword alone shatters most of the martial
        arts created by Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, using his newly created martial arts as a sacrifice, Kim
        Young-hoon's saber pierces through and slices through the air, targeting
        Seo Eun-hyun’s neck.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, although Seo Eun-hyun's Formless Sword is ferocious,
        it still needs half of a half-breath more to descend and reach him.
      </p>
      <p>'I will win!'</p>
      <p>It’s when Kim Young-hoon laughs as if his mouth might tear.</p>
      <p>
        Above Seo Eun-hyun's left hand, a brilliant five-colored glow bursts
        forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the Seventy-Two Earthly Sha True Words, the Earth Penalty True
        Word materializes through the five elements spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Did he create it without reciting the mantra, by just manipulating the
        flow of spiritual power?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging by its quick formation, it seems like a spell that has been
        prepared from earlier and has just been completed.
      </p>
      <p>The spiritual power solidifies in the void, condensing firmly.</p>
      <p>
        It’s a type of spell that condenses spiritual power to trigger an
        explosion!
      </p>
      <p>'It doesn't matter, he can't hit me anyway.'</p>
      <p>
        It will only take as much time to blink an eye for Seo Eun-hyun to
        complete his spell and launch it at Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, in that amount of time, Kim Young-hoon's saber will have already
        reached Seo Eun-hyun's neck!
      </p>
      <p>That's what he thought...</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun did not launch the spell in his left hand.</p>
      <p>
        Instead, he grasps the spell with his hand imbued with Pure Spiritual
        Force and looks at Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>Along with Seo Eun-hyun's intent, the name of his technique echoes.</p>
      <p>Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique, Direct Serpent.</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword, which seems to be striking down at Kim Young-hoon,
        has already changed its form and resides in Seo Eun-hyun's left hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spell overlays on the Formless Sword and is shot at Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>If it continues like this, it would be a counter-strike.</p>
      <p>
        'And if it's a counter-strike, this monstrous guy with Gang Qi flowing
        in his veins will win.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if his neck is half-cut, as long as the spinal cord is not severed,
        he probably won't die, thanks to the Pure Spiritual Force spreading life
        force throughout his body.
      </p>
      <p>It’s a judgmental defeat for Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>'No.'</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon squeezes out all the energy in his body.</p>
      <p>'I'll be prepared to die, just like Seo Eun-hyun!'</p>
      <p>It feels as if his upper dantian is about to explode.</p>
      <p>
        But Kim Young-hoon doesn’t care and further ignites his talent, the
        sensation he had since he first opened his eyes in this world.
      </p>
      <p>The joy of cultivating martial arts.</p>
      <p>He forgets everything else.</p>
      <p>'How can this not be enjoyable?'</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon creates another martial art.</p>
      <p>
        This new martial art is not just about physical agility or pouring out
        slashes.
      </p>
      <p>In a paused world.</p>
      <p>Golden threads spurt out from all over Kim Young-hoon's body.</p>
      <p>
        The threads, moving at the speed of light in the world of an instant,
        gather around his arms and into his grip, connecting to the Surpassing
        Radiant Saber he holds, completely enveloping the saber.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the surface of the Surpassing Radiant Saber, thin thread-like veins
        form, creating blood vessels and meridians.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon contemplates and ponders over martial arts.</p>
      <p>Internal energy, techniques, and intent.</p>
      <p>All are a part of martial arts.</p>
      <p>
        And the Inner Core harmoniously connects everything, maintaining balance
        in martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Kim Young-hoon recalls this and ponders over the existence of
        the Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>'What is the Inner Core?'</p>
      <p>
        The Inner Core is basically where the Gang Sphere settles in the
        dantian, mixing with the nature of the dantian to form something new.
      </p>
      <p>Then, what is the dantian?</p>
      <p>
        Why does the Gang Sphere, used externally, get depleted when its energy
        is exhausted, but the dantian recovers its power?
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's senses lead him to the answer as he questions.</p>
      <p>'It's because they're connected.'</p>
      <p>The dantian is connected to the body's blood vessels and meridians.</p>
      <p>It's connected to physical life.</p>
      <p>
        Thus, empowered by the vitality of life, it continuously draws energy
        from the atmosphere, nurturing internal energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gang Sphere, although containing consciousness, is not truly
        connected to vitality, so it keeps depleting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that brief moment, Kim Young-hoon's talent leads him to a new idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he creates external meridians and blood vessels to emit energy and
        infuse life force into the Gang Sphere, wouldn't that Gang Sphere become
        another Inner Core existing externally?
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the resistance to the depletion of energy, can it be possible
        that, due to being connected to life force, one can continuously recover
        strength?
      </p>
      <p>Or could it become a new source of power?</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's Surpassing Radiant Saber is the union of nine Gang
        Spheres and his domain of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>'Here I go.'</p>
      <p>
        Breathing life into the Surpassing Radiant Saber, he creates a new
        dantian outside his body.
      </p>
      <p>The Surpassing Radiant Saber begins to burn even more brilliantly.</p>
      <p>
        The Surpassing Radiant Saber, in a completely still world, surpasses
        through all perception and cognition, rushing towards Seo Eun-hyun after
        slicing through his spell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword infused with Seo Eun-hyun's spell rapidly changes
        form and targets Kim Young-hoon, but due to the hasty change, it only
        manages to head towards his shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Delayed by the breaking of the sound barrier, sound belatedly explodes,
        and the dust that rises around them is pushed away in a circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's Surpassing Radiant Saber is touching Seo Eun-hyun's
        neck, while Seo Eun-hyun's Formless Sword is touching Kim Young-hoon's
        shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>"I..."</p>
      <p>It’s Kim Young-hoon's victory.</p>
      <p>"I won!"</p>
      <p>Churk, Walkak</p>
      <p>
        Blood spurts from Kim Young-hoon's eyes, nose, and mouth, having
        overstrained his upper dantian by rapidly activating his talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's Inner Core is also empty, and the brilliance of the
        Surpassing Radiant Saber seems to extinguish at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun sighs.</p>
      <p>
        "...If it had been a real fight, I would have died. Yes, I admit
        defeat."
      </p>
      <p>"Ha, haha, hahaha...!"</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon laughs, covered in blood.</p>
      <p>He has finally succeeded in surpassing him.</p>
      <p>Fizz...</p>
      <p>
        The golden light embedded in Kim Young-hoon's saber is retracted back
        into his domain of consciousness, and Seo Eun-hyun's Formless Sword
        returns as well.
      </p>
      <p>"By the way, what was that? That thing at the end."</p>
      <p>
        "I theorized I could turn the external Gang Sphere into an Inner Core by
        connecting it to a dantian outside the body like Surpassing Radiant
        Saber.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created an additional source of power outside the body and used it to
        momentarily enhance the Surpassing Radiant Saber beyond its limits."
      </p>
      <p>"Huh..."</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun looks at Kim Young-hoon with a stunned expression.</p>
      <p>
        "Did you... create that martial art in the midst of battle just now?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "If the idea is there, it's certainly possible to create such martial
        arts. You probably can learn it even more easily. You originally emit
        energy outside your body to perform spells..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Kim Young-hoon glances around while talking to Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>He hasn't had a chance to pay proper attention until now.</p>
      <p>"Being a cultivator... without difficulty..."</p>
      <p>
        He only thought the surroundings were destroyed, and the terrain
        damaged.
      </p>
      <p>He hadn’t considered 'how' it differed from the original terrain.</p>
      <p>"...You'll be able to learn it."</p>
      <p>
        The terrain altered by Seo Eun-hyun scattering his Formless Sword in all
        directions forms a battle formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The battle formation has spell characters carved into it as sword marks,
        with five overlapping formations centered around Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he had just infused his spiritual power, the Five Elements battle
        formation would have activated, making the entire vicinity Seo
        Eun-hyun's territory.
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>Chill, chill!</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon suddenly feels a shiver run down his spine.</p>
      <p>
        'If the battle dragged on, and Seo Eun-hyun started activating the
        battle formation...'
      </p>
      <p>It would’ve been an inevitable defeat for Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        'Against cultivators, prolonged battles are nearly impossible, huh.'
      </p>
      <p>He sighs, thinking he had done well to end it quickly.</p>
      <p>"...Anyway, uh...!"</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon suddenly feels his legs give out.</p>
      <p>'Ah... I'm exhausted.'</p>
      <p>Consciousness seems to be fading away.</p>
      <p>"Eun-hyun, please take care of me.."</p>
      <p>And just before losing consciousness,</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon realizes how unscathed Seo Eun-hyun is.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon’s whole body is torn, his clothes soaked in blood, and he
        himself is exhausted from internal injuries and the depletion of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has been injured in several places by the force of the Formless
        Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Seo Eun-hyun, aside from slightly faster breathing, has no injuries
        or even dust on his clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for the slight mark on his neck where Kim Young-hoon's saber had
        touched, he’s unharmed everywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it had been a real fight, Kim Young-hoon's saber would have
        decapitated Seo Eun-hyun, and Seo Eun-hyun's Formless Sword would have
        taken one of Kim Young-hoon's arms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strictly speaking, it’s Kim Young-hoon's victory, a fact acknowledged by
        both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as Kim Young-hoon loses consciousness, he can't help but chuckle to
        himself internally.
      </p>
      <p>‘Is this really a win?'</p>
      <p>
        The victor is on the brink of death, while the loser remains unscathed.
      </p>
      <p>Swallowing his ironic laughter, Kim Young-hoon faints.</p>
      <p>'This shit...'</p>
      <p>"Sigh..."</p>
      <p>I look at the fallen Kim Young-hoon and sigh softly.</p>
      <p>It’s a complete defeat.</p>
      <p>
        Honestly, the way he kept creating martial arts in the midst of the
        battle, especially within those fleeting moments, was spine-chilling.
      </p>
      <p>And that last martial art he created.</p>
      <p>
        'Creating an external dantian to increase the output of a martial art?'
      </p>
      <p>It’s revolutionary, something only a genius like him could create.</p>
      <p>
        I couldn't have imagined Kim Young-hoon's talent to be this
        extraordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s undoubtedly my defeat in the pure realm of martial arts, and had it
        been a real battle, it would have been the end of this life for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If I only had a few more seconds, I could have activated the battle
        formation and seized control of the surrounding area...'
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon moves in a world far faster than a mere second.</p>
      <p>Even my reactions with the Formless Sword are barely in time.</p>
      <p>'He didn't give me any time and just chased after me.'</p>
      <p>I pick up the blood-soaked Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>"Truly remarkable."</p>
      <p>I don’t know how much longer Kim Young-hoon has to live.</p>
      <p>
        Nor do I know if he can overcome the heart attack and heavenly lightning
        to overcome lifespan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m curious about how much more he will grow in the time he has left.
      </p>
      <p>"At least in this life, I will be able to see all of your growth."</p>
      <p>For a long, very long time.</p>
      <p>As long as he's been granted a new lifespan.</p>
      <p>
        If he can't overcome death, I will be there to witness his final
        moments.
      </p>
      <p>For a very long time.</p>
      <p>I take Kim Young-hoon and leave Shattered Heaven Peak.</p>
      <p>Having achieved everything I wanted, it’s time to visit others.</p>
      <p>I left Shengzi and returned to Yanguo.</p>
      <p>
        In one of the coastal cities of Yanguo, I rented a small mansion and
        treated Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The external dantian-forming martial art Kim Young-hoon recently created
        is damaging to the essence. It must be incomplete since it was made on
        the spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, having clashed with me several times, Kim Young-hoon's energy
        and blood were twisted and needed a long time to heal.
      </p>
      <p>
        While treating Kim Young-hoon, I contemplated the enlightenment from
        Beyond the Path to Heaven. I decided to think about what to do next with
        Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Everything I learned during my Qi Refining days were just basic
        spells.'
      </p>
      <p>True cultivation starts from Qi Building.</p>
      <p>
        It's the stage where one's lifespan truly begins to extend and where one
        starts to transcend humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, all the spells from the 1st to the 14th Stars of Qi Refining are
        essentially just the basics.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s like laying the groundwork in the body to produce Pure Spiritual
        Force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the product is made, it's time to sell it and influence the
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I need to learn proper cultivation methods and elevate my cultivation in
        Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>'I need to find Qi Building methods.'</p>
      <p>Where should I get the cultivation manuals?</p>
      <p>
        At this point, being at Qi Building, I will be welcomed in any clan.
      </p>
      <p>'Well, I'll think about obtaining them later...'</p>
      <p>
        Essentially, I now have the power of Core Formation, so getting
        cultivation methods wouldn't be difficult.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, finding 'the right' method is another matter.</p>
      <p>
        I put the thought of cultivation methods aside and think about the
        visions I saw at Shattered Heaven Peak.
      </p>
      <p>'Don't reveal? The Ender? Gifts?'</p>
      <p>Honestly, I don’t understand what it all means.</p>
      <p>
        Sure, there are records of Yang Su-jin causing Heavenly Rejection and
        other suspicious records.
      </p>
      <p>And considering he called me the 'next generation’s Ender'...</p>
      <p>'Perhaps... he's like us, someone who fell into this world.'</p>
      <p>Then, what does it mean to be an Ender?</p>
      <p>
        I don’t know for sure. I can guess why we're called Enders, but I can't
        be certain.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the warning he gave me must have been about the power I possess.
      </p>
      <p>'Don't disclose my regression ability?'</p>
      <p>So far, I haven't told anyone about it.</p>
      <p>It seemed no one would believe me even if I did.</p>
      <p>
        Even if they did believe, what could they do about it? It would only
        cause mutual distress, so I kept silent.
      </p>
      <p>'And... I instinctively felt averse to it.'</p>
      <p>
        All humans instinctively avoid disclosing their fate. Especially Enders.
      </p>
      <p>That shadow, calling himself Yang Su-jin, had said so.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Revealing it means [it] will notice, no matter where in the Three
        Thousand Worlds. Does that mean, [it]…’
      </p>
      <p>I gaze at the sky, far away, furrowing my brow.</p>
      <p>
        ‘A very vast and powerful being, capable of scouring the entirety of the
        Three Thousand Worlds, just by us uttering it... Is it searching for us,
        the 'Enders', even now?’
      </p>
      <p>The sky today is clear.</p>
      <p>
        It’s a spotless blue. The sky seems high, and beyond it looks endlessly
        vast.
      </p>
      <p>Shiver!</p>
      <p>I feel a chilling sensation and shake my head.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Honestly, I don't understand, but it's probably better not to do what
        I've been warned against... Besides, not disclosing about fate means…’
      </p>
      <p>
        I think about my colleagues who were captured by Heavenly Being
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>Those who had their talents immediately exposed.</p>
      <p>
        "What happens to those who have been exposed? Have they already been
        noticed by [it[ he spoke of?"
      </p>
      <p>I sigh, squinting my eyes.</p>
      <p>I can't figure it out.</p>
      <p>
        "Never mind. I'll think about it later. Right now, I don't have enough
        information to understand anything."
      </p>
      <p>Gradually, Kim Young-hoon's treatment is coming to an end.</p>
      <p>Several days passed.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon gets up and swings his saber again.</p>
      <p>"So, what now?"</p>
      <p>He asks me.</p>
      <p>
        "Now that you're a Qi Building cultivator, you can easily become an
        elder in any clan."
      </p>
      <p>"Elder, huh... That could be good, but."</p>
      <p>I look towards the south, far away.</p>
      <p>"There's a friend I need to meet."</p>
      <p>"A friend to meet? Who might that be?"</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, remember that dragon-like creature that captured Deputy Manager Oh?
        It seems he has a job for me."
      </p>
      <p>I briefly explain Seo Ran to him and say,</p>
      <p>
        "It seems he wants me to help his descendant and defeat a Core Formation
        level ghost. I'm thinking of giving it a try."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, a Core Formation level ghost."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon, upon hearing my summary, grins.</p>
      <p>"That sounds fun. Let's go beat it up together."</p>
      <p>"Alright, then shall we go meet that dragon's descendant first?"</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon and I cross the Black Wind Sea and head towards Seo Ran's
        abode.
      </p>
      <p>Thump, thump!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon and I kicked through the air and arrived at Seo Ran's
        cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we used Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation as before, we could
        have flown, but knowing it’s a trap set by Seo Hweol, it became an
        option we shouldn’t learn.
      </p>
      <p>"Is it down there?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, it is."</p>
      <p>"Then shall we swim..."</p>
      <p>Just as Kim Young-hoon is about to hold his breath,</p>
      <p>I stop him and draw my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        "Why bother swimming? Let's just ask the owner to come out, though I
        feel sorry for him."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm?"</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        I fee; sorry for Seo Ran, but it seems we needed to cause a bit of a
        commotion.
      </p>
      <p>Formless Sword!</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>With a single strike, the sea splits apart.</p>
      <p>
        The water all the way above Seo Ran's cave is torn open by the Formless
        Sword, and a path to his dwelling appears before us.
      </p>
      <p>"Is the owner home?"</p>
      <p>
        I use the language of the demon race to vibrate spiritual energy and
        shout. After a while,
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran crawls out of his abode in his dragon form.</p>
      <p>"...What brings seniors to this place...?"</p>
      <p>He looks at us, Kim Young-hoon and me, with great caution.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The divided sea merges again, and Seo Ran emerges from the water to meet
        our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I show him the Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation given by Seo Hweol
        and explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Sea Dragon King Seo Hweol asked me to help you, his descendant,
        break the barrier of Black Bone Valley. This demon beast manual is the
        proof.
      </p>
      <p>Would you like to accept our help?"</p>
      <p>After looking at me and the manual, Seo Ran's expression brightens.</p>
      <p>
        "Se, seniors, if you could help me, I would be grateful. But you are
        humans, and I am a member of the demon race, can you trust me..?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "...I've already heard everything from the Sea Dragon King. Including
        your origins."
      </p>
      <p>I look at Seo Ran as I speak..</p>
      <p>
        At those words, Seo Ran bows his head slightly, sighs softly, and emits
        light.
      </p>
      <p>He transforms into his demi-human form, with scales and a tail.</p>
      <p>
        "...I apologize for not greeting you in my true form from the beginning.
        Knowing this fact, you must be truly requested by the King."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran smells faintly and speaks..</p>
      <p>
        "Understood. Then, I ask for your help. Please assist me in breaking the
        barrier."
      </p>
      <p>I look at him.</p>
      <p>Calling me a senior, this feeling is somewhat strange.</p>
      <p>In this life, perhaps we can't be friends.</p>
      <p>But I won't let him die.</p>
      <p>"Let's do that. Lead us to the barrier."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, Kim Young-hoon, and I head towards the sea area where the
        Nether Crossing Ship of Black Bone Valley is hidden.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>"Wow, magnificent."</p>
      <p>
        After breaking through the illusionary and ghost barriers set up by
        Black Bone Valley, we look at the Nether Crossing Ship positioned at the
        center of a massive water barrier.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon is overwhelmed by the sight and exclaims in awe.</p>
      <p>"That's the barrier."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran points out the barrier surrounding the Nether Crossing Ship to
        Kim Young-hoon and me.
      </p>
      <p>
        A barrier that will dissolve if we remove the eight formation flags
        inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the barrier easily accepts those with pure human lineage,
        posing no problem.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon and I approach the barrier.</p>
      <p>Like my previous life, we just need to enter and remove the flags.</p>
      <p>"Please help me break through this barrier."</p>
      <p>"Alright, then..."</p>
      <p>At that moment,</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A flash of golden radiance strikes one side of the barrier.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon had slashed at the barrier surrounding the Nether
        Crossing Ship with his Surpassing Radiant Saber.
      </p>
      <p>The barrier shakes violently and wavers..</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, no, senior. There's no need to smash the barrier like that...!"
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran seems panicked as he speaks to Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>However, Kim Young-hoon just smirks and readies himself again.</p>
      <p>
        "Ah, well, I don't know much about spells and such. So I just tried
        brute forcing it... But this."
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's Surpassing Radiant Saber begins to emit a golden
        brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Seems like I can smash it. Do we really need to dismantle it the hard
        way?"
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        He swings the Surpassing Radiant Saber again, and the barrier wavers
        once more.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, no..."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran is taken aback by the unexpected development.</p>
      <p>But I just chuckle at the scene.</p>
      <p>If Kim Young-hoon is doing so, I can't be outdone.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        I take out my Formless Sword and, like Kim Young-hoon, batter the
        barrier.
      </p>
      <p>The barrier starts to shake wildly.</p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>With my strike, the barrier trembles and a faint crack appears.</p>
      <p>

      <p>
        Poor barrier. Those humans just need to kindly remove the flags stuck
        inside but instead barrier-san gets jumped lmao.

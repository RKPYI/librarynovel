      <p>Chapter 74: Eve (7)</p>
      <p>It’s difficult to open my eyes.</p>
      <p>No, it isn't simply that I can't open my eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Just as staring directly at the sun hurts the eyes, facing the
        excessively abundant flow of intent causes a throbbing pain in my upper
        dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s painful not just for my eyes, but also for my vision of intent and
        demon senses.
      </p>
      <p>'What kind of enlightenment is this..!'</p>
      <p>
        Yet, I endure the pain and manage to gaze directly at Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>He is dancing amidst golden waves.</p>
      <p>
        The martial essence of the Severing Vein Saber Method unfurls from the
        tip of Kim Young-hoon's blade.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the first to the seventeenth moves of the Severing Vein Saber
        Method.
      </p>
      <p>
        A martial art born from Kim Young-hoon's longing to cross mountains and
        return home.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the sixteenth and seventeenth moves of the Severing Vein Saber
        Method shares the same enlightenment with the twenty-third and
        twenty-fourth moves of the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.
      </p>
      <p>
        The twenty-third move of Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, the sixteenth
        move of Severing Vein Saber Method, ‘Endless Mountains Beyond
        Mountains.’.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the twenty-fourth move of Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, the
        seventeenth move of Severing Vein Saber Method.
      </p>
      <p>'Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains (愚公移山).’</p>
      <p>Just as there are endless mountains beyond mountains.</p>
      <p>No matter how many hardships and adversities life may bring.</p>
      <p>
        If one is as persistent as the Foolish Old Man, believing in their
        martial path.
      </p>
      <p>They will surely be able to push aside all mountains in their way.</p>
      <p>
        This is the ultimate secret technique of both the Severing Mountain
        Swordsmanship and Severing Vein Saber Method, following Endless
        Mountains Beyond Mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        It encapsulates the will of the previous cycles’ Kim Young-hoon's life.
      </p>
      <p>However, Kim Young-hoon has never been the Foolish Old Man.</p>
      <p>
        The term 'Foolish Old Man' refers to a foolish and slow-witted person.
      </p>
      <p>An ill-fitting term for a martial genius like him.</p>
      <p>
        Yet, perhaps the previous Kim Young-hoon, having tasted despair in front
        of cultivators, wanted to say this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even a genius cannot advance further without becoming the Foolish Old
        Man.
      </p>
      <p>And so...</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon became the Foolish Old Man.</p>
      <p>No matter how unreachable the path seems.</p>
      <p>Even if Mount Tai stands in his way.</p>
      <p>
        After inheriting and passing down, he finally succeeds in breaking
        through the mountain.
      </p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>Fwoosh!</p>
      <p>
        From Kim Young-hoon's upper dantian, Gang Qi rises, beginning to burn
        his dantian.
      </p>
      <p>'That is...'</p>
      <p>
        With my eyes, trained in both cultivation and martial arts, I see its
        flow.
      </p>
      <p>'The secret technique of the Jin Clan!'</p>
      <p>
        The technique previously used on my disciples, inserting the resentful
        souls of their relatives into their upper dantians to forcibly awaken
        their talents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon had reinterpreted the Jin Clan's secret technique in
        terms of martial arts, creating something new.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of using the souls of others, he burns his upper dantian with
        his own Gang Qi, elevating his martial talent beyond its limits.
      </p>
      <p>"Aaaaah!"</p>
      <p>
        Starting from his upper dantian, Kim Young-hoon's upper body begins to
        burn with Gang Qi.
      </p>
      <p>Despite the pain, he does not stop this martial technique.</p>
      <p>
        Akin to the last light before sunset, burning the brightest, he is
        burning himself.
      </p>
      <p>It’s painful to even watch.</p>
      <p>But I can't miss this scene.</p>
      <p>Changes begin to occur in Kim Young-hoon's martial arts.</p>
      <p>Woooom-</p>
      <p>In the world of intent.</p>
      <p>Around the burning Kim Young-hoon stands nine versions of himself.</p>
      <p>Nine Gang Spheres start to change, emitting brilliance.</p>
      <p>
        The Gang Spheres begin to dissolve, not into the air, but into Kim
        Young-hoon's domain of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        One by one, the nine Gang Spheres merge, and the golden luminosity
        emanating from Kim Young-hoon grows intense.
      </p>
      <p>Then, suddenly.</p>
      <p>Fzzt, fzzt-</p>
      <p>
        Merely watching, the sharpness of the energy starts to slice through my
        body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, Kim Young-hoon's domain of consciousness begins to
        materialize, merging with the Gang Spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's consciousness domain turns into pure golden brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>"I... Have... Reached... It...!!"</p>
      <p>Krrrrrrr!</p>
      <p>
        The materialized domain of consciousness momentarily thins out like a
        line.
      </p>
      <p>"I... Will..."</p>
      <p>The golden line merges into Kim Young-hoon's saber.</p>
      <p>"Beyond... The Heavens...!!!!!"</p>
      <p>
        Burning with Gang Qi, Kim Young-hoon swings his golden-lit saber towards
        the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an instant, his saber surpasses even the rays of light and reaches
        the heavens.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Brilliant light streaks across the sky, splitting the clouds in half as
        it passes!
      </p>
      <p>'Ah...'</p>
      <p>I felt something flowing down my cheek, coming from my eyes.</p>
      <p>When I wipe it with my hand, it’s red.</p>
      <p>
        Tears of blood, perhaps, shed in the face of such beautiful yet
        incomprehensible enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>Fwoosh...</p>
      <p>
        There, Kim Young-hoon, having swung his saber towards the heavens, died
        standing in that very pose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even as he burned with Gang Qi, it was as if he had finally reached his
        destination, as if he had at last arrived where he wished.
      </p>
      <p>He is smiling.</p>
      <p>Plunk, thud...</p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>
        Gang Qi escapes from Kim Young-hoon's body, and he disintegrates, swept
        away by his own energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        He becomes a cluster of light, flying off to the heavens, to the place
        he so longed to reach.
      </p>
      <p>"...I will not forget you."</p>
      <p>I bow in the direction where Kim Young-hoon had been.</p>
      <p>
        This is a tribute to a grandmaster who had once again transcended the
        limits of martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe because I had just witnessed an enlightenment beyond the Ultimate
        Pinnacle,
      </p>
      <p>
        Around me, six Gang Spheres emerge and split into seven as they rotate.
      </p>
      <p>Only two more left..</p>
      <p>
        With just two more, I will meet the qualifications to challenge the
        realm beyond the Ultimate Pinnacle, proven by Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I examine the book of the Beyond the Path to Heaven Martial Arts, left
        behind by Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>It seems graspable, yet elusive.</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps when I reach the extremes of the Ultimate Pinnacle, I can grasp
        it through this book.
      </p>
      <p>'To that place.'</p>
      <p>I will surely reach it.</p>
      <p>
        Maybe because of Kim Young-hoon's saber light that had torn the sky, I
        see people from various cultivator clans approaching from afar.
      </p>
      <p>I use the Earth Surpassing Path to escape underground.</p>
      <p>Mulling over Kim Young-hoon's final moments.</p>
      <p>My time of death approaches.</p>
      <p>And with a smile, I exhale my last breath.</p>
      <p>Huuuu...</p>
      <p>Yellow, black, red, and white clouds appear and circle around me.</p>
      <p>
        The Earth Surpassing Path, Water Surpassing Path, Fire Surpassing Path,
        and Metal Surpassing Path.
      </p>
      <p>Before dying, I successfully mastered these four paths.</p>
      <p>
        'But, it seems I will die without mastering the Wood Surpassing Path...'
      </p>
      <p>The method of the wood element.</p>
      <p>
        I had deliberately left the wood element method for last because it
        reminds me of my master.
      </p>
      <p>I’m not sure if I am good enough ‘soil’ for a tree to deeply root.</p>
      <p>My life is nearing its end.</p>
      <p>
        All seven Gang Spheres had been stabilized after encapsulating the
        enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my next life, with just 10 years of dedicated practice, I can reach
        the extremes of the Ultimate Pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>Seven Gang Spheres.</p>
      <p>And the four elemental methods.</p>
      <p>All nearly complete, save for one or two of each.</p>
      <p>'Have I become good enough soil for a tree to grow now?'</p>
      <p>What will the next life hold?</p>
      <p>“I know nothing.”</p>
      <p>I laugh at myself, absorbing the clouds swirling around me.</p>
      <p>The sacrifice of Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>The disintegration of Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        And my own cultivation, all to lay the groundwork for the next journey.
      </p>
      <p>This entire life was nourishment for the next.</p>
      <p>'So tranquil...'</p>
      <p>I contemplate the swirling clouds of four colors in my dantian.</p>
      <p>Like the calm before the storm.</p>
      <p>'Yes, this life was just like the calm before the storm...!'</p>
      <p>
        In the next life, I will become the storm that sweeps away everything.
      </p>
      <p>Because...</p>
      <p>'I cannot dishonor those who have nourished me in this life!'</p>
      <p>Thump, thump...</p>
      <p>My life is fading.</p>
      <p>Krrrrrrr!</p>
      <p>I once again challenge the Qi Building stage.</p>
      <p>The four clouds whirl and compress.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, a Spiritual Energy Star, shining in four colors, begins
        to form at the center.
      </p>
      <p>'How many times have I attempted Qi Building..?'</p>
      <p>I lost count.</p>
      <p>There had been too many attempts.</p>
      <p>Krrrrrrboom!</p>
      <p>
        The Spiritual Energy Star, on the verge of collapsing, is continuously
        sustained by the four clouds.
      </p>
      <p>But the changes are too much.</p>
      <p>Four attributes are not enough.</p>
      <p>Uggghhh</p>
      <p>Again and again, I knock on the threshold of Qi Building.</p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>My heart begins to falter.</p>
      <p>'It has begun.'</p>
      <p>
        I send Gang Qi to my heart, forcefully pumping to resist the end of my
        life.
      </p>
      <p>Thump, thump, thump...</p>
      <p>It’s painful.</p>
      <p>But since it has come to this...</p>
      <p>'I'll see it through to the end.'</p>
      <p>
        Knowing he couldn't transcend his limits in the time he had left, Kim
        Young-hoon burned himself up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even a genius set himself ablaze; how could a dullard like me hesitate
        at the brink of death?
      </p>
      <p>Krrrrrrr!</p>
      <p>Energy escapes from my Inner Core.</p>
      <p>It then transforms into Gang Qi within my body, starting to burn.</p>
      <p>Fwoosh!</p>
      <p>Fwoosh!</p>
      <p>"Aaaargh!"</p>
      <p>
        Without the Spiritual Energy Star to control the Gang Qi and still in Qi
        Refining rather than Qi Building,
      </p>
      <p>
        My body can't withstand the Gang Qi and is entirely consumed by flames.
      </p>
      <p>
        But simultaneously, the Gang Qi incessantly stimulates my heart, surging
        up from the Inner Core in my lower dantian, reaching and igniting the
        upper dantian.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's martial technique.</p>
      <p>
        Being at the Ultimate Pinnacle and the extreme of Qi Refining myself, I
        am able to observe and replicate that technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        I burn my upper dantian with Gang Qi, elevating my limited talents to
        their utmost, and even beyond!
      </p>
      <p>Koong! Koong! Koong!</p>
      <p>I knock on the wall of Qi Building time and time again.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, I conjure Gang Spheres around me, focusing my
        consciousness to grasp the sensation of the eighth Gang Sphere.
      </p>
      <p>A life spent sending others away.</p>
      <p>Disciples, masters, friends.</p>
      <p>I will not lose them again, using this failure as nourishment.</p>
      <p>Kurung! Kururung!</p>
      <p>Dark clouds begin to gather in the sky.</p>
      <p>I laugh mockingly as I burn within the Gang Qi.</p>
      <p>"Has it... arrived..?"</p>
      <p>
        Ironically, I am now finding the ominous dark clouds somewhat familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if mocking a lowly creature for daring to escape the lifespan
        dictated by the heavens, the clouds laden with lightning completely
        cover the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        I activated the vision of intent and demon senses, along with the
        Lightning Predicting Eye I discovered at the Golden Divine Heavenly
        Thunder Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        A technique to concentrate on celestial energy and predict the location
        of lightning strikes.
      </p>
      <p>'Well, it's not much of a technique, just a knack.'</p>
      <p>
        It just focuses the sense of celestial energy gained from the Seven
        Stars Ritual slightly on the lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, observing the lightning-laden clouds, I still think this technique
        is pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone is skilled enough to predict lightning, they can just block
        or withstand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, if a weakling can predict but not stop lightning, they won't
        be able to escape it either.
      </p>
      <p>How can one dodge something that strikes at the speed of light?</p>
      <p>Engulfed in Gang Qi, I look up at the sky calmly.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The Spiritual Energy Star lasts longer than ever before, a result of
        mastering the four surpassing paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        This strengthens my hope that mastering all five elements will lead to
        Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The Spiritual Energy Star explodes, failing to endure.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, blue lightning crashes from the sky.</p>
      <p>Lightning from the Heavens strikes a Man born of the Earth.</p>
      <p>Engulfed in Gang Qi, I am struck by the lightning.</p>
      <p>And in that moment of being struck.</p>
      <p>With seven rotating Gang Spheres around me.</p>
      <p>
        At the moment of death, when the energy of the Heavens descend to the
        Earth, I seem to understand the principle of Gang Spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
        'One divides into Heaven (天), Earth (地), and Man (人). Just as a
        person isn't formed alone... perhaps the heavens, earth, and humans
        aren't formed alone either.'
      </p>
      <p>Heaven, Earth, and Man.</p>
      <p>Each is influenced by the others’ aspects.</p>
      <p>
        Then, perhaps the Heavens are influenced by the Earth, Man, and
        themselves, containing another cycle of Heaven, Earth, and Man.
        Similarly, the Earth is influenced by the Heavens, Man, and itself,
        containing another cycle within.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans, too, might have a cycle of Heaven, Earth, and Man within them.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Ah, Kim Young-hoon attained the enlightenment of Gang Spheres through
        the principle of endless circulation.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans are influenced by those who gave birth to them, those they live
        with, and those they give birth to, endlessly circulating within.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the principles of the world also circulate, influencing each
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Burning within the blue lightning, I attain enlightenment in that
        fleeting moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        'The heavens punishing humans who surpass their lifespan is, in the end,
        to minimize the influence that man has on the heavens...'
      </p>
      <p>Just as Kim Young-hoon influences me.</p>
      <p>Just as Seo Ran influences me.</p>
      <p>Just as I influenced them.</p>
      <p>We all influence each other.</p>
      <p>A cycle within Heaven, Earth, and Man.</p>
      <p>The Three Talents divide again into another set of Three Talents.</p>
      <p>The number of Gang Spheres increases.</p>
      <p>Seven, eight... and then nine!</p>
      <p>In that enlightenment.</p>
      <p>
        Even as I turn to ash within the blue lightning, I see the seven Gang
        Spheres increase to nine and close my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>That was my ninth return.</p>

        Translator Notes: Eighth Cycle over! Man, Kim Young-hoon pioneering a
        new realm was just epic. What do y’all think is gonna happen in the next
        cycle? Will Seo Eun-hyun finally reach the Qi Building stage? Will he
        manage to reach the new realm of martial arts? So exciting!

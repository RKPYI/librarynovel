      <p>Chapter 50: 7th Cycle's First Day</p>
      <p>I slowly opened my eyes.</p>
      <p>My chest still ached.</p>
      <p>
        Was it because of the heartache I experienced just before dying in my
        past life?
      </p>
      <p>Or was it phantom pain from the fierce beating of the heart?</p>
      <p>
        Or perhaps, it was the sorrow of never being able to see my master
        again, with whom I had formed a bond.
      </p>
      <p>"I, your disciple, will etch Master in my heart."</p>
      <p>
        Though separated forever by a separate timeline, our time together will
        not be forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>After making this short vow,</p>
      <p>I formed a hand seal.</p>
      <p>
        There was not a speck of spiritual power in my body, but the hand seals,
        perfected through Understanding before Breakthrough, could be activated
        with just the faintest energy flowing inside me.
      </p>
      <p>With a burst of energy,</p>
      <p>
        As the hand seal was activated, the other companions around me, just
        about to wake up, fell back into sleep without me needing to do
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>After using the hand seal, I felt a throbbing in my head.</p>
      <p>"This sensation... something is wrong with my upper dantian..?"</p>
      <p>
        It felt like something massive was crammed inside the upper dantian.
      </p>
      <p>After a moment of contemplation, I realized what it was.</p>
      <p>"My consciousness has reached the level of Qi Refining 7th Star..!"</p>
      <p>
        Considering that the consciousness of a Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin martial artist is around the level of Qi Refining 3rd or 4th
        Star,
      </p>
      <p>
        The size of my consciousness, having cultivated further to reach Qi
        Refining 7th Star, was about the size of Qi Refining 10th Star..
      </p>
      <p>
        It was strange that my upper dantian remained intact, given that a
        consciousness of that size was compressed within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems my body, not yet having undergone rejuvenation in the Five
        Energies Converging to the Origin, is struggling to cope with the upper
        dantian."
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this pain, I dug up some yellow bamboo roots nearby to eat
        and immediately entered rejuvenation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, the Five Elements of heaven and earth energy flowed into my
        body, and I regained the Five Elements Spiritual Roots, grasping the
        qualities of a cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only after undergoing the transformation and acquiring a body capable of
        withstanding the consciousness did the headache cease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the compressed consciousness in the upper dantian
        unfolded properly after reaching Five Energies Converging to the Origin,
        revealing its form.
      </p>
      <p>It was the same size as my consciousness in the previous life.</p>
      <p>I felt a faint sense of nostalgia looking at it.</p>
      <p>"Something else has been transmitted through time..."</p>
      <p>At the same time, I grasped one of the laws of regression.</p>
      <p>What regresses are only my soul and consciousness.</p>
      <p>
        If the consciousness grows before regression, its size is maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first took my companions to a cave and kept them asleep with a sleep
        spell.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I pondered about this life.</p>
      <p>"Heavens do not permit me... What should I do?"</p>
      <p>
        The main reason for becoming a cultivator was to investigate the
        Ascension Gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my past life in the Cheugnmun Clan, I had used the clan's library to
        learn about the Ascension Gate.
      </p>
      <p>The information wasn't much different from what I already knew...</p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, the Ascension Gate is a spatial rift that opens once every
        thousand years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once open, it gradually shrinks over six months before fully closing.
      </p>
      <p>
        To withstand the spatial pressure inside the Ascension Gate, one must at
        least have the defensive power of a cultivator at the Heavenly Being
        realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the Ascension Gate closes, one must wait another thousand years to
        see it again.
      </p>
      <p>A thousand years.</p>
      <p>
        To wait that long, one needs at least the lifespan and power of a
        cultivator at the Nascent Soul realm.
      </p>
      <p>That's why I decided to become a cultivator.</p>
      <p>
        "Even if I master martial arts, it only maintains the peak conditions of
        the body, not extending life."
      </p>
      <p>A fact I had verified in my past life.</p>
      <p>However, I can't further my cultivation.</p>
      <p>Then what should I do?</p>
      <p>How should I do it?</p>
      <p>Is there a way to find out?</p>
      <p>
        Even though my master had imparted the knowledge of Qi Building and the
        latter stages of Qi Refining to me,
      </p>
      <p>I could never surpass Qi Refining 7th star.</p>
      <p>What am I supposed to do!</p>
      <p>"I must try, at least once."</p>
      <p>I clenched my teeth.</p>
      <p>Yes, there's nothing I can do.</p>
      <p>But the seniors of Heavenly Being will visit in a few days.</p>
      <p>
        The Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, Black Ghost Valley, Heaven
        Creation Sect.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Sea Dragon King and Hunchback Old Man.</p>
      <p>I should plead with them.</p>
      <p>Even if it means groveling, I should ask them for a way.</p>
      <p>
        Clenching my teeth, I began to cultivate the Law-Transforming Dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equalize the five spiritual qualities and settle them in the dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then harmonize with the Yin-Yang energy to polish with the primordial
        chaos energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps because I had already achieved this state in my past life, I
        stayed awake for two nights and completed the Qi Gathering phase,
        creating the Law-Transformation dantian.
      </p>
      <p>Now, I was ready to enter the 1st Star of Qi Refining at any time.</p>
      <p>The day came.</p>
      <p>
        Once again, the Grand Master of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect,
        the Elder of the Black Ghost Valley, and the Sect Leader of the Heaven
        Creation Sect – three Heavenly Being cultivators descended upon us.
      </p>
      <p>[There are four with spiritual roots, huh?]</p>
      <p>
        The Grand Master of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, Jin
        Byuk-ho, drew us in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heaven and earth energy naturally resonated, pulling me, Oh Hyun-seok,
        Jeon Myeong-hoon, and Kang Min-hee forward.
      </p>
      <p>Once again, reactions similar to my previous life burst forth.</p>
      <p>
        [The Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Body...! A legendary constitution!]
      </p>
      <p>[Ghosts, Ghostly Yin Transformation Immortal Root..!]</p>
      <p>[Unique Holy Body! Hahaha, I can't stop laughing!]</p>
      <p>Then, their gazes finally turned to me.</p>
      <p>
        [Hm? At the stage of completing Qi Gathering. It looks like you are
        originally a cultivator... Oh? Look at this. The size of your
        consciousness is at the level of Qi Refining 10th star?]
      </p>
      <p>Jin Byuk-ho exclaimed upon seeing the size of my consciousness.</p>
      <p>Then, greed flickered in the eyes of the others again.</p>
      <p>[Let's test the aptitude.]</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, heaven and earth energy forcibly infiltrated my body,
        tearing through it.
      </p>
      <p>Crack, crunch...!</p>
      <p>"Argh...ugh!"</p>
      <p>
        I gritted my teeth and endured his cruel aptitude test, and after a
        while, it was determined that I had the Five Elements Spiritual Roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the five energies radiated brilliance, the three cultivators
        immediately showed disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Tch, I had high expectations due to the unusual size of your
        consciousness for a Qi Gatherer...]
      </p>
      <p>[This one seems unremarkable.]</p>
      <p>
        [Hmm, but considering you have not activated any spiritual meridians and
        have just begun learning cultivation... That level of consciousness is
        not bad.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Only Sir Chang-ho showed some liking towards the size of my
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If things continued this way, Sir Chang-ho would only give me a
        recommendation and leave.
      </p>
      <p>I knelt on the spot and shouted loudly.</p>
      <p>
        "I greet the great seniors of Immortal Cultivation! I have forced open
        the divine consciousness by reaching the Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin through martial arts and have longed to become a cultivator!
        Please show mercy to this lowly one and accept me as a disciple!"
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>I swung my Gang Qi-imbued arm in the air to demonstrate my worth.</p>
      <p>
        "I can also handle the Pure Spiritual Force used by Qi Building
        cultivators. My combat power is above Qi Refining 14th Star, less than
        Qi Building. If you take me, you'll gain the strength of a Qi Refining
        14th Star immediately!
      </p>
      <p>Please grant me this opportunity, seniors!"</p>
      <p>[Hmm...]</p>
      <p>
        [Five Energies Converging to the Origin... there certainly was such a
        thing...]
      </p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho and White Bone Ghost Devil of the Black Ghost Valley
        appeared indifferent, while Sir Chang-ho of the Heavenly Creation Sect
        showed significant interest.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, you speak the language of Byeokra. Are you from there?"</p>
      <p>
        He asked me in his native language instead of through consciousness, and
        I responded likewise.
      </p>
      <p>"...You could say that."</p>
      <p>"I have a branch family in Byeokra..."</p>
      <p>However, he seemed uninterested in me beyond a recommendation.</p>
      <p>I asked with gritted teeth.</p>
      <p>"Why won't you give me a chance! You won't regret taking me!"</p>
      <p>
        "Hmm... If it wasn't the time for the Ascension Gate to open, and you
        had come to the Heaven Creation Sect, or even to the Golden Divine
        Heavenly Thunder Sect or the Black Ghost Valley, you would have been
        good enough to be an inner disciple. But now it's different.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are already planning to promote our most important members in the
        sect during ascension, and every additional person increases our burden
        exponentially. These individuals have legendary, almost mythical
        qualities like the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Body, Ghostly Yin
        Transformation Immortal Root, and Unique Holy Body, which is why we are
        willing to bear that burden."
      </p>
      <p>So, my qualities are not enough to take me with them.</p>
      <p>I looked at the three Heavenly Being cultivators and asked.</p>
      <p>"Then, may I ask one thing?"</p>
      <p>[You dare, treating us as if we're free to indulge you!]</p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho roared angrily, and a bolt of lightning fell from the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>"Argh...!"</p>
      <p>I was struck by lightning, screaming in agony.</p>
      <p>It felt like my body was burning in flames.</p>
      <p>'Am I, dying...'</p>
      <p>"What a nasty temper."</p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>
        Sir Chang-ho flicked his finger, and wood element spiritual energy
        enveloped me with healing power.
      </p>
      <p>I was quickly healed from the electrical damage.</p>
      <p>"Cough...! Hah...!"</p>
      <p>[Heh, taking care of your fellow countryman, are you?]</p>
      <p>
        "You're all too quick-tempered. This junior might have something
        interesting to ask. It's too much to strike with lightning just for
        speaking."
      </p>
      <p>Sir Chang-ho commented, clicking his tongue.</p>
      <p>
        Trusting Sir Chang-ho, I decided to ask my question, even at the risk of
        dying.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Seniors, if you have no intention of taking me, could you kindly advise
        how one might surmount the barriers of the heavens themselves forbidding
        the path of Immortal Cultivation?
      </p>
      <p>
        I aim to reach Qi Refining 7th rank and perform the Seven Stars Ritual,
        but what should I do if dark clouds arise in the sky every time,
        blocking the heaven and earth spiritual energy?"
      </p>
      <p>White Bone Ghost Devil frowned at my question and pointed at me.</p>
      <p>Pop!</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, both my arms burst open.</p>
      <p>
        [Chang-ho indulged you, and now you overstep your bounds. Do you really
        think you have the right to speak to us?]
      </p>
      <p>"Jeez, if you don't know, just say you don't. Crazy, I tell you."</p>
      <p>Sir Chang-ho clicked his tongue and restored my arms.</p>
      <p>
        White Bone Ghost Devil pulled Kang Min-hee close to them, looking too
        annoyed to bother with me anymore, and floated into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmm, the phenomenon of Heavenly Rejection. I recall reading about it in
        the sect's archives.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho seemed somewhat interested in my question and pondered
        briefly before answering.
      </p>
      <p>
        [As far as I know, the ritual will break if someone else helps, so you
        should push away the anomalies of the Heavenly Rejection phenomenon
        yourself.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hahaha, look at his face sinking. Well, it's not helpful advice, is it?
        How is a Qi Refining cultivator supposed to fend off the Heavenly
        Rejection phenomenon with their own power? Even a three-year-old could
        give that answer!"
      </p>
      <p>[...Tch, what can I do? He's annoying! I'm leaving!]</p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho, frustrated, struck me with lightning again before floating
        away.
      </p>
      <p>"Argh!"</p>
      <p>
        Once again, I felt my body burning in pain, but Sir Chang-ho's healing
        technique barely saved my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...Thank you, Sir Chang-ho, sect leader of the Heaven Creation Sect and
        Cheongmun Clan."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's nothing. Tch... When you reach Heavenly Being, everyone's
        character becomes a bit off, so just bear with it. For now, I'll give
        you a recommendation for the Cheongmun Clan. With your consciousness,
        you would have been welcomed anywhere before the Ascension Gate opened,
        but it's a shame."
      </p>
      <p>I still bowed deeply before him and said.</p>
      <p>
        "Thank you for your words, but I plan to continue appealing to the many
        seniors passing through the Ascension Gate during this period."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hm? Even if you appeal, everyone else is busy taking their most
        important members and future talents with them. You won't find anyone to
        take care of you."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But... aren't there some who go alone, without a faction? I heard of
        one person with a hunchback and controls puppets, having no faction..."
      </p>
      <p>Sir Chang-ho frowned at my words.</p>
      <p>[What! You're going to appeal to the Mad Lord, that lunatic!]</p>
      <p>He exclaimed through consciousness, not vocal.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jin Byuk-ho and White Bone Ghost Devil, who were preparing
        to leave, looked back down.
      </p>
      <p>[The Mad Lord? Why is that crazy old man's title coming up?]</p>
      <p>[Why are you bringing up that spine-chilling lunatic?]</p>
      <p>'Uh...?'</p>
      <p>
        Their reactions were not good, even drawing the two cultivators back.
      </p>
      <p>Jin Byuk-ho's face was turning red with anger.</p>
      <p>
        [You... you're not planning to appeal to that crazy Mad Lord, are you!?]
      </p>
      <p>"Yes...?"</p>
      <p>
        I questioned in surprise, recalling how he had been friendly when he
        learned I was a martial artist who reached Five Energies Converging to
        the Origin in my past life, even gifting me the Hidden Consciousness
        Technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        White Bone Ghost Devil also sternly advised me with a hardened face.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You know about the Mad Lord, but do you not know what kind of person he
        is? He might seem sane at times, but he frequently suffers from madness
        and bouts of insanity. He's more terrifying and spine-chilling than any
        devil arts cultivator or clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might have read some sane records about him, but he is mostly
        insane, so do not engage with him!]
      </p>
      <p>Sir Chang-ho also spoke to me with a face full of concern.</p>
      <p>
        "Didn’t you say you were a martial artist of the Five Energies
        Converging to the Origin? The Mad Lord's peculiar obsession with martial
        artists is well-known. Wasn’t his young lover a martial artist from the
        Five Energies Converging to the Origin? Ever since her death, that
        madman became notorious for capturing martial artists and transforming
        them into puppet-like creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        I advise you not to approach him! If caught by the Mad Lord, you could
        be transformed into a living puppet!"
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>He shook his head in dismay and sighed.</p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, if you don’t want to throw your life away, not only should you
        avoid speaking to him, but also hide immediately if he appears to avoid
        being detected! Remember my words! Forget about unnecessary thoughts and
        take this recommendation letter to the Cheongmun Clan."
      </p>
      <p>
        I numbly received the recommendation letter from Sir Chang-ho, who
        repeatedly warned me against encountering the hunchback old man, the Mad
        Lord, before leaving.
      </p>
      <p>'...What’s the deal with him?'</p>
      <p>
        I recalled the seemingly sane hunchback old man, feeling deep conflict
        within.
      </p>
      <p>'No, before that...'</p>
      <p>
        I pondered, looking at Manager Kim Yeon, who seemed puzzled by my
        conversation with the cultivators in the language of Byeokra.
      </p>
      <p>'I should do something about Manager Kim...'</p>
      <p>
        If what they said was true, it wouldn’t be good for Manager Kim Yeon to
        be caught by the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        'But even if I intervene, Manager Kim will awaken that vast
        consciousness, and the Mad Lord will come for her...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Having properly learned cultivation, I now understood the status and
        ability of Heavenly Being cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just their thoughts could naturally resonate with heaven and earth
        spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>How could I possibly contend with such monsters?</p>
      <p>
        Not figuratively, they could literally turn a country to dust in a
        single blow.
      </p>
      <p>Amidst worry and anxiety.</p>
      <p>
        Once again, Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo awakened the power of calling wind
        and rain..
      </p>
      <p>
        Sea Dragon King Seo Hweol, sensing the origin of her power, came to take
        her.
      </p>
      <p>I kneeled before Seo Hweol and asked a question.</p>
      <p>
        "I, a mere mortal, wish to ask a question to Lord Sea Dragon King.
        Please graciously accept my inquiry..."
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm, go ahead.]</p>
      <p>
        "Do you, Lord Sea Dragon King, know of a cultivator called the Mad
        Lord?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, Sea Dragon King Seo Hweol, who had never lost his
        solemn and dignified expression, suddenly contorted his face.
      </p>
      <p>[That damn lunatic... Ahem. Why do you ask about that madman?]</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>It is now clear.</p>
      <p>The hunchback old man.</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord is indeed a madman feared by all.</p>
      <p>'To see such a reaction from the composed Sea Dragon King...'</p>
      <p>"...I wish to know why everyone dislikes the Mad Lord."</p>
      <p>
        [Drop the honorifics for that bastard. That madman has a very perverse
        sexual desire, using his puppets for it. Although most Heavenly Being
        cultivators have some mental issues after living for thousands of
        years...
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord is one who's sane in just one aspect, and insane in all
        others. Never engage or converse with him! He usually captures those who
        speak with him, transforming them into living puppets.]
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>I was speechless, my face blank with shock.</p>
      <p>I also realized how lucky I had been so far.</p>
      <p>
        'No, was it because he was very pleased to take Manager Kim Yeon as his
        disciple..?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, other individuals, despite their ferocious nature, left us
        alone, but...
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord always tried to kill me and Kim Young-hoon, persisting only
        because Manager Kim stopped him.
      </p>
      <p>'Every time, we would have died if Manager Kim hadn’t intervened.'</p>
      <p>Thinking more about it, he was indeed a madman.</p>
      <p>To leave Manager Kim to such a madman would be too cruel.</p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>I kneeled before the Sea Dragon King and begged.</p>
      <p>
        "Please, Lord Sea Dragon King...kindly accept this woman, Kim Yeon, as
        your disciple or kin..!"
      </p>
      <p>[...What? Why should I do that?]</p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol, who seemed agitated by the mention of the Mad Lord, returned
        to his usual demeanor and questioned me.
      </p>
      <p>I explained everything to him.</p>
      <p>
        We are beings from another world, each having gained unique abilities
        upon coming to this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Manager Kim Yeon is soon to awaken a consciousness surpassing even
        Heavenly Being cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the Mad Lord covets her talents, likely to take her as his
        disciple.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hmm... Hearing your situation, it's quite pitiable. Caught in the eyes
        of the Mad Lord...]
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Lord Sea Dragon King seemed more moved by the Mad Lord's
        interest in Manager Kim than by our sudden arrival from another world.
      </p>
      <p>[But how do you know all this?]</p>
      <p>"...This is the ability I have gained."</p>
      <p>
        [Hmm, something like a prophecy? I refuse if you’re asking to be taken
        too. Those who have reached a certain realm have a sense of fate and
        know roughly about the future. Prophetic abilities are the most
        useless.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "...I do not mind. Please, I beseech Lord Sea Dragon King to take her."
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm...]</p>
      <p>Seo Hweol seemed to ponder for a moment before speaking.</p>
      <p>
        [It's a big burden for me to take another person. Taking this girl is
        already a huge burden, but I'm willing because her abilities will be a
        tremendous help to my race...
      </p>
      <p>But to take another one...]</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        [However, I'm too worried about what might happen to her with the Mad
        Lord, and if what you say is true, her consciousness might indeed be
        useful...]
      </p>
      <p>He looked at me narrowly, pondering.</p>
      <p>
        [...What if what you said is a lie? If that girl doesn’t awaken any
        abilities, she's unappealing to me...]
      </p>
      <p>
        "If Lord Sea Dragon King believes I have lied, then you may devour me.
        According to my ability, she will awaken her power within today, so just
        wait until then."
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm...]</p>
      <p>After a moment of thought, he slowly nodded.</p>
      <p>
        [If her ability is a lie, I’ll just leave her near the Ascension Gate.
        The Mad Lord won’t be interested in her anyway. But... the Mad Lord’s
        power is so immense that if he notices her awakening, it might be hard
        even for me to contend...]
      </p>
      <p>"...!"</p>
      <p>
        [If her ability is as you say, it could be very helpful, so I'll keep an
        eye on it.]
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Lord Sea Dragon King!"</p>
      <p>
        After speaking, Sea Dragon King approached Manager Kim Yeon and grasped
        her wrist too.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Yeon, unaware of what was happening, struggled in surprise.</p>
      <p>[Hmm, quite rebellious. Sleep for a while.]</p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>
        A gentle wave of consciousness from Sea Dragon King put Kim Yeon, Kim
        Young-hoon, and Oh Hye-seo to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        [...I ended up talking more than expected. Since fate has brought us
        here, I can’t take you, but I can let you out of the Ascension Path. How
        about it?]
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>
        Sea Dragon King flicked his finger, and a spatial rift opened inside the
        cave, revealing a dark entrance.
      </p>
      <p>
        '...Well, if Manager Kim goes with Sea Dragon King, there's no reason
        for the Mad Lord to come here...'
      </p>
      <p>
        After thinking for a moment, I approached the sleeping Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I formed a hand seal.</p>
      <p>My consciousness connected with his upper dantian.</p>
      <p>
        I touched his forehead and used the same technique my master had passed
        down in my previous life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge of Yanguo, Byeokra, and a bit of Shengzi’s language seeped
        into Kim Young-hoon’s mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with the Severing Vein Saber Method, Severing Mountain
        Swordsmanship, and various martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the Record of Surpassing Path and Martial Arts, Record of Gazing
        Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts, and other techniques accumulated
        by Kim Young-hoon in my past life.
      </p>
      <p>
        '...In this life, I hope you, Kim Hyung, won’t face danger because of
        me.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, I imparted the cruel deeds of the Makli Clan and the information
        that killing Emperor Makli Jung would reduce their atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Kim Young-hoon kills Emperor Makli Jung, the Jin Clan wouldn’t
        uselessly operate assassination squads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, my disciples would naturally return to being ordinary people under
        the Jin Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        After imparting knowledge to Kim Young-hoon, I placed him into the
        spatial rift.
      </p>
      <p>"Goodbye, Kim Hyung."</p>
      <p>I might not see him again in this life.</p>
      <p>[Ho, aren't you going?]</p>
      <p>"...No."</p>
      <p>I breathed in the air of Ascension Path</p>
      <p>
        Outside the Ascension Gate, the heaven and earth spiritual energy here
        was denser than in Yanguo and Byeokra.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if I went outside, I wouldn't be able to break through Qi Refining
        7th star.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, in this life, I will train within Ascension Path, amidst this
        dense spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>I will continuously perform rituals for the heavens.</p>
      <p>Sincerity can move the heavens.</p>
      <p>
        '...Will the insights and techniques my master imparted upon me become
        meaningless?'
      </p>
      <p>If the heavens forbid,</p>
      <p>Until the heavens grow weary or insane,</p>
      <p>I will devote this life to earning heavens' permission.</p>
      <p>
        The Ascension Path has much denser spiritual energy, so there might be a
        different possibility.
      </p>
      <p>"I wish to remain in the Ascension Path."</p>
      <p>
        [Hmm... You intend to cultivate within the spiritual energy of Ascension
        Path? Not a bad idea. However, this place is difficult to enter for
        anyone below the level of Nascent Soul. Heavenly Being cultivators have
        already taken all living creatures above Qi Building and Core Formation
        as materials... If you train here, you'll spend decades in immense
        solitude.]
      </p>
      <p>"...I am prepared for that."</p>
      <p>
        [Well, if that's the case, there's nothing I can do. I wish you luck.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol nodded and closed the spatial rift. Holding Kim Yeon and Oh
        Hye-seo, he then stepped outside the cave.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        A blue light enveloped my vision, and soon, a blue dragon was seen
        soaring into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>I stepped out of the cave and looked up at the heavens.</p>
      <p>
        In this life, I will continuously seek the heavens' permission from
        within Ascension Path.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I devote fifty years to constant rituals, even the heavens will not
        dare to deny me!
      </p>
      <p>'Master, your disciple...'</p>
      <p>I will ensure the knowledge you imparted does not go to waste!</p>
      <p>With this vow for my current life, I gazed at the sky.</p>

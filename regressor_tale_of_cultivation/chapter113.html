      <p>Chapter 113: What You Trampled On / The Path You Have Tread (1)</p>
      <p>Three days before Yuan Li's arrival.</p>
      <p>"I will kill him."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin sighed softly as he looked at me.</p>
      <p>
        As the Core Formation cultivator who first discovered the Yuan Li
        massacre, Cheongmun Jung-jin was given temporary command of this Yuan Li
        hunting group.
      </p>
      <p>He looked at me with a dark expression and said,</p>
      <p>
        "I too want to tear that person to shreds. But we need a plan. Right
        now, although about 150 Core Formation cultivators have gathered, we've
        had little time to meet and discuss. To face that old monster... we need
        more time."
      </p>
      <p>"...."</p>
      <p>
        "I fully understand that some of the Core Formation cultivators,
        including you, are blinded by rage. However, now is the time to unite
        our strength. Being uncooperative will only hinder us."
      </p>
      <p>"...My goal is to kill him."</p>
      <p>
        "...If the plan devised by the formation masters succeeds, we can be
        free from the terror caused by Yuan Li for a considerable amount of
        time. It would be even better if Yuan Li reaches the end of his lifespan
        during this period."
      </p>
      <p>Clench...</p>
      <p>I ground my teeth and tears of black curses stream down.</p>
      <p>"Are you saying... I can't kill him with my own hands...."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin sighed deeply.</p>
      <p>
        "Why wouldn't I want to tear him into thousands of pieces... But if this
        plan fails, that devil will unhesitatingly unleash a massacre across the
        entire continent, just like we experienced. Right now, with not a single
        Nascent Soul cultivator among us, there will be no one to stop him."
      </p>
      <p>"...."</p>
      <p>
        "Please... for the peace of the entire continent... help us. Everyone
        gathered here... must unite and participate in the plan..."
      </p>
      <p>I looked at Cheongmun Jung-jin.</p>
      <p>His intent was also tainted with pain.</p>
      <p>
        "Please lend your strength. The head of the Gongmyo clan has even
        brought out the secret techniques of his clan..."
      </p>
      <p>At his request, I clenched my teeth.</p>
      <p>"...Then, I will set a condition."</p>
      <p>"What is it?"</p>
      <p>
        "I will cooperate with the plan and follow the lead of the clan head,
        but if an opportunity arises, I will do my utmost to kill Yuan Li.
        That's my condition."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Understood. That's only natural. Not just you... practically everyone
        here intends to do the same."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin nodded, confirmed my participation in the plan, and
        then went to persuade the elderly man in mourning clothes, who had been
        shouting loudly about killing Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        I watched Cheongmun Jung-jin for a moment, then looked again at the plan
        devised by the numerous Core Formation cultivators and formation
        masters.
      </p>
      <p>'Will it succeed?'</p>
      <p>The chances of success are high.</p>
      <p>
        If their plan works, the world will be peaceful for hundreds of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt peace for hundreds of years even in my previous life after the
        Heaven-Treading Desert massacre.
      </p>
      <p>'If it succeeds... does my revenge get pushed back?'</p>
      <p>Is that the right thing to do?</p>
      <p>At this moment, can I endure not tearing his flesh apart?</p>
      <p>'...I'll do my best.'</p>
      <p>
        At an opportune moment, without the need for such a complex plan by the
        Core Formation cultivators, I will kill Yuan Li...!
      </p>
      <p>And so, three days later.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li began to appear beyond the horizon.</p>
      <p>
        I tightly grasp the Formless Sword, recalling the conversation I had
        with Cheongmun Jung-jin a few days ago.
      </p>
      <p>'I will kill him right here, leaving no reason for the plan.'</p>
      <p>I exert all my strength from the start.</p>
      <p>
        Maintaining the stance of Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains, I directly
        connect the meridians made of energy to the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>I am putting my life on the line.</p>
      <p>Kuang!</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword, faster than anyone else's attack, shoots out and
        collides with Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, my Formless Sword is blocked by just the blood clouds
        surrounding Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>Cheok Cheok Cheok Cheok Cheok</p>
      <p>
        Other Core Formation cultivators line up behind me, each casting their
        spells and dharma treasures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dharma treasures corresponding to water, fire, wind, and lightning
        pierce through Yuan Li's blood clouds.
      </p>
      <p>"Die, you evil ghost!"</p>
      <p>
        The old man in mourning clothes, who had lost his grandson to Yuan Li,
        spews a purple wheel-shaped dharma treasure from his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the openings in the blood clouds created by the other
        cultivators, the old man and other Core Formation cultivators launch
        their dharma treasures.
      </p>
      <p>Kuang Kuang Kuang!</p>
      <p>Bright explosions flash, and Yuan Li grins eerily.</p>
      <p>Screech!</p>
      <p>Beyond the explosions, a curtain of red light flares.</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, he takes out four red pagodas and spreads a barrier around
        himself.
      </p>
      <p>'It's become tougher.'</p>
      <p>
        When I last fought with Yuan Li, who was then only at Core Formation,
        the barrier would have wavered after a few strikes probably due to
        absorbing only Core Formation spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, even after the bombardment of dharma treasures by me and other
        Core Formation cultivators, the barrier, imbued with Nascent Soul
        spiritual power, remains unshaken.
      </p>
      <p>[Tsk, tsk, all this noise is quite bothersome.]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li sneers and raises his hand.</p>
      <p>"Block it!"</p>
      <p>"The old monster is using his power!"</p>
      <p>"Attack with all you've got!"</p>
      <p>
        Almost 100 Core Formation cultivators simultaneously pour out their
        strongest dharma treasures and spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heaven and earth tremble, and the nearby desert melts into glass,
        while sandstorms spread in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>Kuaaang!</p>
      <p>
        Due to the combined attacks of the Core Formation cultivators, a pit
        about 5 Li (2.5 km) in diameter and 1 Li (500 m) deep formed.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>The landscape changes, and the earth rumbles.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>Beyond the explosion, blood clouds surge within.</p>
      <p>"Ugh, insane…!"</p>
      <p>"He's still not dead after that…!?"</p>
      <p>Fear appears on the faces of the Core Formation cultivators.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li clicks his tongue, and the sound echoes in all directions.</p>
      <p>
        [If I were just an ordinary early Nascent Soul, I might have been in
        danger. But alas... I am not just any ordinary early Nascent Soul, and
        moreover, you lot are lowly beings who couldn't even participate in the
        recent ascension, are you not?]
      </p>
      <p>Shiiing!</p>
      <p>Inside the blood cloud, a bloody radiance begins to burst forth.</p>
      <p>
        "Everyone, form up and prepare the formation. The old monster is about
        to use his spell!"
      </p>
      <p>I shout in all directions, glaring at Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>
        For several days, thanks to the testimony of two survivors who barely
        survived Yuan Li in the Northern Grasslands, and including myself, the
        characteristics of Yuan Li's spells spread among all Core Formation
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the Core Formation cultivators who heard our testimony knew
        somewhat about Yuan Li's spells and its power.
      </p>
      <p>"Everyone, this way!!"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin and Gongmyo Ryeong shout loudly, standing side by
        side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Numerous Core Formation cultivators join them, and they quickly arrange
        a protective formation they had practiced for the past days.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a simple protective formation that lower-level cultivators learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when Core Formation cultivators deploy it, their combined
        spiritual power forms an immense defensive force.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Yuan Li's spell explodes.</p>
      <p>
        Bloody radiance swirls in all directions, and the four corners of the
        world seem to be engulfed in blood.
      </p>
      <p>Crackle, sizzle!</p>
      <p>
        The protective formation looks like it will break at any moment, but the
        formation constructed by over 100 Core Formation cultivators did not
        easily shatter.
      </p>
      <p>Shhhh!</p>
      <p>After a while, the blood light subsides.</p>
      <p>
        Beyond the diminishing blood radiance, we can see Yuan Li preparing a
        spell of similar magnitude again.
      </p>
      <p>"Attack again!"</p>
      <p>"Don't give him any openings!"</p>
      <p>
        Around 140 Core Formation cultivators divided into five groups,
        attacking Yuan Li from all sides and the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        I swing my Formless Sword wildly, never taking my eyes off Yuan Li's
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multicolored dharma treasures and spells bombard the barrier around Yuan
        Li.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li completes his spell again.</p>
      <p>"Blood, Tree, Sea!"</p>
      <p>Charrarararack!</p>
      <p>Yuan Li absorbs the blood clouds around him.</p>
      <p>Then, Yuan Li takes out a staff.</p>
      <p>The wooden staff with the red crystal skull embedded in it.</p>
      <p>
        Small branches, like baby fingers, densely grow on the staff and emit a
        deep red glow.
      </p>
      <p>Charrarararack!</p>
      <p>The small branches on the staff grow wildly in all directions.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>"Evade! Don't touch it!"</p>
      <p>"No, don't go there!"</p>
      <p>
        The branches engulf the surroundings, forming a bloody forest around
        Yuan Li in the desert.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Core Formation cultivators fail to evade Yuan Li's attack and are
        trapped in his ‘Tree Sea,’ quickly turning into shriveled husks as all
        their vital force (Qi) and blood are drained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, at the center of the Tree Sea, looks to have recovered the
        energy he had just spent after devouring several Core Formation
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>"Damn, such a monster...! But you can't take us all down...."</p>
      <p>Charrack, charrack, charrack!</p>
      <p>Seven scrolls float around Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>"Release!"</p>
      <p>
        As he forms a spell, the demon souls painted in blood on the scrolls are
        released.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, unlike when they fought me before, the demon souls do not split
        to face different opponents but start to merge in the air.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        As one demon soul overlaps with another, their power increases
        dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>Keeng Keeng Keeng!</p>
      <p>
        The demon souls, initially at the Core Formation level, gradually
        surpass the peak of Core Formation mid-stage, reaching late-stage and
        even the level of Core Formation Grand Perfection.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Keeng Keeng Keeeeeng!</p>
      <p>
        When the seven demon souls completely merge, they form a shape that is
        neither beast nor human, but a bizarre aberration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power emanating from the bizarre soul reaches the level of the
        Nascent Soul.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, aah..."</p>
      <p>"Haha..."</p>
      <p>
        Although the energy felt from the demon soul indicated it is not a true
        Nascent Soul, and using more than seven or eight spells would exhaust
        its energy, the important thing is that another Nascent Soul-level force
        has appeared right beside Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>Kiiaaaah!</p>
      <p>But that isn't the end.</p>
      <p>
        When Yuan Li opens his storage device, ghostly wails resound and the
        blood water I had seen before surges out, transforming into two ghost
        kings wielding scythes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, the ghost kings enter the blood clouds surrounding Yuan Li,
        merging with it completely.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li's blood clouds conglomerate, forming the shapes of the two ghost
        kings.
      </p>
      <p>"Insane..."</p>
      <p>"Not even a normal Nascent Soul cultivator..."</p>
      <p>
        The newly strengthened ghost kings, each slightly less powerful than an
        early Nascent Soul, combine to have enough strength to match the early
        Nascent Soul stage.
      </p>
      <p>[So, will you continue to try, you bugs?]</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>"Don't give up, everyone!"</p>
      <p>It’s Gongmyo Ryeong, the head of the Gongmyo clan.</p>
      <p>
        Despite her pale complexion, Gongmyo Ryeong, a beautiful woman in a
        brown robe, takes out numerous dharma treasures and shouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We all knew we couldn't face a Nascent Soul cultivator anyway! Stick to
        the original plan and push him back!"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, that's right…! If we just follow the plan…!"</p>
      <p>"Right! We can definitely handle this!"</p>
      <p>[Hoh...?]</p>
      <p>
        The Core Formation cultivators, valuing their own lives, were cautious
        and did not directly confront Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the days leading up to Yuan Li's arrival, they had already
        prepared a strategy to face him, and they are all moving according to
        that plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, a few of us, including me, are trying to seize any
        opportunity to kill Yuan Li, regardless of the plan.
      </p>
      <p>'I'll kill him.'</p>
      <p>No need for the plan.</p>
      <p>
        Isn't it just a compromise offered by those afraid to confront Yuan Li
        directly?
      </p>
      <p>He can be killed.</p>
      <p>If only a chance appears!</p>
      <p>Kuang Kuaaaang!</p>
      <p>"Aaargh!"</p>
      <p>"Monster...!"</p>
      <p>
        Pushed back by the combined forces of the bizarre soul and the ghost
        kings, the Core Formation cultivators are being overwhelmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, even in the midst of this, they madly charge at Yuan Li, pushing
        him back.
      </p>
      <p>"Die, you old monster!"</p>
      <p>
        Alongside the old man wearing mourning clothes, I furiously attack Yuan
        Li.
      </p>
      <p>Fssht Fssssht!</p>
      <p>
        Our attacks gradually crack the protective pagoda barrier surrounding
        Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>"Die! Perish! Vanish!!!"</p>
      <p>
        The old man in mourning clothes weeps tears of blood as he pours out
        spells, and I too, shedding tears of black, mix curses with my Formless
        Sword, striking down the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Including me and the old man, one or two other Core Formation
        cultivators who have lost relatives to Yuan Li and crazed with the
        intent to kill joined the attack on the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Boooom!</p>
      <p>With our combined attacks, the pagoda barrier finally breaks.</p>
      <p>"Push forward!!"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin roars from the back.</p>
      <p>
        Elders from the Cheongmun Clan, seeing the breach in Yuan Li's barrier,
        charge towards him.
      </p>
      <p>Kuaang!</p>
      <p>
        Three elders from the Cheongmun Clan cling to Yuan Li, pushing him to
        one spot.
      </p>
      <p>[You insects, how dare you touch me.]</p>
      <p>Shwack!</p>
      <p>Above Yuan Li, three translucent blood-red banners appear.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        However, my Formless Sword sweeps away the Five Elements Blood Curse
        Banners. Along with the Cheongmun elders, some Core Formation
        cultivators charge at Yuan Li while others press him with dharma
        treasures and spells.
      </p>
      <p>[These bugs…?]</p>
      <p>
        Realizing the direction he’s being pushed towards, Yuan Li looks at us
        and speaks.
      </p>
      <p>[What scheme is this?]</p>
      <p>"Die!!!"</p>
      <p>"I'll rip your head off."</p>
      <p>
        The old man in mourning clothes and I hurl our Formless Sword and
        wheel-shaped dharma treasure at Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>Then, Yuan Li opens his mouth.</p>
      <p>Shwaaaak!</p>
      <p>Seventeen bone dagger dharma treasures sprung from his mouth.</p>
      <p>Chirring Chirrring!</p>
      <p>
        The daggers emit a strange sound, scattering blood-red energy in all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>"Wait! Everyone, scatter!"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin's voice echoes, and the elders of the Cheongmun clan
        hastily retreat.
      </p>
      <p>
        However some Core Formation cultivators who are too slow to react fail
        to dodge Yuan Li's dharma treasures.
      </p>
      <p>Shwaaack!</p>
      <p>A blood-red cleaving force extends in all directions.</p>
      <p>
        Those who are close to Yuan Li are instantly torn to shreds, and their
        vital force (Qi) and blood are devoured by the blood clouds surrounding
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment, screams resound from within the blood clouds, but they
        quickly fade away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, who then absorbs the surrounding blood clouds, begins to regain
        his energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        [It’s tiresome dealing with such a large swarm of insects. Had I reached
        the mid-stage of Nascent Soul, none of you would have stood a chance and
        would have become mere fodder for me.]
      </p>
      <p>"He's recovering!"</p>
      <p>"Stop him!"</p>
      <p>
        The first to rush towards Yuan Li are the old man in mourning clothes
        and I.
      </p>
      <p>"Die!"</p>
      <p>"Die!"</p>
      <p>We shout in unison, pouring our attacks onto Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>Shwaaack!</p>
      <p>The dagger dharma treasures slash widely, targeting us.</p>
      <p>
        However, the old man in mourning robes uses a mysterious technique to
        block the slashes, and I cover my whole body with the Formless Sword to
        fend them off.
      </p>
      <p>Kuaang!</p>
      <p>
        The old man and I charge at Yuan Li, pushing him back with almost
        body-slamming force.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin's voice grows louder from behind.</p>
      <p>"We're almost there! Formation masters, get ready!"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        In the space between the old man and me, Cheongmun Jung-jin crashes in
        with his heavy body, emanating a blue dull glow.
      </p>
      <p>[You… insects…!]</p>
      <p>
        And finally, the plan devised by the Core Formation cultivators to
        confront Yuan Li activates.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin, exerting his strength, strikes Yuan Li. Yuan Li's
        body is sucked into the inner barrier of the black castle in the eastern
        region.
      </p>
      <p>"Indeed, the master is not hindered by its barriers."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin sneers at Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>
        I bite my lip, glaring at him, then gather my spiritual power and form a
        seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together with other formation masters, we channel our spiritual power
        into the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>'I couldn't kill him.’</p>
      <p>Crack...</p>
      <p>A fever radiates from the top of my head.</p>
      <p>But Cheongmun Jung-jin's words echo in my mind.</p>
      <p>
        <em
          >"Why wouldn't I want to tear him into thousands of pieces... But if
          this plan fails, that devil will unhesitatingly unleash a massacre
          across the entire continent, just like we experienced. Right now, with
          not a single Nascent Soul cultivator among us, there will be no one to
          stop him."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >"Please... for the peace of the entire continent... help us. Everyone
          gathered here... must unite and participate in the plan..."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>Crack...</p>
      <p>
        I grit my teeth and, together with other formation masters, contribute
        my spiritual power to the barrier above the formation.
      </p>
      <p>'No choice this time.'</p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>"I will...!"</p>
      <p>Next time.</p>
      <p>"I will pluck your head and take it away!"</p>
      <p>To avenge their souls...!</p>
      <p>
        Tears mixed with curses stream down as I, along with other formation
        masters, deploy the sealing formation using the barrier of the black
        castle.
      </p>
      <p>"Seal!"</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Above Yuan Li's location, multi-colored rays of light swirl, turning
        into a prison that traps him.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        As the formation masters deploy the sealing formation, other cultivators
        move the dragon veins around with their unique techniques.
      </p>
      <p>"Yang Heaven."</p>
      <p>
        The head of the Jin clan, Jin Ye-woon, and his elders channel the Yang
        attribute dragon veins into the formation.
      </p>
      <p>"Yin Deity!"</p>
      <p>
        The head of the Makli clan, Makli Hwang-cheon, and his elders bring in
        the Yin attribute dragon veins..
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin and Yang are attached to the formation, and the heads of each clan
        add the dragon veins corresponding to Dui (☱), Li (☲), Zhen (☳), Xun
        (☴), Kan (☵), and Gen (☶), completing the Eight Trigrams.
      </p>
      <p>
        The head of the Gongmyo Clan, Gongmyo Ryeong, and three Core Formation
        lords from the Eastern States form seals above the sealing formation,
        completing it.
      </p>
      <p>"Eight Trigrams Spirit Absorbing Sealing Formation! Seal!"</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The dragon veins flowing through the Heaven-Treading Desert connect to
        the formation, completing it.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kuang Kuaaaang!</p>
      <p>
        Inside the formation, blood-red flashes appear as the formation trembles
        violently.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's useless! The Eight Trigrams Spirit Absorbing Sealing Formation,
        passed down in the Gongmyo clan, can imprison even a Nascent Soul
        cultivator if properly deployed. Moreover, the formation masters spent
        days researching the peculiar barrier in your castle, enhancing the
        formation with its characteristics. Unless you reach the Heavenly Being
        stage, no, even before the mid-stage of Heavenly Being, you absolutely
        cannot escape this formation!"
      </p>
      <p>Boom...</p>
      <p>
        With Gongmyo Ryeong's words, the echoing reverberations from within
        ceases.
      </p>
      <p>Then, Yuan Li's voice resounds.</p>
      <p>
        [A splendid sealing formation. It seems I won't be able to easily
        escape.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "You old monster, I don't know how much life you have left, but you'll
        probably spend the rest of it trapped in there until you die of old
        age!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gongmyo Ryeong's confident words are met with silence from inside the
        formation, which is soon followed by booming laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ha ha ha! How amusing. Remember this, you will regret it when I break
        free from this seal.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Gongmyo Ryeong seems flustered by his confident words but chuckles and
        looks down at the formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Old monster, you brag too much! Do you think this formation is so easy
        to break? Have you lived all these years in vain?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [Tsk tsk, I'm not so unwise, young one. Think about it. If you are Core
        Formation cultivators, read the celestial energy! Read the
        constellations and see what kind of place this is...!]
      </p>
      <p>"What?"</p>
      <p>Confused, Gongmyo Ryeong looks down at the sealing formation.</p>
      <p>
        [Kekeke… Do you not understand? Here's a hint. Where did the last
        Liberation Palace appear?]
      </p>
      <p>"What...?"</p>
      <p>
        At his words, one of the lords of the Eastern States looks up at the sky
        with wide eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it’s broad daylight, Core Formation cultivators have enhanced
        abilities to read celestial energy, allowing them to interpret
        constellations even during the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wait...! Considering these coordinates... and the location of the last
        Liberation Palace... calculating the next position..."
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, fear flashes in the lord's eyes.</p>
      <p>"It's here! The Liberation Palace will appear near this place!"</p>
      <p>
        At these words, one of the chiefs from the Northern Grasslands widen
        their eyes in shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Serving Command Palace!? This place is where the next Serving
        Command Palace will appear...!?"
      </p>
      <p>"What...! The Serving Command Palace will appear...?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, it will! If you consider the pattern of the Liberation Palace and
        its previous appearance, it will appear near here! In 200 years, this
        seal will be useless!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the Core Formation cultivators all stare at the sealing
        formation with fear-stricken eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ha ha ha, foolish insects. Did you not consider Serving Command
        Palace...? I will be freed in 200 years. Until then, I will collect my
        Blood Spirits and use my stored resources, raising my cultivation to the
        late stage of Nascent Soul. Prepare yourselves to fight a late-stage
        Nascent Soul cultivator in 200 years...!]
      </p>
      <p>"This is madness!"</p>
      <p>"How stupid! Why didn't we think of the Serving Command Palace!"</p>
      <p>
        "Who could have calculated such a thing! The last appearance of the
        Serving Command Palace was 200 years ago, and its appearance here was
        thousands of years ago!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "What fools we are! Now, because of the Liberation Palace, this devil
        will be released!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Core Formation cultivators from various factions raise their voices
        in anger, and I, along with two other hermit cultivators, look around
        stupidly.
      </p>
      <p>It seems we, who don't belong to any faction, lacked information.</p>
      <p>
        The old man in mourning clothes, who tried to kill Yuan Li with me,
        shouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What are you saying! What is this Liberation Palace, and what's with
        the Serving Command Palace? I know roughly what the Serving Command
        Palace is, but why would the seal be broken if the Serving Command
        Palace appears near here!"
      </p>
      <p>
        At the old man's question, Gongmyo Ryeong bites her lip and explains.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You probably didn’t have the opportunity to access such information,
        being a loose cultivator. Serving Command Palace is also known as
        Liberation Palace. It symbolizes liberation, and when the Serving
        Command Palace appears, the heaven and earth energy in that area
        resonates with the symbol of liberation, releasing what is trapped."
      </p>
      <p>"What...? The Serving Command Palace has such power?"</p>
      <p>I also pah close attention to her words.</p>
      <p>
        'Is this the reason Yuan Li caused a massacre and appeared 200 years
        later?'
      </p>
      <p>Gongmyo Ryeong continues her explanation.</p>
      <p>
        "Among high-level cultivators, there's a rumor that Serving Command
        Palace was originally created to liberate something sleeping somewhere
        in this world. Whether it's an immortal treasure, a mythological
        lineage, or the soul of an ancient being, no one knows."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Whatever the purpose of Serving Command Palace might be, I don't care.
        What are you trying to say? It's not what I'm thinking, is it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Fellow cultivator, your thoughts are probably correct. Simply put, if
        there's a seal where the Serving Command Palace appears, that seal will
        resonate with the energy of liberation from the Serving Command Palace,
        completely breaking down or significantly weakening."
      </p>
      <p>"That means…"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin, finishing the old man, speaks seriously.</p>
      <p>
        "It means that this old monster will be released again when Serving
        Command Palace descends in 200 years."
      </p>
      <p>Color drains from the faces of numerous Core Formation cultivators.</p>
      <p>Amidst their fear, Cheongmun Jung-jin shouts.</p>
      <p>"Listen, everyone!"</p>
      <p>All eyes turn to him.</p>
      <p>
        "There's no need to tremble in fear! This might be a blessing in
        disguise!"
      </p>
      <p>"What do you mean, Cheongmun Clan head?"</p>
      <p>
        "When the old monster started his massacre, Core Formation cultivators
        from all over the continent urgently gathered to confront Yuan Li.
        Surely, not everyone was in their best condition, right?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, that's right!"</p>
      <p>
        "Indeed. I had to rush out of my alchemy session when I heard a Nascent
        Soul old monster is on a killing spree. I couldn’t show my true
        strength!"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin continues.</p>
      <p>
        "200 years might not be a long time for us, but it's certainly not short
        either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if all the geniuses of the continent ascended with the Heavenly
        Being seniors, only those with the potential to reach Nascent Soul did
        so. There are still plenty of talents with the potential to reach Core
        Formation! Over the next 200 years, we can cultivate more talents,
        increase the number of Core Formation cultivators, and prepare
        thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as we trapped this old monster with just a few days of preparation,
        with 200 years of preparation, we can capture even a late-stage Nascent
        Soul old monster, or even a Nascent Soul at Grand Perfection!"
      </p>
      <p>
        His words gradually brighten the expressions of the Core Formation
        cultivators scattered around.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In 200 years! We will prepare for that time to capture this Nascent
        Soul old monster! Of course, if the old monster dies of old age within
        200 years, all the better... but if not, we have talents to nurture and
        a future to look forward to! We can prepare even more!"
      </p>
      <p>
        As he speaks, I finally begin to grasp the full extent of what I had
        been wondering about through my repeated returns.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Remembering the massacre in the Heaven-Treading Desert that occurred
        this time, let's prepare for the great war with the old monster in 200
        years!"
      </p>
      <p>10th year of regression.</p>
      <p>
        Due to a small butterfly effect caused by the actions of the Mad Lord,
      </p>
      <p>The Heaven-Treading Desert massacre was brought forward by decades.</p>
      <p>
        As a result, the entire continent began to prepare for the war against
        Yuan Li, the Bloodwood Practitioner, which would take place in 200
        years.

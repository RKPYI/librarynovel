      <p>Chapter 52: Heavens Above (2)</p>
      <p>
        The night passed, and dawn broke. Then, I witnessed something
        extraordinary.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>
        The stone saber I had made for the imaginary Kim Young-hoon, which I had
        split in half, began to float in the air.
      </p>
      <p>'Uh...?'</p>
      <p>
        A faint figure started to reappear. The figure I had split in two. Each
        half of the figure, now holding the upper and lower parts of the saber,
        began to grow new bodies on their opposite sides.
      </p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle-</p>
      <p>
        New bodies fully formed, and the reality of the two Kim Young-hoons
        became clear again. This time as well, they were Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two Kim Young-hoons, each holding a saber, aimed at me. Their
        transparent eyes asked me to stop my futile thoughts and engage in a
        duel.
      </p>
      <p>"Heh, hehehe..."</p>
      <p>
        I felt saliva dripping from my mouth. My eyes bloodshot, I chuckled and
        stood up shakily, holding the stone sword.
      </p>
      <p>"Hahaha...!"</p>
      <p>I rushed towards the two Kim Young-hoons.</p>
      <p>
        Crazy or not, what did it matter? Yes, let's just play and think later.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was another six months before I managed to defeat the two Kim
        Young-hoons. I roamed around, engaging in battles with them. Finally, I
        elevated my Severing Mountain Swordsmanship to the extreme and succeeded
        in cutting down both Kim Young-hoons simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        There lay the bisected corpses of the two Kim Young-hoons, still smiling
        eerily.
      </p>
      <p>"...Aren't you resentful that I've cut you down?"</p>
      <p>
        Despite being bisected, the two Kim Young-hoons shook their heads.
        Seemingly, they were happy to see my martial arts improve. From the
        bisected bodies of the two Kim Young-hoons, new bodies began to sprout
        again.
      </p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle...</p>
      <p>
        Now, the two Kim Young-hoons have become four. Each of them was armed
        and surrounded me. The fight was about to get even tougher.
      </p>
      <p>"Alright, let's do this!"</p>
      <p>
        Months passed again. Whenever the time was right, I held rituals towards
        the heavens, and each time they failed, I, along with the now six Kim
        Young-hoons, would demolish the altar.
      </p>
      <p>"Why! Why! Why!"</p>
      <p>
        I screamed towards the heavens, smashing the altar with the Kim
        Young-hoons.
      </p>
      <p>"Why won't you grant me permission... Heavens...!"</p>
      <p>Why still, still...!</p>
      <p>
        If this much sincerity isn't enough, then what more do you want from me!
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The sixth Kim Young-hoon swung his saber, shattering the last piece of
        the altar. I thanked him and sat down, exhausted.
      </p>
      <p>"...Kim Hyung."</p>
      <p>I spoke to the Kim Young-hoons.</p>
      <p>
        "I know. I've lost my mind right now. But in a way, I'm both insane and
        rational."
      </p>
      <p>
        The repeated failures and the loneliness of not being able to converse
        had led to these illusions. I pondered over my feelings and formed a
        hypothesis about the Kim Young-hoons in front of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...You all are the Kim Young-hoons I remember from my past lives,
        aren't you?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At my words, all six Kim Young-hoons nodded. Excluding the Kim
        Young-hoon from my first life without regression and this current cycle,
        they were the six Kim Young-hoons from the six cycles of regressions.
        The ones I remembered and longed for.
      </p>
      <p>"...I'm sorry for dragging the departed into my delusions."</p>
      <p>
        They smiled wryly, saying it's just my imagination, what does it matter.
        I chuckled and grasped my sword.
      </p>
      <p>"...I'm always grateful for playing with me."</p>
      <p>Blink</p>
      <p>
        I closed and opened my eyes. Their figures vanished, leaving six
        floating stone sabers. Blinking again, they transformed back into six
        Kim Young-hoons.
      </p>
      <p>7 years passed.</p>
      <p>"Heavens... grant me strength."</p>
      <p>Heavens, please accept me...</p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>
        Once again, I clenched my teeth at the sight of the obstructing dark
        clouds.
      </p>
      <p>'Still...'</p>
      <p>Still, I am not granted permission by the heavens.</p>
      <p>
        It was different from when I transitioned from first-rate to the peak.
        Back then, though there was an indescribable huge wall blocking me, I
        could feel the existence beyond that wall and devoted my life to
        breaking through.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, it's not a huge wall. It's like being thrown alone into an
        endless space. There's no wall, nothing at all. I can't even see the
        next realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        When will the heavens permit me? There's no promise, just me clinging to
        the cold and lofty mercy of the heavens, waiting for the next realm.
      </p>
      <p>'...I must try.'</p>
      <p>Crack...</p>
      <p>
        My fingers, imbued with Gang Qi, gripped the stone altar made by the
        Earth Dwelling Method, leaving imprints.
      </p>
      <p>'Yes, I must try.'</p>
      <p>No matter how much the heavens ignore me.</p>
      <p>Even if I am just a struggling bug.</p>
      <p>Until they accept me...</p>
      <p>I must keep enduring.</p>
      <p>
        Yes, if not today, then tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, then the day
        after.
      </p>
      <p>Until they accept me.</p>
      <p>I will keep trying, over and over...!</p>
      <p>"Heavens above... I am waiting...!"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>I stamped my foot.</p>
      <p>The altar crumbled.</p>
      <p>
        Beside me, six Kim Young-hoons, each performing their own ritual dance,
        assisted me as we furiously pounded the altar together.
      </p>
      <p>"I will definitely reach you..!"</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>At some point.</p>
      <p>I was able to overcome the six Kim Young-hoons.</p>
      <p>The heavens would still not permit me.</p>
      <p>All I did was swing around pieces of stone.</p>
      <p>Even that was just a figment of my imagination.</p>
      <p>Were the Kim Young-hoons before me the real ones?</p>
      <p>No, they weren't.</p>
      <p>
        If they were the real Kim Young-hoons, they would have shot a single
        Gang Sphere and blown me away.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I was fighting were just Kim Young-hoons supported by my
        imagination.
      </p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>I have now overcome all the Kim Young-hoons I have longed for.</p>
      <p>Now, whom do I have to fight?</p>
      <p>Who do I have to compete with to express this torment?</p>
      <p>That's when it happened.</p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle...</p>
      <p>The illusions of the six Kim Young-hoons I had overcome.</p>
      <p>Their corpses began to squirm.</p>
      <p>And from those wriggling of corpses, something began to grow.</p>
      <p>It was the leader of the Shadow Guards and its members.</p>
      <p>"..Eh?"</p>
      <p>
        The Shadow Guards grew from Kim Young-hoons' corpses, and the six Kim
        Young-hoons squirmed and grew again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, along with the six Kim Young-hoons, the Shadow Guards have
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>"...Haha, not bad."</p>
      <p>The combined attack of masters is better the more there are.</p>
      <p>Drooling from my mouth, I shouted.</p>
      <p>
        "Come at me! All of you, come at me! Fine, I will make the weapons for
        you!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I formed a hand seal, made stone weapons for the Shadow Guards and Kim
        Young-hoons, infused them with Gang Qi, and threw them.
      </p>
      <p>They took my weapons and all rushed at me.</p>
      <p>
        Every time I fought, I felt a tingling pleasure in my head, blowing away
        the pain and despair of my ritual failures.
      </p>
      <p>"Hahaha!"</p>
      <p>It's so fun!</p>
      <p>So very fun!</p>
      <p>I am enjoying this!!!</p>
      <p>My intent was somehow a dark blue hue.</p>
      <p>But I didn't care and shouted.</p>
      <p>"Great!!!"</p>
      <p>Two years passed.</p>
      <p>32 years since regression.</p>
      <p>22 years since the start of the Seven Stars Ritual.</p>
      <p>
        That day, I was drooling from my mouth, taking the combined attack of
        several members of the Shadow Guards and several peak masters I had met,
        and the combined attacks of the Kim Young-hoon group. We were fighting,
        crossing a mountain in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>"Um...?"</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, while fending off the extreme attack of the Shadow Guard
        leader, I noticed something different down below.
      </p>
      <p>"That, that is...!"</p>
      <p>
        I felt my eyes widen, gestured to the people playing with me, and went
        down.
      </p>
      <p>It was a stone building.</p>
      <p>A trace of civilization!</p>
      <p>I hurriedly ran to the stone building.</p>
      <p>"This place is..."</p>
      <p>Inside the stone building, there was no sign of life.</p>
      <p>
        At most, some spiritual herbs or poisonous plants growing in various
        places and low-level spiritual beasts that came together to bare their
        teeth at me.
      </p>
      <p>
        But such creatures, seeing the Shadow guards and peak masters of the
        great sects, and the group of Kim Young-hoons following me, were
        surprised and fled with wide eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Hmm, strange. These are supposed to be visible only to me because I've
        lost my mind... Why are those creatures running away?'
      </p>
      <p>
        After thinking for a while, I realized that many weapons floating in the
        air following me would be a terrifying sight.
      </p>
      <p>'Well, good... Anyway, this building is...'</p>
      <p>
        The building seemed to be made in a style used thousands of years ago.
      </p>
      <p>Inside, there wasn't much to see.</p>
      <p>'It's not made for people to live in.'</p>
      <p>It was too cramped for that.</p>
      <p>This wasn't so much a building as...</p>
      <p>'It feels like a shrine.'</p>
      <p>
        I looked at the altar, or something similar, and became certain of my
        thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the top of the altar, there was a large square indentation, as if
        something had been placed there before.
      </p>
      <p>'An ancestral tablet or some kind of stele...'</p>
      <p>Wait, a stele?</p>
      <p>I came out of the building and looked at it hastily.</p>
      <p>
        I hadn't noticed because I rushed in, but this building didn't just seem
        neglected due to age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around it were stones that seemed like remnants of the stone building,
        and the bottom part of the building was ripped out.
      </p>
      <p>And the terrain around the stone building.</p>
      <p>It was as if.</p>
      <p>
        'A very powerful person had plucked this stone building from its
        original place and thrown it here...?'
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrain around the stone building was deeply gouged on one side.
      </p>
      <p>As if thrown and leaving a mark on the land.</p>
      <p>I looked in the direction the gouge pointed.</p>
      <p>It was towards the Ascension Gate.</p>
      <p>
        'The indentation on the altar inside the building. Its size is...
        exactly the same as the stele that floated above the Ascension Gate...?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps this stone building was originally erected where the Ascension
        Gate was.
      </p>
      <p>
        And one of the Heavenly Being cultivators had plucked the building and
        thrown it here for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>'Is there a hidden secret..?'</p>
      <p>
        While searching near the stone building, I found something delightful.
      </p>
      <p>"This is...!"</p>
      <p>A fragment of a stone with Oracle Bone Script written on it.</p>
      <p>It was too ancient for me to identify correctly.</p>
      <p>But from what I know, it seemed to mean thunder (雷).</p>
      <p>
        I searched around the fragment with the character for thunder, but found
        nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>'I'm curious now. Is there some hidden secret in this place?'</p>
      <p>What does this Oracle Bone Script of thunder mean?</p>
      <p>Is it related to the thunderclouds near the Ascension Gate?</p>
      <p>"Hmm... It's getting interesting."</p>
      <p>
        As I came up with various hypotheses and my mind cleared, the many
        figures around me became transparent.
      </p>
      <p>Only numerous stone weapons floated in the air.</p>
      <p>"Shall I look for more of these similar buildings..?"</p>
      <p>
        With that intention, I wandered around the island, looking carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        The size of Ascension Path was immense, as big as combining several
        cities.
      </p>
      <p>It seem to be about the size of South Korea.</p>
      <p>
        At the center of the island was the Ascension Gate, and this place was
        shaped like a circular land floating in the air around the Gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        But despite my thorough search, I couldn't find any more buildings like
        the stone building.
      </p>
      <p>'Hmm, it's hard to find out more without further clues...'</p>
      <p>
        I sighed and went near the Ascension Gate for the first time in a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gate was closed due to the time passed, but the spatial rifts and
        thunderclouds around it remained.
      </p>
      <p>But I saw something I hadn't noticed before.</p>
      <p>Traces of the stone building near the Ascension Gate.</p>
      <p>
        Stones that looked of the same material as the stone building were
        scattered nearby.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed like the base of the stone building.</p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        I examined the stones, then went back to where the stone building was
        located.
      </p>
      <p>
        The direction the stone building flew from the Ascension Gate was north.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suddenly realized that the size of the stone building and the part
        near the Ascension Gate, which seemed to be its base, didn't match.
      </p>
      <p>'The base part is almost ten times bigger.'</p>
      <p>This meant the original stone building was much larger.</p>
      <p>But why was only this stone building left here?</p>
      <p>
        I thought about whether the remnants of the stones had weathered and
        crumbled, but there weren't many such remnants nearby.
      </p>
      <p>Then...</p>
      <p>
        'There was a larger stone building when the cultivator blew up the
        building. When they ripped and threw the building, only this part fell
        here, and the rest...'
      </p>
      <p>Further north.</p>
      <p>Fell outside the area.</p>
      <p>I ran to the northern edge, looking down at the desert below.</p>
      <p>"...Tsk, all sand."</p>
      <p>Maybe it was buried under the sand.</p>
      <p>
        The stone, having touched it a few times, was very sturdy and not easily
        damaged.
      </p>
      <p>I might have to dig under the sand nearby later.</p>
      <p>Or since I've mastered earth spells, I could dig underground.</p>
      <p>'Anyway, I'll investigate later.'</p>
      <p>I decided such and looked up at the sky.</p>
      <p>
        Despite my sudden doubts and curiosity, I haven't paid much attention.
      </p>
      <p>But now, I need to perform the ritual again.</p>
      <p>"...How long must this continue."</p>
      <p>Suddenly, the urge to give everything up overwhelmed me.</p>
      <p>"How long must I... keep doing this?"</p>
      <p>Perhaps I was doing something foolish.</p>
      <p>
        After all, maybe the heavens have no intention of permitting me, no
        matter what I did or do.
      </p>
      <p>Am I just working in vain?</p>
      <p>Am I foolishly lingering in this place for nothing?</p>
      <p>I...</p>
      <p>"...Master."</p>
      <p>I clenched my teeth.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>I stomped my foot, and the earth rose up, forming an altar.</p>
      <p>
        "As you said, Master, sincerity can reach the heavens... I will give it
        my all."
      </p>
      <p>Not yet.</p>
      <p>I can't give up yet.</p>
      <p>
        Even if I do give up, it will be after I've dedicated this entire life
        to trying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because there have been too many who have pushed me forward in my many
        lives...
      </p>
      <p>Many figures surrounded me.</p>
      <p>Some held weapons, others didn't.</p>
      <p>
        There were Kim Young-hoons, subordinates from my time as the Wulin
        Alliance chief advisor, from the time of the Palace of Heavenly Demons,
        the Shadow Guards...
      </p>
      <p>And my disciples,</p>
      <p>And my master.</p>
      <p>Only then did I realize.</p>
      <p>I haven't gone mad.</p>
      <p>
        I wasn't crazy. I was just longing for them so much that I called them
        to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The many people in my memory were merely projected before my eyes
        according to my will.
      </p>
      <p>"...I will not give up."</p>
      <p>I said, looking at everyone.</p>
      <p>Looking at the Kim Young-hoons.</p>
      <p>Looking at my disciples.</p>
      <p>Looking at my master.</p>
      <p>"For the sake of not forgetting your help...!"</p>
      <p>
        I gathered the ritual utensils, adorned the altar, and prepared for this
        night's ritual.
      </p>
      <p>Heavens above.</p>
      <p>Heavens above.</p>
      <p>Grant me strength.</p>
      <p>Allow me.</p>
      <p>I cried out, looking at the sky filled with dark clouds.</p>
      <p>But the heavens remained silent.</p>
      <p>Without any response, just silently looking down at me.</p>
      <p>It was a failure again.</p>
      <p>But I did not give up.</p>
      <p>"Heavens above... Grant me strength..."</p>
      <p>"Heavens above... Allow me..."</p>
      <p>
        I earnestly prayed, performing and praying through the ritual over and
        over.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heavens did not look at me, but now I also stopped looking at the
        heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, each time I performed the ritual, I looked at the numerous
        figures around me.
      </p>
      <p>Those who had pushed me forward.</p>
      <p>The many connections who had supported and sustained me.</p>
      <p>Even if I can't meet them anymore, they are with me in my heart.</p>
      <p>"Heavens above..."</p>
      <p>I will not give up.</p>
      <p>Because I am not alone.</p>
      <p>
        From a certain point, I stopped smashing the altar in anger after the
        ritual ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, I focused on gathering stones to build the altar higher and
        stronger.
      </p>
      <p>My altar grew taller.</p>
      <p>Eventually, it would reach the sky.</p>
      <p>
        As time passed, the figures surrounding me became more and more
        distinct.
      </p>
      <p>As the tower grew taller and stronger,</p>
      <p>
        The six Kim Young-hoons who fought with me, the Shadow Guards, several
        peak masters,
      </p>
      <p>And my disciples.</p>
      <p>
        Over 500 disciples, the Shadow Guards, Kim Young-hoons, elders and
        protectors of various great sects.
      </p>
      <p>The loyalists I fought with in the Jin Clan.</p>
      <p>They all came out with weapons and sparred with me.</p>
      <p>
        At first, it was overwhelming, but after a few years, I was equally
        fighting against them all.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my skills improved, the figures participating in my sparring
        increased.
      </p>
      <p>Most were martial artists wielding weapons.</p>
      <p>
        But also the petty bandits, water bandits, and unorthodox sect martial
        artists I had captured.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the first-rate masters I had sparred with, the number almost
        reached two thousand as the range expanded.
      </p>
      <p>35 years into regression.</p>
      <p>25 years since starting the Seven Stars Ritual.</p>
      <p>How many thousands of times have I failed the ritual?</p>
      <p>'I can't even remember.'</p>
      <p>But I sense that I will not be broken.</p>
      <p>I am not alone.</p>
      <p>'How can I be alone with so many accompanying me...!'</p>
      <p>"Heavens above, look."</p>
      <p>Humans cannot reach the heavens alone.</p>
      <p>But no human is ever completely alone.</p>
      <p>Within the many connections and relationships,</p>
      <p>Inside 'us', humans are born and live.</p>
      <p>"Heavens above, you may not look at me."</p>
      <p>But I am not composed of just myself.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the heavens cannot ignore 'us'.</p>
      <p>
        I now ascend the giant altar, almost as tall as a four-story building.
      </p>
      <p>Thousands of weapons float in the air below the altar.</p>
      <p>When I blink, the weapons are all held by numerous figures.</p>
      <p>
        Besides those figures holding weapons, thousands more without weapons
        look at me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some might call me a madman who creates imaginary figures in his
        madness.
      </p>
      <p>From that perspective, I am indeed a madman.</p>
      <p>But from the perspective of longing for people, am I really mad?</p>
      <p>Every human is born, grows, and dies within humanity.</p>
      <p>People inevitably seek others.</p>
      <p>Is it madness for people to crave others?</p>
      <p>For people to crave life?</p>
      <p>For people to yearn for higher places for that?</p>
      <p>"Heavens above, I cannot give up now."</p>
      <p>I murmured, looking at the countless figures.</p>
      <p>I know.</p>
      <p>
        They are all illusions created by my loneliness, longing, and yearning.
      </p>
      <p>But if I can only break free from the cycle of regression and fate,</p>
      <p>I can find them all again, retrieving my life as it was.</p>
      <p>And for that.</p>
      <p>I must ascend higher!</p>
      <p>As I ascend the altar, I shout towards the heavens.</p>
      <p>"Heavens above, look! I will not give up! I cannot give up!"</p>
      <p>So, grant me strength!</p>
      <p>So, allow me!</p>
      <p>The ritual began.</p>

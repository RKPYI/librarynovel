      <p>Chapter 5: Director Kim is a Martial Genius (2)</p>
      <p>
        Achieving mastery in martial arts means fully embodying the true essence
        of those arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on a martial artist's skill, applying the essence of martial
        arts in real combat earns them recognition as a formidable warrior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if it's a third-rate martial art from the streets, understanding
        and embodying its essence can elevate one to the status of a second-rate
        martial artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, as one practices higher-level martial arts, the essence
        embedded in each move requires the enlightenment equivalent to several
        third-rate arts, making it a hallmark of first or second-rate martial
        arts
      </p>
      <p>
        The Demon Slaying Sect was one of those sects with high-level martial
        arts, a well-established sect in the city of Seokyung.
      </p>
      <p>And,</p>
      <p>Someone had mastered their martial arts in just seven months.</p>
      <p>Swoosh, swoosh!</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's blade sliced through the air.</p>
      <p>
        Absolute Dragon Saber Technique (絶龍刀法) of the Demon Slaying Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        A blade technique reputed to even cut down flying dragons. It was a
        foundation martial art for inner disciples of the Demon Slaying Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, being a foundation art for inner disciples meant it was on a
        different level than common third-rate martial arts, equivalent to
        second-rate martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being called 'second-rate,' these martial arts were far from
        weak.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a fundamental art taught to the inner disciples of a large sect, its
        ferocity was formidable.
      </p>
      <p>Mastering its true essence meant,</p>
      <p>"...He's reached first-rate."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon had just managed to achieve the status of a first-rate
        warrior.
      </p>
      <p>I was astonished, watching him perform the blade technique.</p>
      <p>First-rate.</p>
      <p>The significance of that title was immense.</p>
      <p>
        In any field, those labeled as 'first-rate' signify the masters of that
        industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even within the martial world, a first-rate warrior holds positions like
        an elder or even hall master of a large sect.
      </p>
      <p>For a small to mid-sized sect, they might even be the sect leader.</p>
      <p>'To become first-rate in just half a year.'</p>
      <p>
        Many warriors train rigorously and achieve enlightenment to barely reach
        this level.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Kim Young-hoon, defying all norms, had boldly reached first-rate in
        just half a year.
      </p>
      <p>'No wonder the Demon Slaying Sect is upside down.'</p>
      <p>
        Rumor had it that the sect was in chaos because an outer disciple had
        achieved the skill level of an elder in just seven months, leading to
        suspicions of him being a spy from another sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, due to this, Kim Young-hoon, along with another suspected
        spy (me), was confined to our residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I don't even know martial arts, why am I suspected of being a spy?'
      </p>
      <p>But, of course, it made sense.</p>
      <p>
        A middle-aged man with a bulging belly comes to learn martial arts, and
        after being taught, he becomes a first-rate expert in just half a year.
      </p>
      <p>It's understandably suspicious since it defies all logic.</p>
      <p>"Mr. Kim, aren't you worried?"</p>
      <p>"Ha, what do you mean?"</p>
      <p>
        "If they suspect us of being spies, aren't they likely to block our
        meridians or destroy our Dantian? It's not uncommon in these kinds of
        martial arts settings."
      </p>
      <p>"That is true."</p>
      <p>Buzz!</p>
      <p>He swung his sword one last time and wiped off his sweat.</p>
      <p>
        "But somehow, I feel like I can see the next 'barrier.' If I overcome
        it, I believe I'll reach the next level."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>He's a monster.</p>
      <p>
        How long has it been since you've become a first-class warrior, and
        you're already feeling the next level?

      <p>'After first-class is a peak master .'</p>
      <p>
        From peak master, one can be the sect leader of a major sect, or a grand
        elder-level strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Yanguo, this level is also called the Pinnacle Realm, and just being
        a peak master puts one in the fearsome position of being within the top
        1000 in Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, within the martial arts world, there is hardly any discussion
        about a level beyond the peak. Thus, it’s essentially the final reach a
        martial artist can attain through their martial arts training.
      </p>
      <p>
        'To think…Just mastering some high-level martial arts and in seven
        months, a peak master...'
      </p>
      <p>My expectations were wrong.</p>
      <p>
        With this momentum, the return of the world's greatest swordsman could
        be accelerated by not 30 years, but 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>'No, 50 years might be too much, let's say 40 years.'</p>
      <p>Such was the insane level of growth of Director Kim.</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, if you're a first-class warrior, you might be treated as a spy,
        but once you surpass the wall into the peak, even if you're suspicious,
        they have to accept you. Besides, Seo Eun-hyun still has a ginseng root
        from what he dug up, right?"
      </p>
      <p>He continued practicing his swordsmanship while talking.</p>
      <p>
        Indeed, I had left a root of the yellow bamboo that I had dug up in
        Ascension Path .
      </p>
      <p>
        The yellow bamboo root was prepared for when Director Kim grew enough,
        to increase his inner energy...
      </p>
      <p>'It won't be long before I give it to him.'</p>
      <p>
        By then, Director Kim's inner energy would also match that of a peak
        master.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...But Director, your sword technique seems completely different from
        just before..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, it's Hall Master Heo Baek’s sword technique. Was it the True
        Demon Slaying Sword Technique? I saw it once, unfolded it, and learned
        it. Now, I'm trying to adapt it into my swordsmanship."
      </p>
      <p>''...''</p>
      <p>'Truly a heavenly martial talent.'</p>
      <p>It was truly terrifying.</p>
      <p>
        Come to think of it, from the beginning, Director Kim had an unusual
        stamina for hiking and incredibly fast footwork when playing foot
        volleyball.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever he did something physical at work, he always came in first,
        which was suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Was this talent always there? Then, maybe our qualities and abilities
        weren't awakened in this world but were already present from our
        original world? Then, my regression ability too?'
      </p>
      <p>It was a conjecture.</p>
      <p>I shook my head, dispelling the thoughts that had risen in my mind.</p>
      <p>Soon, seven days and nights passed.</p>
      <p>Paat!</p>
      <p>Director Kim had become a peak master.</p>
      <p>"The [Wall] has been overcome."</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        I handed Director Kim the last 900-year-old yellow bamboo root,
        astonished.
      </p>
      <p>"You have an unexpectedly incredible talent."</p>
      <p>
        "I'm surprised myself. I never knew I had such a talent for martial
        arts... Maybe it was for this reason that I liked martial arts since I
        was young."
      </p>
      <p>
        While exchanging such trivial jokes, Director Kim chewed and swallowed
        the yellow bamboo root I handed him, then began internal energy
        cultivation in a sitting posture.
      </p>
      <p>Kuuuu...</p>
      <p>
        Shortly after, three flowers of qi formed above Director Kim's head and
        scattered into his nose and mouth.
      </p>
      <p>'That's Three Flowers Gather at the Summit (삼화취정)..'</p>
      <p>Suaa...</p>
      <p>Director Kim's eyes sparkled.</p>
      <p>He stood up with a confident expression.</p>
      <p>"Now, even the Hall Master is not so scary."</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>"By the way, when will this house arrest be lifted?"</p>
      <p>He approached one of the elders who was supervising our house.</p>
      <p>"Excuse me, when will this house arrest be lifted?"</p>
      <p>"Until your suspicion of being a spy is cleared."</p>
      <p>"Hmm... Alright then."</p>
      <p>Three more days passed.</p>
      <p>People from the sect came.</p>
      <p>
        "Hear this! The hall master of the Demon Slaying Hall orders to sever
        ties with Yoon Young-hoon (Yoon because there is no Kim surname Yanguo),
        a spy from another sect trying to steal our martial arts, and cut the
        meridians of his limbs!"
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        Three elders from the Demon Slaying Hall surrounded Director Kim, and a
        second-class warrior, a law enforcer, approached me.
      </p>
      <p>"Didn't I say I'm really not a spy? I'm just..."</p>
      <p>"Shut up! Tie him up!"</p>
      <p>"Hoo..."</p>
      <p>What happened wasn't clear.</p>
      <p>
        Just that Director Kim Young-hoon unsheathed his sword at a fast speed.
      </p>
      <p>Shuk!</p>
      <p>"Ahh... Aaaaah!"</p>
      <p>One elder's wrist was slightly cut.</p>
      <p>That elder won't be able to use that hand for life.</p>
      <p>Director Kim held the sword with a gloomy face.</p>
      <p>
        Unlike seven months ago, his body, now lean and filled with muscles,
        naturally assumed the posture of the sword stance he had practiced
        thousands, if not millions, of times.
      </p>
      <p>‘'It was my first martial arts school...'’</p>
      <p>‘'What on earth...!'’</p>
      <p>
        The two startled elders rushed at him, but again, Kim's sword moved too
        fast for the eye to see, lightly slicing the wrists of the elders.
      </p>
      <p>‘'Oh, oh...'’</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>
        The guardian who was approaching me also panicked. As Kim quickly
        approached and delivered a wrist strike, the guardian collapsed
        unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>‘'Ugh, aghhhh!'’</p>
      <p>'’Damn! He's a peak master! Run away!'’</p>
      <p>‘'Inform the Sect Leader!’'</p>
      <p>
        Several disciples of the Demon Slaying Sect, who had come with their
        elders, panicked and ran away. Kim Young-hoon, with a stern face, spoke
        to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'Eun-hyun, I'm thinking of going to the Dragon Fighting Stronghold.
        What do you think?'’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'Dragon Fighting Stronghold, while being a faction of the unorthodox
        sect, isn't one known for great misdeeds. It's just a faction known for
        its strong martial spirit, so it doesn't seem bad.'’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'Ha ha ha, good. Then, you go ahead to the Dragon Fighting Stronghold.
        I'll follow after dealing with the elders of the Demon Slaying Sect
        and... the Sect Leader.'’
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon and I left the house, going in opposite directions.</p>
      <p>
        I hurriedly headed to the southern part of Seokyung City, where the
        Dragon Fighting Stronghold was located, and only reached there by
        evening.
      </p>
      <p>‘'Seo Eun-hyun, why are you so late?'’</p>
      <p>‘'Ha ha. You are just too fast, Director.'’</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon had already arrived at the Dragon Fighting Stronghold
        faster than me.
      </p>
      <p>I sighed softly as I looked at the bloodstains on his sword.</p>
      <p>
        Director Kim, who used to be shocked by my violence, now carried a sword
        stained with blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it's for survival in this world, it is inevitable that we are
        changed by this world.
      </p>
      <p>How nice it would be if we could return.</p>
      <p>To our ordinary lives on Earth, not this martial world.</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, I felt the ability to return to the past was a rather useless
        gift.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If I had to return... why not send me back to that time on Earth...'
      </p>
      <p>It can't be helped since it's come to this.</p>
      <p>Anyway, we have to live.</p>
      <p>I smiled at Director Kim, his sword stained with blood.</p>
      <p>'’I'm glad you're safe, Director.”</p>
      <p>Ten years passed.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, who had been betrayed by the Demon Slaying Sect, devoted
        himself to the Dragon Fighting Stronghold, and was appointed as an
        official elder of Dragon Fighting Stronghold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Becoming an official elder, he collected even more advanced martial
        arts, and soon became a powerful warrior, surpassing even peak masters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, he had earned the seat of one of the three great swordsmen of the
        world in just ten years.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in reality, he always concealed more than 40% of his abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he fully revealed his strength, he would become the unrivaled number
        one in the world, the foremost person in Yanguo, and I had no doubt
        about that.
      </p>
      <p>Ignoring our age difference, I decided to address him as Hyung-nim.</p>
      <p>
        He created a martial arts technique that suited me perfectly and taught
        it to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        '’This is the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship (斷岳劍法). It's named for
        its intent of slicing even the giant mountain. If you master it, you too
        can become a peak master.'’
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with the sword technique, he also created Dragon Vein Qi Method
        (龍脈氣功), an advanced internal energy method.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a first-class martial art, different from the simple third or
        second class ones.
      </p>
      <p>The problem was...</p>
      <p>'’But Eunhyeon. You are really... a bit dull.'’</p>
      <p>My terrible martial talent.</p>
      <p>
        Even though he, the greatest martial artist, personally created a
        technique suited for me and taught it in detail, I was still barely
        hanging onto third class even after a year.
      </p>
      <p>'‘...I can't help it. Everyone has talents in different fields.'’</p>
      <p>
        Over the past ten years, Kim Young-hoon practiced martial arts, and I
        studied medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied acupuncture points, acupuncture methods, and medical
        treatments in addition to the herbal medicine I had learned earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to this, I was able to set up an official medical hall and act as
        a doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe it was due to the herbal knowledge I had previously learned, I was
        able to progress much faster in the field of medicine than in martial
        arts.
      </p>
      <p>'’By the way, aren't you going to marry?'’</p>
      <p>‘'Well, I have to wait for the opportunity.'’</p>
      <p>
        The rough atmosphere of Dragon Fighting Stronghold made marriage an
        undesirable option.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were even young ladies who ran away pale-faced when they heard I
        worked in the medical hall of Dragon Fighting Stronghold.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'Ha ha ha, I might have to leave Dragon Fighting Stronghold for the
        sake of my brother's marriage.'’
      </p>
      <p>‘'Are you really leaving because of me?'’</p>
      <p>
        ‘'Just joking. Rather, Dragon Fighting Stronghold feels too cramped.'’
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed. Having achieved the title of one of the three great swordsmen of
        the world within ten years and possessing the hidden strength of the
        number one in the world, his words made sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'I'm thinking of leaving Dragon Fighting Stronghold to establish a new
        organization. What do you think?'’
      </p>
      <p>‘'A new organization?'’</p>
      <p>
        ‘'Yes, the Wulin Alliance (武林盟)! A group that will unite the many
        factions of Yanguo and mediate the complicated political situations.
        What do you think? Will you join me?'’
      </p>
      <p>‘'Of course, I will. We are from the same hometown.'’</p>
      <p>
        ‘'That's right, people from the same hometown... We shouldn't part
        ways.'’
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, Kim Young-hoon and I, having been in this world for ten years,
        left Dragon Fighting Stronghold to establish the Wulin Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon left Dragon Fighting Stronghold and for two years, he
        traveled around Yanguo, challenging and breaking the signboards of major
        factions in each area.
      </p>
      <p>In the third year.</p>
      <p>
        He finally succeeded in taking down the signboards of all the factions.
      </p>
      <p>
        He truly earned the title of the number one person in the world and
        established the Wulin Alliance with the fame of number one, uniting the
        factions of the martial world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, he was the first leader of the Wulin Alliance, and I assisted
        him as the chief strategist.
      </p>
      <p>Seven years passed after the establishment of the Wulin Alliance.</p>
      <p>It had been twenty years since we landed in this world.</p>
      <p>
        My martial arts skill had progressed from barely hanging onto third
        class to comfortably being at that level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I had first-class inner energy due to consuming many medicinal
        herbs in my position as strategist, my actual skill was still just at
        the fringe of third class.
      </p>
      <p>However, Kim Young-hoon was different.</p>
      <p>Kuuuuu―</p>
      <p>In the dark secret room.</p>
      <p>
        I stood as Kim Young-hoon's protector, waiting for him to finish his
        energy circulation.
      </p>
      <p>That's when it happened.</p>
      <p>Woo-woong!</p>
      <p>A light shone, and above his head, five circles of energy gathered.</p>
      <p>
        After a while, the five spheres of energy were inhaled through his nose
        and mouth.
      </p>
      <p>The realm of Five Energies Converging to the Origin!</p>
      <p>Tuk, Wuduk tuk tuk!</p>
      <p>
        Soon after, his body began to twist significantly, and his bones and
        flesh started to contort.
      </p>
      <p>“That is...”</p>
      <p>Wuduk Duk Duk!</p>
      <p>His body transformed into an ideal form.</p>
      <p>A complete transformation!</p>
      <p>Paaaat!</p>
      <p>
        For a moment, there's a bright light, and then a completely different
        person stood before me.
      </p>
      <p>
        All wrinkles and white hair were gone, and the bald head had grown lush
        hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        The owner of that vibrant body, brimming with vitality, was completely
        different from the person I knew.
      </p>
      <p>“Hyung-nim...?”</p>
      <p>“Ha, haha... Hahahaha!”</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, having undergone a complete transformation, seemed to
        have successfully rejuvenated.
      </p>
      <p>Now, he looked much younger than even me.</p>
      <p>
        “Truly the best! Look at you, brother! You seem to be brimming with
        vitality! It feels like you can do anything!”
      </p>
      <p>“...Haha, you’ll probably get married before me, Hyun-nim.”</p>
      <p>That was true.</p>
      <p>
        Ever since I was appointed as a chief strategist in the Wulin Alliance,
        I had been insanely busy, not even having the time for dating, let alone
        marriage.
      </p>
      <p>“Hey, what are you talking about? Me, get married...”</p>
      <p>But it seemed like he had no thoughts about marriage either.</p>
      <p>
        “I've been married on Earth, and the first three years were good, but
        after that, it was really... No, I better not talk about it.”
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon was a married man who had been a director on Earth.</p>
      <p>
        It seemed he had no intention of ever marrying again, even after
        becoming the number one person in the world, given his past experiences
        with his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
        “But Hyung-nim, the world will be shocked to know you've undergone a
        complete transformation.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Haha, indeed. But now, it's time to gradually pass on the leadership of
        the Wulin Alliance to the next leader...”
      </p>
      <p>“There’s no one who meets your standards, Hyung-nim?”</p>
      <p>
        “To be the leader of the Wulin Alliance, one must have a certain level
        of martial arts, but there isn’t a single person who understands the way
        of martial arts!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You're just too much of a genius, Hyung-nim. It's not that other people
        are stupid.”
      </p>
      <p>“Still...”</p>
      <p>One year after Kim Young-hoon's complete transformation.</p>
      <p>
        Hyung-nim passed on the position of the leader of the Wulin Alliance to
        the next generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I too wanted to retire with Hyung-nim, but since the second leader of
        the Wulin Alliance was facing difficulties in managing the alliance, I
        ended up being forced to continue to sit as the chief strategist.
      </p>
      <p>And so, another 10 years passed.</p>
      <p>It has been 30 years since I arrived in this world.</p>
      <p>My age was now approaching sixty.</p>
      <p>
        As for my martial arts skills, while my internal strength was abundant,
        my actual skill level had barely reached the very end of the
        third-rate."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wulin Alliance went through the second leader and reached the time
        of the third leader, and I finally managed to retire after frantically
        training a successor and passing the position to the second strategist.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Kim Young-hoon retired from his position as the leader of the
        Wulin Alliance and travelled around Yanguo, often disappearing for
        months.
      </p>
      <p>Because of this, he did not even attend my retirement ceremony.</p>
      <p>
        I saw Kim Young-hoon's face again a year after retiring as a strategist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bought a manor in Seokyung City and was leisurely reading medical
        books there.
      </p>
      <p>Trudge, trudge...</p>
      <p>‘'What's this? Who's there... Ugh! Hyung-nim!’'</p>
      <p>''...''</p>
      <p>
        ‘'Why do you look like a beggar? And why didn't you come to my
        retirement ceremony? Were you enjoying your travels around the world so
        much... Hyung-nim?'’
      </p>
      <p>
        The man I saw after a long time was in a beggar's appearance,
        pale-faced, and had lost all his overwhelming self-confidence.
      </p>
      <p>‘'What happened, Hyung-nim!'’</p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>
        He lay down on the floor of my manor, looking up at the sky, and spoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'Eun-hyun, I thought I was truly blessed with the talents of martial
        arts.'’
      </p>
      <p>'’But you are a genius, aren't you?'’</p>
      <p>
        ‘'...Yes. I'm definitely a martial arts genius. There probably isn't a
        single person in Yanguo, no, among ordinary mortals, who can match my
        martial talents.'’
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ordinary mortals? How is Hyung-nim an ordinary mortal? You are the
        number one in the world...'’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'I encountered cultivators. Don't you remember? Thirty years ago. Those
        monsters who flew in the sky and kidnapped our companions.'’
      </p>
      <p>‘'...'’</p>
      <p>I fell silent.</p>
      <p>The cultivators.</p>
      <p>
        Working as the chief strategist of the Wulin Alliance, I had met them a
        few times.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were lurking in Yanguo's political and even royal circles,
        manipulating the entire country of Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the establishment of the Wulin Alliance to control the martial
        world, they wanted to get their hands on the Wulin Alliance as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unwilling to oppose them, knowing that it would mean fighting the entire
        country of Yanguo, I agreed to join hands with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        With their indirect support, we were able to significantly expand the
        power of the Wulin Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, they demanded that martial artists should not be able to harm
        cultivators, and because of this decree, members of the Wulin Alliance
        never had the chance to confront them.
      </p>
      <p>And,</p>
      <p>
        After stepping down as the leader of the Wulin Alliance, Kim Young-hoon
        went in search of cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Those cultivators are really hard to find. Even if I do manage to find
        one and try to engage them in combat, they use annoying techniques like
        illusions or flying to escape, preventing a proper fight.
      </p>
      <p>But this time, I finally succeeded in facing them head on."</p>
      <p>"So, did you win?"</p>
      <p>"...I won."</p>
      <p>
        "If you had said that during your time as the leader of the Wulin
        Alliance, I would have grabbed the back of my neck in disbelief."
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon chuckled bitterly, sticking out his tongue.</p>
      <p>
        "In a life-or-death struggle against a cultivator who had reached the
        stage of Qi Building, I barely managed to inflict a scratch on his
        fingertip... He said that even a mere touch on his body would count as
        my victory... so I guess it was a win, in a way."
      </p>
      <p>
        "...Was this cultivator one of the ten greatest masters among the
        cultivators?"
      </p>
      <p>"...No."</p>
      <p>He got up and looked dejected.</p>
      <p>
        "He said that the Qi Building stage is considered the second-lowest
        level in the cultivation world. For a martial artist, it's equivalent to
        a second-tier fighter."
      </p>
      <p>"...What? That's unbelievable."</p>
      <p>In both my past and present lives.</p>
      <p>I knew that cultivators were formidable beings.</p>
      <p>
        Above the martial artists, there existed these incredibly powerful
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>But having seen his martial prowess for 30 years, I knew.</p>
      <p>His martial arts truly reached the heavens!</p>
      <p>
        Not just as a figure of speech. Kim Young-hoon could literally perform
        martial arts in the sky using levitation.
      </p>
      <p>He could slice through solid iron as if it were tofu.</p>
      <p>Yet, such a martial arts genius!</p>
      <p>
        He only managed to scratch a cultivator who was at the second-lowest
        level in their hierarchy!
      </p>
      <p>'I knew this world was like a xianxia novel.'</p>
      <p>I knew about the genre of xianxia,</p>
      <p>But I only knew it as a genre, not the details.</p>
      <p>
        I called this world a xianxia-like world because of the existence of
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>But I hadn't thought much about how strong they really were.</p>
      <p>
        The monsters who kidnapped our colleagues 30 years ago, I had considered
        them as divine beings rather than cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's unbelievable that a human can be strong enough to toy with you,
        Hyung-nim."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I thought so too. But, I was just a frog in the well... The cultivators
        we've seen lurking around in Yanguo are the lowest in the cultivation
        hierarchy. Those at the very bottom, ironically, meddle with the mundane
        world."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>He sighed deeply.</p>
      <p>
        "I will continue to confront these cultivators and I will create a
        martial art that can face them. I must...! I have the talent of a
        'Heavenly Martial Artist' like no other in this world, after all!"
      </p>
      <p>
        With that, Kim Young-hoon left, his eyes blazing with determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was so shocked by his words that I didn't step outside for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        And from that day on, I began to investigate these cultivators with all
        my might.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using my connections, I met with cultivators lurking within the Wulin
        Alliance, in politics, business, and even the royal family. Learning
        about their world and their ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more I learned about cultivators, the more I realized that the
        extent of their realm was beyond my imagination.
      </p>
      <p>Cultivators.</p>
      <p>
        Unlike martial artists who focus on physical prowess and internal
        energy, their goal is to become immortals through cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the lowest cultivators were as strong as peak martial artists,
        meddling in various affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        As their cultivation level increased, they could control weather,
        natural disasters, and gradually become almost godlike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning about these terrifying beings, I continued my martial arts
        training out of fear.
      </p>
      <p>The dragon-like beings we saw 30 years ago.</p>
      <p>
        They were not divine beings but humans who achieved such states through
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more unbelievable was that these beings are still struggling to
        ascend to higher realms, where even more terrifying beings exist.
      </p>
      <p>However,</p>
      <p>
        I was a witness to such unbelievable tales myself, so I couldn't simply
        dismiss it as a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew my colleagues had become formidable beings, but I hadn't realized
        the extent.
      </p>
      <p>They were becoming truly terrifying entities.</p>
      <p>"Haha..."</p>
      <p>
        The more I learned about cultivators, the more I realized how
        insignificant the power we had acquired was.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how high our martial arts become, cultivators were monsters
        who could move mountains and alter landscapes.
      </p>
      <p>No matter how many times I undergo regression,</p>
      <p>I could never reach the level of a cultivator.</p>
      <p>
        Cultivators require a 'spiritual root' to begin their journey, something
        those without it can never achieve.
      </p>
      <p>'Regression might not end with this life, but I don't know.'</p>
      <p>I just thought of it as another chance at life and lived my best.</p>
      <p>Even if there's another life after this,</p>
      <p>'We can never stand against cultivators...'</p>
      <p>
        The more I interacted with cultivators and delved into ancient texts
        about them, the more powerless I felt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amidst the feelings of powerlessness and pressure, I continued to train
        in martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>Swinging a sword with my aging body somehow cleared my mind a bit.</p>
      <p>Thus, another 10 years passed.</p>
      <p>"Sigh..."</p>
      <p>
        As I performed the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship and regulated my
        breath, I had barely managed to reach the level of a second-tier martial
        artist.
      </p>
      <p>Around that time, I encountered my changed brother again.</p>
      <p>"Hyung-nim...?"</p>
      <p>
        The man I met after a long time looked like a wild hermit, with long,
        unkempt hair and a bushy beard.
      </p>
      <p>"It's been a while, Eun-hyun."</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, it's been years since we last saw each other. We've only been in
        touch through letters... Did the information I sent about the
        cultivation world help you?"
      </p>
      <p>"It did, somewhat."</p>
      <p>"Were you able to develop a martial art to defeat the cultivators?"</p>
      <p>"I've completed the martial art I had been conceptualizing."</p>
      <p>"Wow...!"</p>
      <p>
        I gasped in awe. If a martial arts genius like him said so, it meant his
        martial arts could definitely confront cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>"Surely, your martial arts must have transcended the heavens..."</p>
      <p>"No."</p>
      <p>His face, however, bore an unusually somber look.</p>
      <p>"My martial arts... can only go this far."</p>
      <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
      <p>"I've come to bid you farewell today."</p>
      <p>"Hyung-nim?"</p>
      <p>
        His face, once filled with pride and hope, was now completely shrouded
        in darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Today, I'm going to join a cultivation sect as a disciple. Probably
        starting from the very bottom. Haha..."
      </p>
      <p>"No, what do you mean?"</p>
      <p>
        "For the past 10 years, using information about cultivators, I sought
        them out, fought them, and developed martial arts to counter them. And
        then... I met a being known as a Core Formation Cultivator."
      </p>
      <p>His story continued.</p>
      <p>
        "After fighting him and unleashing all my insights, I managed to sever
        the Core Formation Cultivator's left hand. But he simply attached a
        talisman, and his hand regrew. Right after that, I was completely toyed
        with by him."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "He said that he admired my will and would accept me into his
        cultivation sect. After losing to him, I realized this is the limit of
        what martial arts can reach."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "Martial arts cannot take you any higher. Whether you practice for a
        hundred or a thousand years, it's all the same. So now, I've decided to
        become a cultivator and walk a new path."
      </p>
      <p>Hearing his words, I felt my lips trembling.</p>
      <p>There was so much I wanted to say, but nothing I could say.</p>
      <p>Then, a rather foolish question escaped my lips.</p>
      <p>
        "Isn't it impossible to become a cultivator without a spiritual root?"
      </p>
      <p>"The Core Formation Cultivator said..."</p>
      <p>To my foolish question, came a shocking reply.</p>
      <p>
        "The stage of 'Five Energies Converging to the Origin' that martial
        artists achieve corresponds to the 'Five Elements Spiritual Root' that
        cultivators are born with. Precisely, when a mortal achieves the 'Five
        Energies Converging to the Origin' through martial arts, they awaken the
        spiritual root."
      </p>
      <p>"Huh..."</p>
      <p>
        "Qualities that cultivators are born with, mortals can only awaken
        through a lifetime of martial arts exploration."
      </p>
      <p>He looked up at the sky with a bleak expression.</p>
      <p>"I was a genius of martial arts, but only of martial arts."</p>
      <p>After staring at the sky for a while, he got up.</p>
      <p>"I must go now. To pursue a higher realm."</p>
      <p>
        Having finished speaking, Young-hoon, my brother, vanished using a
        movement technique.
      </p>
      <p>A book was left in his place.</p>
      <p>I picked up the book he left behind with a dazed expression.</p>
      <p>
        The title was ‘Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial
        Arts.’ (越修窮武錄)
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the martial art he developed while seeking out cultivators for
        the past decade.
      </p>
      <p>As I read each page of his insights...</p>
      <p>
        Frankly, to me, barely hanging on as a second-tier martial artist, it
        seemed like grasping at straws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, I could feel his emotions as he left this martial art, and his
        resolve to give up this path and become a cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>The preface of the book contained his request to me.</p>
      <p>
        "Junior brother Seo Eun-hyun, please pass on this martial art to future
        generations, making it a lifeline for them to survive in front of the
        natural disasters known as cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>I read and reread his insights, engraving them in my mind.</p>
      <p>Though I couldn't understand it no matter how many times I read it,</p>
      <p>I did it to feel his last will.</p>
      <p>"Hyung-nim... You left me behind, where are you going?"</p>
      <p>At first, he was just my boss.</p>
      <p>But over 40 years,</p>
      <p>He had become my true brother.</p>
      <p>
        From that day on, I continued my training even more diligently,
        desperately trying to understand even a bit of the knowledge he had left
        behind. However, my aging body gradually became weaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I managed to reach the level of a second-tier martial
        artist, no longer just clinging to this rank by a thread. But from that
        point on, my body rapidly declined due to inevitable aging.
      </p>
      <p>Coughing on my ornate bed, I thought, 'How ironic.'</p>
      <p>
        It's been nearly 50 years since I came to this world. Similar to my past
        life, here I am lying in bed, dying of a similar illness. The only
        difference is the bed and the size of the house.
      </p>
      <p>'It seems one's destiny cannot be changed.'</p>
      <p>
        I'm going to die on the same day, from the same cause. As death draws
        near, I can feel it. This is fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how hard a human being tries, they cannot escape their
        destiny. They can only comply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frantic struggles can make life a bit better, a bit more enjoyable. But
        one's innate fortune and destiny cannot be changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If being human means floundering between luck and destiny, then we can
        only gain something within that space.
      </p>
      <p>Anything beyond that is unattainable.</p>
      <p>'But was it really so?'</p>
      <p>As I feel my life draining away, I slowly close my eyes.</p>
      <p>
        I didn't want to feel the regrets of my past life. In this given time, I
        lived as hard as I could. But in retrospect, could I really not go
        beyond my destiny?
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes, I wonder.</p>
      <p>
        'Maybe if I had struggled a little more, pushed a little harder, I could
        have reached further...'
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent a lifetime with Young-hoon Hyung-nim reaching the position of
        the chief strategist of the Wulin Alliance. I grasped all the wealth and
        honor one could feel in the human world.
      </p>
      <p>Now, all that’s left is my impending death.</p>
      <p>'Do I regret it?'</p>
      <p>
        This life was not regrettable. In fact, it was more than fulfilling.
      </p>
      <p>If there was one thing I regret...</p>
      <p>
        'It’s regrettable that I couldn't do anything when someone trying to
        leap to greater heights faced an even greater wall.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I am utterly ordinary, except for having undergone one cycle of return.
        In terms of martial arts, I'm rather untalented.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ordinary person like me, next to someone blessed with heavenly
        talent, couldn’t witness him surpassing the heavens...
      </p>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>Not seeing what lies beyond the heavens was my only...</p>
      <p>Regret.</p>
      <p>
        On a cold but not too chilly winter day, I lay in bed, wrapping up a
        persistent life where I did everything I could for 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>That was my second return.</p>

      <p>Chapter 105: Lotus (13)</p>
      <p>Dust scatters in the air.</p>
      <p>I swing my sword.</p>
      <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>
        Three valleys appear in front, and what looked like a mountain range at
        the end split into three parts.
      </p>
      <p>As Byeok Mun-seong panicks, I close in on him.</p>
      <p>
        I reach out and grab one of the hundreds of flying swords trailing
        behind him.
      </p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        Even just in the air, the Formless Sword exudes terrifying power, and
        when combined with a sword, its concentration increases even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I overlay the Formless Sword onto the artifact, it activates and
        emitted spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        It seems like a fire attribute flying sword. As flames burst forth, the
        Formless Sword catches the flames, creating a massive fiery sword.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Swinging the artifact overlaid with the Formless Sword, a massive fiery
        slash flies out, turning the desert into a glassy wasteland.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each swing brings Byeok Mun-seong closer due to his fear affecting his
        control of spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>I grab another flying sword and swing again.</p>
      <p>A water attribute flying sword.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>The desert in front transforms into a swampy area.</p>
      <p>
        I swing a wood attribute flying sword, corresponding to the Zhen trigram
        (☳), containing the attribute of thunder, and lightning strikes all
        around, melting parts of the desert into glass.
      </p>
      <p>“Aaaargh!”</p>
      <p>
        Caught in the lightning, Byeok Mun-seong screams and loses control of
        his flying sword, plummeting downwards.
      </p>
      <p>Plunk!</p>
      <p>
        He falls into a sand dune, and Buk Hyang-hwa, who had managed to escape
        from his grasp, summons her artifacts nearby and safely land on one.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, you are unharmed."</p>
      <p>
        "You could have just waited a bit and caught this guy, but you had to
        come and complicate things."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, no matter how many artifacts you have, you shouldn't underestimate
        the power of a Qi Building cultivator."
      </p>
      <p>I point at him, crawling out of the sand dune.</p>
      <p>Sssss!</p>
      <p>"Yin Soul Ghost Incantation."</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Several curse spells fly towards him, embedding directly into his head.
      </p>
      <p>“Aaaargh!”</p>
      <p>“Restrain!”</p>
      <p>Screech!</p>
      <p>
        The curse spell burrows into his upper dantian, creating a mental
        restraint.
      </p>
      <p>He rolls his eyes back, foaming at the mouth, and collapses.</p>
      <p>I approach him, forming hand seals.</p>
      <p>“Why did you do this?”</p>
      <p>“Hurrk... Ahh, ahh!”</p>
      <p>“Answer, and the pain will lessen. Answer me.”</p>
      <p>“I, I...”</p>
      <p>He starts babbling while drooling.</p>
      <p>“I alone... recognize her true worth...”</p>
      <p>“Hmm?”</p>
      <p>“I alone... can help her grow!”</p>
      <p>“So you kidnapped her for that?”</p>
      <p>“That’s... right...!”</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa, who has approached, asks coldly.</p>
      <p>
        “And what was that about being able to help me grow? What does that
        mean?”
      </p>
      <p>“Answer.”</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        I trigger the curse spell slightly, and Byeok Mun-seong, his eyes
        rolling back, replies.
      </p>
      <p>“The, the Byeok Clan... recently, in the desert... found it...”</p>
      <p>“What is it?”</p>
      <p>“The, the ruins of... the Jo Clan...”</p>
      <p>I ask curiously.</p>
      <p>“The Jo Clan?”</p>
      <p>What kind of clan is that?</p>
      <p>I see Buk Hyang-hwa’s face turn serious.</p>
      <p>“You found the ruins of the Jo Clan?”</p>
      <p>“Is the Jo Clan... a famous clan?”</p>
      <p>I ask puzzlingly, and Buk Hyang-hwa nods gravely.</p>
      <p>
        “Unless you’ve spent a long time in eastern Byeokra, you might not know.
        The Jo Clan, gone extinct a thousand years ago, was shrouded in all
        kinds of mysteries.
      </p>
      <p>
        A thousand years ago, they were renowned in all areas of creation –
        artifacts, puppets, talismans, elixirs. The most well-known fact to the
        general public is…”
      </p>
      <p>Her explanation makes me startled.</p>
      <p>“The clan of the Mad Lord, Jo Yeon.”</p>
      <p>‘The Mad Lord’s clan...!’</p>
      <p>I become astonished and look at Byeok Mun-seong.</p>
      <p>
        “A thousand years ago, they ruled all of Byeokra, boasting tremendous
        power, then vanished overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some say the Mad Lord, in his madness, exterminated his own clan, but
        that seems implausible.”
      </p>
      <p>I recall what the Mad Lord had sobbed.</p>
      <p>―I exterminated my own clan that killed her.</p>
      <p>“...”</p>
      <p>
        I fall silent, and Buk Hyang-hwa continues interrogating the delirious
        Byeok Mun-seong.
      </p>
      <p>“So, what did you find at the Jo Clan ruins?”</p>
      <p>
        "In the ruins of the Jo Clan... of the Mad Lord Jo Yeon, a special...
        elixir formula... was discovered that enhances the talent of descendants
        who possess the Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent, growing their
        abilities."
      </p>
      <p>"A special elixir? What is it?"</p>
      <p>
        With a groan of resistance, he starts to speak under my mental
        restraint.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's an elixir that, besides enhancing spiritual power, significantly
        amplifies 'emotions' by incorporating the resentful souls of the
        ingredients used in the Qi Building Pills in its refining process. The
        Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent has a nature where if 'emotions'
        fluctuate beyond a certain level or through the accumulation of
        experience over a long period of effort, 'growth of quality' is
        possible. From Seven-Patterns to six, from four to three, from two to
        one. For Buk Hyang-hwa, who is a Four-Pattern Extraordinary Pattern Law
        Talent, with enough effort accumulated, there's a possibility to reach
        the level of Three-Patterns!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember the half-mixed patterns of black and purple that had appeared
        on her.
      </p>
      <p>"I, only I can help her grow, awaken her talent..."</p>
      <p>"Is there anything else you wish to ask?"</p>
      <p>"No, that's enough."</p>
      <p>I form a spell and place my hand on his head.</p>
      <p>"What should we do with him?"</p>
      <p>"I can turn him into an idiot if you want."</p>
      <p>After pondering, she shakes her head.</p>
      <p>
        "Let it be. He has shown me kindness before, so let's call it even."
      </p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa coldly looks down at Byeok Mun-seong.</p>
      <p>
        "But this is it, Cultivator Byeok. There's nothing between you and me
        anymore, no next time."
      </p>
      <p>"You hear that? Remember her words."</p>
      <p>I softly trigger the curse.</p>
      <p>
        Screaming, he passes out, likely retaining only the memory of Buk
        Hyang-hwa's final words.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's go."</p>
      <p>"Okay."</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa gathers her flying sword artifacts and ascends on a flying
        artifact with me back to Cheon-saeok City.
      </p>
      <p>Feeling the desert wind, I ask her.</p>
      <p>
        "Aren't you curious about the formula for that elixir? It could be
        beneficial for a cultivator like you."
      </p>
      <p>She gives an awkward smile.</p>
      <p>
        "Most cultivators don't know, but do you know the main ingredient of the
        Qi Building Pill, Daoist Seo?"
      </p>
      <p>"I'm aware."</p>
      <p>
        "Then, it's easier to explain. My father told me that human life force
        and essence blood are used in the Qi Building Pill. That formula is
        based on it, so I'd rather not consume it."
      </p>
      <p>"Most cultivators consume it knowingly. Why don't you?"</p>
      <p>"Have you consumed any Qi Building Pills, Daoist Seo?"</p>
      <p>I smile wryly.</p>
      <p>"I haven't."</p>
      <p>"Then you understand... I'd rather not."</p>
      <p>"I see."</p>
      <p>"And I've been thinking."</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa gently touches the skin where her patterns were visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If talent can grow through experience and effort, I'd prefer to grow
        that way."
      </p>
      <p>"A wise choice."</p>
      <p>
        We continue to talk about talent and cultivation on our way back to
        Cheon-saek City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon returning, she embraced Buk Joong-ho, who finally relaxed and
        hugged her back.
      </p>
      <p>
        When asked about the kidnapper, Buk Hyang-hwa didn't mention Byeok
        Mun-seong, only deciding to increase her room's security and protective
        artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, the kidnapping incident concluded.</p>
      <p>
        A few days later, we resumed our discussions on the formation method.
      </p>
      <p>
        The remaining parts included the external and inner array methods
        conceived in Serving Command Palace and the coordination between the
        formation artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent months redesigning the formation method, now nearing
        completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The last part is the most tedious and time-consuming. We need to focus
        on trial and error to finalize the formation."
      </p>
      <p>
        What remained was for Buk Hyang-hwa to create the formation artifacts,
        attract dragon veins to support the Longevity Tree, and finely tune the
        formation to the Longevity Tree.
      </p>
      <p>This is time-consuming due to gathering the dragon veins.</p>
      <p>The formation artifacts were quickly completed.</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa made seventy-two formation flags and thirty-six formation
        discs, which Cheongmun Ryeong and I adjusted to fit the formation
        alongside Buk Hyang-hwa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we just have to wait for the dragon veins to gather after
        installing the formation!
      </p>
      <p>"We need a place for test trials..."</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong suggests, and Buk Hyang-hwa, adjusting the formation
        artifacts, replies.
      </p>
      <p>"Should we find a place rich in dragon veins?"</p>
      <p>"That would be ideal. Any suggestions?"</p>
      <p>She hesitates before responding.</p>
      <p>"There is a place near Cheon-saek City..."</p>
      <p>"Let's go there."</p>
      <p>"To install the formation there, we need my father's permission."</p>
      <p>"Is it his property?"</p>
      <p>With a bittersweet smile, she says,</p>
      <p>"It's my mother's grave."</p>
      <p>Embarrassed, Cheongmun Ryeong coughs and looks away</p>
      <p>
        “We can’t do a formation experiment on your mother's grave. We should
        look for another location, even if it's a bit farther.”
      </p>
      <p>“I believe my father will grant permission.”</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa puts down the formation flags on the table.</p>
      <p>
        “The purpose of this formation is to gather dragon veins to grow plants
        and trees, correct? Although my mother’s grave is in a desolate desert,
        some small plants grow due to the dense dragon veins. If the formation
        could make my mother’s grave more vibrant, I don’t see why my father
        wouldn’t agree. I’ll ask for his permission.”
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong coughs and nods in agreement.</p>
      <p>“Alright, then please do.”</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa leaves to seek permission from Buk Joong-ho, and soon
        after, he enters the conference room where we are designing the
        formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        After hearing again about the formation’s effects from Cheongmun Ryeong,
        he nods in approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        “She would have liked it. I entrust this to you, Cultivator Cheongmun.”
      </p>
      <p>“If you say so.”</p>
      <p>
        Thus, the test trial site for the formation was decided to be the grave
        of Buk Hyang-hwa’s mother, Buk Joong-ho’s wife.
      </p>
      <p>The spirit tablet is inscribed with the name Yeon (Lian / Lotus).</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa’s mother, Buk Joong-ho’s wife.</p>
      <p>Her name is Yeon.</p>
      <p>
        Buk Joong-ho pours some liquor at Yeon's grave and then closes his eyes
        for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeon's grave is in a sandstone cave a little away from Cheon-saek City.
      </p>
      <p>‘Or maybe it's not ordinary sandstone.’</p>
      <p>
        Due to the active dragon veins, the rocks seem to have transformed into
        a special ore infused with spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether Buk Joong-ho had created it or not, the cave's ceiling is open
        to the sky, letting in light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the light, various unknown flowers and grasses have sparsely
        grown inside the cave.
      </p>
      <p>‘This location...’</p>
      <p>
        I recall the memory of Buk Hyang-hwa giving me water for the first time
        in my past lives. It seems she used to visit this cave even then.
      </p>
      <p>“Please set up the formation, Cultivator Cheongmun.”</p>
      <p>“Understood.”</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong and I place formation flags and discs around the grave,
        outside, and at various distant spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formation flags attract the surrounding spiritual energy and the
        formation discs gather the dragon veins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, spiritual energy gathers in the center of the grave, enhancing the
        vitality around.
      </p>
      <p>The sparse grass and flowers begin to flourish more vigorously.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong and I complete the external formation setup and then
        move inside to adjust the inner formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        “My wife had no cultivation talent in her life. It's fortunate she now
        rests in a place filled with spiritual energy.”
      </p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho spoke while looking at the grave.</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong looks at the spirit tablet and asks him.</p>
      <p>“Yeon, that's a beautiful name. She must’ve been a lovely wife.”</p>
      <p>“Yes. My wife was beautiful. A good mother.”</p>
      <p>“What is her family name?”</p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho answers with a bittersweet expression.</p>
      <p>
        “My wife has no family name. Not because she lacked a family, but
        because her family was too eminent to give her one.”
      </p>
      <p>He caresses his wife's grave as he speaks.</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa also looks at her father's back with a melancholic
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The esteemed cultivator from the Gongmyo Clan, Elder Gongmyo
        Cheon-saek. My wife was his illegitimate daughter.”
      </p>
      <p>A vein popped on Cheongmun Ryeong’s forehead.</p>
      <p>“That lustful man... causing trouble again...”</p>
      <p>
        “I don’t resent him. He was kind to me, and my wife, being a mortal
        without any cultivation potential... well, it wouldn’t make sense for
        the Gongmyo Clan to give the clan name to an illegitimate mortal
        daughter...”
      </p>
      <p>“I apologize on behalf of my friend for his mistake.”</p>
      <p>
        “No need. Thanks to Elder Gongmyo Cheon-saek, we have Cheon-saek City,
        and my wife and I could spend time here...”
      </p>
      <p>
        After looking at the grave for a while, he takes out a small sapling of
        magnolia.
      </p>
      <p>“Yeon loved magnolias. Please let this bloom.”</p>
      <p>“Certainly.”</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong plants the magnolia sapling behind the grave and
        connects the dragon veins of the formation to the magnolia.
      </p>
      <p>
        “After 5 years, the dragon veins will accumulate spiritual energy, and
        then it will rapidly grow the magnolia. We can come back later to check
        on the dragon veins.”
      </p>
      <p>He sighs lightly and looks at Buk Hyang-hwa and me.</p>
      <p>
        “Thank you all for your efforts. All that’s left is to observe the
        formation for 5 years, solve minor issues, and conduct trial and error.”
      </p>
      <p>“5 years...”</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong sighs softly.</p>
      <p>
        “Even at this old age, instead of resting peacefully at the main house,
        I'm conducting tests on formations…”
      </p>
      <p>“Haha, I apologize for that.”</p>
      <p>
        “No, Daoist Seo, you have nothing to be sorry for. It was our clan
        head's command after all.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong pats his back and leaves, while I briefly look at the
        Buk father-daughter pair and leave the grave with them.
      </p>
      <p>And thus, five years passed.</p>
      <p>In Buk Hyang-hwa's underground workshop.</p>
      <p>In its secret chamber.</p>
      <p>“Stay strong, Miss Buk.”</p>
      <p>“Hnngh!”</p>
      <p>
        I placed my hand on Buk Hyang-hwa’s back, infusing earth attribute
        spiritual power to support her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Not much longer now! With the techniques Cultivator Cheongmun and I
        taught you…”
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        The next moment, a light bursts from her eyes, and clouds of spiritual
        energy billow from her mouth.
      </p>
      <p>Woosh…</p>
      <p>
        Possessing the roots of Earth, Wood, and Metal, Buk Hyang-hwa exhales
        and reabsorbs clouds of yellow, blue, and white spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>Then, suddenly.</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        A sound like thunder seems to resound from her lower abdomen, indicating
        the circulation of Pure Spiritual Force within her.
      </p>
      <p>
        For about five years, Buk Hyang-hwa had been taking spiritual elixirs
        provided by her father Buk Joong-ho. Additionally with the guidance of
        Cheongmun Ryeong, a leading authority in spiritual awakening, and my
        teachings, she had reached the peak of Qi Refining
      </p>
      <p>
        Following my advice, she learned additional basic methods tailored to
        her spiritual roots, bringing them all to peak cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with her preparation and my help, she has finally reached the
        stage of Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>“Ah…! Pure Spiritual Force…”</p>
      <p>
        She lifts her hand, showing the Pure Spiritual Force swirling around it,
        and lets out a small cry of joy.
      </p>
      <p>“Thank you so much, Daoist Seo.”</p>
      <p>“It’s nothing. It was a friend’s request after all.”</p>
      <p>
        “Haha, Senior Cheongmun is somewhat of a friend too, isn’t he? Yet, he
        said he wouldn’t help, didn’t he?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well… Cultivator Cheongmun is a member of the Cheongmun Clan, so
        helping a non-Cheongmun cultivator with Qi Building might cause some
        gossip within his clan, right?”
      </p>
      <p>“Hmm…”</p>
      <p>
        She gives me a meaningful look, then opens the door of the secret
        chamber and walks out, laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, let’s leave it at that. Now, let’s visit the grave. It’s time.”
      </p>
      <p>“…Alright.”</p>
      <p>
        Over the past five years, Cheongmun Ryeong, Buk Hyang-hwa, and I have
        grown closer.
      </p>
      <p>And as I watch her walk away, I smile wryly.</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa ascended to Qi Building, gaining an additional lifespan of
        300 years. The spiritual energy accumulated in the dragon veins over
        five years activated the formation, rapidly growing the magnolia tree.
      </p>
      <p>“Ah…”</p>
      <p>We marvel at the purple magnolia blossoms inside Yeon’s grave.</p>
      <p>
        Especially Buk Joong-ho, who looks close to tears at the sight of the
        flourishing magnolia.
      </p>
      <p>
        “…Thank you, Cultivator Cheongmun. Cultivator Seo. And thank you,
        Hyang-hwa.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “We should be thanking you for providing land rich in dragon veins.”
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong humbly accepts Buk Joong-ho’s gratitude.</p>
      <p>
        Unlike five years ago, the grave is now vibrant with dense spiritual
        energy, causing the inner grass and weeds to grow abundantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There’s no need to gather the formation artifacts we’ve spread out.
        We’ve confirmed this formation works, so we can just make more if
        needed.”
      </p>
      <p>“That’s right.”</p>
      <p>“…Thank you.”</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the formation designed by Cheongmun Ryeong and me, Yeon’s
        grave will continue to be a place brimming with life.
      </p>
      <p>
        After expressing his gratitude again, Buk Joong-ho exchanges
        pleasantries with us.
      </p>
      <p>After the courtesies are done,</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong looks at the formation and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        “Now, I'll return to the Cheongmun Clan and prepare a place near there
        similar to the first floor of Serving Command Palace, with similar
        dragon veins and environment. I’ll wait another five years and test the
        formation there. If it works as well as it did here, we’ll finally
        install the formation at the actual location of Serving Command Palace.”
      </p>
      <p>“Please do, and thank you.”</p>
      <p>
        There’s no need for Buk Hyang-hwa’s or my help in the remaining process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formation artifacts are complete, and the formation is fully
        adjusted. What remains is Cheongmun Ryeong’s test trial.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then, see you in five years, Daoist Seo. Now that you’re at the same
        level, Cultivator Buk.”
      </p>
      <p>“Yes!”</p>
      <p>“Understood.”</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong packs up his belongings and returns to the Cheongmun
        Clan.
      </p>
      <p>“Aren’t you leaving, Daoist Seo?”</p>
      <p>
        “There's no need for further adjustment to the formation, so my presence
        there is unnecessary.”
      </p>
      <p>“So, it’s just Senior Cheongmun leaving, and you’re staying?”</p>
      <p>“That seems to be the case.”</p>
      <p>“You could go somewhere else. Why insist on staying here?”</p>
      <p>I can’t find the words to respond and avoid her gaze.</p>
      <p>She notices my reaction and gently chuckles, taking me by the arm.</p>
      <p>
        “Alright. Since you're staying, for at least the next five years, you'll
        be in Cheon-saek City, right?”
      </p>
      <p>“That seems likely.”</p>
      <p>
        “Then, how about we plant a new sapling in front of my mother’s grave?”
      </p>
      <p>“Suddenly?”</p>
      <p>“You said you're staying, so let's commemorate that.”</p>
      <p>
        Unable to resist, I'm led by her to the market and somewhat
        bewilderingly buy a sapling.
      </p>
      <p>“What kind of sapling did you get, Daoist Seo?”</p>
      <p>“Ah... a quince tree.”</p>
      <p>I stroke the quince sapling.</p>
      <p>
        My old master used to say I resembled a quince tree, so I bought it in
        his memory.
      </p>
      <p>We each carry our saplings and enter Yeon’s grave.</p>
      <p>“Aren’t you curious about the sapling I got?”</p>
      <p>“Oh, I'm sorry.”</p>
      <p>“Haha, it's fine. My sapling is…”</p>
      <p>She caresses a blooming magnolia flower.</p>
      <p>“A white magnolia.”</p>
      <p>“White magnolia…”</p>
      <p>
        “Just like my mother loved purple magnolias, I love white magnolias.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel she suits white magnolia, much like her preference for white
        attire.
      </p>
      <p>
        We plant the quince and white magnolia saplings on either side of the
        purple magnolia tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formation is aimed at the purple magnolia, so our saplings wouldn’t
        grow rapidly but will gradually and naturally grow beside it.
      </p>
      <p>“Why did you suddenly decide to plant saplings, Miss Buk?”</p>
      <p>“I told you, didn’t I?”</p>
      <p>“That's true, but…”</p>
      <p>
        I sense she has other, unspoken reasons, but can't bring myself to voice
        them first.
      </p>
      <p>“Shall we head back?”</p>
      <p>“...Let's do that.”</p>
      <p>We return to Cheon-saek City.</p>
      <p>
        That evening, I once again sat on the walls of Cheon-saek City, facing
        the desert wind.
      </p>
      <p>“You seem to enjoy contemplation, my friend.”</p>
      <p>
        Buk Joong-ho approaches me from behind, echoing a scenario similar to
        five years ago.
      </p>
      <p>His question is similar as well.</p>
      <p>“How is it going lately, getting closer to the young lady?”</p>
      <p>I brush my face with one hand.</p>
      <p>“Do you still have no feelings beyond friendship for my daughter?”</p>
      <p>The same question as five years ago, but my answer has changed.</p>
      <p>“...I find myself fond of the Miss.”</p>
      <p>“Hahaha, I knew it. My intuition was right.”</p>
      <p>He chuckles heartily and sits beside me.</p>
      <p>“In fact, five years ago, you already liked my daughter.”</p>
      <p>“...”</p>
      <p>
        “You were able to hide your feelings back then, but now your affection
        has grown too strong to conceal, hasn’t it?”
      </p>
      <p>He accurately guesses my inner turmoil.</p>
      <p>I can't bring myself to remove the hand that covers my face.</p>
      <p>Falling for someone.</p>
      <p>
        He is right. Five years ago, I merely hid my feelings, but now they’re
        too evident.
      </p>
      <p>I like her, more than I can deceive myself.</p>
      <p>
        “So, when will you confess to my daughter? From what I see, she won't
        reject you.”
      </p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>“Sir…”</p>
      <p>That is it.</p>
      <p>“I have no intention of confessing to the Miss.”</p>
      <p>This love has to remain a beautiful memory.</p>
      <p>
        If it becomes more than a memory, and the subject of that love vanishes
        beyond time,
      </p>
      <p>I will surely go mad.</p>
      <p>“Hmm…”</p>
      <p>At my response, Buk Joong-ho gives me a puzzled look.</p>
      <p>
        “Are you part of a specific religion that forbids romantic
        relationships?”
      </p>
      <p>“No.”</p>
      <p>“Or perhaps you have a preference for men?”</p>
      <p>“...No.”</p>
      <p>“Or maybe a special cultivation method that renders you incapable…”</p>
      <p>“No!”</p>
      <p>“Then why?”</p>
      <p>He crosses his arms and asks me.</p>
      <p>
        “Why are you making such efforts not to be with my daughter since five
        years ago?”
      </p>
      <p>“...”</p>
      <p>
        “Had you truly disliked my daughter, you would have left Cheon-saek City
        with Cultivator Cheongmun. But you stayed, knowing your own heart. Yet
        you insist on not being with her?”
      </p>
      <p>
        He looks at me, unable to understand, and I resort to a shallow lie.
      </p>
      <p>“...I practice a peculiar cultivation method.”</p>
      <p>I continue explaining.</p>
      <p>
        “It’s called the One Emotion Method. It’s a method that intensifies a
        specific emotion to cultivate special powers. I’m using your daughter to
        amplify my emotions for faster cultivation. Staying here is just for
        advancing my cultivation…”
      </p>
      <p>“You're lying.”</p>
      <p>“I do practice the One Emotion Method.”</p>
      <p>“No, no.”</p>
      <p>He looks me straight in the eyes.</p>
      <p>
        “You said you use emotions for cultivation, right? If you were with my
        daughter, wouldn't your emotions deepen even more? Why wouldn’t you
        choose that?”
      </p>
      <p>“...”</p>
      <p>“Wouldn’t that be more beneficial for you?”</p>
      <p>Indeed.</p>
      <p>
        I practice the One Emotion Method to cultivate the Five Elements Blood
        Curse Banner, but the emotion I use isn't love.
      </p>
      <p>Rather, it’s calmness.</p>
      <p>
        Every time I think of Buk Hyang-hwa and feel my heart flutter, I
        deliberately use calmness as the emotion for my cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, my affection has grown too strong, overshadowing my calmness.
      </p>
      <p>“...Please give me some time.”</p>
      <p>“Hmm…”</p>
      <p>
        I can’t say anything more, and Buk Joong-ho looks at me with an
        unimpressed gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Fine. But I hope you make a decision quickly. My daughter has spent her
        life confined in the city, using her mother's last words as an excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her fate, as I see it, is you. Without you, she might never meet her
        fated and will continue to confine herself even more. I hope for a quick
        decision.”
      </p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho descends the walls, and I close my eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Days passed, and another pleasant visitor came from the west to stir my
        calmness.
      </p>
      <p>“How have you been, Eun-hyun?”</p>
      <p>It’s Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>“Let’s have a match.”</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>He draws his gold-bladed saber.</p>

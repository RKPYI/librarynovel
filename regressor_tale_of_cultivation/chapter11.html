      <p>Chapter 11: Heaven-Sent Talent (5)</p>
      <p>"Is this a dream?</p>
      <p>Swoosh...</p>
      <p>Rain is falling.</p>
      <p>
        The sky is dyed in ink, and beneath it, an old man in blues is riding a
        cloud-shaped magical artifact, looking down at the ruined main hall of
        the Palace of Heavenly Demon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around him, dozens of Qi Building practitioners in blue robes looked
        down upon the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the rain, it seemed as if an invisible barrier surrounded them,
        repelling the raindrops.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the center of the Palace, Hyung-nim, the members of the Palace of
        Heavenly Demons, and the elders lay covered in blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coughing up blood, Hyung-nim used a broken saber as a cane and barely
        stood up.
      </p>
      <p>“Monster... Qi Building, late stage...”</p>
      <p>
        The old man riding the cloud-shaped artifact looked down at him and
        said, “You can take pride, mortal. I am not just a simple Qi Building
        14-star cultivator, but a Qi Building at Great Perfection, a higher
        realm of cultivation. You have fought unbelievably well against a
        practitioner almost reaching Core Formation and forty-nine others in the
        Qi Building.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Fought well, my ass... Handling you alone was overwhelming. The rest...
        even if I just executed formations...”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hmm, judging by your state, you seem to have reached Five Energies
        Converging to the Origin among martial artists. Correct?”
      </p>
      <p>Coughing blood, Hyung-nim knelt on one knee.</p>
      <p>‘Hyung-nim...’</p>
      <p>
        Trapped under the debris of the collapsed building, I could only watch
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was pinned down by the debris, unable to move, when the building
        collapsed with a wave of a Qi Building cultivator’s hand.
      </p>
      <p>‘It’s not a fatal injury.’</p>
      <p>My self-diagnosis, based on my past life as a top-tier physician.</p>
      <p>With proper treatment, I could be up in two months.</p>
      <p>But right now, I couldn’t even slightly assist Hyung-nim.</p>
      <p>‘Even if I weren’t trapped, I’d be of no help.’</p>
      <p>Biting my lip, I realized my own powerlessness.</p>
      <p>
        The old man in the blue robe, who declared himself a Great Perfection Qi
        Building cultivator, stroked his beard and spoke to my Hyung-nim.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Although it’s abominable that you killed members of my cultivator clan
        and deserve death, I admire your talent. I offer you the chance to
        become a disciple of my clan and learn cultivation methods.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Cultivation... methods? Weren’t those... for your special, fancy
        folks... only?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “If a martial artist reaches Five Energies, even mortals awaken a
        similar spiritual quality. Your Five Energies Converging to the Origin
        probably corresponds to our Five Energies Spiritual Root. If you learn
        cultivation methods, you’ll become a valuable asset to our clan.”
      </p>
      <p>The other cultivators seemed taken aback by his offer.</p>
      <p>“Ha... Grandfather. This guy is...”</p>
      <p>
        Before a Qi Building cultivator could voice his displeasure, the old man
        murmured something, likely sending a telepathic message.
      </p>
      <p>Afterwards, the disturbed Qi Building cultivators started smirking.</p>
      <p>
        “Ha, indeed, mortal. You have the potential to become a cultivator, so
        we offer you this chance.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’ll even teach you our clan’s highest cultivation methods. You’ve
        achieved a great feat.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Becoming a cultivator will grant you incomparable power and wisdom.”
      </p>
      <p>They were now encouraging Hyung-nim to become a cultivator.</p>
      <p>
        I noticed from their eyes that they were mocking and ridiculing him.
      </p>
      <p>‘Trap...’</p>
      <p>
        It was a trap. They would accept him as a cultivator, but something was
        left unsaid.
      </p>
      <p>Coughing blood and covered in wounds, Hyung-nim stood up.</p>
      <p>
        “Cultivation, right. That sounds good! Indeed, fighting you helped me
        reach an epiphany. Thanks to you, I was able to complete the Record of
        Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts!”
      </p>
      <p>He stomped the ground powerfully.</p>
      <p>“I’ll show you the extreme of the marital Record!”</p>
      <p>“...With that broken saber? Your comrades are all dead, too?”</p>
      <p>
        “...The dead comrades of the Palace of Heavenly Demons will also wish to
        strike you down.”
      </p>
      <p>Hyung-nim grasped his saber stance.</p>
      <p>‘That look...’</p>
      <p>For a moment, I saw the overlap of Hyung-nim from my past life.</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, I felt like I understood the true intention behind the Record
        of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts..
      </p>
      <p>In my past life, Hyung-nim’s despairing look told me something.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        He vanished in an instant, reaching the old man's side and swung his
        sword.
      </p>
      <p>“Hmph, futile... huh...!”</p>
      <p>
        As the old man tried to cast a spell, my brother's broken saber sliced
        through the air next to him and cut through empty space.
      </p>
      <p>However, something invisible seemed to have been 'cut.'</p>
      <p>
        The old man was greatly flustered and lost hold of Young-hoon, who
        slipped past him and escaped through the encirclement of Qi Building
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>Indeed.</p>
      <p>
        This was the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial
        Arts created by Young-hoon from my past life. A martial art born from
        despair and sorrow, created by the greatest martial artist upon
        encountering a cultivator and falling into despair.
      </p>
      <p>This martial art harbored a purpose:</p>
      <p>
        "To my younger brother Seo Eun-hyun, please preserve this martial art
        for future generations, so they may have at least a lifeline in the face
        of the natural disaster known as cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>
        A secret technique to create an escape in the presence of stronger,
        invincible cultivators. This was the original goal pursued by the Record
        of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts.
      </p>
      <p>"Catch that audacious mortal!"</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The old man in blue robe rode a cloud-shaped magical artifact and chased
        after Young-hoon, and the other Qi Building cultivators followed suit,
        each riding their own flying magical artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few remaining Qi Building cultivators looked down at the ruined Palace
        of Heavenly Demons.
      </p>
      <p>"Seems like there's a survivor down there."</p>
      <p>Their gaze on me was palpable.</p>
      <p>But one of the cultivators dismissively said,</p>
      <p>
        "Nevermind. If they're not peak cultivators, let's leave the first and
        second-rate scraps and go after him. The rest can be handed over to the
        mortal authorities to issue a manhunt."
      </p>
      <p>"Understood."</p>
      <p>
        The Qi Building cultivators left me behind, soaring after Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, I was of no interest to them, just first-rate scraps.</p>
      <p>Worthless, inconsequential, a mere mortal.</p>
      <p>"Cough... Ugh...!"</p>
      <p>Weak, useless, powerless.</p>
      <p>
        Gritting my teeth, I pushed the debris off me with all my might,
        summoning all my internal energy.
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh... Aaaah!"</p>
      <p>Weak, yet surviving due to my insignificance.</p>
      <p>Happy about it?</p>
      <p>"Haah...!"</p>
      <p>
        I barely crawled out of the debris and collapsed onto the rain-soaked
        ground.
      </p>
      <p>"Aah... Aah...!"</p>
      <p>Endlessly weak, to the extent of being of no help to anyone.</p>
      <p>
        Despite learning various skills like disguise, medicine, stealth, and
        espionage to compensate for my weakness, I was helpless against real
        monsters.
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh... Aah...!"</p>
      <p>I wailed in the rain.</p>
      <p>Squelch, squelch, squelch...</p>
      <p>
        After some time, I regained some strength and crawled to where
        Young-hoon had jumped away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bodies of the elders and the peak cultivators of the Palace of
        Heavenly Demons were strewn about.
      </p>
      <p>I searched among them for any possible survivors.</p>
      <p>Sadly, all the members of the Palace were dead.</p>
      <p>"Damn it."</p>
      <p>Then, something caught my eye.</p>
      <p>The spot where Young-hoon had jumped.</p>
      <p>There was something there.</p>
      <p>"This is..."</p>
      <p>A sword mark. But it formed a shape.</p>
      <p>It was a letter.</p>
      <p>I hastily approached the sword mark and read the letters.</p>
      <p>"In fifteen days... at Suak Temple..."</p>
      <p>Suak Temple was a deserted temple outside Cheombyeok City.</p>
      <p>
        The sword mark was so crudely made that only someone who knew his
        handwriting could understand it.
      </p>
      <p>"I'll wait fifteen days."</p>
      <p>
        After using my internal energy to recover in the rain, I rescued other
        survivors trapped under the debris, buried the elders and members of the
        Palace in a suitable place, and addressed the remaining force.
      </p>
      <p>"Vice-leader, what do we do now?"</p>
      <p>
        "If Master Young-hoon, the Palace Leader, is defeated by the
        cultivators..."
      </p>
      <p>"We are marked as criminals in the martial world..."</p>
      <p>"If the authorities issue a manhunt for us..."</p>
      <p>I sighed, facing the desperate faces clinging to me.</p>
      <p>
        All that were left were those who had not reached the peak stage, only
        up to the late stage of first-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the peak experts belonging to the Palace had died fighting the
        cultivators while deploying a battle formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        'In such a situation, if the superior shows panic, it leads to great
        chaos.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Among these people, some might rise in rebellion and capture me to offer
        my head to the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>"From today on."</p>
      <p>Currently, I was nominally the superior.</p>
      <p>Unlike my past life, I was a mid-tier first-rate warrior.</p>
      <p>
        In a group where everyone else was only first-rate, my skills were not
        to be underestimated.
      </p>
      <p>"The Palace of Heavenly Demon changes form."</p>
      <p>This wasn't just a state of confusion.</p>
      <p>
        With the disappearance of the Extreme Heavenly Demon, Young-hoon, the
        focal point of the Palace, the organization's future seemed bleak, and
        chaos was bound to escalate.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the last superior, I had to present at least some sort of vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Palace of Heavenly Demons is currently marked as a public enemy of
        the martial world, and the authorities have set bounties on most of us.
        The focal point, Extreme Heavenly Demon, Young-hoon, is also currently
        in an unknown state of life or death!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, the remaining people's eyes started to look menacing.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If the authorities or martial factions start to pursue us, we'll be
        annihilated! But there is a way!"
      </p>
      <p>"What is it?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yanguo is vast! Therefore, it takes time and resources for news to
        spread throughout Yanguo. We will exploit this gap and seize control of
        the martial world's information in Yanguo!"
      </p>
      <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
      <p>
        "There are those among you who have learned espionage,
        counter-espionage, stealth, disguise, and other miscellaneous skills
        from me! We'll use those skills to gather information from each faction
        and understand the trends of the martial world, transforming the
        direction of the Palace of Heavenly Demons into an organization that
        handles information!
      </p>
      <p>
        From now on, information in the martial world will pass through our
        hands and be manipulated by us! Since we deal with information, even the
        information that the Palace of Heavenly Demons was our predecessor can
        be manipulated by us!
      </p>
      <p>
        We will survive by circulating, supplying, and selling false information
        to the authorities and martial factions!"
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't mere bravado.</p>
      <p>
        In my past life, when I was the chief strategist of the Wulin Alliance,
        all information and events of the martial world were in my hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was more than capable of handling information, and I even knew about
        many future events.
      </p>
      <p>
        My words seemed to have given some confidence to the remaining people as
        the threat in their eyes began to fade.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The sooner the better. Let's establish a new organizational structure
        and search the Palace building for land deeds and money. Before the
        night ends, we will be reborn!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly reorganized the remaining members and left Cheombyeok City
        with others that night.
      </p>
      <p>Fifteen days passed.</p>
      <p>I headed to Suak Temple as mentioned by Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>'What's this? It's empty.'</p>
      <p>I waited a long time.</p>
      <p>Until dawn the next day, I waited for Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>But again, the day turned to night.</p>
      <p>
        Night turned to day, and after three days and nights, Young-hoon did not
        come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I rummaged through Suak Temple and finally found a trace left by
        Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>"Phew, almost missed it."</p>
      <p>I found a sword mark on the main beam of Suak Temple.</p>
      <p>
        "Cultivators are pursuing, so I couldn't meet you and left this letter
        here."
      </p>
      <p>I jumped up to the beam, cut it down, and dropped it.</p>
      <p>
        The beam had dozens of small sword marks, each forming letters. Despite
        the poor handwriting, I could make it out.
      </p>
      <p>I slowly read Young-hoon's letter.</p>
      <p>
        "That day, I realized the true purpose of the Record of Transcending
        Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts. I thought it was a martial art
        created to kill cultivators, but I was completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>It was made to escape from cultivators.”</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "That day, I deeply felt the despair of the creator of this martial art.
        Surely, the creator too must have met an overwhelming cultivator,
        despaired, and ended up creating a martial art not to confront but to
        escape from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could kill cultivators with this martial art only because their level
        was too low. I boasted that it was the greatest martial art, but I
        realized it has nothing to boast about.”
      </p>
      <p>"Hyung-nim..."</p>
      <p>This letter's tone reminded me of Young-hoon from my past life.</p>
      <p>
        "But I will continue to run away from the cultivators with my last
        pride. I'll see if martial arts can really not stand against
        cultivators, if the martial Record is really only about escaping, or if
        I can reach beyond that.
      </p>
      <p>
        From now on, I will keep running away from cultivators, evolving the
        Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts to its
        extreme as long as I can practice martial arts. It seems I won't see you
        for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultivators are approaching. If I survive, I'll come to you someday."
      </p>
      <p>That was the last sentence of the letter.</p>
      <p>"I, too, will wait for you in the shadows, Hyung-nim."</p>
      <p>
        I left Suak Temple and returned to Gwiyeonggak, the successor to the
        Palace of Heavenly Demons, now reorganized as an intelligence
        organization.
      </p>
      <p>Another ten years passed.</p>
      <p>
        I successfully infiltrated Gwiyeonggak into the shadows of Yanguo,
        controlling the information market throughout Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        My decades of experience handling information in the Wulin Alliance and
        knowledge of the future were immensely helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other intelligence organizations resisted us a bit, but they eventually
        lost in secret battles.
      </p>
      <p>We were, after all, successors to the Palace of Heavenly Demons.</p>
      <p>
        A group formed from the remnants of a faction designated as martial
        world’s greatest criminals, with each remnant being a first-rate master.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were of the level of large faction elders or small faction sect
        leaders, and abundant in our ranks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if others initiated secret battles, our sheer power overwhelmed
        them, and we easily swept away other intelligence organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for peak masters who could challenge us, they had no reason to get
        involved in such secret battles, preferring to establish their own
        factions or join large factions as honorary elders or guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, within five years, Gwiyeonggak completely controlled
        Yanguo's martial world information market, erasing any information
        linking us to the Palace of Heavenly Demons.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next five years, I stabilized Gwiyeonggak and waited patiently
        for Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>Ten years after the annihilation of the Palace.</p>
      <p>
        Gwiyeonggak had firmly established itself as a leading information
        faction in Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, we deceived the cultivators into believing that the
        remnants of the Palace of Heavenly Demons were completely eradicated,
        successfully separating us from the Palace..
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, we even became the privileged class in Yanguo, supported by
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        In ten years, a few of the late-stage first-rate warriors had crossed
        the threshold into peak masters, ensuring we were not lacking in
        external strength.
      </p>
      <p>Everything was abundant.</p>
      <p>Except for one thing.</p>
      <p>'My own skills.'</p>
      <p>As I remember, I have about ten years left to live.</p>
      <p>Shing! Shing!</p>
      <p>
        The sword strokes of the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship sliced through
        the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        For ten years, busy with work, I couldn't properly train my martial
        arts, so my martial arts level was just at the boundary between mid and
        late first-rate.
      </p>
      <p>'I'm just one step away from reaching the late first-rate.'</p>
      <p>But that step wouldn't cross.</p>
      <p>
        I must reach the late first-rate stage within the next ten years and at
        least grasp the clues to the Pinnacle Realm.
      </p>
      <p>'How long must I remain weak?'</p>
      <p>I was nearing seventy, but I still felt considerably weak.</p>
      <p>
        'I aim for at least the Five Energies Converging to the Origin, but I'm
        still not even late first-rate.'
      </p>
      <p>Why is my talent so meager?</p>
      <p>
        Pondering this while swinging the sword for a while, a familiar voice
        reached my ears.
      </p>
      <p>"You still have a lot of distractions in your swordplay, Eun-hyun."</p>
      <p>"!"</p>
      <p>I immediately turned my head.</p>
      <p>There he was, sitting there.</p>
      <p>"It's been a long time, Hyung-nim."</p>
      <p>"Enough with the greetings, just wield your sword again."</p>
      <p>
        Following his instruction, I resumed the stance of the Severing Mountain
        Swordsmanship.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That sword technique fits you like a glove. Used properly, it can even
        lead you to the peak. Show me."
      </p>
      <p>I displayed the moves of the swordsmanship as he said.</p>
      <p>
        Watching, he pointed out corrections, and I diligently followed,
        improving my form.
      </p>
      <p>
        This guidance continued until nightfall, and then he disappeared like a
        ghost.
      </p>
      <p>Rubbing my eyes, I looked around, but he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
      <p>
        The next day, he reappeared, guiding me in martial arts, and I followed
        his teachings without question.
      </p>
      <p>Seven days and nights later, a breakthrough occurred.</p>
      <p>The sword felt fused with my being.</p>
      <p>
        The Severing Mountain Swordsmanship seemed to blend into my soul,
        becoming a part of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, it felt like I could perform the technique with a branch or
        even bare-handed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the sword energy naturally covered the sword, becoming
        much more stable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed I could maintain the sword energy much longer than before.
      </p>
      <p>"This is... Sword and Body Unity!"</p>
      <p>The realm of Sword and Body Unity, a symbol of the late first-rate.</p>
      <p>"You've crossed the barrier. Congratulations."</p>
      <p>"Hyung-nim, you are truly remarkable."</p>
      <p>I genuinely admired him.</p>
      <p>
        A boundary I couldn't cross for years, he helped me cross in just seven
        nights.
      </p>
      <p>But he clicked his tongue and said,</p>
      <p>
        "I didn't give it to you. You were almost at the boundary, so I just
        gave you a little push on the back."
      </p>
      <p>"Still, it wasn't easy to overcome that barrier."</p>
      <p>
        "I've done all I can for you. Now that you've crossed the barrier, you
        must sort it out yourself."
      </p>
      <p>"Of course."</p>
      <p>
        "And... reaching the pinnacle will not be easy. Beyond it lies a
        completely different world. You must not think in terms of ordinary
        martial arts regarding the Pinnacle Realm."
      </p>
      <p>"I have heard that all my life."</p>
      <p>
        "No matter how much you listen, it won't be enough. I may have crossed
        the pinnacle's barrier as if it was a joke, but for someone with your
        lack of talent, it will take thousands, tens of thousands of times more
        effort just to reach that barrier."
      </p>
      <p>"I will keep that in mind."</p>
      <p>"Right."</p>
      <p>Young-hoon Hyung-nim then took out a book from his robe.</p>
      <p>
        The title of the book was "Record of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding
        Martial Arts" (眺修越武錄).
      </p>
      <p>
        "I've supplemented some lacking parts of the Record of Transcending
        Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts, developed a few techniques
        further, and added a few more."
      </p>
      <p>
        He said 'a few', but the book was significantly thicker than the one I
        had received in my previous life.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed almost three times thicker.</p>
      <p>
        "But still, even after gazing at cultivators, beyond ordinary martial
        arts, it's just a record of no significance. I never managed to surpass
        cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "I managed to somehow evade the early Qi Building cultivators, and
        finally succeeded in cutting down a late stage Qi Building cultivator.
        But the Core Formation cultivators... They are like natural disasters.
        From the Core Formation onwards, they are akin to natural phenomena in
        human form..."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "I managed to cut off one wrist of a Core Formation cultivator. But that
        was it, the wrist grew back as soon as the cultivator chanted a few
        spells, and I was on the verge of life-and-death several times."
      </p>
      <p>He looked up at the sky with a bitter expression.</p>
      <p>I couldn't hide my own bitter feelings.</p>
      <p>He rose to the top of the world faster than in my previous life.</p>
      <p>
        Even after mastering the Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts, his previous cycle's legacy.
      </p>
      <p>It was the same result as I had heard in my past life.</p>
      <p>
        "Probably the creator of the Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts felt the same as I did. That this is '[the
        end]'. That martial artists cannot go beyond this... He must have felt
        that..."
      </p>
      <p>He brushed his face with a look of devastation.</p>
      <p>
        "I... I was highly regarded by the Core Formation cultivator who subdued
        me. I was admitted to his cultivation clan. I was the best in the
        martial world, but in the clan, I would be the junior. Haha... Since
        entering the cultivation clan means cutting ties with the secular world,
        I came to see you one last time."
      </p>
      <p>"Then, if that's '[the end]', why did you give this to me?"</p>
      <p>
        I looked at the Record of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts
        with a gloomy expression and asked.
      </p>
      <p>"After all, even if you master it, you can't reach cultivators."</p>
      <p>"Haha, that's true. But..."</p>
      <p>He spoke with a sorrowful expression.</p>
      <p>
        "For the future generation, to at least secure their minimum rights in
        front of cultivators. This martial art is left for that purpose. I don't
        even consider it a lifeline. It's just the minimum 'power' for beings
        like us, mere mortals, to be recognized as entities by cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>He smiled sorrowfully and continued.</p>
      <p>
        "There are many more cruel and brutal cultivators than you think. This
        martial art provides a brief moment of respite in front of such
        people... It's that kind of martial art."
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh...</p>
      <p>Suddenly, he disappeared completely from my sight.</p>
      <p>As if he had become a phantom, I was astonished.</p>
      <p>"This is..."</p>
      <p>
        "One of the miscellaneous techniques created while developing Record of
        Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts. This Record, like the
        Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts, requires
        the martial artist to reach the level of Three Flowers Gather at the
        Summit. Take it to a martial artist who has reached that level, and they
        will recognize its value. I also left another gift for you, so continue
        to diligently strive and reach the pinnacle."
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>
        After leaving these words, Young-hoon Hyung-nim never appeared in front
        of me again.
      </p>
      <p>Young-hoon Hyung-nim left something else for me.</p>
      <p>On the wall of my training ground.</p>
      <p>There, sword marks were engraved, forming a martial arts technique.</p>
      <p>"This is..."</p>
      <p>It was the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>
        But... tailored to my level, having reached the late first-rate, it was
        once again revised.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original swordsmanship which consisted of 12 moves, had 12 more
        added, making a total of 24 forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, the added moves were connected to the original Severing
        Mountain Swordsmanship, so it wasn't difficult to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps because I had reached the state of 'Sword and Body Unity,' the
        proficiency of the swordsmanship seemed to increase very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Hyung-nim."</p>
      <p>
        As I learned the revised swordsmanship, I quietly thanked Young-hoon
        Hyung-nim.
      </p>
      <p>My life slowly drained away.</p>
      <p>But I wielded my sword relentlessly, even with an aging body.</p>
      <p>
        From the late first-rate, striving to break through to the Pinnacle
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        I memorized the techniques of the Record of Gazing Cultivation and
        Exceeding Martial Arts, transcribed them, and secretly distributed them
        to major factions around Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hoped that the peak masters who got the record would slightly improve
        their realm and gain strength to oppose cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>My body was gradually losing vitality.</p>
      <p>It no longer obeyed me as before.</p>
      <p>But I gritted my teeth and swung my sword.</p>
      <p>I can't be weak anymore.</p>
      <p>I mustn't be weak.</p>
      <p>Repeating life doesn't mean there's no meaning in a repeated life.</p>
      <p>That's why I lived this life to the fullest.</p>
      <p>And for the life I may live again...</p>
      <p>I mustn't feel powerless in that lifetime.</p>
      <p>I cannot be weak!</p>
      <p>Years flew by quickly.</p>
      <p>On the day I died, I was still wielding my sword.</p>
      <p>Thus, I concluded my tenacious life with swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>That was my third return.</p>
      <p>
        Translator Notes: The words Transcending and Exceeding in 'Record of
        Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts' and 'Record of
        Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts' are the same word in
        Korean,월, which is phonetically Wol.
      </p>
      <p>
        So phonetically, the names of the records are
        <strong>Wol</strong>-su-gung-mu-rok and
        Jo-su-<strong>wol</strong>-mu-rok respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, to better show the difference between the two records I used
        different words that have similar meanings and fit the context,
        'Transcending' and 'Exceeding.'

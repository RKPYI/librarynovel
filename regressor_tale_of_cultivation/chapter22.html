      <p>Chapter 22: Refining (1)</p>
      <p>
        Following Kim Young-hoon, I left the Imperial palace and arrived at a
        small manor on the outskirts of Seokyung City.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, I found a gathering of martial artists who had followed Kim
        Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>"These people are..."</p>
      <p>
        I was impressed by the caliber of warriors Kim Young-hoon had assembled.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Members of the Four Star Three Demons? There are elders from various
        major sects too.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems he had used his connections from his days as the Wulin Alliance
        leader to gather elders from the seven major sects of Seokyung City's
        Four Star Three Demon and elders from some of the major sects in Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of them were peak masters, capable of using the Sword Silk, and
        there were over ten who had reached the level of Three Flowers Gather at
        the Summit.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Without the cultivators, this force could even overthrow the Imperial
        family...!'
      </p>
      <p>
        As I admired their strength, some of them glared at me, probing me with
        their red intents targeting my neck, forehead, and vital points.
      </p>
      <p>'What is this, some kind of test?'</p>
      <p>I responded with my intent, pointing at their vital points in kind.</p>
      <p>
        In a brief moment, I exchanged blows with several major sect elders.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, who is this person brought by the former alliance leader, the
        world's number one warrior? I've never seen such a master in Seokyung
        City."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, this man is Seo Eun-hyun, my younger brother. He was a renowned
        peak master in the Changho city area about twenty years ago. He recently
        joined us after leaving his role in the Shadow Guards."
      </p>
      <p>At his words, some elders seemed displeased.</p>
      <p>
        "Why bring someone from the government? Especially someone from the
        Imperial family?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Can we really trust him if he might still be loyal to the Emperor?"
      </p>
      <p>"I can't trust anyone from the government!"</p>
      <p>
        It seems the martial sects naturally had prejudices against government
        officials due to generally poor relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wait, everyone, calm down. Though he served under the Emperor, he has
        completely betrayed the Emperor after hearing my offer. Isn't that
        right, Seo?"
      </p>
      <p>"That's right. If you want, I can even curse the Emperor."</p>
      <p>
        I cleared my throat and let loose the frustrations I had been holding
        against the Emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Emperor Makli Jung, you despicable man! Treating your subordinates like
        dogs while you comfortably sleep in your chamber, shameless and lazy!
        I'll expose your family's atrocities to the world!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Having guarded the Emperor and seen him sleep comfortably in his chamber
        with a soundproof barrier while assassins attacked, I had often been
        annoyed. I never had the mindset to be loyal to the Emperor of Yanguo.
        In fact, I even harbored some resentment towards the Emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
        After my rant against the Emperor, the hostility in the eyes of the
        gathered peak masters seemed to soften.
      </p>
      <p>"Well, if he's a spy, he wouldn't curse the Emperor so freely."</p>
      <p>Recognizing their acceptance, I felt a sense of achievement.</p>
      <p>
        Once the recognition was settled, Kim Young-hoon addressed the gathered
        martial artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Listen. As I said before, the current Imperial family and the
        cultivator clan behind them, the Makli Clan, have abandoned their
        humanity and sucked the lifeblood of countless commoners. They are no
        different from cannibalistic devil path cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've gathered enough allies. Starting today, we'll join hands with the
        Makli Clan's opposition, the Jin cultivator clan, and bring down the
        Makli Clan's strongholds."
      </p>
      <p>He continued his explanation.</p>
      <p>
        "The Jin Clan will support us from behind. We'll follow their lead to
        find the hidden domains of the Makli Clan and destroy their
        elixir-making furnaces where they grind commoners into pills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you, the great masters gathered here, will join us in this
        righteous cause."
      </p>
      <p>There was no loud response, just silent nods.</p>
      <p>"Then, let's move quickly to bring down those wicked cultivators!"</p>
      <p>We followed Kim Young-hoon out of Seokyung City.</p>
      <p>
        In a small valley northeast of the city, known as Immaekgok, we met a
        group of red-robed cultivators waiting for us.
      </p>
      <p>'These must be the Jin Clan cultivators.'</p>
      <p>
        "I see they're quite capable," commented an elderly cultivator among
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Have you kept your promise? I brought allies, now let's take down those
        vile cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, yes. The wicked Makli Clan must be eradicated from Yanguo. Now,
        let's open the portal to the Makli Clan’s domain."
      </p>
      <p>
        As the elder formed hand seals, the valley's landscape began to distort.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Follow us closely. We're about to breach the Makli Clan's formations."
      </p>
      <p>
        We followed the cultivators into the twisting path, and soon, the
        distorted valley disappeared, leading us into a small village.
      </p>
      <p>'It smells...'</p>
      <p>
        Upon entering, the stench of blood and decaying bodies filled the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everywhere, the smell of blood and rotting corpses permeated the air.
      </p>
      <p>"Intruders! The Jins are attacking!"</p>
      <p>Dang, dang!</p>
      <p>A bell tolled from a watchtower in the village.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, cultivators in blue robes emerged from the thatched
        houses and began forming hand seals.
      </p>
      <p>Woom!</p>
      <p>A blue barrier enveloped the entire village, blocking our entry.</p>
      <p>
        "Ha, you may have brought some martial artists, but you, Jin Clan scum,
        dare not enter here!"
      </p>
      <p>The barrier looked robust at first glance.</p>
      <p>
        The thickness of the blue light barrier was hundreds of times thicker
        than the flimsy defensive spell I had shattered with my energy in a
        previous encounter.
      </p>
      <p>That's when it happened.</p>
      <p>Step, step...</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon stepped forward.</p>
      <p>"Elder, who is this mortal? Can we really trust him?"</p>
      <p>
        The sounds of chattering cultivators in red robes from the Jin Clan were
        heard from behind.
      </p>
      <p>The elder in red robes paused for a moment before responding.</p>
      <p>
        "He may be a mortal, but he's different. It may be hard to believe, but
        he matched me in combat without being overpowered. Moreover, his
        techniques sometimes surpassed my defenses..."
      </p>
      <p>Woom...</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon began to gather his internal energy.</p>
      <p>
        Both I and the other peak masters, even those who had reached Three
        Flowers Gather at the Summit, widened our eyes, eager to witness Kim
        Young-hoon's technique.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>
        As he raised his hand, internal energy began to coalesce in the air.
      </p>
      <p>The energy gradually condensed into a form of Gang Qi</p>
      <p>
        The tremendous power emanating from the energy force made us, as well as
        the Jin Clan cultivators, flinch.
      </p>
      <p>However, the transformation of Gang Qi was not the end.</p>
      <p>'That is...!'</p>
      <p>I watched, wide-eyed, as Kim Young-hoon continued.</p>
      <p>The Gang Qi started to condense.</p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble!</p>
      <p>'That is...!'</p>
      <p>
        In my past life, Kim Young-hoon had pursued this state in a frenzied
        chase.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble!</p>
      <p>'The realm beyond Five Energies Converging to the Origin'</p>
      <p>
        The realm he had strived for until the very end was now unfolding from
        his hands once again.
      </p>
      <p>The Gang Qi solidified, taking the form of a small sphere.</p>
      <p>Everyone present could feel it.</p>
      <p>Being hit by that sphere would leave few unscathed.</p>
      <p>
        The strike that had burst the arm of a Core Formation cultivator in the
        past life!
      </p>
      <p>The technique that could confront a Qi Building cultivator head-on!</p>
      <p>
        The Sphere of Gang Qi, directed by Kim Young-hoon's gesture, flew
        towards the barrier created by the cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>Bright light flashed, and a fierce windstorm ensued.</p>
      <p>
        The cultivators, each in their own way, performed spells to avoid being
        swept away by the storm, while we, peak masters, relied on our leg
        strength or cut through the wind to witness the spectacle.
      </p>
      <p>It was visible.</p>
      <p>Hundreds, no.</p>
      <p>
        Thousands, tens of thousands of Gang Saber burst from the sphere,
        slicing through the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the world of peak masters, tens of thousands of intents danced in
        unimaginable trajectories.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        The red-robed elder from the Jin Clan, seemingly having unpleasant
        memories associated with the sphere, showed discomfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the windstorm subsided and the light faded, a giant hole appeared in
        the center of the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>"Everyone, enter!"</p>
      <p>"Yes, Elder!"</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivators, each using their flying spells, entered
        through the hole Kim Young-hoon had created.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also drew our weapons and entered through the breach in the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>"Stop them! Block the Jins!"</p>
      <p>"Wait! First, stop those martial artists!"</p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>
        The sword energy of a peak master who had reached Three Flowers
        instantly pierced through the defensive spell of a cultivator who had
        been speaking and slit his throat.
      </p>
      <p>"A mortal... has broken through a cultivator's spell!"</p>
      <p>
        "The Pinnacle Realm of martial artists! Retreat to the rear! Qi Refining
        cultivators, release the Jiangshi!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, dark Jiangshi started emerging from various places in
        the village.
      </p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>The Jiangshi rushed towards the peak masters.</p>
      <p>Their speed was faster than ours, and their strength far superior.</p>
      <p>However...</p>
      <p>'I can see it.'</p>
      <p>
        The optimal trajectory of the Jiangshi's attacks was clearly visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Interesting. I hadn't considered it before, but those lines represent
        intent. Does that mean the Jiangshi, already dead and turned into
        vengeful spirits, still possess intent?'
      </p>
      <p>
        I dodged the hand of a Jiangshi rushing towards me, then, using Deep
        Mountain, I cut diagonally and thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Is it just the intent of their controllers? No, it doesn't seem just
        that. But if Jiangshi have intent, why can't they use sword energy?'
      </p>
      <p>
        While cutting through the Jiangshi, I noticed a cultivator preparing a
        spell.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I swiftly released a hidden weapon towards the cultivator forming hand
        seals.
      </p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        The weapon rebounded off the cultivator's defensive spell, but,
        inexperienced in combat, he canceled his spell preparation at the sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Judging by the size of his consciousness... about Qi Refining 1st
        Star.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I cut down the Jiangshi in my way and charged towards the cultivator,
        unleashing my Sword Silk.
      </p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        With each strike of my sword silk, visible cracks appeared in the
        cultivator's defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        'This is pathetically weak compared to the spells used by the Qi
        Refining 2nd Star cultivator I fought before.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Although that cultivator had artificially inflated his abilities with
        talisman, his defensive spell was still his own ability.
      </p>
      <p>Clang, clang!</p>
      <p>
        After several strikes, the distracted cultivator's defense shattered.
      </p>
      <p>
        "H-hiik... S-spare me. Please spare me. I only did what the clan asked
        me to. I didn't want to do it, I'm actually..."
      </p>
      <p>"What is this?" I asked.</p>
      <p>"Please, I'll tell you everything. This is the primary refinement."</p>
      <p>I furrowed my brow.</p>
      <p>"Primary refinement?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. We extract the essence and vital energy from mortals and collect
        it in this formation for primary refinement into essence blood. This
        blood is then sent to the clan's higher-ups for further refinement in
        higher domains. There, they mix the essence blood, refine it again
        through secondary, tertiary, and quaternary processes, until finally,
        they create fresh blood by combining thousands of mortals' blood and
        energy, from which they concoct Revival pills (復命團) for the Core
        Formation elders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, great master, I did nothing wrong. If you wish, I'll give you all
        the essence blood I've refined. It's a powerful supplement, and
        consuming it could increase your internal energy..."
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>I looked at him with a sneer.</p>
      <p>"You've made it easier for me to kill you without hesitation."</p>
      <p>"W-what?"</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>
        Instead of using my sword, I infused my fist with energy and burst the
        cultivator's head.
      </p>
      <p>There had been some hesitation.</p>
      <p>
        Even if they were devil path cultivators, perhaps there were those who
        lived peacefully, cultivating in this village.
      </p>
      <p>'In this village, there is no good person. There can't be!'</p>
      <p>
        I cast aside all hesitation and drew my sword towards the cultivators in
        blue robes controlling Jiangshi.
      </p>
      <p>"You all have no right to live."</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>Qi Mountain, Heart Heaven!</p>
      <p>
        With my energy channels fully opened, I unleashed enhanced sword silk,
        cutting down the attacking Jiangshi in one swoop, and charged towards
        the blue-robed cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>"Die, all of you!"</p>
      <p>The battle ended quickly.</p>
      <p>
        In the center of the village, a Qi Building cultivator from the Makli
        Clan was swiftly killed by the combined attack of the Jin Clan elder and
        Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the Qi Building cultivator defeated, Kim Young-hoon went around
        slicing through Jiangshi and other cultivators with his energy spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha-ha, excellent! As expected of a Makli Clan cultivator, their pockets
        are deep!"
      </p>
      <p>"I made the right decision joining this raid!"</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan cultivators, having finished looting the corpses of the
        Makli Clan cultivators, were rummaging through their belongings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Jin Clan elder was searching through the body of the Qi
        Building Stage cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>"Those cultivators are going too far."</p>
      <p>"How can they think of looting bodies after killing them?"</p>
      <p>"Hmm, hmm."</p>
      <p>
        In contrast, I and the other peak masters were visibly uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I had experience in plundering weapons and wealth after killing
        unorthodox martial artists, I had never actively searched bodies in such
        a manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, it's natural for the victor to claim the spoils. You mortals
        might not understand, but taking the spoils is also a way to honor the
        defeated," spoke a Jin Clan cultivator, slightly flushed, trying to
        justify their actions.
      </p>
      <p>But the more he spoke, the stiffer our expressions became.</p>
      <p>
        "Enough. It's better to leave them be. After all, they are just dead.
        Wouldn't it be better to leave quickly?"
      </p>
      <p>Just then, Kim Young-hoon approached us.</p>
      <p>"Wait. We have something to do."</p>
      <p>"What? Are you also after the spoils..."</p>
      <p>Ignoring the cultivator's words, Kim Young-hoon spoke to us.</p>
      <p>
        "In the houses of the cultivators, there are bodies of sacrificed
        commoners. We should at least bury them, so they don't remain exposed
        like that. What do you think, masters?"
      </p>
      <p>"That's right."</p>
      <p>"We forgot about them."</p>
      <p>
        We entered the houses where the Makli Clan cultivators had lived,
        dragged out the bodies of the commoners, and one by one buried them.
      </p>
      <p>"Let them be. They're just dead. Isn't it better to leave quickly?"</p>
      <p>
        The Jin Clan elder, having finished looting, looked annoyed at Kim
        Young-hoon, who was digging the ground to bury the bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, neither Kim Young-hoon nor any of us paid attention to him,
        continuing to silently bury the bodies
      </p>
      <p>How much time has passed?</p>

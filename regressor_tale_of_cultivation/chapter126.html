      <p>Chapter 126: What You Trampled On / The Path You Have Tread (14)</p>
      <p>[Uh... Aaaaaaah!]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li swings the Blood Wave Fan.</p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>"Scatter."</p>
      <p>The blood storm he tries to summon disperses by Seo Ran's command.</p>
      <p>[This... damn it...!]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li clenches his teeth, veins bulging all over his body.</p>
      <p>And then, Yuan Li emits a bloody radiance.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>"Dangerous."</p>
      <p>
        He’s far more sinister than when he was in his old body, a completely
        different level of threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stand next to Seo Ran, grasping the Colorless Glass Sword and the
        Formless Sword together, and use the first form of Severing Mountain
        Swordsmanship towards the bloody radiance.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Kwoooooosh!</p>
      <p>Tingling...</p>
      <p>After a moment of trembling hands, I glare at Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>
        Though greatly weakened under Seo Ran's control, he is still a Nascent
        Soul cultivator, significantly stronger than his peers!
      </p>
      <p>'He hasn't reached the late stage of Nascent Soul.'</p>
      <p>
        Just like I distributed my power among the curse dolls, he focused more
        on the cultivation of the so-called Blood Body than his own, hence not
        reaching the late stage of Nascent Soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, he created the Blood Body and added a millennium to his
        lifespan, which is no loss for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truly, the more one uncovers, the more sinister and formidable he
        becomes.
      </p>
      <p>But now.</p>
      <p>'All of his cards are revealed.'</p>
      <p>There is nothing more to worry about.</p>
      <p>
        The hidden power that the Byeok Clan head mentioned must have been this
        Blood Body.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, if I just take down this body.</p>
      <p>'It's over!'</p>
      <p>
        I dash towards Yuan Li with blazing eyes, and Seo Ran also forms a spell
        next to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I wondered why this desert is so cold... Turns out there's so much yin
        energy sleeping beneath this land."
      </p>
      <p>
        At his spell, the base of Yuan Li's black castle beings to boil and
        bubble.
      </p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>Kiiiyaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>Kiiyaaaa!</p>
      <p>Kwaaaack!</p>
      <p>
        An enormous amount of yin energy erupts, and a terrifying number of
        vengeful souls and ghosts begin pouring out from under Yuan Li's black
        castle.
      </p>
      <p>Kiyaaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>
        With their emergence, the previously clear desert sky fills with yin
        energy, dark clouds gathering once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How many thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands did you
        slaughter and devour, Senior Yuan Li? Even the elders who managed the
        livestock farms would shake their heads."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran clicks his tongue and forms another spell.</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, with eyes blasting bloodlight, charges at Seo Ran, but I, along
        with the other surviving Core Formation cultivators, including Cheongmun
        Jung-jin, block his path with lit eyes.
      </p>
      <p>-I blame you!</p>
      <p>-Bloodwood!</p>
      <p>-Bloodwood Practitioner Yuan Li!</p>
      <p>-Yuan Li!</p>
      <p>Countless ghostly wails cry out Yuan Li's name.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran too looks appalled, and the ghosts crawling out from under the
        black castle continue to multiply.
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li's complexion darkens.</p>
      <p>
        [This crazy... Why is a member of the Sea Dragon Tribe practicing the
        methods of the Black Ghost Valley...!]
      </p>
      <p>"I've told you. I'm a disciple of the Great Black Ghost Valley."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran smiles and continues his spellcasting.</p>
      <p>And his spell becomes complete.</p>
      <p>
        [I, Sea Ran, who hosts this Ghost Festival, call upon the spirits to
        reveal their reason for resentment!]
      </p>
      <p>-Yuan Li!</p>
      <p>-Kill Yuan Li!</p>
      <p>-We were killed by the Bloodwood Practitioner!</p>
      <p>
        [Having heard your cries, I, Seo Ran, disciple of Black Ghost Valley,
        offer you the opportunity to manifest in physical form and seek to
        assist you in your revenge. Please lend me your strength]
      </p>
      <p>-Revenge!</p>
      <p>-We can take revenge!</p>
      <p>-Take revenge against him!</p>
      <p>-Yuan Li!</p>
      <p>Kiiiyaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>Thousands of ghosts cry Yuan Li's name, howling in hordes.</p>
      <p>
        All around Seo Ran, an enormous ghostly power erupts from within the
        ghost fog.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s definitely not a level of ghostly power Seo Ran can produce alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Disciple of the Black Ghost Valley, Seo Ran, hosting this festival and
        swearing in the name of the Nether Crossing Ship, offers you the chance
        to manifest and aid your revenge. But you too must swear to lend your
        strength against him!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran's voice echoes in all directions, and Yuan Li bursts into
        laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You, I see what spell you're trying to cast. That's a Heavenly Being
        level technique, can someone like you even handle it...?]
      </p>
      <p>But Seo Ran ignores Yuan Li's words and continues on.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>-Kiiiyaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>-Kwaaaaa!</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>Around Seo Ran, surrounded by ghost fog,</p>
      <p>
        From somewhere afar, immense power flows from the Nether Crossing Ship,
        pouring into the thousands of ghosts slaughtered by Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        If everything went as planned, Song Jin would have anchored the Nether
        Crossing Ship deep in the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        After gathering the yin and ghostly energy of the deep sea through the
        Nether Crossing Ship, it was planned to be transmitted to Seo Ran via
        the ship's teleportation array.
      </p>
      <p>Kwoooosh!</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of ghosts gain strength and wail.</p>
      <p>
        Then, as Seo Ran completes his spell, tens of thousands of ghosts rush
        into his body.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran's aura begins to surge dramatically.</p>
      <p>The power of tens of thousands of ghosts converge into Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li shouts with a tense voice.</p>
      <p>
        [Fool! You won't be able to contain that power! Just explode and die,
        foolish Sea Dragon...!]
      </p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>[Master, please come!]</p>
      <p>Seo Ran calls out while looking at the ghost fog.</p>
      <p>Ssshhh...</p>
      <p>I shudder as I feel every hair on my body stand.</p>
      <p>Another soul, not Seo Ran's, is present in his upper dantian.</p>
      <p>The Attaching Spirit Great Spell.</p>
      <p>
        It allows one to attach a part of their original spirit to someone else,
        enabling the distant exertion of their power.
      </p>
      <p>"Kugh, cough!”</p>
      <p>I find it hard to breathe and collapse on the spot.</p>
      <p>Not just me.</p>
      <p>
        Even Cheongmun Jung-jin and numerous Core Formation cultivators who were
        blocking Yuan Li, all suddenly fell to their knees, overwhelmed.
      </p>
      <p>Even Yuan Li, who is full of vigor, trembles violently.</p>
      <p>[Ah, ahh, ahhh...]</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin, the elder of Black Ghost Valley and a Heavenly Being
        cultivator, has gathered tens of thousands of vengeful ghosts that Yuan
        Li had slaughtered.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment.</p>
      <p>He regained his original strength.</p>
      <p>[What a nostalgic scene.]</p>
      <p>Blue ghost fire lights up in Seo Ran's eyes.</p>
      <p>From his mouth, a different voice than Seo Ran’s.</p>
      <p>It’s Song Jin.</p>
      <p>
        He seems lost in thought, looking at something different in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, who looks as if he’s about to foam at this mouth, emanates an
        intent of horror.
      </p>
      <p>[Why, why... is there a Heavenly Being cultivator...!]</p>
      <p>
        [Right, let's not fall into nostalgia. Even though it's just a remnant
        spirit left in my remnant soul, using the Attaching Spirit Great Spell
        is quite taxing on both my and Ran's souls. Let's finish this quickly.]
      </p>
      <p>Kiiiyaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of resentful souls wail.</p>
      <p>
        Ghostly claws sprout from Song Jin's hand, now occupying Seo Ran's body.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Huaaaaaah!!! Why are you still here! Why is a Heavenly Being cultivator
        still here!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li desperately tries to flee, invoking the spiritual energy of
        heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>[Die.]</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kuguaguaguaguang!!!</p>
      <p>
        The strike tears away the outer walls of Serving Command Palace. The
        ancient barrier surrounding Yuan Li's black castle, which even the
        combined efforts of Core Formation cultivators couldn't budge, is also
        torn like paper.
      </p>
      <p>Kuguaguanguang!</p>
      <p>A valley forms in the desert.</p>
      <p>
        Not a small one created by cultivators, but the desert literally cleaves
        in half.
      </p>
      <p>No other words can describe the scene.</p>
      <p>Simply put, the desert split in two.</p>
      <p>That alone is enough.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>
        The piece of meat that was once Yuan Li, hit by Song Jin's strike,
        twitches in the corner of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truly proving his feat of having survived Seo Hweol's Three Ultimate
        Strikes, he’s still alive, albeit reduced to a piece of flesh.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kulock!</p>
      <p>Song Jin, in Seo Ran's body, coughs up black blood.</p>
      <p>He looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        [You, you said you learned a curse method, right? Transfer all the
        burdens inflicted on my disciple's body and soul to me, the caster of
        the Attaching Spirit Great Spell.]
      </p>
      <p>"Will you be alright?"</p>
      <p>
        [I’m already a dead body so why does it matter? Just quickly transfer
        the burden.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Following Song Jin's request, I use the Yin Soul Ghost Incantation to
        transfer all burdens on Seo Ran's body and soul to Song Jin as a curse.
      </p>
      <p>It’s possible because Song Jin himself allows it.</p>
      <p>
        [Huh huh. This reduces the time I can spend with my disciple by 100
        years. Damn it... If Yuan Li wasn’t a threat to my disciple, I would
        never have done this. Surely you won’t tell me that you can’t finish him
        off after I’ve turned him into a piece of meat? I’m leaving now.]
      </p>
      <p>
        With those words, Song Jin releases the Attaching Spirit Great Spell and
        disappears from Seo Ran's body.
      </p>
      <p>'So this is the power of a Heavenly Being.'</p>
      <p>I laugh hollowly at the traces Song Jin leaves behind.</p>
      <p>
        It’s my first time witnessing the attack of a Heavenly Being cultivator
        up close.
      </p>
      <p>The sight of the split desert is chilling.</p>
      <p>"Now, he's completely neutralized! Everyone attack!"</p>
      <p>
        I hold the Colorless Glass Sword and fly toward the meat that was once
        Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other Core Formation cultivators, released from Song Jin's pressure,
        also rush toward the flesh with blazing eyes.
      </p>
      <p>That's when it happens.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>From the black castle, the crimson stream flows again.</p>
      <p>"Again?!!"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin exclaims in disgust.</p>
      <p>"Everyone, prevent it from reaching Yuan Li!"</p>
      <p>I pour out curses, creating a river of curse spells.</p>
      <p>The dark river of curses entwines around Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>
        'I'll corrupt whatever Long Source True Power and everything else...!'
      </p>
      <p>But then.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>The Long Source True Power summoned by Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>
        Instead of Yuan Li, it heads towards the formation flags he had stuck in
        the ceiling of the Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>"What...!"</p>
      <p>I grit my teeth and raise the Colorless Glass Sword.</p>
      <p>"Everyone, stop it!"</p>
      <p>He’s trying to summon the Serving Command Seal.</p>
      <p>At that moment.</p>
      <p>[Wuuuuahhh...!!!]</p>
      <p>
        The meat lump that used to be Yuan Li emits an immense bloody radiance,
        shaking off my curses and soars into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>[I too, will stake my life!]</p>
      <p>Huaaaa!</p>
      <p>I instantly realize what he’s doing.</p>
      <p>He’s burning his own Nascent Soul.</p>
      <p>
        A gamble that can burn up the Nascent Soul completely, leading to death,
        or at least dropping the level of cultivation if it goes wrong!
      </p>
      <p>But if the gamble succeeds,</p>
      <p>'He'll obtain the Serving Command Seal!'</p>
      <p>I clench my teeth, explode all my energy, and rush after him.</p>
      <p>Chuarukruk!</p>
      <p>
        From the meat lump that is Yuan Li, numerous branches sprout, forming a
        bloody forest that blocks my path.
      </p>
      <p>
        The remaining Core Formation cultivators all rush in to break through
        the forest together.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>In an instant, I reach Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>"Do you think it'll go as you wish?"</p>
      <p>[Out of my way!!!]</p>
      <p>Chuaruruk!</p>
      <p>From Yuan Li's body, his Nascent Soul pops out.</p>
      <p>A baby with numerous hands, eyes, and mouths.</p>
      <p>
        The baby cuts off one of its hands attached to the soul and throws it at
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Even if my cultivation drops, even if my entire plan completely
        collapses! I cannot retreat from this spot!]
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The sacrificed arm of the Nascent Soul explodes massively, engulfing me.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Severing Mountain!</p>
      <p>Kuguaguagua!</p>
      <p>I pierce through the explosion, chasing after Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>
        Neglecting defense and focusing solely on breaking through the
        explosion, the skin on my entire body peels off.
      </p>
      <p>
        But thanks to the life force of a Core Formation cultivator and the
        effect of the Spirit Nector’s enhanced regeneration, my skin quickly
        heals.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>His formation activates.</p>
      <p>The last floor of Serving Command Palace collapses, and finally,</p>
      <p>Paaaatt!</p>
      <p>
        The Serving Command Seal appears in the sky of the Serving Command
        Palace.
      </p>
      <p>Taatt!</p>
      <p>
        I gulp down as many of the liquors I have remaining in my storage
        artifact.
      </p>
      <p>White-Red Wine, enhancing the connection with my dharma treasures.</p>
      <p>Dream Lotus Elixir, increasing the speed of my dharma treasures.</p>
      <p>Red Moon Dew, strengthening my power...</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, in the form of a baby Nascent Soul, explodes all his hands,
        eyes, and mouths.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        In an instant, Yuan Li gains tremendous power by damaging his Nascent
        Soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        After drinking numerous immortal wines and focusing all that power into
        a single point, I throw the Colorless Glass Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        My sword and Yuan Li's hand reach the Serving Command Seal at the same
        time.
      </p>
      <p>And at that moment.</p>
      <p>"Stop!"</p>
      <p>Seo Ran's voice reaches Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li's body freezes in place.</p>
      <p>
        My Colorless Glass Sword deflects the Serving Command Seal and hits it
        far away.
      </p>
      <p>"This is the end."</p>
      <p>
        I charge towards Yuan Li, unfolding the ultimate technique of Severing
        Mountain Swordsmanship, Severing Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>Paaatt!</p>
      <p>At that moment, a bloody light begins to glow.</p>
      <p>Parararak!</p>
      <p>"...!"</p>
      <p>
        The formation flags Yuan Li had infused with Long Source True Power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Destroying all floors of Serving Command Palace, the flags still
        floating in the air move, surrounding and holding the far-flung Serving
        Command Seal.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Chuarararak!</p>
      <p>
        From one side of the meat lump, tentacle-like tendrils sprout, grabbing
        the Serving Command Seal.
      </p>
      <p>[I am the master of the Serving Command Seal...!]</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>[Fortune has tilted in my favor…!!!!!]</p>
      <p>
        His cockroach-like persistence finally succeeded in grabbing the Serving
        Command Seal.
      </p>
      <p>Chuaruruk!</p>
      <p>He regenerates his body.</p>
      <p>Drip, drip...</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, as always, still hides his face behind the black mask. However,
        blood flows from beneath.
      </p>
      <p>Clearly not in a good state.</p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>He is laughing.</p>
      <p>
        [The Blood Body I have hidden, all my Long Source True Power. I have
        used them all. Even going as far to damage my Nascent Soul, reducing my
        cultivation to the early stage. Having gone this far to seize heavenly
        fate, if I can't defeat you all, call me a damned pig!]
      </p>
      <p>'He's got the Serving Command Seal.'</p>
      <p>I still clench my teeth and charge at him.</p>
      <p>
        'But with something as metaphysical as fate, he can’t recover his
        strength!'
      </p>
      <p>He’s near death and hasn’t been able to regain his strength.</p>
      <p>'I'll kill him and snatch the Serving Command Seal!'</p>
      <p>At that moment.</p>
      <p>Rumble...</p>
      <p>Serving Command Palace begins to collapse.</p>
      <p>
        After being hit by Song Jin's attack and even losing the Serving Command
        Seal to Yuan Li,
      </p>
      <p>The exterior walls of Serving Command Palace slowly crumble.</p>
      <p>Those fragments begin to fall precisely towards me.</p>
      <p>Boom Boom!</p>
      <p>I slash through the debris of the exterior walls.</p>
      <p>
        But strangely, no debris falls towards Yuan Li, and he smoothly flies
        past me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I slash the Formless Sword at him, but precisely between him and me, the
        debris of Serving Command Palace falls, and my Formless Sword misses
        him.
      </p>
      <p>'What is this...!'</p>
      <p>My eyes widen in confusion.</p>
      <p>[Foolish boy. It seems the heavens are on my side.]</p>
      <p>Seo Ran orders Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>“Kneel!”</p>
      <p>But, Yuan Li, holding the Serving Command Seal, just laughs.</p>
      <p>
        [Oh, my. Coincidentally, it seems all the essence blood of the Sea
        Dragon King in my body evaporated when I was hit by the attack of the
        Heavenly Being Cultivator. It’s truly a coincidence.]
      </p>
      <p>“What...!”</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>Yuan Li emits blood light.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran is swept away by the blood light straight into the black castle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li follows Seo Ran out of Serving Command Palace, and strangely,
        the collapsing Serving Command Palace stops breaking down the moment
        Yuan Li leaves.
      </p>
      <p>Crack...</p>
      <p>I finally manage to escape the bombardment of debris.</p>
      <p>What is this?</p>
      <p>This isn’t some striking coincidence.</p>
      <p>It’s as if the entire world is standing on his side.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>
        The ghost of Song Jin watching the situation from my embrace suddenly
        starts howling.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Damn it!!! That cockroach-like bastard! Surviving from getting hit by
        even that and getting his hands on the Serving Command Seal?!]
      </p>
      <p>It‘s Song Jin's voice.</p>
      <p>He urgently speaks to me.</p>
      <p>[You! Look around! How many remaining ghosts are there around us?]</p>
      <p>
        Prompted by Song Jin's voice, I widen my perception and survey the
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        But perhaps because everything had been exhausted by Song Jin's strike,
        there are almost no remaining ghosts or resentful souls.
      </p>
      <p>“Almost... none.”</p>
      <p>
        [Damn it! If there were as many ghosts as before, I could have snatched
        back the Serving Command Seal and whatever else! Damn it! Damn it!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Song Jin curses and then cuts off the communication. I quickly follow
        after Seo Ran and Yuan Li into the black castle.
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>“Cultivator…Seo.”</p>
      <p>“...!?”</p>
      <p>
        Under the debris of Serving Command Palace, I hear the voice of Byeok
        Mun-seong.
      </p>
      <p>“Cultivator… Byeok?”</p>
      <p>He is half buried under the debris.</p>
      <p>
        No, the problem isn't that he is half-buried, but rather, like Buk
        Hyang-hwa, his lower body is missing somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>Only a quarter of his body remains.</p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, he is still alive due to the tenacious life force of a
        Core Formation Cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>However…</p>
      <p>'His Golden Core, it's shattered.'</p>
      <p>He is about to die soon.</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong fumbles his mouth and speaks to me.</p>
      <p>“...I won't... hold you long... since it's urgent. This…”</p>
      <p>He pulls out a small glass shard from his chest and hands it to me.</p>
      <p>“That is…”</p>
      <p>
        A glass sculpture carved from inside a centipede den with a cursed doll.
      </p>
      <p>It’s a shard of that sculpture.</p>
      <p>
        “I loved her too, but compared to you, perhaps my love wasn’t that deep.
        Rather... if I hadn’t been resentful of you for stealing her from me, I
        might have given up chasing after her in a few years. But anyhow... she
        was my first love. Please…”
      </p>
      <p>He clenches his teeth and hands me the glass shard.</p>
      <p>“Avenge her, I beg you.”</p>
      <p>I clench my teeth and take the shard he hands me.</p>
      <p>“Understood. Rest well.”</p>
      <p>With that, Byeok Mun-seong closes his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        I leave Byeok Mun-seong behind and enter the castle with the surviving
        Core Formation Cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>Inside the black castle, the air is thick with the smell of blood.</p>
      <p>I swiftly fly towards where I sense movement.</p>
      <p>The center of the castle.</p>
      <p>The grand hall there.</p>
      <p>
        I head to that place, where the smell of blood is the strongest, where a
        few survivors have gathered.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, I see Yuan Li entangling Seo Ran with blood.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu...</p>
      <p>I clench my teeth.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li is leisurely holding the Serving Command Seal.</p>
      <p>
        Externally, he is just a Nascent Soul at the initial stage, a very
        weakened early Nascent Soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        But internally, he has risen back to the level of a mid-stage Nascent
        Soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Entering my castle to confront me, who holds the Serving Command
        Seal..? Admirable courage. But all of you who injured me to the point of
        damaging my Nascent Soul will be reduced to a handful of Long Source
        True Power.]
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li grins wickedly.</p>
      <p>
        [I was momentarily bewildered by the appearance of a Heavenly Being. But
        yes, I've heard rumors about one of the elders of Black Ghost Valley. A
        ghost soul, beheaded by the Mad Lord, stuck in the ruined Nether
        Crossing Ship like a bound spirit, waiting for the day to be dragged
        into the realm of the dead! It must be him, right? Hahaha, it's
        impressive that such a remnant soul could deliver a strike at the
        Heavenly Being stage. His days of being dragged to the Netherworld must
        be numbered now.]
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li smirks sinisterly.</p>
      <p>
        [Now I have nothing to worry about. All that's left is to kill all of
        you and heal my injuries.]
      </p>
      <p>Blood light flashes around him.</p>
      <p>
        [I didn't realize that Summoning Wind, True Blood Transformation was a
        trap left by Seo Hweol, but now that I do, I just need to extract the
        practice of Summoning Wind, True Blood Transformation from my Blood
        Body. I'll deal with all of you with only the Blood Demon Suppressing
        Sea Light and Blood Chain Binding Forest!]
      </p>
      <p>Can we win?</p>
      <p>It’s truly despairing.</p>
      <p>How in the world...</p>
      <p>Can we defeat this monster?</p>
      <p>
        Even if I risk my life now and unleash Foolish Old Man Moves
        Mountains...
      </p>
      <p>Can I manage to land a strike?</p>
      <p>Is this life even worth it?</p>
      <p>That's when...</p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle...</p>
      <p>The ghost left in my arms by Song Jin starts to speak again.</p>
      <p>[What's the situation inside?]</p>
      <p>"Hmm?"</p>
      <p>Alerted by Song Jin's voice, Yuan Li's body shudders.</p>
      <p>
        "Seo Ran is captured, and Yuan Li is showing off his mid Nascent Soul
        cultivation while holding the Serving Command Seal."
      </p>
      <p>
        [I see. It's going to be a bit noisy, so make sure you protect Seo Ran
        well.]
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm?"</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        With a sound as if the heavens are tearing apart, one side of the black
        castle’s wall collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
        A massive shockwave whirls through the hall, and I shield Seo Ran from
        the debris and shockwave headed his way.
      </p>
      <p>And then...</p>
      <p>I realize the identity of the surprise.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li and I both utter its name.</p>
      <p>[Nether Crossing Ship?]</p>
      <p>"Nether Crossing Ship?"</p>
      <p>It’s a completely ruined, dark wreck.</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin rammed the Nether Crossing Ship into Yuan Li's castle for his
        disciple.
      </p>
      <p>[Barrier!]</p>
      <p>
        And then, the debris from the Nether Crossing Ship flies and forms some
        sort of formation around Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, reminded of his dreadful experience at the hands of Song Jin,
        stands stiffly.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Anyone who wants to live, get into the barrier I’ve set up! I'll let
        everyone in except that Yuan Li bastard.]
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin, gripping the helm of the Nether Crossing Ship, burns with
        ghost fire and speaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Since my last move used up a lot of the time I can remain in this
        world, I might as well leave now."]
      </p>
      <p>"Ma…Master...!"</p>
      <p>Seo Ran calls out to Song Jin in a desperate voice.</p>
      <p>Song Jin looks fondly at Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        [Disciple, remember this well. The will of Black Ghost Valley is not in
        the Nether Crossing Ship but in the people who reside inside.]
      </p>
      <p>Swish...</p>
      <p>Song Jin pulls out a dark pearl.</p>
      <p>It’s the space-breaking bead.</p>
      <p>
        [The Serving Command Seal is frightening, but there are three ways to
        counter it. First, a fate stronger than the Serving Command Seal.
        Second, overwhelming power. And third…]
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, you can't! Space-breaking beadl! As the descendant of the Sea
        Dragon King, I command you, do not respond to my master's command!"
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>The Nether Crossing Ship begins to vibrate.</p>
      <p>
        [History. If it's something with a long history, it can resist fate.
        Experience the Nether Crossing Ship’s history of 500,000 years...!]
      </p>
      <p>Wuwuwuwuwu!</p>
      <p>
        The Nether Crossing Ship and the space-breaking bead begin to glow
        simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why aren't you listening to me! Space-breaking bead! Listen to me!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, his eyes rolling in panic, ignores the Nether Crossing Ship and
        shouts.
      </p>
      <p>"No! Master! Master!!"</p>
      <p>[Space-breaking bead, active. Nether Crossing Ship....]</p>
      <p>In his final moments, Song Jin looks at Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        Somehow, his eye sockets streaming with ghost fire, seem to be smiling.
      </p>
      <p>[Self-Destruct.]</p>
      <p>
        I hurriedly pull Cheongmun Jung-jin and the other cultivators into the
        barrier Song Jin set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li frantically pounds on the barrier trying to get in, but since
        Song Jin doesn't allow it, he can only stupidly keep pounding while
        holding the Serving Command Seal.
      </p>
      <p>And then...</p>
      <p>A dark storm engulfs everything.</p>
      <p>The storm subsides.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, weeping tears of blood, frees himself from Yuan Li's restraint
        and gazes at the debris before him.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, ah... ahhh..."</p>
      <p>The barrier set up by Song Jin barely withstood the storm.</p>
      <p>
        The reason it could withstand the terrifying spatial storm seemed to be
        not because the barrier itself was robust, but rather because the
        barrier, made from the debris of the Nether Crossing Ship, is unaffected
        by the power of the same Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>It’s a matter of property, not the magnitude of power.</p>
      <p>I step out of the barrier.</p>
      <p>Squelch, squelch...</p>
      <p>"Heh..."</p>
      <p>I spit words with contempt.</p>
      <p>"Truly, utterly despicable."</p>
      <p>A blood-soaked lump of flesh.</p>
      <p>
        Above this lump, a figure of a blue dragon appeared, guarding the
        meatlump.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Seo Hweol, Seo Hweol, Seo Hweol! Is it you again? Just stop coming
        out..!"
      </p>
      <p>Swoooooosh</p>
      <p>The dragon figure, having faced the spatial storm, scatters away.</p>
      <p>
        However, thanks to Seo Hweol's protection, Yuan Li is still not dead.
      </p>
      <p>"Seo Hweol...!"</p>
      <p>I cry out his name in venom.</p>
      <p>Chuarak. Churararak</p>
      <p>The lump of flesh begins to regenerate.</p>
      <p>Kurok Kurok…</p>
      <p>Yuan Li reveals himself again.</p>
      <p>Now, Yuan Li also looks precarious.</p>
      <p>
        His mask is shattered, covering only his eyes and forehead, leaving his
        mouth exposed.
      </p>
      <p>His cultivation dropped to the Grand Perfection of Core Formation.</p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        The debris of the black castle, shattered by the Nether Crossing Ship,
        supplements his power.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>His cultivation soars back to the initial stage of Nascent Soul.</p>
      <p>"Heh, haha... hahaha..."</p>
      <p>
        Whether he is too weak to speak in consciousness, he bursts into
        laughter with his voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Serving Command Seal... the Serving Command Seal... saved me...! And
        with this early Nascent Soul cultivation, I can still... against you
        lot..."
      </p>
      <p>He spits out a mouthful of blood while speaking.</p>
      <p>"Kargh... gagk...!"</p>
      <p>"Tsk..."</p>
      <p>
        I attempt to approach him, but as he waves his hand, a blood light of
        early Nascent Soul level bursts out, blocking me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You, people like you... these youngsters... I, do you know how I lived
        to this day? For 900 years… What preparations I made, with what
        emotions, I came this far? Do you know? I won’t die. I will not die!”
      </p>
      <p>He screams, emitting power of the early Nascent Soul stage.</p>
      <p>I look at him calmly.</p>
      <p>"I, as well. I’ve lived for about 900 years too."</p>
      <p>"What...?"</p>
      <p>"Don't casually use age to assert in front of me...!"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>I charge at him, swinging the Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        But even as he vomits blood from the blow, he manages to fend me off,
        and the recoil sends me flying backward.
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh...!"</p>
      <p>
        "Keh, kah... These wretched fools. You vermin have driven me to this...!
        I'll kill you, I'll kill you all..."
      </p>
      <p>I stagger, trying to stand up.</p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>"...?"</p>
      <p>I see a jade norigae among the debris of the black castle.</p>
      <p>The norigae lay at Yuan Li's feet.</p>
      <p>I hastily search my bosom.</p>
      <p>"Ah..."</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Hyang-hwa’s norigae is still in my possession.</p>
      <p>Then, that one must be...</p>
      <p>'The great-grandson of Wolryang. It's his...'</p>
      <p>
        His relic must have been rolling around somewhere in Yuan Li’s castle
        after being consumed by Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I gaze at the norigae, Yuan Li, noticing my gaze, approaches it
        while sneering.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, right. This norigae. Was it the one that woman beside you 200 years
        ago had?"
      </p>
      <p>He approaches the noriage.</p>
      <p>He provocatively reminds me of my memories with Buk Hyang-hwa.</p>
      <p>A vile provocation.</p>
      <p>But it’s proof of how desperate he has become.</p>
      <p>"This garbage..."</p>
      <p>Crunch, crunch...</p>
      <p>He stomps on Wolryang’s great grandson's pendant, crushing it.</p>
      <p>Crunch...</p>
      <p>
        "You trash-like wretches, the trash you carry around is nothing. No
        matter how much you struggle, with the Serving Command Seal in hand..."
      </p>
      <p>"It's not."</p>
      <p>"What?"</p>
      <p>I slowly stand up.</p>
      <p>I have made my decision.</p>
      <p>"...It's not trash."</p>
      <p>
        "Ha, it's not trash? Look. This is trash. What's under my foot is..."
      </p>
      <p>I have vowed to stay alive until I offer his head to their souls.</p>
      <p>But now.</p>
      <p>After Song Jin sacrificed his life, creating this opportunity.</p>
      <p>Here and now.</p>
      <p>Even if I can't offer his head to them.</p>
      <p>I have resolved to die.</p>
      <p>I grit my teeth and raise the Colorless Glass Sword.</p>
      <p>"What you trampled on…No.."</p>

      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>Darkness reaches out to us.</p>
      <p>
        Thousands of black hands emerge from thin air, stretching towards us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twisting my body in mid-air, I narrowly evade all the hands along the
        optimal path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Mountain Lord’s Soaring Flight at full display, I manage to escape
        the ghost hands without a single hair touched.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, for Seo Ran with his large size, escaping is a bit more
        challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the power of exorcism and destruction from his golden bell, Seo
        Ran burns off several hands clinging to him and ascends upwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we break free from the ghost hands, the puppets we previously
        shattered on our way down started to rise in the air and swiftly charge
        at us.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>"Seo Hyung, don't stop, just look ahead."</p>
      <p>
        I release Sword Gang from both hands, swinging it in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>Boom! Bang!</p>
      <p>
        Following the intricacies of Dual Energy Sword Control, my Sword Gang
        wildly changes trajectory in mid-air, knocking away all parts of the
        puppets charging at us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, ahead of us, a sea of destroyed parts, emitting intense ghostly
        energy, are surging towards us.
      </p>
      <p>"Prepare the strongest attack."</p>
      <p>"Understood."</p>
      <p>
        I emit Gang Sphere from my Inner Core, and Seo Hyung gathers spiritual
        power at the corner of his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>"Break through!"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Three Gang Spheres fly from my hand, turning into a storm of light that
        stops the wave in its tracks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A blue torrent of light erupts from Seo Ran's mouth, striking the wave
        head-on.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran’s breath carves a huge hole in the wave.</p>
      <p>We rush towards the gap and manage to escape..</p>
      <p>We quickly ascend to the next level.</p>
      <p>Sticky, black darkness surges towards us, trying to grasp us.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran keeps exhaling breaths and I continuously emit Gang Spheres,
        narrowly escaping the pursuit of the Core Formation-level ghost spirit.
      </p>
      <p>Finally.</p>
      <p>We see the entrance we came through in the distance.</p>
      <p>As we’re about to escape the Nether Crossing Ship,</p>
      <p>Numerous black hands emerge from the ship itself.</p>
      <p>
        I evade all the hands, but Seo Ran, due to his size, can’t avoid them
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a reason for the sudden emergence of ghost hands from the
        ship's hull.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humming sounds emanate from the ship, and the ghost spirit's voice
        resonates.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Escaping well, aren't you? Daring to plunder the Azure Bone Valley's
        treasures like that bastard Mad Lord...!
      </p>
      <p>
        While I am here, it will never happen... Even if this ship is destroyed
        and discarded, it once shared its glory days with the Azure Bone
        Valley’s prime!
      </p>
      <p>No one can covet the Valley's treasures...!!!]</p>
      <p>'Azure Bone Valley?'</p>
      <p>Before I can ponder, another giant ghost hand surges towards me.</p>
      <p>
        I explode the ghost hand with a Gang Sphere from my Inner Core and
        approach Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>"Seo Hyung, I'll help..."</p>
      <p>"No need. I've gathered enough strength, I can handle this!"</p>
      <p>Seo Ran's body emits a sudden surge of demonic power.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, golden energy begins to emanate from between his scales.
      </p>
      <p>He looks to be cloaked in a golden protective Gang Qi.</p>
      <p>'Is this the power of that Dharma Treasure he mentioned earlier?'</p>
      <p>The ghost hands grasping him explode, freeing Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        He gnashes his teeth and ascends into the sky, as thousands more ghost
        hands emerge from the ship, trying to grasp him.
      </p>
      <p>The ghost spirit's voice echoes everywhere.</p>
      <p>
        [You! That's a treasure of the Azure Bone Valley, isn't it! If you leave
        it behind, I’ll let you go!]
      </p>
      <p>"Nonsense! This is my treasure! My own treasure!"</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran shouts back at the ghost spirit and signals me with his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I activate Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation, slicing through the
        ghost hands with wind, and cling to Seo Ran, aiding his flight.
      </p>
      <p>"Hold tight. We'll break through the barrier in one go!"</p>
      <p>"Yes!"</p>
      <p>
        I blast two ghost hands approaching us from both sides with Gang Spheres
        and grab onto Seo Ran's mane.
      </p>
      <p>Blue light emits from between his scales.</p>
      <p>
        In an instant, Seo Ran's massive body exerts explosive power, leaping
        through space, and we find ourselves near the water barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, I see the Nether Crossing Ship teeming with hundreds of
        black hands.
      </p>
      <p>The next moment.</p>
      <p>We're soaked again, entering the foggy area.</p>
      <p>The fog, blackened, follows us.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran evades the pursuing fog and throws himself towards the end of
        the mist.
      </p>
      <p>There is significant resistance when entering from outside.</p>
      <p>But there’s no resistance when leaving from inside to outside.</p>
      <p>
        Once we're outside the barrier, the light between Seo Ran's scales
        vanishes, and he falls powerlessly into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>'He's exhausted.'</p>
      <p>Seo Ran's condition doesn't look good.</p>
      <p>
        His eyes are rolled back and gasping for air. Seo Ran writhes as he
        floats on the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I need to move him, or else he might be attacked by other sea
        demons...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Using my internal energy, I grab Seo Ran's neck and activate Summoning
        Wind, Dragon Transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran and I are engulfed in a whirlwind and rise into the sky
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If only I had mastered water attribute spells, I could have just let
        him float in the sea and swim along..."
      </p>
      <p>
        I once again realize the importance of mastering the Five Surpassing
        Paths to Cultivation, especially the Water Path.
      </p>
      <p>After carrying his heavy body and flying for a while,</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>We finally make it out of the stormy sea.</p>
      <p>"Huff, huff..!"</p>
      <p>
        As soon as we’re in the sunlight, Seo Ran regains his consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>"Seo Hyung, may I put you down now?"</p>
      <p>"Ugh.. Yes, go ahead. My neck is sore."</p>
      <p>Splash!</p>
      <p>I drop Seo Ran into the sea, and he emerges from the water.</p>
      <p>
        Using Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation continuously while carrying
        Seo Ran quickly depleted my Inner Core's energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If I had kept flying while carrying Seo Hyung, I might have been
        exhausted too.'
      </p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, thanks for helping me several times and getting me out of that
        sea area. There are many demon tribes there practicing dark arts...
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had floated in the sea unconscious, I would have surely become
        their prey."
      </p>
      <p>"Helping a comrade is only natural. No need for thanks."</p>
      <p>"Haha, 'natural to help a comrade,' huh..."</p>
      <p>
        A trace of sorrow momentarily crosses Seo Ran's face and consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>"Anyway, this attempt was a failure."</p>
      <p>"What will you do now, Seo Hyung?"</p>
      <p>
        "I can't give up on what's inside there. It's something I desperately
        need."
      </p>
      <p>He clenches his teeth.</p>
      <p>
        "But that place is guarded by a Core Formation-level ghost spirit. It's
        impossible to investigate further."
      </p>
      <p>After a moment of silence, Seo Ran pulls out the golden bell.</p>
      <p>
        "I didn't expect such a ghost spirit to remain, so I only gathered
        energy in this treasure for three years just to fend off basic ghosts.
        But if such a being exists, it's a different story."
      </p>
      <p>He continues, looking at the golden bell.</p>
      <p>
        "More than three years. I'll invest even more time in this treasure to
        make it even stronger, so no evil ghost can approach.Then, I'll
        definitely get what I need!"
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        "Eun-hyun. Ten years. Can you help me again after ten years? I must
        obtain it. Without it, I cannot move forward. It's equivalent to my
        entire life being denied."
      </p>
      <p>His eyes reveal an obsession bordering on madness.</p>
      <p>
        Previously, he said he needed to find an item to enhance his
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>But I can tell.</p>
      <p>'It's not just about cultivation, there's something else.'</p>
      <p>After pondering, I nod to Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        "I will help you. You and the Sea Dragon King have been kind to me."
      </p>
      <p>It isn't just out of gratitude to Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>I owe much to Seo Hweol and wanted to help him.</p>
      <p>Seo Ran stays silent for a moment, then nods.</p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>We arrange when and where to meet again, and then part ways.</p>
      <p>"Sigh..."</p>
      <p>
        I stay floating above the sea with Summoning Wind, Dragon
        Transformation, organizing my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>'Thinking back, a great ghost...'</p>
      <p>The many ghosts in the fog.</p>
      <p>And the Core Formation-level ghost spirit called me a great ghost.</p>
      <p>
        The remaining ghost spirit of a Heavenly Being cultivator said I had a
        soul coated with multiple deaths.
      </p>
      <p>'Do the dead see such things?'</p>
      <p>
        The Black Bone Valley Grand Elder, White Bone Ghost Devil, who seemed
        much more skilled than the Core Formation ghost spirit, hadn't said
        anything to me.
      </p>
      <p>'The influence of being a 'dead person' seems significant.'</p>
      <p>
        ' Azure Bone Valley, too. I've never heard of it, even in the royal
        archives of Shengzi. Azure Bone Valley?'
      </p>
      <p>Could it be related to Black Bone Valley's hidden history?</p>
      <p>After contemplating, I shake my head.</p>
      <p>There’s nothing I can do now.</p>
      <p>I need more information later.</p>
      <p>'For now...'</p>
      <p>I must elevate my cultivation.</p>
      <p>
        I need to enhance my Gang Sphere to reach the extreme of Ultimate
        Pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        And find a way to advance from Qi Refining 14th Star to Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>Whether it works or not, I'll give it my best shot.</p>
      <p>
        First, I decided to go to Yanguo, meet Kim Young-Hoon, and find a way to
        advance to Qi Building while gaining martial arts experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        After contacting Kim Young-Hoon through the Jin Clan, I informed him
        where I would be staying.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went to the mountains near Yanguo, Yansan City, defeated all the
        bandits in the area, and settled down.
      </p>
      <p>
        "First, I should master the Water Surpassing Path up to the 4th Star."
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering that in ten years, I'll be joining Seo Ran to venture deep
        into the Black Wind Sea and search the Nether Crossing Ship of the Black
        Bone Valley again, it's essential to at least know the basics of water
        attribute spells to avoid being a burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivation manual I acquired, regarded as the basic among the
        basics in the Daoist community, is 'Five Surpassing Paths to
        Cultivation.' It contains the basic techniques for the Five Paths:
        Earth, Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I had only mastered the Earth Surpassing Path but I could always
        learn the other paths if I wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, mastering even one Earth Surpassing Path was challenging, so
        I focused solely on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        To assist Seo Ran in the sea, mastering at least the basics of the Water
        Surpassing Path is necessary, so I plan to learn it to the minimum
        extent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began training in the Water Surpassing Path, replenishing water
        spiritual energy in a nearby valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        While practicing the Water Surpassing Path, I found it surprisingly
        'easy.'
      </p>
      <p>
        'Perhaps it's because I've already activated and cleared the meridians
        with the Earth Surpassing Path.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s just a matter of accumulating water energy along those pathways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teachings of Understanding before Breakthrough I learned from my
        master weren't limited to earth attribute methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the differences between the Five Elements, I quickly embodied
        and made the Water Surpassing Path my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I form the Water Hand Seal, the valley's water rises into the air,
        forming shapes as I envision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forming the seal again, water droplets form in the air and begin to
        fall.
      </p>
      <p>"This will solve any thirst problems in the desert."</p>
      <p>
        I smile, feeling the Water Surpassing Paths spiritual power settling
        within me.
      </p>
      <p>
        After about a year of diligent practice, the Water Surpassing Path is
        close to reaching the 2nd Star of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also mastered all seventy-two Earthly Sha True Words corresponding to
        the water element, making them freely usable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I always had an overwhelming understanding of the Seventy-Two
        Earthly Sha True Words, mastering other elemental attributes became
        straightforward after getting accustomed to them.
      </p>
      <p>"Now, let's try Qi Building again."</p>
      <p>
        Even while mastering the Water Surpassing Path, I haven't neglected
        martial arts training, and my Gang Sphere has increased to four.
      </p>
      <p>I can now accelerate my mental facilities by more than five times.</p>
      <p>Woooong.</p>
      <p>
        I focus, attempting to advance to the next phase from the Infinite
        Spiritual Cloud.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Clouds of spiritual power whirl in my dantian, forming a Spiritual
        Energy Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, like before, the spiritual energy star begins to crack under
        strain and turbulence.
      </p>
      <p>And then...</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>I clench my teeth and endure the pain.</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy star exploded, and my cultivation fell back to 12th
        Star.
      </p>
      <p>"Sigh..."</p>
      <p>Back to square one.</p>
      <p>I sigh softly, slowly recovering my spiritual power.</p>
      <p>But then...</p>
      <p>"....?"</p>
      <p>Something felt off.</p>
      <p>I focus and activated the Earth Surpassing Path</p>
      <p>I realize the odd sense of déjà vu.</p>
      <p>'The recovery speed... has slightly increased...?'</p>
      <p>My spiritual power recovery rate has sped up compared to before.</p>
      <p>A mysterious phenomenon!</p>
      <p>After some contemplation, I figure out the cause.</p>
      <p>'The Water Surpassing Path!'</p>
      <p>That's right.</p>
      <p>
        Not just the Earth Surpassing Path, but also the recently practiced
        Water Surpassing Path's water energy was complementing the earth energy,
        slightly speeding up the recovery of spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>'Ah, this was mentioned when I bought the manual.'</p>
      <p>The old man selling the cultivation manual previously explained it.</p>
      <p>'Good. This means I can try the next challenge sooner.'</p>
      <p>
        Faster spiritual power recovery meant more attempts at advancing to Qi
        Building.
      </p>
      <p>With a lighter heart, I begin to recover my cultivation state.</p>
      <p>Four years passed.</p>
      <p>
        I successfully mastered the Water Surpassing Path up to 4th Star and
        could handle the four Gang Spheres quite stably.
      </p>
      <p>Around this time, Kim Young-Hoon finally visited.</p>
      <p>"Kim Hyung, have you finally come after I sent a letter years ago?"</p>
      <p>I greet him with a hearty laugh.</p>
      <p>However, Kim Young-Hoon's expression isn't bright.</p>
      <p>
        "...Sorry. I was so absorbed in something that I lost track of time. A
        few years ago, the cultivator clans in Shengzi started attacking the
        Makli Clan for breaking a treaty. Recently, the Makli Clan hasn't been
        active, so I've been focusing solely on martial arts. And..."
      </p>
      <p>Wooooong.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-Hoon releases his Gang Sphere.</p>
      <p>
        The sphere split into three, then each sphere split into three again,
        totaling nine spheres orbiting around him.
      </p>
      <p>"I've also reached the extreme of Ultimate Pinnacle...</p>
      <p>But. This is the end."</p>
      <p>His complexion turns ashen.</p>
      <p>
        "I've made several attempts and errors, yet I can't grasp what to do
        next. Even after studying the demon beast method to explore the next
        realm, it isn't enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are so many paths before me, yet none seem to lead anywhere! It's
        completely unclear what I should do next! I have increased my
        miscellaneous skills, but no matter how much I learn, it doesn't raise
        my realm.
      </p>
      <p>How do I transcend beyond this point? Really, how...?"</p>
      <p>
        After venting his emotions, Kim Young-Hoon takes a deep breath and calms
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sigh... I'm sorry. I'm just too frustrated. I don't know what to do. Up
        to Ultimate Pinnacle, it felt like I was following a path laid by
        others, but beyond this, it feels like I need to create a realm that
        doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've studied medicine, and even advanced to the 3rd Star of Qi Refining
        with the cultivation method I requested from the Jin Clan. I've
        researched and re-researched the demon beast method you gave me. But how
        to create the next realm... I just don't know."
      </p>
      <p>He sighs, clearly frustrated.</p>
      <p>'Ultimate Pinnacle, as well, was a realm of theory.'</p>
      <p>The realm of Three Flowers Gather at the Summit is rare.</p>
      <p>Five Energies Converging to the Origin is legendary.</p>
      <p>
        And Ultimate Pinnacle was just a 'conceptual' realm imagined by martial
        artists.
      </p>
      <p>What could be stronger than Five Energies Converging to the Origin?</p>
      <p>If such a realm exists, what would it be named?</p>
      <p>
        The name of a realm born from the frivolous theories of martial artists.
      </p>
      <p>That is Ultimate Pinnacle.</p>
      <p>
        And now, Kim Young-Hoon is struggling to reach a realm beyond
        imagination.
      </p>
      <p>A realm beyond imagination.</p>
      <p>
        Even the storytellers, who playfully speak of Ultimate Pinnacle, have
        not even dreamt of what lies beyond it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimate Pinnacle, after all, was a realm of fantasy, thus it had a
        name. But the world beyond that, even among the storytellers, remains
        nameless.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-Hoon is struggling to reach a place without a name.</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry."</p>
      <p>But I can't join him in his struggle.</p>
      <p>I am slow.</p>
      <p>
        So slow, in fact, that I am still at the mid-stage of Ultimate Pinnacle
        with only four Gang Spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is uncertain whether I could even handle nine Gang Spheres in this
        lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>How can I, then, discuss what lies beyond Ultimate Pinnacle?</p>
      <p>"I'm not yet qualified to discuss such a realm."</p>
      <p>"Yes, you're right."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-Hoon isn't a bad person. Normally, in such a situation, he
        would try to lighten the mood by praising my skills as decent.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Kim Young-Hoon only affirmed my words with a dark expression,
        evidence of his extraordinary efforts to transcend to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What lies beyond is unexplored. A realm that's never been seriously
        discussed. The 'basic' requirement to enter it is reaching the extreme
        of Ultimate Pinnacle. Even my talent needs to be honed to the absolute
        brink for this realm..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, during his speech, Kim Young-Hoon pauses, then begins to
        chuckle.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha, haha...! It's so infuriating. It might have been better if my
        talent was mediocre, focused only on reaching existing realms...
      </p>
      <p>
        If the realm already exists, I could have trained diligently. But since
        I don't even know what to do, it's unbearably tormenting. Being the only
        pioneer, the pressure that I cannot give up is immense..."
      </p>
      <p>I look at him with a bittersweet feeling.</p>
      <p>When I think about it, it’s true.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-Hoon ascended to Ultimate Pinnacle several lifetimes ago.</p>
      <p>In the past life.</p>
      <p>And the life before that.</p>
      <p>And even before that.</p>
      <p>
        He ascended to Ultimate Pinnacle multiple times, wielded nine Gang
        Spheres, and reached its extreme repeatedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        But not once had he mentioned discovering a realm beyond or shown any
        joy in such a discovery.
      </p>
      <p>Does a realm beyond Ultimate Pinnacle truly exist?</p>
      <p>I couldn't dare to console his despair.</p>
      <p>His despair is entirely different from mine.</p>
      <p>All I can do is silently listen to his despair.</p>
      <p>After venting for a while, Kim Young-Hoon spoke more calmly.</p>
      <p>
        "I'm sorry... I didn't come here to vent my emotions. I came to give you
        a warning."
      </p>
      <p>"What kind of warning?"</p>
      <p>
        "While studying the Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation method you
        gave me, I realized something. When humans practice it, during its
        activation, it forcibly transforms the consciousness into the form of a
        dragon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought while studying this technique that it shouldn't be practiced
        by humans."
      </p>
      <p>I listen carefully to his words.</p>
      <p>
        Indeed, Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation is powerful, but every
        time I use it, it feels overwhelmingly uncomfortable, like wearing a
        tight suit of armor.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It puts too much strain on the human soul. No matter how powerful your
        consciousness is from practicing cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultivating that method is, metaphorically, like diving deep into the
        ocean without a diving suit and wearing a dragon's skin. The burden on
        your soul is too great.
      </p>
      <p>There's a reason humans don't practice demon beast methods."</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>I sigh softly.</p>
      <p>
        "Perhaps, humans have their own suitable form of consciousness. But at
        least, it's definitely not in the form of a dragon... I clearly felt
        that."
      </p>
      <p>The form of consciousness fitting for humans.</p>
      <p>I repeat those words in my mind.</p>
      <p>Translator Notes: I made some changes to the terms:</p>
      <p>
        3 Great Realms of Cultivation first mentioned in chapter 38 has been
        changed to 3 Great Boundaries of Cultivation to better differentiate
      </p>
      <p>
        The God of the Azure Emperor, etc for the 4 Constellations has been to
        changed to the Spirit of the Azure Dragon and etc. I initally thought
        the constellations mentioned referred to the 5 Emperors of Chinese Myth
        cuz of the Yellow Emperor part, but after doing some research it turns
        out the constellations refer to the 4 mythical beasts.

      <p>Chapter 116: What You Trampled On / The Path You Have Tread (4)</p>
      <p>“This is…?”</p>
      <p>Seo Ran takes the space-breaking bead from me.</p>
      <p>After a moment, his pupils quiver.</p>
      <p>“Where did you get this?”</p>
      <p>“Well…”</p>
      <p>I hesitate for a moment and then tell him honestly.</p>
      <p>
        “The Sea Dragon King instructed me to pass this dharma treasure to
        Daoist Seo. I was overtaken by greed and kept it for myself…”
      </p>
      <p>I didn’t hand over the space-breaking dharma treasure to Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        But the space-breaking bead was useless even when filled with spiritual
        power, apparently requiring some special condition to activate.
      </p>
      <p>“I’m sorry about that. However…”</p>
      <p>“Wait…”</p>
      <p>Seo Ran, holding the dharma treasure, stiffens and says,</p>
      <p>“Please… wait a moment.”</p>
      <p>
        He puts the space-breaking bead into his sleeve and flies to the helm of
        the Nether Crossing Ship to speak with Song Jin.
      </p>
      <p>
        They seemed to be having a conversation, and I could sense complex and
        nuanced intents flowing from the helm.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, the Nether Crossing Ship arrived at Serving Command
        Palace in the void space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran continued talking with Song Jin, still holding the
        space-breaking bead.
      </p>
      <p>
        I glance at them briefly and decide to discuss it again after returning
        from Serving Command Palace. Then I head into Serving Command Palace
        with the Core Formation cultivators of the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>“Before setting up the formation, everyone please wait.”</p>
      <p>
        I signal to Cheongmun Jung-jin and the elders, then head to the core of
        Serving Command Palace and fiddle with the part Buk Hyang-hwa had
        manipulated, using the exact same method she did.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Pressure builds up throughout Serving Command Palace, and our spiritual
        power is sealed by one level.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>My cultivation level dropped by one big stage.</p>
      <p>To others, I appear like a Qi Refining cultivator.</p>
      <p>
        The other Core Formation cultivators dropped to the Qi Building stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Now, show us. Can you, in this state, still exert the power of a Core
        Formation cultivator?”
      </p>
      <p>An elder of the Cheongmun Clan asks me.</p>
      <p>
        I nod, grasp the Formless Sword, and swing it towards one of the
        internal structures of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The structure, already half-destroyed when I came with Buk Hyang-hwa,
        crumbles to dust with a single stroke of my sword.
      </p>
      <p>“Do you believe me a little now?”</p>
      <p>
        At my words, the elders of the Cheongmun Clan look at me in stunned
        silence, then nod.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, the golden order of Serving Command Palace deactivates,
        and I say to them,
      </p>
      <p>
        “The restraint lasts for about an hour. Even if we try to extend it by
        tampering with Serving Command Palace’s circuitry, the maximum would be
        about half a day.”
      </p>
      <p>The elders of the Cheongmun Clan ponder over my words.</p>
      <p>“Anyway, my capabilities should now be confirmed.”</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin and the elders all nod in agreement.</p>
      <p>
        “Understood. When we capture Yuan Li, we’ll plan based on your
        abilities.”
      </p>
      <p>“Hmm, about that…”</p>
      <p>One of the elders speak to Cheongmun Jung-jin.</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin, receiving his gaze, askes me,</p>
      <p>“Then, could Cultivator Seo please set up the formation now?”</p>
      <p>“Certainly.”</p>
      <p>It’s a formation I’llhave to set up in my next life anyway.</p>
      <p>Setting it up in advance wouldn’t be bad.</p>
      <p>
        I take the formation artifacts created by Buk Hyang-hwa and install it
        throughout the first floor of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>Then, after a while.</p>
      <p>
        I approach the Longevity Tree in the central arboretum of Serving
        Command Palace, where the Longevity Fruits are about to ripen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stand there, gazing at the blossoms on the Longevity Tree, lost in
        thought.
      </p>
      <p>The one who should’ve eaten these fruits is gone,</p>
      <p>But I've only just found a way to harvest them.</p>
      <p>
        ‘What meaning is there in this life… now devoid of a reason to live…’
      </p>
      <p>With a listless gaze, I activate the formation indifferently.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Spiritual energy from all over Serving Command Palace converges here.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s incomparable to the formation spread through the weak dragon veins
        near the Heaven-Treading Desert and Cheon-saek City.
      </p>
      <p>
        A massive wave of spiritual energy surges towards this place, filling
        the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin and elders, beholding this majestic scene, stand with
        their mouths agape in awe. However, I just stare blankly into space with
        a listless expression.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        “The formation has been activated. In five years, the formation will
        pour the accumulated wood-element spiritual energy of this area into the
        Longevity Tree, rapidly accelerating the growth of the fruits.”
      </p>
      <p>“That's great. Thank you.”</p>
      <p>
        I listen to the thanks of the Cheongmun Clan elders, standing there
        blankly.
      </p>
      <p>
        After adjusting the formation a bit, we left Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thank you, Cultivator Seo. We'll return in five years to harvest the
        Longevity Fruits.”
      </p>
      <p>
        After making plans for five years later, I parted ways with Cheongmun
        Jung-jin and elders.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Cheongmun Clan disappeared, Song Jin and Seo Ran approached me.
      </p>
      <p>Koooom!</p>
      <p>
        At Song Jin's will, the Nether Crossing Ship traversed space and settled
        above the distant ocean.
      </p>
      <p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, who has been emitting complex intent, asks me with a trembling
        voice.
      </p>
      <p>“This dharma treasure… did the Dragon King really give it to you?”</p>
      <p>“Yes.”</p>
      <p>“And he really asked you to pass it on to me?”</p>
      <p>I nod.</p>
      <p>Seo Ran stiffens.</p>
      <p>
        “Can you prove its authenticity with a Ghost Path Oath here, in front of
        the Nether Crossing Ship?”
      </p>
      <p>
        His face turned pale as he spoke. It’s said that if an oath or statement
        made in front of the Nether Crossing Ship is broken, the soul would be
        sucked into it after death.
      </p>
      <p>I calmly reply.</p>
      <p>
        “I swear in front of the Nether Crossing Ship. It's true that Seo Hweol
        asked me to pass the space-breaking bead to Daoist Seo.”
      </p>
      <p>“Ha, haha…”</p>
      <p>Seo Ran, with a stunned expression, laughs and holds his head.</p>
      <p>Watching him, Song Jin speaks with a bitter voice.</p>
      <p>
        [I didn’t know the Sea Dragon King had such a side… Such heartlessness.]
      </p>
      <p>Holding the space-breaking bead, Song Jin continues.</p>
      <p>
        [According to our investigation, this dharma treasure can only be
        activated by someone with the ‘True Origin Blood’ of the Sea Dragon
        Tribe, and only by someone designated by them. If not of the True Origin
        Blood, one cannot even interfere with the dharma treasure, and if not
        designated by a Sea Dragon of True Origin Blood, it cannot be activated.
        And...]
      </p>
      <p>He glances at the space-breaking bead and continues.</p>
      <p>[The designated person for this bead is Seo Ran himself.]</p>
      <p>“Master, I, your unworthy disciple…”</p>
      <p>[Go rest inside.]</p>
      <p>“Thank you.”</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, with a pained expression and holding his head, said he needed
        some time alone and went inside the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Song Jin sighs and asks,</p>
      <p>[Do you know what this dharma treasure is?]</p>
      <p>“I do.”</p>
      <p>I tell the truth, and Song Jin looks at me.</p>
      <p>His eyes blaze with ghostly fire.</p>
      <p>
        [Knowing it's a self-destructive dharma treasure… you accepted Seo
        Hweol's request?]
      </p>
      <p>
        “That’s why I didn't deliver it until now. I asked for the method of
        using this dharma treasure for my own purposes.”
      </p>
      <p>[...]</p>
      <p>“I didn't expect him to realize so quickly.”</p>
      <p>
        In my previous life, Seo Ran realized the purpose of the spac- breaking
        bead only when it was time to activate it.
      </p>
      <p>I never thought he would realize it immediately in this life.</p>
      <p>‘It seems Song Jin has taught him well.’</p>
      <p>I look at Song Jin.</p>
      <p>After locking eyes with me for a moment, he lets out a faint sigh.</p>
      <p>
        […Thank you. For not passing that dharma treasure to my disciple. If it
        had been activated, the Nether Crossing Ship would have crumbled, and I
        wouldn't have been able to teach my disciple and pass down the legacy of
        the Azure Ghost Valley.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Song Jin says with a bitter tone, looking at the space-breaking bead.
      </p>
      <p>“It's nothing. By the way… I still have one more favor you owe me.”</p>
      <p>[Ah, that's right. Indeed.]</p>
      <p>I speak to Song Jin,</p>
      <p>“I'll use my last favor. Please…”</p>
      <p>Drip, drip…</p>
      <p>Just thinking about it, curses begin to erupt around me.</p>
      <p>“Help me.”</p>
      <p>Startled!</p>
      <p>Song Jin flinches and stares directly at me.</p>
      <p>“Help me take revenge.”</p>
      <p>[...]</p>
      <p>He seems to ponder.</p>
      <p>
        [For that… ask Seo Ran. Perhaps, my disciple can be of more help to
        you.]
      </p>
      <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
      <p>Song Jin continues.</p>
      <p>
        [I recently sent my disciple deep into the sea to gather yin energy. But
        actually, I had another task for him.]
      </p>
      <p>“Oh?”</p>
      <p>
        He points southwards over the Nether Crossing Ship, towards the Black
        Wind Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        [At the far southern end of the sea, near [World’s End], lies the
        homeland of the Sea Dragon Tribe, the Sea Dragon Palace where the Sea
        Dragon King resided. For some reason, Seo Hweol left Seo Ran here and
        covered the Sea Dragon Palace with a massive seal before leaving,
        preventing Seo Ran from entering to cultivate.]
      </p>
      <p>I listen silently to Song Jin's explanation.</p>
      <p>
        [According to Seo Ran, if the Nether Crossing Ship is destroyed and the
        souls of the Sea Dragon Tribe previously swallowed by the ship are
        freed, those souls will teach Seo Ran how to break the seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now that he is my disciple, I can't allow him to shatter the Nether
        Crossing Ship and do such a thing. I instructed Seo Ran to reach the
        Nascent Soul stage and directly interact with the Nether Crossing Ship
        to extract the souls. A Nascent Soul cultivator can retrieve the souls
        devoured by the ship. And to do that, entering the Sea Dragon Palace,
        filled with the spiritual elixir of the Sea Dragon Tribe, is the first
        step. I taught him a corroding great spell and asked him to break
        through Seo Hweol's seal.]
      </p>
      <p>Song Jin chuckles.</p>
      <p>
        [Whether he rescues the souls of the Sea Dragon Tribe first and then
        enters the Sea Dragon Palace to enhance his skills, or vice versa, it
        doesn’t matter. Seo Ran agreed to do so. I also taught him the famous
        formations of the Azure Ghost Valley to help him break the seal. Now,
        he’s almost breached the corner of the seal, and it seems only a strong
        final push is needed to break in.]
      </p>
      <p>“So, you want me to help Seo Ran break the seal?”</p>
      <p>
        [Yes, the weird method you've mastered boasts immense offensive power,
        surely enough to break the seal. He's been gathering energy for a
        powerful strike, but if you help, that may not be necessary.]
      </p>
      <p>It seems he wants to use my strength for Seo Ran’s benefit.</p>
      <p>But that doesn’t matter to me.</p>
      <p>What’s important right now is,</p>
      <p>
        “By helping Seo Ran break the seal, does that create a way to confront
        Yuan Li?”
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>Finding the best way to kill him is my goal.</p>
      <p>Song Jin nods.</p>
      <p>
        [Even if Seo Hweol's abilities are great, it's impossible for him to
        ascend with all the treasures accumulated over the long history of the
        Sea Dragon Tribe without something equivalent to the Nether Crossing
        Ship. Surely, a considerable amount of treasures must remain inside the
        Sea Dragon Palace. Moreover, most of the treasures of the Sea Dragon
        Tribe are items that can gain an advantage over Yuan Li's two main
        devilish arts. There's a high probability that objects antagonistic to
        him are piled up inside...!]
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, my eyes widened.</p>
      <p>"I will... help Daoist Seo."</p>
      <p>It doesn't matter.</p>
      <p>If it can give me even a slight advantage over him.</p>
      <p>I will do anything.</p>
      <p>
        At those words, Song Jin nods in satisfaction and enters the Nether
        Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Shortly after, Seo Ran comes out with a gloomy face.</p>
      <p>"...I heard you will help me, senior."</p>
      <p>"That's right."</p>
      <p>"I am a bit shocked, but... I understand. Thank you."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran turns to Song Jin.</p>
      <p>"Master... Please head to the southern end."</p>
      <p>[Haha, understood.]</p>
      <p>
        Hence, we steer the Nether Crossing Ship towards the Sea Dragon Palace,
        the former base of the Sea Dragon Tribe, located at the [World's End] in
        the south.
      </p>
      <p>Jang―</p>
      <p>
        [Hmm, as expected, this sea area doesn't suit the Nether Crossing Ship.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The southern sea is calm, the sky clear, and the sun blazing intensely.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heaven and earth spiritual energy is stable, and it seems unlikely
        for storms to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the Black Wind Sea, where clouds gather frequently, the
        southern sea looks very peaceful.
      </p>
      <p>'Most of all...'</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy floating between heaven and earth is incredibly
        clean and warm.
      </p>
      <p>It even feels somewhat sacred.</p>
      <p>[Disciple, lead the way.]</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, Master. The Sea Dragon Palace is at the bottom of this deep sea."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran points downwards into the waters.</p>
      <p>
        Despite the clear weather, the deep blue sea is dark, and its depth
        seems immense.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Song Jin doesn’t seem bothered and simply nods, holding the
        steering wheel.
      </p>
      <p>[Good, then everyone hold your breath.]</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Soon after, the Nether Crossing Ship, engulfed in ghostly energy, begins
        to submerge into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>'Such a variety of functions.'</p>
      <p>Chaaaa!</p>
      <p>
        I ponder this while observing the ghostly energy of the Nether Crossing
        Ship repelling the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ghostly energy of the Nether Crossing Ship seemed to be slightly
        consumed by the sunlight above the water surface, but as it descended
        deeper, it absorbed the yin energy of the deep sea, replenishing its
        strength on its own.
      </p>
      <p>'This is all just a ruined wreck's functionality...'</p>
      <p>
        I look around the Nether Crossing Ship for a while before losing
        interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa, Kim Young-hoon, Cheongmun Ryeong, Buk Joong-ho, and the
        neighbors of Cheon-saek City.
      </p>
      <p>After they died, I somehow lost enthusiasm for everything.</p>
      <p>Even seeing something fascinating only sparks temporary interest.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        After descending into the deep sea for a period of time, the Nether
        Crossing Ship finally reaches the seabed.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugung!</p>
      <p>
        [We've arrived. Follow Seo Ran and break the seal on the Sea Dragon
        Palace.]
      </p>
      <p>
        I nod and, holding my breath, follow Seo Ran out of the ghostly Nether
        Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Chaaaaak!</p>
      <p>
        The immense water pressure presses down on me, but with Gang Qi flowing
        in my veins, it isn't a big threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being unable to breathe is also not a problem, as I could last 3 or 4
        days longer than mortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran transformed into his sea dragon form and swam ahead in the deep
        sea.

      <p>
        'The surface was full of warm and pleasant spiritual energy, but...'
      </p>
      <p>The deep sea below is somehow...</p>
      <p>'Desolate.'</p>
      <p>It is dark and devoid of life.</p>
      <p>There should be life even in the deep sea.</p>
      <p>However, around here, it seems as if no living creature exists.</p>
      <p>
        Even microscopic organisms didn't appear within my domain of
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>It’s almost like the Dead Sea.</p>
      <p>After a while, following Seo Ran, I understood the reason.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>A massive wall of darkness.</p>
      <p>
        A huge semi-circular something is covering the land at the bottom of the
        deep sea in front of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, this wall of darkness seems to be endlessly absorbing the vital
        force around it.
      </p>
      <p>"Is this the seal of the Sea Dragon Palace?"</p>
      <p>
        Since the demon race's language vibrates spiritual energy instead of
        air, if one is capable, there’s no need to open the mouth to speak.
      </p>
      <p>I asked Seo Ran in a breath-holding state, and he nodded.</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. Please follow me. Over there, in the corner, is the weakest flow
        of the seal. I have cast a corroding spell there to weaken the seal."
      </p>
      <p>
        I swim for a while following Seo Ran, and then, at one corner of the
        seal.
      </p>
      <p>I can see it surrounded by dark mist.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The yin energy and ghostly energy densely accumulated by the formation
        sticks thickly towards one corner of the seal, burning a blue ghost
        fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having some expertise in formations myself, I can tell which part of the
        seal the Black Ghost Valley's notorious formation, the Ghost Wail
        Corroding Formation, has weakened.
      </p>
      <p>"Do I attack the center?"</p>
      <p>"Yes. Please, I ask for your help."</p>
      <p>Calmly holding the Formless Sword, I take a stance.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        And then, I thrust the Formless Sword towards the Ghost Wail Corroding
        Formation.
      </p>
      <p>Kuuuuuu!</p>
      <p>The seabed of the deep sea shales.</p>
      <p>
        Although there is no loud explosion underwater, massive ripples spread
        out visibly around it.
      </p>
      <p>But the formation set by Seo Hweol doesn't budge.</p>
      <p>'Is this not enough?'</p>
      <p>I once again hold up the Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, ultimate technique, Severing Mountain!
      </p>
      <p>Kuoouo!</p>
      <p>Once again, a cloud of dust rises from the bottom of the deep sea.</p>
      <p>'So this is how much it weakened...'</p>
      <p>This time there was a vibration, but the seal remains strong.</p>
      <p>
        After executing Severing Mountain, I immediately return to the stance of
        Transcending Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>I maintain the state of Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains.</p>
      <p>
        While maintaining Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains, I repeatedly
        strike Seo Hweol's seal with Severing Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took about 16 consecutive hits of Severing Mountain executed by the
        Formless Sword before the seal cracked.
      </p>
      <p>Jeck, Jejejeck!</p>
      <p>The seal, it split open.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Chaaaaa!</p>
      <p>A hole opened up causing the surrounding water to be sucked inside.</p>
      <p>"Puhup!"</p>
      <p>I enter inside with the water current.</p>
      <p>"Puha!"</p>
      <p>Haaaaa</p>
      <p>
        The inner space seems to be filled with air, allowing me to breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, Seo Ran transforms back into his human form and enters
        inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's been a long time since I've been here. I haven't been here since I
        was very young..."
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran looks around, seemingly nostalgic.</p>
      <p>'What immense energy.'</p>
      <p>
        I absorb the surrounding spiritual energy, observing the immense
        spiritual energy filling the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy inside the seal is extraordinarily higher than
        outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently, the seal not only blocked access for outsiders but also
        seemed to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy and vital force,
        concentrating it inside.
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>'Huh?'</p>
      <p>I see the Sea Dragon Palace unfolding before my eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Like an ancient imperial palace of the human world, it is lined with
        stately halls and ancient palaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The jade-colored tiles on the halls, which appear somewhat divine at a
        glance, are lined up, giving off a grand feeling.
      </p>
      <p>However, as I look at these halls, I feel something strange.</p>
      <p>'Something... familiar...?'</p>
      <p>Kududeuk!</p>
      <p>
        I execute the Earth Wall spell to block the water pouring from the
        cracked opening.
      </p>
      <p>Then, kicking off the void, I fly up into the sky.</p>
      <p>"Senior?"</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran looks at me, puzzled, but I fly up into the air to take in the
        whole view of this ancient Sea Dragon Palace.
      </p>
      <p>'The structure of this Sea Dragon Palace is...?'</p>
      <p>I have seen a structure resembling this Sea Dragon Palace before.</p>

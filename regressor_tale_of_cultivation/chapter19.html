      <p>Chapter 19: Peak Master (2)</p>
      <p>
        Together with Kim Young-hoon, I headed to Changho city and used the
        money looted from the bandits to create identity plaques and buy a
        manor.
      </p>
      <p>There, I taught him literacy and martial arts.</p>
      <p>About two months later...</p>
      <p>Woong―</p>
      <p>'He's growing faster.'</p>
      <p>
        Slightly bemused, I watched Kim Young-hoon consuming yellow bamboo roots
        and entering the realm of Three Flowers Gather at the Summit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that my ascension to a peak master and earnestly imparting a
        first-rate martial art, Severing Vein Saber Method, had spurred such
        rapid growth.
      </p>
      <p>'It's a bit anticlimactic.'</p>
      <p>But it was always like this.</p>
      <p>
        While some spent a lifetime reaching the Pinnacle Realm, others, with
        the guidance of a peak master and first-rate martial arts, leapfrogged
        the Pinnacle Realm and directly entered Three Flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, three flower-like energies were absorbed through his nose and
        mouth, and Kim Young-hoon half-opened his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>His eyes gleamed with wisdom.</p>
      <p>
        "Congratulations on reaching Three Flowers Gather at the Summit. To
        think you achieved it before even fully learning literacy..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, I find it astonishing, myself. Who knew I had such martial
        talent..."
      </p>
      <p>I looked at Kim Young-hoon impassively.</p>
      <p>A hint of competitive spirit arose in me.</p>
      <p>
        'Up until now, after Kim Young-hoon reached Three Flowers, I never
        really sparred with him.'
      </p>
      <p>It was always him guiding me in practice spars.</p>
      <p>What about now?</p>
      <p>
        Me, having ascended to peak master, and Kim Young-hoon, who has just
        reached Three Flowers.
      </p>
      <p>"...Firstly, congratulations. How about... a sparring match?"</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, sparring sounds good. Somehow, I feel I might win this time."
      </p>
      <p>He drew his saber, igniting his competitive spirit.</p>
      <p>I drew my sword as well.</p>
      <p>In the manor's practice yard, two peak masters began their duel.</p>
      <p>Ping―</p>
      <p>I launched my killing intent at Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>Dozens of blue lines attached themselves to him.</p>
      <p>Dozens of optimal paths targeted him.</p>
      <p>Then, Kim Young-hoon readjusted his stance.</p>
      <p>"...!"</p>
      <p>Dozens of blue lines disappeared.</p>
      <p>
        His weaknesses vanished, rendering all my potential attacks useless.
      </p>
      <p>Woong―</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, hundreds of red threadlines targeted me.</p>
      <p>
        I shifted my stance to eliminate my vulnerabilities and prepared to
        counterattack Kim Young-hoon's moves.
      </p>
      <p>As I did, the red lines extending from him receded.</p>
      <p>How intertwined our red and blue lines must have been.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon initiated the attack.</p>
      <p>"Severing Vein Saber, Mountain Wind."</p>
      <p>Ping!</p>
      <p>A piercing attack with astonishing speed!</p>
      <p>Yet, from that pierce, hundreds more red lines branched out.</p>
      <p>A sign of numerous follow-up moves.</p>
      <p>"Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Strange Stone."</p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I spun in place, taking a defensive and offensive posture, blocking his
        thrust.
      </p>
      <p>"Severing Vein Saber, Grand White!"</p>
      <p>
        His thrust twisted in mid-air, slashing from my upper right to lower
        left.
      </p>
      <p>"Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Transcending Peaks!"</p>
      <p>
        I countered his saber with a horizontal slash, then recalculated dozens
        of paths.
      </p>
      <p>My blue lines targeted his head, waist, and legs.</p>
      <p>"Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Entering Mountain."</p>

      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>I switched to a lower stance and aimed for his leg.</p>
      <p>
        In that brief moment, dozens of blue and red lines exchanged between us.
      </p>
      <p>"Severing Vein Saber, Dragon's Mound!"</p>
      <p>
        Similar to Severing Mountain Swordsmanship's Flowing Ridge, but with
        more intricate variations, the technique descended upon me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that brief moment, dozens more threadlines exchanged in the air
        between us.
      </p>
      <p>We had already exchanged dozens of moves in this imaginary realm.</p>
      <p>'Dodge? No, dodging would keep pushing me back.'</p>
      <p>That would lead to defeat.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter.</p>
      <p>It's just a sparring match.</p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>A surge of competitiveness rose within me.</p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>
        'Ah, right. In this life, this might be my only chance to beat Kim
        Young-hoon.'
      </p>
      <p>
        From now on, he will grow exponentially like a fish in water or a
        runaway train.
      </p>
      <p>Next time we spar, he'll be beyond my reach.</p>
      <p>This time.</p>
      <p>
        This time, when he's just ascended to Three Flowers, is my last chance
        in this life to defeat him.
      </p>
      <p>Yes, let's win.</p>
      <p>Even if it means using everything I have.</p>
      <p>I quickly moved my hand, grabbing a hidden weapon from my sleeve.</p>
      <p>"Infinite Fighting Hidden Weapon Technique, Direct Snake."</p>
      <p>Pivit!</p>
      <p>
        The small weapon I launched from my hand flew towards Kim Young-hoon's
        face.
      </p>
      <p>He dodged quickly, his face showing surprise.</p>
      <p>But that gave me an opening in his stance.</p>
      <p>Ting!</p>
      <p>I deflected his saber and went on the offensive.</p>
      <p>"Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Flowing Ridge."</p>
      <p>Fwit!</p>
      <p>The serpentine sword energy shot towards him.</p>
      <p>'It's blocked.'</p>
      <p>A red line is drawn at an angle that could deflect my sword.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, a new branch extends from that line aiming for my
        shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>"After deflecting, counterattack."</p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, I pull out another weapon from my sleeve.</p>
      <p>Holding the weapon, the number of blue lines I can use doubles.</p>
      <p>His red lines changes.</p>
      <p>
        The red branch that stretched from his saber to my shoulder now shifts
        towards my weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only after deflecting my weapon does the red branch stretch back towards
        me.
      </p>
      <p>"Good."</p>
      <p>But it's still not enough.</p>
      <p>"I have more real combat experience!"</p>
      <p>"Dragon Vein, ‘Qi Mountain, Heart Heaven’, Cliff Edge."</p>
      <p>I incorporate three techniques into one movement.</p>
      <p>
        With Dragon Vein, I rapidly circulate my internal energy to strengthen
        my sword energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, I open all the meridians in my body with Qi Mountain,
        Heart Heaven to further strengthen the energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Cliff Edge, I vary the speed of my sword to make it difficult to
        react.
      </p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>
        Sword Silk forms at the tip of my sword, materializing the internal
        energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite unleashing my enhanced sword energy, Kim Young-hoon
        swiftly retreated using a stepping technique, avoiding a direct hit. My
        sword only grazed his chest, causing a small scratch.
      </p>
      <p>"That's it. I've got the momentum."</p>
      <p>Mountain Lord’s Martial Arts, Transcending Peaks Step.</p>
      <p>
        I charge with the momentum of a Mountain Lord, approaching with
        Transcending Peaks Step, then using Mountain Tiger to feign multiple
        strikes while actually using a diversion tactic to engage in a melee.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time,</p>
      <p>Ping! Ping!</p>
      <p>
        I launch the weapon in my other hand while clashing blades with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though I'm pushing him back, Kim Young-hoon finds an opportunity to
        counterattack, extending several red lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treating it as real combat, I seize every opportunity. From throwing
        sand from the ground, spitting hidden needles, and persisting with
        tricky attacks. Kim Young-hoon, gradually cornered, infuses more energy
        into his saber with frustration.
      </p>
      <p>Woong—</p>
      <p>The momentum shifts.</p>
      <p>"Dangerous."</p>
      <p>Something big is coming.</p>
      <p>"I'll show you the realm of Three Flowers Gather at the Summit!"</p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>The energy in his saber begins to transform.</p>
      <p>
        The intangible saber energy condenses, forming tangible threads like
        silk, evolving once again.
      </p>
      <p>"That's...!"</p>
      <p>
        The energy enveloping his saber fully materializes, emitting a bright
        white light.
      </p>
      <p>"Saber Silk!"</p>
      <p>"Taah!"</p>
      <p>The bright white light engulfs everything in front of me.</p>
      <p>If I clash with it, my sword will likely be cut in two.</p>
      <p>Any peak master would face the same fate.</p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>
        My Severing Mountain Swordsmanship was created by a genius of the era,
        who had reached the absolute of martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>"Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Echoing Valley!"</p>
      <p>
        A technique that shook off even Kim Young-hoon's energy in the previous
        life!
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's his energy at this early stage of Three Flowers Gather at the
        Summit, it's possible.
      </p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>
        "Remove intent from the sword, make it empty, and then accept the
        opponent's force..."
      </p>
      <p>Reversed!</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>I receive Kim Young-hoon's energy and counter it back at him.</p>
      <p>
        A loud explosion follows, and Kim Young-hoon steps back three paces.
      </p>
      <p>"Heh, impressive."</p>
      <p>Thwoong—</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's saber splits in two.</p>
      <p>Inside, I'm shocked.</p>
      <p>"He countered my reversal with his energy in that short time?"</p>
      <p>
        By my calculations, when I countered with Echoing Valley, he should have
        been thrown back, his saber shattered. But in that moment, he recaptured
        his saber energy and countered with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I admit defeat. My weapon is broken, a disgrace for any warrior. You're
        quite skilled, aren't you?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "…Don’t worry. From now on, I will never be able to beat you again."
      </p>
      <p>I sheathe my sword and speak calmly.</p>
      <p>
        After today's duel, I won't be able to beat Kim Young-hoon in my next
        life either.
      </p>
      <p>
        He grew in real-time during the fight and will become stronger after
        consolidating his insights. Fighting me, he gained near-real combat
        experience and will soon become one of the top Three Great Warriors.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Actually, I've prepared a congratulatory gift for you reaching the
        Pinnacle Realm."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, wasn't this duel the gift? Is there more?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, here…"</p>
      <p>I entered the house and gave him six books I had prepared.</p>
      <p>"This is…"</p>
      <p>
        "Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts Scripture. I bought it
        from an old man. The minimum requirement is Three Flowers Gathering at
        the Summit. I read it but couldn’t understand, so I'm giving it to you."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, what a fortunate encounter. I'll read it gratefully."</p>
      <p>
        The insights gained from the Record of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding
        Martial Arts were maximized by Kim Young-hoon of the previous cycle and
        organized into various profound realizations.
      </p>
      <p>I handed him the books, not as records (록) but as scriptures (경).</p>
      <p>
        Now, with the Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts Scripture,
        he will become so strong that I can't even dare to face him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After teaching him more literacy and language for about a month, I went
        on to earn a living by slaughtering bandit groups and unorthodox sects
        near Changho City and capturing wanted criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Young-hoon had learned all the characters, he spent about four
        months training crazily while looking at the six volumes of Gazing
        Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts Scripture, his expression half
        dazed.
      </p>
      <p>Four months passed like this.</p>
      <p>"Young-hoon Hyung, I've earned some money."</p>
      <p>
        I returned home with a bounty from capturing a famous late-stage master
        bandit near Changho City.
      </p>
      <p>But Kim Young-hoon was not at home.</p>
      <p>'What? Did he go out?'</p>
      <p>
        He had been reading the Scripture and training martial arts as if
        possessed, but today, he was nowhere to be found in the house.
      </p>
      <p>'It seems like he has left the house entirely...'</p>
      <p>That's when it happened.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>"Ah!"</p>
      <p>Suddenly, Kim Young-hoon appeared out of thin air, like a ghost.</p>
      <p>"What the...!"</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, I tried using one of the techniques written in the Scripture, and
        you really couldn't find me. This book is indeed an incredible martial
        arts text...!"
      </p>
      <p>"Young-hoon Hyung, that's..."</p>
      <p>I asked him with a trembling voice.</p>
      <p>
        This strange technique was one that Kim Young-hoon of previous cycles
        only managed to use after reaching the absolute of martial arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, the current Kim Young-hoon, who had not even been training for
        a year, was using it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, this? It's one of the techniques written in Gazing Cultivation and
        Exceeding Martial Arts Scripture. Normally, it would be much easier to
        use upon reaching Five Energies Converging to the Origin, but I've been
        focusing solely on this technique for the past few days. Even though I'm
        only in the realm of Three Flowers, I somehow managed to use this
        technique."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah... So you haven't reached the Five Energies state yet?"</p>
      <p>
        "Hahaha, do you think reaching the Five Energies is a joke? Just
        following the insights written in the Scripture will take at least five
        years. By the way, this technique is really fearsome. Even you, a peak
        master, couldn't notice it. If I wanted, I could assassinate anyone."
      </p>
      <p>I was speechless at his talent and just stared at him for a moment.</p>
      <p>
        "By the way, I'm planning to go out and gain real combat experience in
        the martial world. Will you come with me?"
      </p>
      <p>"Uh, the martial world, you say?"</p>
      <p>After pondering for a moment, I shook my head.</p>
      <p>"No, I'm fine, Young-hoon Hyung."</p>
      <p>"Huh? What do you mean?"</p>
      <p>"I want to stabilize my realm a bit more."</p>
      <p>
        "Well, that makes sense. You're still at the early pinnacle realm and
        can't even use the Sword Silk (劍絲) yet."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, it seems you'll have to go alone, Young-hoon Hyung."</p>
      <p>I said so, deciding to part ways with him for a while.</p>
      <p>The reason was just as I said.</p>
      <p>
        Being at the early stage of the pinnacle realm, I needed time to
        stabilize my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following him and watching duels between great masters would be good,
        but it wasn't what I needed at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least until I reached the mid-stage of the Pinnacle Realm, training
        through trial and error and repetition was the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        'First, I need to get used to entering the vision of a peak master all
        day long.'
      </p>
      <p>
        While Kim Young-hoon went out to challenge various sects, I practiced
        becoming accustomed to the vision of a peak master.
      </p>
      <p>
        My practice opponents were the unorthodox sect groups near Changho City.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were numerous, tenacious, and most importantly, it didn't matter if
        they were killed, making them perfect practice targets.
      </p>
      <p>'The one in front is about to shoot a poison dart.'</p>
      <p>'There's one attacking with a spear from behind.'</p>
      <p>
        'There's someone trying to entangle my ankle with a whip from the
        diagonal right rear.'
      </p>
      <p>Numerous red lines rushed towards me.</p>
      <p>
        I dodged all sorts of attacks from the approaching unorthodox sect
        members, annihilating them with minimal movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        When fighting unorthodox sect martial artists, I always blindfolded
        myself and plugged my ears before seeking them outt.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, I could kill all of them in the vision of a peak master
        without any senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        For about three years, I trained by capturing gangs of evil martial
        artists, bandits, and robbers near Changho City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I was able to enter the world of the Pinnacle Realm all day
        without feeling my brain burning.
      </p>
      <p>My brain had completely adapted to this world.</p>
      <p>
        I even learned how to maintain the vision of a peak master all day
        without using internal energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        After three years of 'practice' fighting unorthodox sect martial
        artists,
      </p>
      <p>I finally succeeded in fully entering the world of a peak master.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, my financial situation improved significantly with the
        bounties collected in Changho City, and my nickname Infinite Fighting
        Spirit started to spread again.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were even those who wanted to become my disciples or follow me as
        martial artists.
      </p>
      <p>'Of course, this was nothing compared to Kim Young-hoon.'</p>
      <p>Nearly three years.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon received the title of the Strongest Blade in Yanguo and
        ascended to the position of the number one person in Yanguo martial
        arts.
      </p>
      <p>The strongest in the martial world!</p>
      <p>
        It was a realm reached by someone who had only been practicing martial
        arts for 3-4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of Kim Young-hoon’s followers and those who wanted to become
        his disciples was incomparably greater than mine.
      </p>
      <p>'Probably by now...'</p>
      <p>
        It was time for Kim Young-hoon to be hit with the Wulin Alliance leader
        illness.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was always the position that came with becoming the number one person
        in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, Kim Young-hoon came to me again and proposed the position
        of deputy leader of the Wulin Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, knowing the future of working like a cow, I flatly refused
        and made an appropriate excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Young-hoon Hyung, I'm now going to try entering the imperial court."
      </p>
      <p>"What, what? The imperial court?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. The reason I'm refusing your offer is to help you from the
        position of an official by joining the imperial court. Please
        understand."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, Younger Brother Seo. I'm truly grateful."</p>
      <p>
        Of course, there was a different ulterior motive for my decision to join
        the imperial court.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If I join the imperial court, I'll have more contact with the
        cultivator clan!'
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the chief strategist of the Wulin Alliance and the head of the
        intelligence organization Gwiyeonggak in my previous lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the information I had learned at that time, the imperial
        court was more deeply entwined with the cultivator clan than any other
        group in Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were even rumors that the Yanguo imperial family was a collateral
        branch of the cultivator clan.
      </p>
      <p>I first applied to the Yanguo military.</p>
      <p>
        The military gladly accepted my application as a famous peak master in
        the martial world, and I quickly gained recognition, rising to the
        position of a general.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that position, I applied to the Imperial Guard and passed without
        any problems.
      </p>
      <p>It was the result I achieved in five years after returning.</p>
      <p>
        "Your mission is to secretly guard His Majesty the Emperor and protect
        him with your life. As a peak master, you should be able to do that
        much, right?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, I will keep that in mind."</p>
      <p>
        I joined the Shadow Guards and, after four months of training in stealth
        and listening techniques, was deployed to guard the Emperor.
      </p>
      <p>There, I discovered a surprising fact.</p>
      <p>'The Emperor... is a cultivator!'</p>
      <p>Woong—</p>
      <p>
        I could see the red aura surrounding the Emperor, centered around his
        forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
        'It's the cultivator's divine consciousness! The Emperor was originally
        a cultivator.'
      </p>
      <p>
        This fact became even more certain after meeting several princes and
        princesses of the imperial family.
      </p>
      <p>
        The majority of the members of the imperial family were cultivators with
        divine consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        'But it seems they're not high-ranking cultivators. They're all...
        nowhere near that fox.'
      </p>
      <p>They seemed to be, at best, cultivators of the Qi Refining level.</p>
      <p>'I don't understand why I, a peak master, have to guard them...'</p>
      <p>
        The Emperor's aura, casually revealed, was definitely not just 1st Star
        of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that level of skill, the Emperor might be stronger than the entire
        Shadow Guards combined.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Maybe the Shadow Guard exists because he's too lazy to deal with
        assassins himself.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the Emperor was the person in the imperial family most at
        risk of assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost every night, assassins came, and I had to fight them off every
        night.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Is it good that I'm gaining real combat experience almost every day?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I accumulated real combat experience as the Emperor's guard,
        spending five years as a member of the Shadow Guard.
      </p>
      <p>"Are you managing well as the Wulin Alliance leader?"</p>
      <p>
        In a small secret room, I was playing Go with Kim Young-hoon and asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Emperor's guard, I was officially forbidden from meeting him, the
        Wulin Alliance leader, so we had to meet secretly like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Isn't it a headache? Haha, it would have been less painful if you had
        joined me."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You're about to become younger than me, aren't you? What's the
        problem?"
      </p>
      <p>"Haha, well..."</p>
      <p>He smiled meaningfully in response to my question.</p>
      <p>It was about time for him to undergo rejuvenation.</p>
      <p>In fact, considering the timing, it was somewhat late.</p>
      <p>
        "The Three Flowers are just around the corner for you. It seems your
        internal energy has improved remarkably. Congratulations."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha... Cutting down assassins beside the Emperor, how could my skills
        not improve?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The assassins coming to kill the Emperor ranged from low peak masters to
        those at the realm of Three Flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time, the assassins were of a similar realm to mine,
        allowing me to freely engage in real battles with them.
      </p>
      <p>"So you seem to be doing well as the Emperor's guard?"</p>
      <p>
        "Don't even mention it. Every time I gauge the Emperor's skill, I feel a
        sense of doubt."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hahaha, the Emperor being a cultivator? That's really something, hardly
        seems worth guarding."
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, Kim Young-hoon had become aware of the
        existence of cultivators and seemed eager to face them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "By the way, Young-Hoon Hyung, what do you think of these cultivators?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally, at this point, Kim Young-Hoon would have been eager to find
        and confront them.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the current Kim Young-Hoon didn't seem to show such intentions.
      </p>
      <p>To my question, he drank from his cup and said,</p>
      <p>"Huh, what to say. Of course, I'd like to fight them. But..."</p>
      <p>"But?"</p>
      <p>
        "I haven't yet fully comprehended all 6 volumes of Gazing Cultivation
        and Exceeding Martial Arts Scripture. Especially the final phrases
        written in it..."
      </p>
      <p>
        The final phrases written in the Scripture were the realizations that
        Kim Young-Hoon had gained at the end of the previous life.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The realizations written in the scripture are such that I can't even
        attempt confronting them before I've fully mastered it. That's why I
        plan to delve into those phrases and then seek out cultivators. By then,
        I should be able to step down from being the Wulin Alliance leader..."
      </p>
      <p>"I see..."</p>
      <p>"By the way, your skills seem to have improved a bit?"</p>
      <p>Kim Young-Hoon smiled and poured more liquor into his cup.</p>
      <p>
        'He's infusing his internal energy into the liquor along with the
        alcohol.'
      </p>
      <p>This man is unbelievable.</p>
      <p>I drew my sword from my waist.</p>
      <p>"Let's see you handle this."</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>He threw the liquor cup.</p>
      <p>Strangely, not a single drop of liquor spilled from the cup.</p>
      <p>
        It looked like a light liquor cup, but I gathered all my internal energy
        and focused on the cup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past five years, having fought continuously, I successfully
        transitioned from the early stage to the mid-stage peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the early stage of the Pinnacle Realm was about seeing one line upon
        entering that world,
      </p>
      <p>
        From the mid-stage onwards, it became possible to see both red and blue
        lines 'simultaneously.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Until now, I had to give up seeing the blue line in order to see the red
        line, and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as I further entered into the Pinnacle Realm, it became
        possible to see both the red and blue lines at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>
        With the vision of a peak master I could see countless red lines
        extending from the cup. At the same time, the optimal paths I could take
        to counter it appeared as blue lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this liquor cup, Kim Young-Hoon was revealing his intent and
        engaging in dozens of exchanges with me.
      </p>
      <p>When I tried to strike with Transcending Peaks,</p>
      <p>The trajectory of the red lines changed vertically.</p>
      <p>When I tried to strike upwards with Ascending Vein</p>
      <p>The red lines' trajectory became elusive, changing erratically.</p>
      <p>And when I tried to create chaos with Landscape Painting ,</p>
      <p>
        The red lines precisely targeted the gaps in my chaos and aimed for my
        weaknesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that instant, after a fight of exchanging blows with Kim Young-Hoon,
        I managed to create a single path that penetrated his defense.
      </p>
      <p>"Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Flowing Ridge'!"</p>
      <p>Zeeeng!</p>
      <p>
        Although the sword tip collided with the liquor cup, a storm blew,
        shaking the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Realizing the internal energy in the cup was dissolved by Flowing Ridge,
        I quickly sheathed my sword and stretched out my hand to catch the
        falling cup.
      </p>
      <p>Luckily, not a drop of liquor was spilled.</p>
      <p>"Phew, should you be playing with food?"</p>
      <p>
        "What? Besides, you've improved significantly. The realm of 'Sword Silk'
        is just around the corner."
      </p>
      <p>'Sword Silk (劍絲)'.</p>
      <p>
        Sword energy compresses akin to a silk thread, the first step where the
        originally formless sword energy materializes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his past life, Kim Young-hoon thought that, given my high
        understanding of sword energy, I would quickly reach the level of 'Sword
        Silk' once I ascended to the Pinnacle Realm. He overestimated my talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even now, ten years after my return, I have yet to realize the state of
        'Sword Silk.'
      </p>
      <p>
        'Thankfully, after reaching the mid-stage of the Pinnacle Realm, I can
        see a glimmer of hope.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It was fortunate that it wasn't as difficult as the transition from the
        late first-rate to the Pinnacle Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'Well, anyway... didn't I say I was on the verge of reaching the Five
        Energies state?'’
      </p>
      <p>‘'Yes, you did.'’</p>
      <p>
        ‘'In fact, I am at a level where I can challenge the Five Energies realm
        at any time. However, if someone attacks me while I'm challenging the
        Five Energies realm, I would be helpless, so I need to call someone
        trustworthy to guard me...'’
      </p>
      <p>‘'So you're asking me to guard you.'’</p>
      <p>‘'Haha, yes.'’</p>
      <p>I went with Kim Young-Hoon to his secluded training room.</p>
      <p>
        ‘'There's no one as trustworthy as someone from the same hometown.'’
      </p>
      <p>‘'Of course. Let's get started.'’</p>
      <p>‘'Alright...'’</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-Hoon sat in the middle of the training room and began his deep
        meditation.
      </p>
      <p>A change began to occur in his energy.</p>
      <p>'Hmm?'</p>
      <p>
        I entered the vision of peak masters and observed the red lines around
        him.
      </p>
      <p>I felt like it was something I needed to do.</p>
      <p>
        The red lines of peak masters usually connect their arms to their
        weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the red line between Kim Young-Hoon's hand and his saber began
        to change.
      </p>
      <p>'That is...'</p>
      <p>Dozens of branches extended from the red line.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, his red line seemed to cover everything around him.</p>
      <p>
        If I were to enter that space, I felt like I would be sliced by Kim
        Young-Hoon's attack immediately.
      </p>
      <p>Any peak master, unless insane, would not dare enter that space.</p>
      <p>'No, that's not it...!'</p>
      <p>I noticed a familiar change and my pupils constricted.</p>
      <p>
        The red line covering all around Kim Young-Hoon began to fill in the
        gaps.
      </p>
      <p>His surroundings gradually became a red domain.</p>
      <p>It looks like...</p>
      <p>'The divine consciousness of the cultivators!!!'</p>
      <p>The red domain centered around the cultivators' foreheads!</p>
      <p>It looked just like their consciousness.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon’s domain became clear, with not a single gap remaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the form of the domain stabilized into a sphere about half a zhang
        (approx. 1.67m) in radius centered around his forehead,
      </p>
      <p>Woong―</p>
      <p>
        The energy around him seemed to be sucked in, forming a certain flow
        within his domains.
      </p>
      <p>These flows slowly merged, forming five spheres above his head.</p>
      <p>
        The phenomenon that occurs when transitioning to the Five Energies
        Converging to the Origin!
      </p>
      <p>
        I had never observed the transition to the Five Energies state so
        closely before.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, during my first-rate days, it was impossible to observe such
        subtle flows of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was only after becoming a peak master, my ability to read others'
        energy dramatically improved, allowing me to observe this phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>'Ah, what a pity.'</p>
      <p>I suddenly felt a sense of regret.</p>
      <p>
        If I had reached the realm of Three Flowers, I might have been able to
        see much more.
      </p>
      <p>'...For now, let's closely observe his current state.'</p>
      <p>I intensely focused on the five spheres.</p>
      <p>The flow within them.</p>
      <p>The principle of how these five spheres revolve around each other.</p>
      <p>
        The principle behind the spheres floating above Kim Young-hoon’s head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I didn't understand everything, these fragments of realization
        seemed enough to give me a sense of the 'Sword Silk.'
      </p>
      <p>Then, it happened.</p>
      <p>Sssrrr―</p>
      <p>The five spheres crumbled, transforming into five-colored energy.</p>
      <p>
        The five-colored energy entered Kim Young-hoon's nose and mouth, and his
        body began to change.
      </p>
      <p>Crack, creak!</p>
      <p>His body twisted.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's bones and flesh changed, and the wrinkles on his skin
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, lush hair grew on his previously bald head.</p>
      <p>Creak, crack!</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        All the energy in the training room seemed to be sucked into him, and he
        half-opened his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>"I've safely reached the Five Origins Converging to the Origin."</p>
      <p>"...Congratulations. You've undergone rejuvenation."</p>
      <p>He looked younger than me, in his twenties.</p>
      <p>
        I had seen this scene in my past life, but this time I gained much from
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's a pity for you. If you had reached Three Flowers, you could have
        seen much more."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I was just thinking that. What can I do? It's my fault for having
        limited skills."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But it must have been somewhat helpful, so think it over once you
        return."
      </p>
      <p>He seemed to like his now lush hair, touching it.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, I asked him a question.</p>
      <p>
        "You must have encountered one or two cultivators, right, Young-hoon
        Hyung?"
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, yes."</p>
      <p>
        "Right now, to my eyes... the consciousness they possess and the domain
        you've formed seem very similar. Do you think there's a connection?"
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>After pondering for a moment, he spoke.</p>
      <p>
        "It seems likely. Within this domain, I think I can fight equally with
        those Qi Refining stage cultivators. Using the martial arts from the
        Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts Scripture, I might even be
        able to fight against higher-level cultivators. Perhaps, those who have
        reached the Five Energies state might share a similar field of vision
        with cultivators."
      </p>
      <p>"I see..."</p>
      <p>
        Through his answer, I could roughly imagine why those who have reached
        the Five Energies state in martial arts obtain the same kind of
        consciousness as cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Obtaining the same consciousness as the cultivators, it might be
        possible to train like them...'
      </p>
      <p>The world seen by the first-rate is different from the peak realm.</p>
      <p>
        The world seen by the Pinnacle Realm and Three Flowers is also
        different.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world seen by Three Flowers Gather at the Summit and the Five
        Energies Converging to the Origin is entirely different.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason why those who have reached the Five Energies state can train
        in cultivators' techniques might be because they can see areas invisible
        to ordinary people.
      </p>
      <p>
        'This experience will help when I reach the Five Energies realm in the
        future.'
      </p>
      <p>
        After receiving some martial arts guidance from Kim Young-hoon that day
        and chatting for a bit, I returned to the imperial palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mulled over the situation he showed me when he ascended to the Five
        Energies and gathered my realizations.
      </p>
      <p>A few days passed.</p>
      <p>That day too, I was guarding the Emperor's bedroom in the darkness.</p>
      <p>Sssrrr―</p>
      <p>Someone approached from the darkness, writhing in the distance.</p>
      <p>It was an assassin again.</p>
      <p>'A peak master.'</p>
      <p>Judging by their energy, he had just reached the Pinnacle Realm.</p>
      <p>However, I didn't let my guard down.</p>
      <p>
        Although I was slightly stronger, the difference between the mid and
        early stages of the Pinnacle Realm was not as significant as between
        first-rate and peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the opponent was a master of assassination, daring enough to
        attempt assassinating the Emperor.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        A red line appeared from the darkness and lunged at me, guarding the
        Emperor's bedroom.
      </p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        I deflected the dagger with my sword and threw a hidden weapon at the
        assassin's ankle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The assassin hastily dodged my hidden weapon and stabbed at me again
        with his dagger.
      </p>
      <p>Our exchanges intertwined.</p>
      <p>My blue line and his red line crossed in the air.</p>
      <p>'Strange.'</p>
      <p>
        I should be focused on the fight, yet I couldn't stop thinking about the
        situation when Kim Young-hoon ascended to Five Energies.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, I began to ponder about sword energy.</p>
      <p>
        'Sword energy indicates the beginning of achieving unification with the
        sword.'
      </p>
      <p>
        'In the mid-stage of the first-rate, one manifests sword energy and
        begins to reach the threshold of unification with the sword.'
      </p>
      <p>
        'In the late stage of the first-rate, one achieves complete unification
        with the sword and can use proper sword energy.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Why, in a life-or-death situation, am I thinking about sword energy and
        the image of Kim Young-hoon ascending to Five Energies?
      </p>
      <p>
        'As one ascends to the Pinnacle Realm and constantly sees the optimal
        path, as long as you follow that path, sword energy never extinguishes.'
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why Kim Young-hoon in my past life advised me to train to
        maintain sword energy all day long.
      </p>
      <p>
        'My optimal path is ultimately the limit my swordsmanship points to.
        Sword energy is the extreme manifestation of my swordsmanship's
        characteristics through unification with the sword.'
      </p>
      <p>Swordsmanship is sword energy.</p>
      <p>These were my feelings during my martial arts training.</p>
      <p>'Wait, no, something's off.'</p>
      <p>But suddenly, I felt something was wrong with my thinking.</p>
      <p>
        The assassin stabbed at me three times in a row, and I deflected their
        dagger with Landscape Painting before destabilizing their balance with
        the Entering Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>His red line stretched towards me and then split.</p>
      <p>After stabbing, he will change his move.</p>
      <p>
        I blocked his intention with my blue line and engaged in a struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If swordsmanship is sword energy, then what's the significance of a
        martial artist? Couldn't cultivators just create moving puppets or
        zombies, teach them swordsmanship, and have them use sword energy?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Why haven't I heard about inanimate objects using sword energy in my
        several lifetimes?
      </p>
      <p>'Sword energy is not just swordsmanship.'</p>
      <p>Then what is sword energy?</p>
      <p>
        While exchanging blows with the assassin, his red line pierced through
        my blue line.
      </p>
      <p>His dagger aimed precisely at my forehead.</p>
      <p>'Sword energy is...'</p>
      <p>
        I remembered the scene when Kim Young-hoon entered Five Energies, a red
        domain forming around his forehead.
      </p>
      <p>Ah, that's it.</p>
      <p>Though sword energy is created by swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>At its core, it's ultimately about the human.</p>
      <p>The intent of the martial artist wielding the sword!</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, I fully understood the true nature of the red and blue
        lines I had seen.
      </p>
      <p>Not just the optimal path or the opponent's intention of attack.</p>
      <p>It's the intent of martial artist unfolding their martial arts!</p>
      <p>The direction of their intent!</p>
      <p>
        Realizing this, I felt a strange sensation in my hand holding the sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if veins were growing from the sword into my skin, entering my hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not just a simple unification with the sword, but a stickier, more
        profound unification!
      </p>
      <p>
        Instinctively, I pushed more intent into the sword, deepening the
        unification.
      </p>
      <p>Until now, I thought sword energy was the same as swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>
        But I realized that swordsmanship is completed together with the martial
        artist who unfolds it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, wherever the intent of the martial artist goes, even if it
        deviates from the swordsmanship, it will still be swordsmanship.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>I swung my sword wildly at the assassin.</p>
      <p>
        Before, if I deviated from the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, the
        power of my sword energy would significantly weaken.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, even when I swing my sword randomly, the power of my sword
        energy doesn't decrease at all.
      </p>
      <p>'No, this isn't the end.'</p>
      <p>I knew that my recent realization was not just this.</p>
      <p>I continued to focus on sword energy.</p>
      <p>
        Until recently, to evolve sword energy, I had to momentarily strengthen
        the energy with techniques like 'Qi Mountain, Heart Heaven.'
      </p>
      <p>It’s different now!</p>
      <p>'Continue to infuse the sword energy with intent!'</p>
      <p>
        In the world of the peak, I saw my sword gradually enveloped in blue
        light.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, reaching a critical moment, my blue light enveloped sword
        transformed into the blue thread of the Pinnacle Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality, I was holding a sword, but in the vision of peaks, I was
        holding a blue thread.
      </p>
      <p>'Ah, this is...</p>
      <p>Sword Silk!</p>
      <p>The proof of maturity in the mid-stage of the Pinnacle Realm!</p>
      <p>Keening―</p>
      <p>
        In reality, my intangible sword energy became thin like a silk thread,
        subtly materializing.
      </p>
      <p>After about 10 years in the Pinnacle Realm.</p>
      <p>I reached the mid peak stage and could freely use Sword Silk.</p>

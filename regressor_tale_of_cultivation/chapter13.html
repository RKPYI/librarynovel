      <p>Chapter 13: Talent Abandoned by the Heavens (1)</p>
      <p>
        I gave my arm to the fox that approached me that morning, cutting it off
        myself. It was a symbolic act of cutting off any future hesitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        After eating my arm, the fox allowed us to stay and then left. Without
        paying attention to the others, I went to a quiet part of the forest and
        continued to swing my sword, striving to regain that enlightenment!
      </p>
      <p>
        But a day passed, then two, and on the third day, when the cultivators
        came and kidnapped my colleagues, even though I swung my sword
        relentlessly without eating, sleeping, or resting, the enlightenment did
        not return.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stopped only on the fourth day, right after Sea Dragon King Seo Hweol
        kidnapped Deputy Manager Oh. I prepared a feast for Manager Kim and Kim
        Young-hoon, who were sitting in despair, adding spices to the grilled
        mushrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three of us ate the feast and shared our last conversation. Soon
        after, Manager Kim awakened her abilities and from afar, an old man
        riding a giant puppet appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man, after a brief struggle with Manager Kim, pushed me and Kim
        Young-hoon into a spatial rift and we were thrown away.
      </p>
      <p>
        I closed my eyes for the last time seeing Manager Kim reaching out to
        us.
      </p>
      <p>When I opened my eyes, I found myself on a tree.</p>
      <p>'Hmm...'</p>
      <p>
        I used my agility to descend and found that Kim Young-hoon was also
        tangled in another tree. After helping him down, I surveyed the area.
      </p>
      <p>'This is the southwestern part of Yanguo.'</p>
      <p>
        In my past life, wandering through the country, managing the Palace of
        Heavenly Demons and Gwiyeonggak, I gained confidence in roughly
        determining my location anywhere within Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>'After about 100 years of wandering around Yanguo.'</p>
      <p>
        Of course, I didn't know every nook and cranny of the country, but I
        could generally figure out where I was.
      </p>
      <p>‘'Wake up, Director.'’</p>
      <p>
        I woke up Kim Young-hoon and explained the situation to him. He seemed
        panicked but accepted it reasonably after all that had happened.
        Together, we headed to the nearest city, while I taught him letters and
        the language along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few days, we reached the nearest city, Hobeok city. We sold
        medicinal herbs and bought a manor. I taught him literacy, language, and
        the Severing Vein Saber Technique, a saber technique he created in his
        past life by modifying my Severing Mountain Swordsmanship. After
        following my teachings, he became a peak master in just three months.
      </p>
      <p>'It feels a bit empty.'</p>
      <p>
        Some spend their entire lives barely reaching the top of first-rate,
        while others reach the peak in just three months.
      </p>
      <p>'And to think he's achieved Three Flowers Gather at the Summit...'</p>
      <p>
        I watched him eating a yellow bamboo root and the floating Three Flowers
        above his head.
      </p>
      <p>'Sigh...'</p>

      <p>
        After he finished his cultivation, he stood up with a relaxed
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>"Ha ha, I think I could even beat you now, Deputy Manager Seo."</p>
      <p>'...'</p>
      <p>I watched him, energetic, and felt bittersweet inside.</p>
      <p>
        He was is the 'Young-hoon Hyung-nim' I knew from my past life. Now,
        mentally, he was much younger than me.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If we go by the time we lived, I'm old enough to be Director Kim
        Young-hoon’s great grandfather.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching his excitement, I thought about not accompanying him in this
        life.
      </p>
      <p>‘'...Director, I have something to tell you.'’</p>
      <p>
        "Something? Oh, sure. Don't worry. I'll teach you this martial art
        well..."
      </p>
      <p>"Starting today, I will go my separate ways from you, Director."</p>
      <p>‘'What?'’</p>
      <p>He looked at me, bewildered.</p>
      <p>‘'Why, Deputy Manager Seo. No, Seo Eun-hyun.'’</p>
      <p>
        "Exactly as I said. I plan to travel separately from you, Director."
      </p>
      <p>‘'Why?'’</p>
      <p>"Because..."</p>
      <p>
        Memories of Young-hoon Hyung-nim from my past lives flashed through my
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first life, where he rose to prominence as the leader of the Wulin
        Alliance but eventually learned about the world of cultivators, fought
        them, despaired, and collapsed. The second life, where he established
        the world's best faction, rebelled against the cultivators, massacred
        them, but eventually gave up the path of martial arts and chose to
        become a cultivator himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably, it would be the same in this life. This life too, he would
        rise to prominence, learn martial arts, fight cultivators, despair in
        front of them, and choose to become a cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>I no longer wanted to see him despair.</p>
      <p>‘'...I am.'’</p>
      <p>But I couldn't say that.</p>
      <p>‘'I want to travel the world and elevate my realm.'’</p>
      <p>‘'But I can teach you that too...'’</p>
      <p>‘'I want to do it alone.'’</p>
      <p>‘'No, you can't. How can I live without you?'’</p>
      <p>
        ‘'You'll be fine, Director. I've taught you writing, language, and
        martial arts. You've become a peak master on your own. You don't have to
        worry anymore.'’
      </p>
      <p>‘'But...'’</p>
      <p>He looked dejected.</p>
      <p>‘'Am I going to be separated from my fellow countrymen again?'’</p>
      <p>
        It seemed the shock of being transported to another world and losing all
        his colleagues in a short time had not yet fully subsided.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'Then let's meet once every two years at this house. How about that?'’
      </p>
      <p>‘'...Hmm.'’</p>
      <p>
        After persuading the gloomy Kim Young-hoon, I parted ways with him and
        left the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Staying by his side, guided by the world's greatest martial expert, I
        could reach the Pinnacle Realm faster. However, I no longer wanted to
        see him despair.
      </p>
      <p>After leaving the city, I looked around the landscape.</p>
      <p>'First, I should go to Seokyung city.'</p>
      <p>
        I thought of visiting the 4 Stars 3 Demons of the capital of Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        With many excellent peal cultivators in Seokyung city’s seven sects, I
        thought I might receive their teachings.
      </p>
      <p>'I'll try some martial arts duels.'</p>
      <p>
        But off course, I had no intention of messing with big sects like the 4
        Stars 3 Demons. It's better not to touch such places until I become a
        peak master, as it would bring trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went to a small sect on the outskirts of Seokyung city, Hall of Eight
        Respects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hall of Eight Respects was a medium-sized sect in Seokyung city, and its
        leader was a top-notch first-rate expert.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I arrived at the Hall of Eight Respects, two gatekeepers blocked my
        way.
      </p>
      <p>‘'What brings you to the Hall of Eight Respects?'’</p>
      <p>
        Dressed in fancy martial robes bought with money from selling herbs, the
        gatekeepers were polite to me. I returned their greeting and stated my
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘'I've come to request a martial arts duel at the Hall of Eight
        Respects.'’
      </p>
      <p>At my words, the gatekeepers' eyebrows twitched.</p>
      <p>"Our hall isn't a place where just anyone can come..."</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I swiftly unsheathed my sword and sliced through the gatekeeper's
        clothes without touching him. The sword energy cut through his front
        garment. Realizing I had used sword energy, the gatekeepers' faces
        turned pale.
      </p>
      <p>"Sword energy...!"</p>
      <p>"A first-rate master!"</p>
      <p>"Do I still look like 'just anyone' to you?"</p>
      <p>
        The two gatekeepers asked me to wait and went inside the Hall of Eight
        Respects. After a while, one of the guards, sweating profusely, returned
        to the gate.
      </p>
      <p>"Please, come inside. The master awaits you."</p>
      <p>
        I followed the gatekeeper into the Hall of Eight Respects and towards
        the sparring ground inside the main building. There, a middle-aged man
        with a long beard was waiting with a nine-section whip in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, I wondered who the first-rate master was, but I didn't expect
        such a young hero."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I am Seo Eun-hyun, a humble and unknown warrior. I am honored to meet
        the master of the Hall of Eight Respects."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha, such a young hero, and yet your martial arts spirit is not
        ordinary."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Your martial arts spirit is also extraordinary, master. Please bestow
        your teachings upon this humble warrior."
      </p>
      <p>After brief courtesies, we began our sparring match.</p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        The master of the Hall of Eight Respects initiated the first move. His
        nine-section whip struck like a serpent, movements full of discipline.
        It felt as if his martial arts had become one with him. I countered his
        attacks using the moves of the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the master of the Hall of Eight Respects launched a kick
        from behind his whip.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I ducked his kick and attacked with a lower stance, breaking through his
        guard.
      </p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        His whip fell towards me, but I quickly stepped back and assumed a
        defensive stance.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...Your sword form and momentum are completely unified. Sword-body
        Unity... Late first-rate"
      </p>
      <p>
        "You too have completely melded your martial arts into your being,
        master. I am learning a lot from this."
      </p>
      <p>"Ha...ha..."</p>
      <p>He sighed while looking at me.</p>
      <p>
        "To reach such a stage at such a young age. You truly are a genius."
      </p>
      <p>"Genius..."</p>
      <p>I let out a bitter smile.</p>
      <p>
        Surely, to outsiders, I am an immense genius. Being in the late stage of
        first-rate mastery in my late twenties is indeed a miracle.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you consider that even first-rate mastery takes decades for ordinary
        people to reach, I must seem like a divine prodigy from the outside.
      </p>
      <p>"A heaven-sent talent..."</p>
      <p>
        But I knew the truth. I was not a genius bestowed by heaven. I was not a
        genius at all.
      </p>
      <p>"...Thank you for praising my inadequate talent."</p>
      <p>To me, being called a genius was not a compliment.</p>
      <p>
        While geniuses are rare in the world, mediocrity abounds. Being compared
        to a genius, despite being a mediocre who couldn't even reach the
        first-rate in a lifetime without the advantage of regression, would be
        nothing short of deception.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, I decided to embrace the title of genius.</p>
      <p>"I will now use sword energy."</p>
      <p>"Go ahead. I will give it my all too."</p>
      <p>At the same time, we both lunged towards each other.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>First move.</p>
      <p>Transcending Peaks(越岳).</p>
      <p>
        I swung my sword from left to right at mid-level, creating a crescent
        moon-shaped sword energy that sliced towards the master of the Hall of
        Eight Respects.
      </p>
      <p>
        He dodged my attack by bending his waist but countered with a low stance
        using his whip.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>Second move.</p>
      <p>Entering Mountain (入山).</p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>
        I quickly switched to a low stance, countering his whip at the same
        height.
      </p>
      <p>Our weapons clashed, sending off sparks.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The master of the Hall of Eight Respects leaped into the air and struck
        down with his whip.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>Third move.</p>
      <p>Ascending Vein (登脈).</p>
      <p>
        I raised my sword from the low position, deflecting his whip and
        preparing to counterattack.
      </p>
      <p>Fourth move (招).</p>
      <p>Flowing Ridge (流陵).</p>
      <p>
        I gently thrust my sword in a fluid motion. He tried to block with his
        whip, but my sword twisted and spiraled, piercing through his defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        He narrowly dodged my thrust, but the spiraling sword energy grazed his
        garment.
      </p>
      <p>Seizing the opportunity, I continued with my next moves.</p>
      <p>Fifth move, Bouldered Cliff (塊巖).</p>
      <p>Sixth move, Strange Stone (奇石).</p>
      <p>
        Twirling the sword like a dance, creating an impenetrable whirl of sword
        strokes, I gradually increased my sword speed.
      </p>
      <p>Whirling, whirling, whirling!</p>
      <p>Seventh move, Deep Mountain (深山).</p>
      <p>Using the rotational force, I launched an attack.</p>
      <p>
        The master of the Hall of Eight Respects tried to strike me down with
        his nine-section whip, but thanks to the strange variations developed
        from the sixth move, I managed to infiltrate his guard.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm...!"</p>
      <p>
        After breaching his defense, I twisted my body from lower right to upper
        left and made my strike.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The master of the Hall of Eight Respects managed to avoid my sword
        strike by turning a full circle, but my sword energy sliced through the
        front of his garment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, he used his momentum from the turn to lash out his
        nine-section whip towards me.
      </p>
      <p>Eighth move, Secluded Valley (幽谷).</p>
      <p>
        I swung my sword again, deflecting the master's whip, effectively
        neutralizing the force within it.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The master stepped back and swung his whip three times in succession.
      </p>
      <p>I countered by raising my sword to the upper left.</p>
      <p>Ninth move, Landscape Painting (山水畵).</p>
      <p>
        Striking down to the lower right, then again using my internal energy to
        strike to the upper right and again to the lower left three times in a
        row.
      </p>
      <p>A total of six strikes successfully parried his whip.</p>
      <p>I raised my sword in a high stance, pulling up my internal energy.</p>
      <p>Tenth move, Dragon Vein (龍脈).</p>
      <p>
        The internal energy from the Dragon Vein Qi Method surged explosively.
      </p>
      <p>
        An enormous force filled my sword, slashing towards the master with a
        fierce momentum.
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh!"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The master countered with his whip, and our weapons collided, creating a
        sound like an exploding cannon.
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh!"</p>
      <p>
        The master grimaced from the shock transmitted through his fingertips
        and spun around, lashing his whip towards me.
      </p>
      <p>'Four times!'</p>
      <p>His whip attack came at me four times.</p>
      <p>Eleventh move, Cliff Edge (斷崖).</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>
        I applied the technique of a thousand-pound weight to my sword filled
        with internal energy.
      </p>
      <p>The sword became incredibly heavy.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the sword energy embedded in the sword pierced through
        the sparring ground floor.
      </p>
      <p>I slashed upwards through the ground, striking the master.</p>
      <p>"Argh!"</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Even though my sword was stuck in the ground, it moved swiftly. As soon
        as it was freed, the speed was incomparably faster than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The master, taken aback by the sudden increase in speed, was sliced by
        my sword across his garment again.
      </p>
      <p>'It's time to finish this.'</p>
      <p>Twelfth move, Seven Lights Emerging Peak (七光一出峰).</p>
      <p>
        As the sun rises behind the mountains, illuminating the world with its
        light,
      </p>
      <p>Seven streams of sword energy flowed beyond the eleventh move.</p>
      <p>Clang!</p>

      <p>"It was a good opportunity."</p>

        upright practices and not resorting to underhanded tactics.'

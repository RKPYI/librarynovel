      <p>
        The excitement of the Twin Immortals Dance gradually subsided as the
        moon reached its zenith, and the event slowly came to an end.
      </p>
      <p>"It was tough, but quite enjoyable."</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa says with a light smile, wiping off her sweat.</p>
      <p>"I'm glad you liked it."</p>
      <p>
        After the festival ended, I’ve been repeatedly practicing the dance
        steps and movements I had performed at the festival and replied.
      </p>
      <p>"But, what are you doing, Daoist Seo?"</p>
      <p>"Oh, somehow this dance move is..."</p>
      <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>
        I spin around several times, drawing out the hidden movements within the
        dance.
      </p>
      <p>"It resembles a spear technique."</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>
        I wrap Gang Qi around my hand in the air, and as I thrust into the void,
        the spear technique hidden in the dance materializes in my hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        'This spear technique seeks the integrity of unity in offense and
        defense...'
      </p>
      <p>
        The martial principles of the spear technique naturally blends into the
        dance, allowing me to grasp it while performing the Twin Immortals
        Dance.
      </p>
      <p>It's been hundreds of years since I began practicing martial arts.</p>
      <p>
        I can easily understand the underlying principles and martial logic of
        martial arts below a certain level.
      </p>
      <p>
        I perform the spear technique several times, attempting to fully restore
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        'This is a remarkable spear technique. It doesn't quite match the
        Twenty-Four Moves Severing Mountain Swordsmanship improved by Kim
        Young-hoon, but it's definitely comparable to the Twelve Moves Severing
        Mountain Swordsmanship he created for me in the early days.'
      </p>
      <p>
        After trying to restore the spear technique, I turn my gaze to Buk
        Hyang-hwa, who is looking at me curiously.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I think I’ve seen this in Cheon-saek City? Is this 'martial arts'?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, it's a self-defense technique practiced by mortals. It's
        considered trivial by cultivators, but if mastered properly..."
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>I demonstrate the Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>"It's possible to reach such a level."</p>
      <p>Zoom!</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword flies in all directions, shooting down the creatures
        trying to invade the village.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, so the technique you have, Daoist Seo, was originally martial
        arts."
      </p>
      <p>"Well, not originally. It still is martial arts..."</p>
      <p>
        In truth, calling it martial arts is an understatement, given its now
        immense power.
      </p>
      <p>"Anyway..."</p>
      <p>I display the Formless Sword again.</p>
      <p>
        "I shared this with you so that if Miss Buk wants to create a magic
        artifact, you could refer to it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, you've been quite negative until now. Have you changed your mind?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Suddenly, I thought it wouldn't be bad to have a magic artifact that
        martial artists can use too."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, I see."</p>
      <p>She smiles slyly.</p>
      <p>
        "But what to do? I was planning to create a magic artifact suitable for
        Daoist Seo, not for martial artists."
      </p>
      <p>"Well, once it's complete, let's take a look at it later."</p>
      <p>I nod easily.</p>
      <p>
        'Now that she knows I'm a martial artist, a suitable magic artifact will
        be completed for martial artists eventually.'
      </p>
      <p>"Then, since we had fun at the festival, shall we get to work?"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        She takes out the portable workshop from her storage device and enters.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems she’s about to create the protective magic artifact for the
        village.
      </p>
      <p>Clang, clang, clang!</p>
      <p>
        Sounds of hammering resound from within the workshop, and I smile at her
        before heading back to the outskirts of the village.
      </p>
      <p>The night deepened, and from that day on,</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa and I grew a bit closer.</p>
      <p>A few days later.</p>
      <p>Boom, boom, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa brings out four totems.</p>
      <p>
        "These are protective magic artifacts designed to last about two years.
        If you install them at the four corners of the village, venomous
        creatures won't be able to invade."
      </p>
      <p>"Th-thank you, Immortal!"</p>
      <p>
        As soon as Buk Hyang-hwa's totems are installed at the village's four
        corners, they emit light and form a barrier covering the village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon after, the barrier shines and becomes transparent, and the totems
        also shine transparently, becoming invisible.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In case the cultivator clans come to the village and find the magic
        artifacts, I've added a hiding function to avoid any nuisance."
      </p>
      <p>"That's a good idea."</p>
      <p>
        I nod, and the next day, after confirming that the creatures couldn't
        properly invade the barrier, we decide to depart.
      </p>
      <p>"How can we ever repay this kindness, Immortals..."</p>
      <p>"It's nothing. And..."</p>
      <p>
        I briefly think of the folklore book held by the village child but shake
        my head.
      </p>
      <p>'It'll be better to come back and persuade her when she’s older.'</p>
      <p>"...We also had a good time at the festival."</p>
      <p>"It's been an honor."</p>
      <p>
        After exchanging farewells with the villagers and receiving their
        parting wishes, we ride the flying artifact and soar again.
      </p>
      <p>
        We venture through the mountainous terrains, making our way to Shengzi's
        bustling central capital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our travels take us to the borders of Shengzi, where it meets Yanguo,
        and into the heart of Yanguo's capital.
      </p>
      <p>
        We explore the myriad of places scattered throughout Yanguo and
        eventually find ourselves in the western expanse of Byeokra, among many
        places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa and I toured numerous locations and introduced her to
        unique cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yanguo was particularly chaotic due to the recent change in its ruling
        dynasty, but Buk Hyang-hwa seemed to enjoy its distinctive atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, we returned to the eastern part of Byeokra,</p>
      <p>To Cheon-saek city.</p>
      <p>It was a return after about four months.</p>
      <p>"I am truly sorry about what happened."</p>
      <p>
        In Cheon-saek City, Cheongmun Jung-jin and Cheongmun Ryeong were
        waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        "When the teleportation array activated again, it emitted a red light,
        so we didn't dare to enter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, we prayed for your souls, thinking you had perished, and
        flew back west to Cheon-saek City..."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong continues Cheongmun Jung-jin's words.</p>
      <p>
        "Fortunately, your father, Cultivator Buk, confirmed your survival and
        was waiting."
      </p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho speaks while holding a ring necklace around his neck.</p>
      <p>
        "As long as Hyang-hwa is alive, this ring connected to her norigae
        shines like this."
      </p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>One side of the ring is brightly lit.</p>
      <p>
        "...Anyway, I'm relieved that both you and Daoist Seo have returned
        safely. We were worried but now feel reassured."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm... Anyway, since it was my negligence as the clan head that led you
        into danger, I'll compensate you later."
      </p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa laughs and accepts the apologies of Cheongmun Jung-jin and
        Cheongmun Ryeong.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's okay. Thanks to that, I got to see the World’s End and tour
        various places, growing closer to Daoist Seo."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have no scruples either. Fortunately, I was able to survive using a
        hidden technique I had kept. Since I am alive, I won't dwell on the
        past."
      </p>
      <p>I also accepts his apology and decline the compensation.</p>
      <p>However, Cheongmun Jung-jin speaks more seriously.</p>
      <p>
        "Not to dwell on the past? The past doesn't disappear. Since I've indeed
        made a mistake, if you refuse compensation, let's agree that we'll
        fulfill one wish for the two of you when possible."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, let's do that."</p>
      <p>"I also won't refuse if the clan head insists."</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa and I nod, securing a favor from Cheongmun Jung-jin.</p>
      <p>
        After apologizing again, Cheongmun Jung-jin returns to the main house of
        the Cheongmun Clan due to clan matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now, let's start researching the formations again... or so I'd like to
        say..."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong glances at Buk Hyang-hwa and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "First, it seems you need time to rest from the journey, so let's start
        the research in three days."
      </p>
      <p>"Understood."</p>
      <p>"Yes!"</p>
      <p>
        She talks with Buk Joong-ho, unpacks, and pours out the magic artifacts
        she made during the journey, along with those she bought in Shengzi and
        Yanguo, at the magic artifact stores.
      </p>
      <p>
        I cast a simple perception-obscuring spell on the walls of Cheon-saek
        City and climb up, gazing at the endless desert in the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Yanguo, a city referred to a kind of administrative system and the
        region around it, but in Byeokra, a city meant just one city, so
        Cheon-saek City also referred to just this one city.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m lost in thought, feeling the bustling intent within this small city
        and the vast spiritual energy emanating from the desert in front of me.
      </p>
      <p>'Over the past four months...'</p>
      <p>Honestly, it was fun.</p>
      <p>
        And at the same time, I felt like I understood why Kim Young-hoon in my
        previous life told me to live a proper life.
      </p>
      <p>'My mind feels at ease.'</p>
      <p>I didn't realize it until I became closer to Buk Hyang-hwa.</p>
      <p>
        During this journey, getting closer to her, I discovered that being by
        her side significantly relaxed my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        It felt like a momentary escape from the unspoken pressure that had
        tightly bound me.
      </p>
      <p>But I control my emotions.</p>
      <p>'I can't go any further than this.'</p>
      <p>
        Parting with disciples, masters, friends, and countless Kim Young-hoons.
      </p>
      <p>The pain and agony I have experienced.</p>
      <p>
        If love between a man and a woman connects, how great would the pain of
        parting be?
      </p>
      <p>There is no love between friends.</p>
      <p>
        So, no matter how close we are, I can bury that pain in my heart and
        somehow move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if my emotions deepen further into love, I might not be able to move
        forward.
      </p>
      <p>In the worst case, my mind might even collapse.</p>
      <p>'I can't let that happen.'</p>
      <p>
        Let's leave the happy memories of the past four months just as they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's ensure these memories don't cross the line into more dangerous
        emotions.
      </p>
      <p>Just when I decided.</p>
      <p>Whoooosh!</p>
      <p>
        The sunset is visible from Cheon-saek City, and a familiar spiritual
        aura settles behind me.
      </p>
      <p>It’s Buk Joong-ho.</p>
      <p>He climbed up to the end of the city wall and sat next to me.</p>
      <p>"So, was your journey with the young lady enjoyable?"</p>
      <p>"Miss Buk’s bright nature made it far from boring."</p>
      <p>"Ha ha, I'm glad it was fun."</p>
      <p>He suddenly looks at me with a meaningful expression.</p>
      <p>
        "By the way, I noticed the change in how you address each other... The
        young lady calls you 'Daoist' instead of 'Cultivator.'"
      </p>
      <p>"Ah..."</p>
      <p>"And your way of addressing her changed a bit too."</p>
      <p>I cough lightly and say,</p>
      <p>
        "Please do not worry, I have no feelings beyond friendship for Miss Buk.
        Besides, I heard that Miss Buk has a destined partner chosen by her
        mother."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, that?"</p>
      <p>Buk Juoog-ho chuckles and looks at the setting sun.</p>
      <p>The sun is sinking beyond the horizon.</p>
      <p>
        "How do you know if the person coming to meet her will be a man or a
        woman? If it's a woman, they could just become sworn sisters, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha ha, so there's a fifty percent chance they're destined partners.
        Shouldn't I be cautious anyway?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Fifty percent chance, huh? So you haven't considered the possibility
        that they might not come to meet her at all?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes...?"</p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho smiles bitterly.</p>
      <p>
        "The young lady waits because it's her mother's last wish, but who knows
        about the other side? They might not keep the promise as earnestly."
      </p>
      <p>"Even so..."</p>
      <p>"Let me be frank."</p>
      <p>The sun dips below the horizon, and the sky turns purple.</p>
      <p>The surroundings begin to darken.</p>
      <p>"There is no destined partner for my daughter."</p>
      <p>"Excuse me?"</p>
      <p>
        "My ring necklace is connected to two magic norigae artifacts. One
        belongs to my daughter. If the owner of the artifact is alive, the other
        side of the ring necklace… Look here."
      </p>
      <p>He extends the ring necklace he is wearing towards me.</p>
      <p>
        "When the young lady was eleven, a few years after her mother's death,
        about eleven years ago from now, the light on the other side of the ring
        went out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her destined partner? There's no such person anymore. They're dead.
        Whether it was accidental, sudden, homicide, or suicide..."
      </p>
      <p>He says with a bitter smile.</p>
      <p>
        "If the owner changes, there should be a sign, but the fact that it's
        been years without any light means the likelihood is high that the other
        person died alone in a foreign land."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        "The young lady already knows. The norigae has been linked to the other
        pair since the beginning, so she must have known for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        She's just... using her mother's last wish as an excuse, not leaving
        this city to relive her memories with her mother."
      </p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho continues, looking at me.</p>
      <p>
        "I pride myself on my ability to judge people. That's why I agreed to
        the bet proposed by that kid Byeok Mun-seong last time."
      </p>
      <p>I recall the Qi Building cultivator from the Byeok clan.</p>
      <p>'He was full of impure intentions...'</p>
      <p>
        But I swallow the thought that came to mind and chose to stay quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In my opinion, you seem like a pretty decent person. Honestly, you look
        even better than the guy from the Byeok Clan. What about you? Do you not
        have feelings for the young lady?"
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>I remain silent for a moment, then give a bitter smile.</p>
      <p>
        "I apologize, but I have no feelings beyond friendship for Miss Buk."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        After looking at me thoughtfully for a moment, Buk Joong-ho stands up
        and dusts himself off.
      </p>
      <p>"My judgment is usually accurate. I'll keep an eye on this."</p>
      <p>Whoooosh!</p>
      <p>He heads back down the city wall, and I turn my head.</p>
      <p>
        The lights in various parts of Cheon-saek City had turned on,
        illuminating the entire city.
      </p>
      <p>I gaze endlessly at the city.</p>
      <p>The next day.</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa was kidnapped.</p>
      <p>"This is..."</p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho's face contorts with rage.</p>
      <p>He came to Cheongmun Ryeong, holding the red-flamed ring necklace.</p>
      <p>"Hyang-hwa is sending a distress signal right now! Please help!"</p>
      <p>"A distress signal?"</p>
      <p>"This is a signal used only when kidnapped..."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Buk Joong-ho's words, Cheongmun Ryeong's face also contorts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How dare they... Kidnapping a cultivator working with the Cheongmun
        Clan means they're disregarding our Clan's authority!"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong stands up indignantly.</p>
      <p>I also frown and rise from my seat.</p>
      <p>"Please explain what happened."</p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho gradually details the situation.</p>
      <p>When he woke up in the morning, Buk Hyang-hwa was not in her room.</p>
      <p>
        The room was unnecessarily disheveled, and there were traces of the
        previous night's formation being skillfully dismantled. Currently, a
        distress signal is being sent through the ring necklace connected to the
        norigae.
      </p>
      <p>'Who suddenly kidnapped her?'</p>
      <p>I heighten my senses.</p>
      <p>"First, please take me to Miss Buk's room."</p>
      <p>
        In the state of heightened demon senses, I decid to track the flow of
        spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>Whoooosh!</p>
      <p>In the middle of the desert.</p>
      <p>A flying artifact, shaped like a flying sword, is rapidly moving.</p>
      <p>
        On the artifact, Byeok Mun-seong is shaking off the sandstorm, holding a
        large sack over his shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Stay calm, Lady Hyang-hwa. Regardless of how much you struggle, you
        were kidnapped as part of my plan, prepared over the last four months. I
        don't know where you’ve been, but thanks to you, I had plenty of time to
        prepare and execute the plan swiftly and secretly."
      </p>
      <p>
        He says with a confident smile to Buk Hyang-hwa, who is wriggling inside
        the sack.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Especially since I scattered Subtle Hidden Fragrance, without special
        tracking demon beasts, they won't be able to track us. Those beasts are
        also handled by my Byeok Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've spoken to the elder handling demon beasts, and for the next seven
        weeks, no demon beast will be found in any market of Byeokra, so it's
        better to give up."
      </p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle...</p>
      <p>Yet the movement inside the sack do not stop.</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong looks southward with a sneering expression.</p>
      <p>
        "First, we'll head to Yanguo through a ship prepared at the southern
        coast. After staying in Yanguo for a few months, we'll head to the Byeok
        Clan's territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, it's in your best interest to follow my words. I can
        maximize your potential just like the Mad Lord did, so it won't be all
        bad for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ha ha, stop squirming. Even as a cultivator, you can't do much with your
        hands and feet tied and your spiritual power sealed..."
      </p>
      <p>Snap...</p>
      <p>"Hmm...?"</p>
      <p>Swoooosh!</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong is startled and looks back.</p>
      <p>
        The sack he is carrying burst open, and Buk Hyang-hwa, who was inside,
        falls out and drops downwards.
      </p>
      <p>"Wh-what...!"</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa uses a spell to land safely on the desert and glares at
        Byeok Mun-seong.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I never thought you, Sir Byeok, would resort to such lowly tactics."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, no..! I tied her hands and feet and even attached a seal to block
        her spiritual power..."
      </p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa raises her hand.</p>
      <p>A small beetle-shaped puppet is on her hand.</p>
      <p>
        The beetle puppet is just about to swallow a piece of talisman that
        looks like a fragment of a seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I made this inspired by Senior Mad Lord's puppets, and it's quite
        handy."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, no... You made that while tied up? All that wriggling was actually
        you making the puppet out of wood shavings...?"
      </p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong momentarily panicks but then laughs.</p>
      <p>
        "Indeed, Lady Hyang-hwa is impressive. I'm even more curious to see what
        happens when your potential blooms. Trust me, Lady Hyang-hwa! I really
        have a way to awaken your potential, just like the Mad Lord did!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you had come to me respectfully to discuss this, I would have
        listened, but this rudeness is too much to bear."
      </p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa coldly eyes Byeok Mun-seong and fiddles with her earring.
      </p>
      <p>The earring emits light and spits out a storage device.</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong's face contorts.</p>
      <p>
        "Ha, it’s a storage device... But just a few artifacts cannot bridge the
        power gap between Qi Building and Qi Refining…”
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, as Buk Hyang-hwa opens the device, dozens, hundreds of flying
        sword artifacts burst out, embedding themselves all around.
      </p>
      <p>Boom, boom, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        As Buk Hyang-hwa breathes life into them, the hundreds of flying sword
        artifacts begin to shine and levitate.
      </p>
      <p>"Damn it...!"</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong's face turns pale.</p>
      <p>
        "If you keep resisting, I'll have no choice but to take you by force!"
      </p>
      <p>"Hold your nonsense... Ah!"</p>
      <p>
        Just as Byeok Mun-seong is about to gather his Pure Spiritual Force,
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm!"</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Mun-seong and Buk Hyang-hwa simultaneously look in one direction.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble, rumble, rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Something colorless is stirring up a sandstorm, flying towards them.
      </p>
      <p>In the center of the sandstorm, a figure flickers.</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong frowns.</p>
      <p>
        "Damn, who's already chasing us? How did they find us? Without a
        tracking demon beast, it should be impossible..."
      </p>
      <p>
        He takes out a flying sword artifact from his storage device and shouts
        at the figure in the center of the sandstorm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Come on, come and see! I was once called the sword genius of the Byeok
        Clan..."
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh, boom!</p>
      <p>
        A colorless sword light whizzes past Byeok Mun-seong, creating a huge
        valley in the desert and causing an explosion in a sand dune far away.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>The ground shakes and sandstorms whirl in all directions.</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong's face turns deathly pale.</p>
      <p>"Is it, is it a Core Formation senior...?"</p>
      <p>"Ah...!"</p>
      <p>
        Conversely, Buk Hyang-hwa recognizes the owner of the sword light, and
        her face brightens momentarily.
      </p>
      <p>And in that brief moment when she’s distracted,</p>
      <p>"La, Lady Hyang-hwa, we must run!"</p>
      <p>"What... Let go of me!"</p>
      <p>
        With a face as white as a sheet, Byeok Mun-seong approached Buk
        Hyang-hwa, picked her up, and jumped onto the flying sword artifact.
      </p>
      <p>"Wait a moment!"</p>
      <p>
        "Lady Hyang-hwa, this is not the time to fight among ourselves. A Core
        Formation senior is furious! Running away is our only chance to
        survive!"
      </p>
      <p>"No..."</p>
      <p>Zoom!</p>
      <p>Byeok Mun-seong shoots into the sky, fleeing.</p>
      <p>
        As Buk Hyang-hwa forms hand seals, numerous flying sword artifacts
        embedded in the desert floor rise to chase them, but they can't keep up
        with Byeok Mun-seong, who is driving the artifact with Pure Spiritual
        Force.
      </p>
      <p>
        The owner of the sword light that had stirred up the sandstorm while
        chasing them, Seo Eun-hyun, looks at the two with a disbelieving
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>"This guy is causing trouble for everyone."</p>
      <p>
        He recalls what Buk Joong-ho said the previous night with a hollow
        laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Cultivator Buk, your judgment of people seems a bit off. To think you
        liked that guy...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun kicks off the ground and chases after Byeok Mun-seong with
        his Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hi, hiik! Senior! I don't know what's happening, but please, please
        spare me!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Unable to recognize Seo Eun-hyun's face obscured by the sandstorm, Byeok
        Mun-seong screams and runs away, while Seo Eun-hyun silently pursues
        him.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, the chase in the desert began.</p>
      <p>"Stop annoying me... Just stop right there...!"</p>
      <p>Boom, crash!</p>
      <p>Once again, Seo Eun-hyun strikes down with the Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        Another valley appears in the desert, and Byeok Mun-seong, overwhelmed
        with terror, pours all of his Pure Spiritual Force into the flying sword
        artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing the disaster caused by the mysterious Core Formation cultivator
        pursuing him, Byeok Mun-seong gasps for air.
      </p>
      <p>
        'A monster. A monster-like Core Formation cultivator is furiously
        chasing me...! If I don't run faster, I'll die...!'
      </p>
      <p>Kugugu Kugugu Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        And Byeok Mun-seong feels the 'mysterious Core Formation cultivator'
        gathering power.
      </p>
      <p>'I'm, I'm going to die...!'</p>
      <p>Something transparent, cutting through the air, flies towards him.</p>

      <p>Chapter 65: Violent Storm (5)</p>
      <p>Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation?</p>
      <p>I read the demon beast method from beginning to end.</p>
      <p>
        Whenever I came across an unfamiliar demon script, I asked Seo Ran for
        clarification, which helped me fully understand the manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This is completely different from the cultivation methods practiced by
        humans.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike humans who base their practices on the Five Elements, the demon
        race's methods are based on their inherent primal instincts .
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not about accurately classifying and manipulating the attributes
        contained in the heavenly and earth spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, it involves recklessly absorbing the mixed spiritual energy and
        then forcibly purifying it within the body, relying on the demon race's
        primal instincts to control it.
      </p>
      <p>That was the foundation of the demon beast methods.</p>
      <p>
        As I looked at the technique for indiscriminately absorbing the heaven
        and earth spiritual energy, I narrowed my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>"Isn't this similar to internal energy methods?"</p>
      <p>It was exactly that.</p>
      <p>
        The aspect of absorbing mixed spiritual energy was no different from a
        martial artist’s internal energy method.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference lay in the subsequent activation and purification of that
        energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If martial artists also activate and purify their internal energy,
        could they learn demon beast methods like the demon race?"
      </p>
      <p>Probably not.</p>
      <p>
        The enlightenment directly linked to demon beast methods is the
        sensation of ‘Earth’.
      </p>
      <p>The world of Yin and Yang.</p>
      <p>Martial artists who can perceive such things do not exist.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if a martial artist were to activate such energy within their
        body, they would literally tear apart and die.
      </p>
      <p>"It's dangerous."</p>
      <p>A literal perfect way to die.</p>
      <p>"But, it's worth learning."</p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, I had enough of a catalyst in my body to activate the
        energy.
      </p>
      <p>"Qi Refining 13th Star, Unified Origin completed."</p>
      <p>
        From this point, one needs to complete Qi Refining 14th Star, Infinite
        Spiritual Cloud, and then challenge the Qi Building stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, once someone completes Qi Refining 12th Star, merging all
        spiritual meridians into one, they are ready to enter Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Qi Refining 13th Star, it's essentially a preparatory stage for Qi
        Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Seo Ran Hyung, I'm going to seclude myself nearby to learn this
        method."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Alright, I also need to make preparations to break the barrier, so
        return within three years."
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving Seo Ran’s cave to cultivate, I went to a suitable rocky island
        nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        After digging a cave to avoid disturbances, I began my first attempt at
        Qi Building along with Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation.
      </p>
      <p>Qi Refining 13th Star, Unified Origin.</p>
      <p>
        A stage where the spiritual power formed in the spiritual meridians is
        concentrated into a single point in the dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        To reach the next stage, Infinite Spiritual Cloud, I needed to activate
        the point of spiritual power in the dantian and create a cloud of
        spiritual power inside.
      </p>
      <p>"I'll activate the point of Unified Origin!"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A thunderous vibration seem to come from within the dantian.</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>The point of Qi exploded.</p>
      <p>
        In that explosion, the energy within the Inner Core transformed and
        became purified.
      </p>
      <p>"But this isn't enough."</p>
      <p>
        After the explosion of the origin point, a cloud of spiritual power flew
        out.
      </p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>Qi Refining 14th Star.</p>
      <p>I entered the Infinite Spiritual Cloud stage.</p>
      <p>"With this cloud..."</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>I condense it.</p>
      <p>Continuously condensing the cloud until it reach its limit.</p>
      <p>"And now, I challenge Qi Building!"</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>A light seemed to ignite inside the dantian.</p>
      <p>Then the clouds began to contract.</p>
      <p>And when the contraction reached a critical point.</p>
      <p>Kuaang!</p>
      <p>A powerful explosion sounded as if thunder was striking within me.</p>
      <p>
        A blast far stronger than before, potentially lethal if it ruptures the
        dantian!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I drew energy from the Inner Core to prevent the blast from
        escaping, thereby preventing a lethal explosion.
      </p>
      <p>"Phew... Is it over?"</p>
      <p>
        The cloud of spiritual power, created by the eruption of the Unified
        Origin point, had lost all its energy and vanished.
      </p>
      <p>
        My cultivation, which had soared to Qi Refining 14th Star for a moment,
        had returned to the completed level of Qi Refining 12th Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can return to Qi Refining 13th Star by repeating the circulation of
        power.
      </p>
      <p>But for now, it was a drop in cultivation.</p>
      <p>My first attempt at Qi Building ended in failure.</p>
      <p>However,</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>In the center of the dantian.</p>
      <p>
        Due to the tremendous activation during the breakthrough, the power
        within the Inner Core became incredibly purified.
      </p>
      <p>
        "With this purified energy, I'll utilize the techniques of demon beast
        methods..."
      </p>
      <p>The Inner Core began vibrating.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, my consciousness began to tremble in sync with the
        vibration.
      </p>
      <p>
        "According to the technique in the method... I align my consciousness
        with the primal instincts described by the method."
      </p>
      <p>Grrrumble...</p>
      <p>My consciousness transforms.</p>
      <p>
        Just as Seo Ran’s consciousness covers his body in his own form, my
        consciousness, which had been enveloping me in a spherical form, began
        to morph into the shape of a dragon.
      </p>
      <p>"It's somewhat uncomfortable."</p>
      <p>
        After all, it was a human trying to learn the cultivation methods of a
        demon beast.
      </p>
      <p>No matter how careful I am, there is bound to be some disharmony.</p>
      <p>"It feels like wearing clothes that don't fit..."</p>
      <p>But still.</p>
      <p>
        After aligning my consciousness with the dragon's primal instincts, I
        began to manipulate the energy accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>Spiritual power began to surge outwards.</p>
      <p>
        The demon race’s methods do not progressively activate the spiritual
        meridians in an orderly manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, it recklessly races towards the final form of the method,
        without caring for anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practitioner's physique must change towards the final form of the
        method.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        As the surging spiritual power whirls outwards, the spiritual meridians
        inside my body gradually adapt and change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this transformation is complete, I should be able to use some of
        the abilities described in Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation.
      </p>
      <p>I will become much stronger.</p>
      <p>However...</p>
      <p>"Arrgh!"</p>
      <p>It's excruciatingly painful!</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps because it's not meant for humans to learn, every time my
        spiritual meridians forcibly adapt to Summoning Wind, Dragon
        Transformation, it feels as though they are tearing apart.
      </p>
      <p>I grit my teeth.</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>
        Inside the cave on the rocky island, as I clench my fists, handprints
        imprint on the cave walls.
      </p>
      <p>Gritting my teeth, I continue to cultivate the method.</p>
      <p>"I'll find... the next path!"</p>
      <p>The next realm of martial arts.</p>
      <p>
        And a way for someone without talent like me to ascend to Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>I will find it, no matter what!</p>
      <p>A year passed.</p>
      <p>Above the Black Wind Sea.</p>
      <p>On a certain rocky island.</p>
      <p>The quiet rocky island began to undergo changes.</p>
      <p>Creak, crack...</p>
      <p>The island started to shake.</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>The vibrations emanating from the island grew stronger, and then...</p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>The island began to split.</p>
      <p>Kuang Kuang Kuang</p>
      <p>The island shattered, and a dragon’s ascension began.</p>
      <p>
        From within the island, a powerful whirlwind surge, grinding the island
        from inside out.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Black rocks are torn apart and lifted into the air, swirling in all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>In the middle of the sea.</p>
      <p>A small whirlwind strikes.</p>
      <p>Roar!</p>
      <p>At the center of the whirlwind, there is a shadowy figure.</p>
      <p>
        From this being, the whirlwind drew water from the Black Wind Sea into
        the sky, scattering rain in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>At the center of the whirlwind.</p>
      <p>
        The shadowy figure inside draws in wind for a while before moving the
        whirlwind onto a nearby rocky island.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gradually, the wind dies down, and the figure inside uses the wind to
        step onto the rocky island.
      </p>
      <p>
        I move my consciousness, feeling the wind that placed me on the rocky
        island.
      </p>
      <p>
        My consciousness, which had transformed into a form akin to a sea
        dragon, returned to its spherical shape.
      </p>
      <p>"This is... Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation."</p>
      <p>Literally, a demon beast method that summons wind.</p>
      <p>
        I recall a familiar memory, thinking of the ability I had just
        displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the time I have been learning this method, a sense of déjà vu
        has been growing, which exploded when I finally used that ability.
      </p>
      <p>It was like...</p>
      <p>"Isn't this similar to what the Makli Clan uses?"</p>
      <p>The wind attribute spells used by the Makli Clan.</p>
      <p>They were so similar to this method that it was uncanny.</p>
      <p>
        The difference being, unlike the faint devilish aura in the wind called
        by the Makli Clan,
      </p>
      <p>
        Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation has a ferocious wildness in its
        winds.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was the difference between Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation
        and the wind techniques of the Makli Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Come to think of it... Most of the Makli Clan's spells are related to
        dragons."
      </p>
      <p>I used to think the Makli Clan's spells were of the Yin attribute.</p>
      <p>But thinking again.</p>
      <p>All the spells used by the Makli Clan.</p>
      <p>The river with the smell of decaying bodies.</p>
      <p>The whirlwinds where wind dragons and wind phoenixes appear.</p>
      <p>The spells that cover the sky in dark clouds to bring down rain.</p>
      <p>They are all related to water and wind.</p>
      <p>Water and wind.</p>
      <p>These are powers related to storms.</p>
      <p>And historically, dragons have been called the tribes of the storm.</p>
      <p>Especially the sea dragon clan, symbolizing the storm of the sea.</p>
      <p>
        "What is the relationship between the Makli Clan, a devilish clan, and
        the Sea Dragon Tribe?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, how is Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation related to the
        devilish arts of the Makli Clan?
      </p>
      <p>Could this demon beast method also be a kind of devilish art?</p>
      <p>"No, it's not a devil path method."</p>
      <p>
        Those who have learned devilish arts, especially those from the Makli
        Clan, emit an unpleasant devilish aura, but I don't feel that here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, as soon as I realized the connection between Summoning Wind,
        Dragon Transformation and the Makli Clan, I felt a certain repulsion.
      </p>
      <p>"The power is certainly outstanding..."</p>
      <p>
        It seems to suit me well, unlike other methods such as Earth Surpassing
        Path, as I achieved it much faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        But still, there's discomfort as if I’m wearing ill-fitted clothes, and
        the connection with the Makli Clan only amplifies this uneasiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...I'm not sure. No point in worrying about it now. Better to ask Seo
        Ran later for a clear explanation."
      </p>
      <p>After shaking off these thoughts, I pondered what to do next.</p>
      <p>Should I go to Seo Ran's cave?</p>
      <p>Or should I return to the mainland?</p>
      <p>
        ‘After all, Seo Ran said it’s fine as long as I return within three
        years. I've just barely learned the basic abilities of Summoning Wind,
        Dragon Transformation. Should I go to Seo Ran to receive further
        guidance and enhance my mastery of the method?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or should I go to the mainland to search for traces of the Golden Divine
        Heavenly Thunder Sect in the western mountains of Shengzi during the
        remaining time?’
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Jin Byuk-ho, there are some records left by the Golden
        Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect in the western mountains of Shengzi.
      </p>
      <p>I might find them if I search.</p>
      <p>"What should I do?"</p>
      <p>After pondering for a while,</p>
      <p>I determined where to spend the remaining two-plus years.</p>
      <p>"Let's head to the mainland."</p>
      <p>I turn towards Shengzi.</p>
      <p>
        Though Seo Ran said the barrier would be safe, it’s an unpredictable
        situation after all. Considering the possibility of losing my life
        unexpectedly, gathering more information is prudent.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        As I activate Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation again, my Inner Core
        responds, releasing energy.
      </p>
      <p>Wind swirls around me, lifting me into the air.</p>
      <p>I fly north from the Black Wind Sea towards Shengzi.</p>
      <p>Shengzi Is a nation governed by numerous cultivator clans.</p>
      <p>
        Because of this, there are many regulations set by these clans that are
        deeply rooted throughout the country.
      </p>
      <p>I found myself caught in one of these numerous rules.</p>
      <p>In the Western Capital City of Shengzi, near the western mountains,</p>
      <p>
        I was surrounded by several high-level Qi Refining cultivators in a
        certain clan's territory.
      </p>
      <p>"Flying is prohibited? What do you mean?"</p>
      <p>
        "Hmph, you didn’t you know the laws of Shengzi when you came here? Is
        that even possible? In various parts of the country, flying is
        prohibited to prevent large-scale battles among the members of different
        cultivator clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you violated the rules, you must immediately pay a fine of 100
        spirit stones."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>I ask the stern-looking green-robed man.</p>
      <p>
        "According to my knowledge, the place where I flew was slightly outside
        the territory of your clan. Do I still have to pay the fine?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmph! What are you talking about? The place where you flew was clearly
        above our clan's territory. If you don't pay the spirit stones, you will
        have to serve time in our clan's prison."
      </p>
      <p>'This is preposterous...'</p>
      <p>It's not that I'm completely ignorant of the laws of Shengzi.</p>
      <p>I've been here in a previous life, so how could I not know?</p>
      <p>
        It's true that there are no-fly zones, but the place where I flew was
        just outside one of these zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this green-robed man is now trying to unfairly impose a fine on
        me, taking advantage of the fact that I'm a foreigner.
      </p>
      <p>'I don't have any spirit stones on me right now...'</p>
      <p>Not even the common storage devices that cultivators carry.</p>
      <p>What should I do?</p>
      <p>After pondering for a moment, I ask him,</p>
      <p>
        "What if I can't pay right now but promise to leave it at the front of
        my clan?"
      </p>
      <p>"Your clan?"</p>
      <p>
        At my words, the green-robed man and the other cultivators looked at
        each other.
      </p>
      <p>"Aren't you a loose cultivator?"</p>
      <p>"No, I belong to a clan."</p>
      <p>"Hmm, which clan is it?"</p>
      <p>I smile and introduce my 'clan.'</p>
      <p>"The Makli Clan."</p>
      <p>Silence fell among the crowd at my words.</p>
      <p>
        "...What nonsense... Cultivators of the Makli Clan all wear blue robes,
        don't they?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, I had no choice but to come to Shengzi secretly."</p>
      <p>
        "Secretly? What business does someone from the Makli Clan have in
        Shengzi, to come in secret?"
      </p>
      <p>"I cannot say. It's a clan secret after all."</p>
      <p>
        "This guy. The more I look, the more suspicious he seems. Pretending to
        be from the Makli Clan, huh?"
      </p>
      <p>"Pretending?"</p>
      <p>I chuckle lightly.</p>
      <p>"Do you still think it's pretending after seeing this?"</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        I activate Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation, gathering the wind
        around me.
      </p>
      <p>"I am indeed an elder of the Makli Clan!"</p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>A whirlwind blows around, sweeping up the green-robed cultivators.</p>
      <p>"Ah, this guy! He's attacking us!"</p>
      <p>"That, that's indeed a technique of the Makli Clan!"</p>
      <p>"This scoundrel from the Makli Clan is attacking us!"</p>
      <p>
        Those cultivators, maybe because they were law enforcers of Shengzi,
        managed to withstand the wind of Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation
        with their high-level Qi Refining skills. They even showed signs of
        counterattacking with other spells.
      </p>
      <p>However, this is all a deception.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        While the whirlwind covers the surroundings and obscures vision, I
        release a Gang Sphere from my palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gang Sphere spins and splits into three, hovering above my hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Listen well, I am Makli Hyun, elder of the Makli Clan! Do not block my
        path!"
      </p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>
        Amidst the dusty wind obscuring everyone's vision, the three Gang
        Spheres fly towards the green-robed cultivators at the speed of light.
      </p>
      <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>
        The Gang Spheres strike the cultivators' defensive spells and magic
        artifacts, causing great shock but not killing them.
      </p>
      <p>"Ahh...!"</p>
      <p>"This power..."</p>
      <p>"He's a Qi Building cultivator... an elder!"</p>
      <p>
        One of the green-robed cultivators hastily infuses spiritual power into
        a talisman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facing the talisman that seems to transmit messages, the green-robed
        cultivator yells with a pale face.
      </p>
      <p>
        "An elder of the Qi Building stage from the Makli Clan has infiltrated
        Shengzi across the border! The Makli Clan of Yanguo has violated the
        treaty!!"
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Using the wind, I shake off the cultivators and quickly fly towards the
        western mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Treaty violation! The cultivator clans of Shengzi will formally protest
        against the Makli Clan!!"
      </p>
      <p>‘Let them protest.’</p>
      <p>
        I leave the yelling green-robed cultivators behind and fly through the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>The western mountains are close.</p>
      <p>Once I get inside, they won't be able to catch me easily.</p>
      <p>A protest against the Makli Clan is none of my concern.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Flash, flash!</p>
      <p>
        Whether it was the effect of the green-robed cultivator's message
        talisman or not, I saw green lights below starting to chase after me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those Qi Refining cultivators of the clan began to gather below me,
        forming an unusual formation.
      </p>
      <p>From the looks of the formation, it isn’t an easy one to deal with.</p>
      <p>"A formation for Qi Building cultivators?"</p>
      <p>
        I pretended to be a Qi Building cultivator using the strength of the
        Ultimate Pinnacle, but I am only at the extreme level of Qi Refining.
        Getting caught in the formation would be troublesome.
      </p>
      <p>"I can't get caught."</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Gang Qi escapes from my palm.</p>
      <p>The Gang Qi splits into three and is then reabsorbed into me.</p>
      <p>"Triple acceleration."</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        My consciousness, transformed into the form of a sea dragon, becomes
        even more akin a sea dragon, and the wind of Summoning Wind, Dragon
        Transformation becomes even stronger.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Wrapped in stronger winds, I fly even faster towards the western
        mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, I’m out of the range of the formation set by the Qi Refining
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>"Are the western mountains ahead?"</p>
      <p>I take in the sight of the western mountains, preparing to hide.</p>
      <p>At that moment...</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>A fearsome presence is felt from behind.</p>
      <p>"That is..."</p>
      <p>A tingling sensation in my limbs.</p>
      <p>A Qi Building cultivator.</p>
      <p>
        Still a dot in the distance, but I know how quickly it will approach.
      </p>
      <p>"Tch, I need to push it a bit."</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>I increase the wind speed.</p>
      <p>
        The whirlwind surrounding me grows larger, showing its ferocity that
        connects the sky and the earth.
      </p>
      <p>Drip-</p>
      <p>Blood drips from my mouth.</p>
      <p>
        But I ignore it and expand Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation even
        more.
      </p>
      <p>The whirlwind of a Qi Building cultivator!</p>
      <p>
        A huge dragon’s ascension absorbs the surrounding dirt and dust,
        clouding the area.
      </p>
      <p>Puff!</p>
      <p>I break out of the dragon’s ascension and form a hand seal.</p>
      <p>"Ha!"</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>The whirlwind moves.</p>
      <p>
        The ashen whirlwind flies towards the chasing Qi Building and
        green-robed cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Qi Building cultivator is startled and quickly casts a spell to
        counterattack.
      </p>
      <p>I wipe the blood from my mouth, concentrating my consciousness.</p>
      <p>
        I had excessively forced out spiritual power equivalent to Qi Building
        at the level of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such an attack can only be used once, and using the Gang Sphere might
        wrongly implicate Kim Young-hoon, who is active in Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>So, I will create a disturbance with this attack and then escape.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        My sword energy cuts through the air, and my consciousness vanish,
        concealed by the Hidden Consciousness Technique.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        I quickly descend towards the western mountains, forming a hand seal.
      </p>
      <p>"Earth Surpassing Path!”</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>The earth opens up to receive me.</p>
      <p>
        I fall into the ground beneath the western mountains using the Earth
        Surpassing Path.
      </p>
      <p>
        The earth's spiritual energy flowing through the western mountains will
        maximize my Earth Surpassing Path.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover,</p>
      <p>
        "Argh! This scum from the Makli Clan! Everyone, chase after him! If he's
        from the Makli Clan, he must have fled into the sky!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Their prejudice against the Makli Clan didn't apply to me hiding
        underground.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hide beneath the ground, watching the Qi Building cultivator from the
        green-robed clan destroy my whirlwind and fly off into the wrong
        direction in the sky, and wipe off the remaining blood from my mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now, let's go find the records of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder
        Sect."
      </p>
      <p>A few months later.</p>
      <p>
        I found the archive at Shattered Heaven Peak in the western mountains,
        where Jin Byuk-ho mentioned the records of the Golden Divine Heavenly
        Thunder Sect were located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, what is the relationship between the Golden Divine Heavenly
        Thunder Sect and the Ascension Gate?
      </p>
      <p>Creak-</p>
      <p>I open the door of the archive and enter.</p>

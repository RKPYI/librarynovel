      <p>Chapter 137: Baihui (4)</p>
      <p>The magic artifact shop is just as I remember it.</p>
      <p>It’s still the same scene from that time.</p>
      <p>Clang, clang, clang!</p>
      <p>
        From inside the workshop, the sound of her crafting something can still
        be heard.
      </p>
      <p>I look around the magic artifact shop for a while, waiting for her.</p>
      <p>
        After a bit, the door of the workshop opens, and a person walks out.
      </p>
      <p>She is wearing the same pure white robe as in my memory.</p>
      <p>It’s her.</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. What brings you here?"</p>
      <p>"I am..."</p>
      <p>Before I can even say anything.</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the jade-colored norigae hanging at my waist starts to tremble
        violently.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, the norigae at her waist also starts to shake.</p>
      <p>A perfectly identical pair of magic artifacts.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, now there were not two, but three, thanks to the item that
        transcended time.
      </p>
      <p>But their function still seems to resonate.</p>
      <p>"That is..."</p>
      <p>Her eyes widened.</p>
      <p>"Are you... that person?"</p>
      <p>She looks at me with wide eyes, holding her norigae.</p>
      <p>I can't speak.</p>
      <p>What should I say?</p>
      <p>What can I say?</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        The norigae in her hand shines brightly and suddenly turns into a bright
        brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>"...!!"</p>
      <p>
        And then, the light flows into the norigae I am holding and merges into
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one I brought is the norigae of Buk Hyang-hwa, transcending time.
      </p>
      <p>In other words, it’s hers from the future.</p>
      <p>
        As if the world does not allow two completely identical things to exist,
      </p>
      <p>
        Her norigae from the past is sucked into the one I am holding and
        absorbed.
      </p>
      <p>Fzzzzt...</p>
      <p>
        Soon after, the norigae in my hand, having absorbed Buk Hyang-hwa's,
        shines even brighter.
      </p>
      <p>It appears to have become firmer and more mysterious than before.</p>
      <p>
        'By overlapping the same artifacts... has the grade of the dharma
        treasure risen?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Lost in thought at the mysterious phenomenon, Hyang-hwa too looks
        astonished.
      </p>
      <p>
        "So, when the same artifacts meet, this happens. I've learned something
        new. Hmm, but... that norigae was also my mother's heirloom..."
      </p>
      <p>She seems somewhat sad.</p>
      <p>Her expression, gestures, actions, habits, breathing, heartbeat...</p>
      <p>All of it, is her.</p>
      <p>She is alive.</p>
      <p>
        "By the way, since you've come all this way with the norigae, why don't
        you come in and have some tea?"
      </p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>I realize from her tone of voice.</p>
      <p>She is not.</p>
      <p>The person I loved.</p>
      <p>Drip, drip...</p>
      <p>
        She is not the her who shared the same time with me, the same feelings,
        the same pain.
      </p>
      <p>"You... don't know me."</p>
      <p>"Yes...?"</p>
      <p>I absentmindedly wipe away my tears and speak.</p>
      <p>"No, it’s nothing"</p>
      <p>I have anticipated this.</p>
      <p>My disciples, my master, countless Kim Young-hoons.</p>
      <p>
        I have been preparing for this moment since the time I couldn't meet
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now that it's actually happening, I can't help but feel bitterly
        cold.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing her stirred a tempest in my heart.</p>
      <p>Perhaps that's why.</p>
      <p>I hand her the norigae.</p>
      <p>
        "Your mother's heirloom was absorbed, so I can't keep it. Please take
        it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Really? It's fine for me, but are you sure you can just give away the
        token of fate?"
      </p>
      <p>Token of fate, huh.</p>
      <p>Do you know?</p>
      <p>
        The person your mother intended to connect you with is already married
        and dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'real' token is probably buried with him by Wolryang's hand in his
        grave.
      </p>
      <p>"...I heard you were to marry the person who brought the norigae."</p>
      <p>
        Feeling an indescribably complex emotion, I place the norigae in her
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>"I'm sorry, but I will give you this norigae and leave."</p>
      <p>"Yes...?"</p>
      <p>"I..."</p>
      <p>I look at her face and feel relieved.</p>
      <p>At the same time, sad looking into her eyes.</p>
      <p>My Her is alive, but she doesn't know me.</p>
      <p>
        If only we had died at the same time that day, we could have been
        together in the afterlife.
      </p>
      <p>"I already have someone I love."</p>
      <p>Holding back tears is easy.</p>
      <p>But holding back emotions is difficult.</p>
      <p>If someone else reads my intent, they might have cried with me.</p>
      <p>
        "Thank you for keeping the token while waiting for fate. But I no longer
        need that token. Please take it and live freely. You don't have to live
        waiting anymore."
      </p>
      <p>"Wait a moment..."</p>
      <p>
        Barely suppressing my boiling emotions, I turn my back and leave the
        magic artifact shop.
      </p>
      <p>A brief but intense encounter.</p>
      <p>But I force myself to step away and turn my back.</p>
      <p>If I don't turn my back now,</p>
      <p>I might fall there and cling to her, weeping madly.</p>
      <p>I would never leave this place again.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>I leave the magic artifact shop and board the Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>"Quickly, go anywhere."</p>
      <p>[Alright.]</p>
      <p>Whirring!</p>
      <p>
        Ghostly mist envelops the Nether Crossing Ship, and we immediately move
        to another place.
      </p>
      <p>'Who was that man?'</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa recalls the man who suddenly came to give her his token
        and left.
      </p>
      <p>She was bewildered.</p>
      <p>
        For years, the signal from the connected magic artifacts had not been
        detected, then suddenly signals started appearing from two places.
      </p>
      <p>
        She thought the magic artifact was broken, but when she checked it was
        fine, leaving her confused.
      </p>
      <p>And a few days ago, one of the two signals disappeared.</p>
      <p>
        Unbeknownst to her, that was when Wolryang had placed the norigae in a
        shrine to honor his great-grandson's spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing the signal return to one, she felt a subtle trembling and
        tension.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed like he might come to find her at any time.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, the pair her mother had made for her could have died long
        ago, and a third person could have found the magic artifact.
      </p>
      <p>But she had been unable to sleep for several days.</p>
      <p>And today.</p>
      <p>The 'him' she had been fantasizing about had come.</p>
      <p>
        Surprisingly, he spoke the story of the token related to her norigae.
      </p>
      <p>She was shocked.</p>
      <p>Doesn’t that mean he is the match her mother had mentioned?</p>
      <p>
        Realizing this, she felt a strange fluttering and trembling feeling.
      </p>
      <p>But contrary to her various expectations.</p>
      <p>'He' simply gave her his norigae and ran away.</p>
      <p>Saying he already had someone he liked.</p>
      <p>"...."</p>
      <p>In truth, she had somewhat anticipated this outcome.</p>
      <p>
        Her mother had wished for her to form a bond or marry the person with
        the norigae.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in reality, there was no guarantee the other party would honor the
        promise.
      </p>
      <p>Even if he didn't keep the promise.</p>
      <p>
        The fact that he crossed the desert to deliver the norigae to inform her
        of this means his character is respectable enough.
      </p>
      <p>'He seemed like a good person...'</p>
      <p>
        She sighed, thinking of the late-stage Qi Refiners who had been
        following her around lately.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If only there were someone with even half the character of that man, I
        would have considered it...'
      </p>
      <p>They were just immature late-stage Qi Refiners.</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa looked outside for a moment and then at the norigae.</p>
      <p>Her norigae and his had merged, emitting a more mysterious aura.</p>
      <p>
        Her mother, lacking a spiritual root, had some skill in crafting magic
        artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps due to her lineage from the Gongmyo Cheon-saek’s bloodline, her
        mother, who had the talent for making magic artifacts, did produce quite
        good-quality ones. However, Buk Hyang-hwa was well aware of her mother's
        skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been a long time since she surpassed her mother with her own
        talents
      </p>
      <p>And she thought about the norigae her mother had made.</p>
      <p>
        'Two magic artifacts merging into one? And this strange, sacred aura...
        Did my mother really make this? It seems more like a dharma treasure
        than a magic artifact?'
      </p>
      <p>As she curiously examined the norigae.</p>
      <p>Drip...</p>
      <p>"...Huh?"</p>
      <p>Hyang-hwa suddenly wiped her eyes.</p>
      <p>"Did something get in my eye...?"</p>
      <p>Thump, thump...</p>
      <p>Somehow, she felt a pain in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        And, looking at the norigae, she suddenly felt overwhelmed with emotion.
      </p>
      <p>"Wait a moment."</p>
      <p>Drip, dripping...</p>
      <p>The tears wouldn't stop.</p>
      <p>Somehow, emotions she didn't even know she had surged up.</p>
      <p>
        Hyang-hwa felt her heart trembling wildly as she thought of the man who
        had just left.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, no..."</p>
      <p>She had to catch him.</p>
      <p>Somehow, she strongly felt this urge.</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>
        With trembling legs, she stumbled and rushed towards the entrance of the
        magic artifact shop.
      </p>
      <p>But he was nowhere to be seen in the vicinity.</p>
      <p>Whooosh...</p>
      <p>
        In the clear desert sky, strangely, a black ghostly mist dispersed into
        the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if possessed, she boarded a flying magic artifact and rose into the
        sky to look around.
      </p>
      <p>He was nowhere to be found.</p>
      <p>
        With trembling hands holding the norigae, feeling the tears falling from
        her chin, she thought.
      </p>
      <p>'Why?'</p>
      <p>Her heart ached so much.</p>
      <p>'What is this feeling?'</p>
      <p>She bit her lip.</p>
      <p>'I must find him.'</p>
      <p>She had to ask him.</p>
      <p>What is this feeling?</p>
      <p>What has he done to her?</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa wiped away the sudden tears and resolved.</p>
      <p>'I will find him.'</p>
      <p>No matter where he is, no matter where he goes.</p>
      <p>She will find him and ask.</p>
      <p>That was her decision.</p>
      <p>[Who did you meet?]</p>
      <p>"...Just an acquaintance."</p>
      <p>[Is that so.]</p>
      <p>Song Jin speaks to me.</p>
      <p>
        [Why don't you try learning the Ghostly Arts of the Black Ghost Valley?
        The death energy accumulated in various parts of your soul... and the
        intense emotional fluctuations you just displayed... They seem highly
        compatible with the sect's techniques.]
      </p>
      <p>"...I'll decline learning devilish arts. Oh, and..."</p>
      <p>I decided to receive something else from Song Jin.</p>
      <p>
        "Do you have a method called 'Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll' in the
        Black Ghost Valley?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [Yes, it exists. It's a cultivation method that no one practices, always
        sitting in the corner of our archives. How do you know about it?]
      </p>
      <p>
        "I heard about it before. Could you give me that manual? I would like to
        learn it."
      </p>
      <p>It’s only at the level of Qi Building methods.</p>
      <p>A method that can resonate with my dharma treasure.</p>
      <p>Now that I have given the norigae to Hyang-hwa,</p>
      <p>I want to resonate more deeply with the Colorless Glass Sword.</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin readily hands over the Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll, and
        after I memorize its essence, I speak to him.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you. And I have a few more requests..."</p>
      <p>I moved to another place with Song Jin's Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>My emotions are boiling too fiercely.</p>
      <p>I wanted to do something quickly to calm them down.</p>
      <p>In the southeast of Byeokra.</p>
      <p>The Byeok Clan resides here.</p>
      <p>
        I arrive at the top of the Byeok Clan's main house with the Nether
        Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>'Maybe I should use the Blood Body here...'</p>
      <p>
        I raise the Blood Body controlled by my consciousness, resembling Yuan
        Li.
      </p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        Through the Blood Body, I create a mask of devilish energy on its face,
        making it look exactly like Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li’s Blood Body flies into the sky and lands above the Byeok Clan's
        estate.
      </p>
      <p>Soon after,</p>
      <p>
        Feeling the commotion of the Nether Crossing Ship and the presence of
        Yuan Li,
      </p>
      <p>Byeok Cheon-gi and the elders of the Byeok Clan hurry out.</p>
      <p>"Lo-Lord Bloodwood, what brings you here?"</p>
      <p>
        Byeok Cheon-gi quickly sets up a soundproof barrier around us and asks.
      </p>
      <p>I speak through the Blood Body's mouth.</p>
      <p>[Bring all the spirit stones of your clan here.]</p>
      <p>"Yes, yes?"</p>
      <p>
        [Did you not hear me? I command you to bring all the spirit stones of
        your clan.]
      </p>
      <p>"But, how..."</p>
      <p>[Enough talk.]</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        Through the Blood Body, I sense the Five Elements Blood Curse Banners
        embedded in the heads of Byeok Cheon-gi and clan elders.
      </p>
      <p>
        'So he’s been operating in secret for hundreds of years, embedding them
        all in their heads.'
      </p>
      <p>Zzzt!</p>
      <p>"…!"</p>
      <p>"Aaaghhhh!"</p>
      <p>"Agaaaaghh!"</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps due to extracting only about one-twentieth of the power of the
        Five Elements Blood Curse Banners,
      </p>
      <p>
        The Core Formation cultivators of the Byeok Clan are in agonizing pain,
        but they somehow manage to endure.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Too much talk. This is for a greater plan, so stop complaining and
        bring all the spirit stones.]
      </p>
      <p>"Gh... Alright...!"</p>
      <p>Soon after,</p>
      <p>
        Under Byeok Cheon-gi's command, the cultivators of the Byeok Clan bring
        millions of spirit stones and place them in front of the Blood Body.
      </p>
      <p>
        "These are all the spirit stones in our main house. There are about ten
        percent as many stones scattered across our territories, but it will
        take too long to gather them..."
      </p>
      <p>[That's enough. This will do. And one more thing...]</p>
      <p>I speak through the Blood Body.</p>
      <p>
        [You mentioned discovering relics of the Jo Clan and researching them,
        right?]
      </p>
      <p>"...Yes."</p>
      <p>
        [Bring all relics of the Jo Clan, especially those related to the
        devilish path that sacrifices human lives, whether they are cultivators
        or mortals, as well as poisonous manuals or techniques, here. It's
        better not to replicate them recklessly.]
      </p>
      <p>"...Yes."</p>
      <p>
        As I menacingly move the Five Elements Blood Curse Banners, Byeok
        Cheon-gi replies with trembling lips.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, they bring the requested items to the Blood Body.</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        I open the Blood Body's storage device and receive everything, loading
        the spirit stones onto the Nether Crossing Ship..
      </p>
      <p>[That's enough. Stay quiet for now. I will contact you again.]</p>
      <p>"Understood. Please take care, Lord Bloodwood!"</p>
      <p>
        The Core Formation cultivators of the Byeok Clan bow to the Blood Body,
        and I control it to board the Nether Crossing Ship, asking Song Jin to
        take me to the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>'This should make up for the betrayal in the past life.'</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of the moment when Byeok Cheon-gi chose to throw the
        Heaven-Sealing Talisman instead of the Heaven-Striking Talisman to kill
        Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>Frankly, it was infuriating.</p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>'Be grateful for having a son like Byeok Mun-seong.'</p>
      <p>
        I decided to let the Byeok Clan off this lightly because of Byeok
        Mun-seong's presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        'They're not a completely depraved devilish clan like the Makli Clan,
        after all...'
      </p>
      <p>
        And since I have also recovered all the devilish arts and refining
        methods discovered in the Jo Clan's ruins, they wouldn't develop like
        the Makli Clan.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>As I’m sorting through these thoughts,</p>
      <p>The Nether Crossing Ship already arrives at the Cheongmun Clan.</p>
      <p>
        I once again move Yuan Li's Blood Body and reveal myself to the
        Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Behind Yuan Li, I unleashed the aura of Treading Heaven Beyond the Path,
        pressing down on the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon after, Cheongmun Jung-jin, the head of the Cheongmun Clan, and the
        clan's elders appear.
      </p>
      <p>"Are, are you a Nascent Soul senior?"</p>
      <p>[Yes.]</p>
      <p>"What graces us with your presence to the Cheongmun Clan?"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin asks with a serious expression, looking at the Blood
        Body.
      </p>
      <p>I move the Blood Body's mouth to speak.</p>
      <p>
        [I have noticed someone of interest. A cultivator named Cheongmun Ryeong
        from the Cheongmun Clan is quite knowledgeable in the way of
        Understanding before Breakthrough. He is known as one of the three great
        experts in Qi Building, and his fame is widespread. I have read his
        books and I’m impressed. He truly is a master of Understanding before
        Breakthrough knowledge. Therefore, I have come to support him and his
        clan, the Cheongmun Clan.]
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        I unload the several million spirit stones from the Byeok Clan in front
        of the Cheongmun Clan's courtyard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin's eyes widened in shock at the sudden influx of
        enough spirit stones for the entire clan.
      </p>
      <p>"Th-thank you…"</p>
      <p>[And.]</p>
      <p>I continue.</p>
      <p>
        [I will ask the owner of this Nether Crossing Ship, Senior Song Jin of
        Black Ghost Valley, to make an arrangement.
      </p>
      <p>
        From now on, if you provide spirit stones, you will be granted the right
        to ride this Nether Crossing Ship. Take the cultivators of the Cheongmun
        Clan who mainly practice Wood attribute methods to the Serving Command
        Palace frequently to accumulate spiritual power.]
      </p>
      <p>
        I pass on my insights of Wood attribute methods and a scroll that can
        break through the prohibitions of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing my words through the Blood Body, Cheongmun Jung-jin, the Core
        Formation elders, and even the Qi Building elders of the Cheongmun Clan
        who had come out to listen to our conversation bow deeply to me.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Seni—"</p>
      <p>[Enough!]</p>
      <p>I shout, cutting off the council of elders.</p>
      <p>Especially Cheongmun Ryeong, who was slowly bowing his head.</p>
      <p>'As expected...'</p>
      <p>This is why I had the Blood Body deliver it instead of myself.</p>
      <p>If I had to hear 'Senior' and receive thanks from Cheongmun Ryeong…</p>
      <p>It would be too painful.</p>
      <p>But still, hearing it through the Blood Body is heart-wrenching.</p>
      <p>
        [That's enough. No need for thanks. It's an order. Now... take care. Do
        your best to support Cheongmun Ryeong, so he can reach the Core
        Formation stage.]
      </p>
      <p>After quickly conveying my wishes,</p>
      <p>
        I board the Nether Crossing Ship and ask Song Jin to take me to Shengzi.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The ghostly mist envelops the Nether Crossing Ship once more, and we
        sail through space.
      </p>
      <p>"Huh…"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin chuckles, looking at the pile of spirit stones before
        him and Cheongmun Ryeong, who looks bewildered.
      </p>
      <p>"Hehehe…"</p>
      <p>He approaches Cheongmun Ryeong and pats his shoulder.</p>
      <p>
        "Ryeong, your efforts have not been in vain. These gifts from the
        respected senior are because they were impressed by your writings and
        theories…"
      </p>
      <p>"…Is that so."</p>
      <p>
        "Stand tall, Ryeong! Everyone listen up! The spirit stones that have
        been gifted are under Ryeong's name. One-third of them will be used for
        Ryeong. Any objections?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The elders and late-stage Qi Refining cultivators of the Cheongmun Clan
        answer loudly.
      </p>
      <p>"None!"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin laughs heartily.</p>
      <p>
        "First, organize these spirit stones! And Ryeong, I'll help you as best
        as I can, so let's focus on advancing to the Core Formation stage from
        today onwards. That senior hopes for your advancement to Core Formation
        and gave us so many gifts. We can't disappoint him!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong, after a moment of silence, speaks with a trembling
        voice.
      </p>
      <p>"…Thank you."</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>The Nether Crossing Ship arrives above the Jinlu Clan in Shengzi.</p>
      <p>
        ‘The Jinlu Clan is the last of the traitor clans of the Western Three
        Kingdoms.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I have crushed the Makli Clan and extracted spirit stones from the Byeok
        Clan.
      </p>
      <p>'But what about the Jinlu Clan?'</p>
      <p>
        The Byeok Clan was spared to some extent because of Byeok Mun-seong,
        despite my resentment against them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Makli Clan was destroyed not only due to my resentment but also
        because of their usual cruel deeds.
      </p>
      <p>But the Jinlu Clan...</p>
      <p>There is neither the usual resentment nor the cruel actions.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, there are no good memories like with Byeok Mun-seong.
      </p>
      <p>'So then...'</p>
      <p>
        After some contemplation, I descend upon the Jinlu Clan with Yuan Li's
        Blood Body.
      </p>
      <p>Shortly after.</p>
      <p>
        Jinlu Yeon-cheon, the head of the Jinlu Clan, and Core Formation elders
        appear.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh my, what brings Lord Bloodwood to this far western end?"</p>
      <p>
        Jinlu Yeon-cheon approaches the blood puppet with a captivating voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I activate the Blood Curse Banners embedded in her and the other elders
        through the Blood Body.
      </p>
      <p>Zzzt!</p>
      <p>"Ugghhh...!"</p>
      <p>"Agrhhhh!"</p>
      <p>In an instant, their entire Core Formation force is incapacitated.</p>
      <p>[From now on.]</p>
      <p>I speak through the Blood Body’s mouth.</p>
      <p>
        [I will inform you of the forces in the Northern Grasslands and the
        Eastern States with the Five Elements Blood Curse Banners embedded in
        them. Go around the North and East, and collect two million spirit
        stones, or equivalent value, from each of them.]
      </p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>I summon a Blood Curse Banner through the Blood Body’s hand.</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>
        The Blood Curse Banner becomes a red flag tattoo that lands on Jinlu
        Yeon-cheon's hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Using this, you can activate the Five Elements Blood Curse Banners
        embedded in individuals three times. Find them, collect the spirit
        stones under my name, and deliver all of them to the Cheongmun Clan
        under my name.]
      </p>
      <p>"To the Cheongmun Clan, you say?"</p>
      <p>
        [Yes, and this is for when everything is over. Open it after you've
        completed your task. Inside the letter are instructions for your next
        steps. If you open this letter before completing the task, a curse
        written in the letter will activate, alerting me, so do not open it
        recklessly.]
      </p>
      <p>"...Yes, I will heed your command."</p>
      <p>I hand her the letter with the curse attached.</p>
      <p>
        Jinlu Yeon-cheon carefully places the letter in her storage artifact.
      </p>
      <p>[Carry out my command.]</p>
      <p>Inside the letter.</p>
      <p>
        'Once everything is over, dedicate everything of the Jinlu Clan to the
        Cheongmun Clan and become a subordinate force to them.'
      </p>
      <p>That is the command I wrote.</p>
      <p>It’s also a punishment for the Jinlu Clan.</p>
      <p>'She will probably like it.'</p>
      <p>A command that would make Jinlu Yeon-cheon happy.</p>
      <p>A command that would make everyone happy.</p>
      <p>'And now, the last part...'</p>
      <p>I fly to a village with the Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>It’s a familiar village.</p>
      <p>'A village that suffered from the tyranny of a centipede demon..'</p>
      <p>This time, I land in the village with my actual body.</p>
      <p>The villagers are wide-eyed seeing me descend from the sky.</p>
      <p>I ask the village head.</p>
      <p>"Beyond that peak, there lives a centipede demon, correct?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, that demon has been taking our young men and women..."</p>
      <p>"I'll take care of it. In return, do me a favor."</p>
      <p>"Wh-what is the favor?"</p>
      <p>"In this village..."</p>
      <p>
        Using internal energy, I sketch the face of a child to whom I read the
        book of fairy tales in my past life.
      </p>
      <p>"Is there a child who looks like this?"</p>
      <p>"Oh, that would be the bookshop owner's daughter. Yes, she's here."</p>
      <p>"I have a request for her. Please guide me to her."</p>
      <p>I followed the village head's guidance to find the child.</p>
      <p>'That book, it certainly wasn't ordinary.'</p>
      <p>There must be some hidden secret in it.</p>
      <p>
        In my previous life, consumed with anger, I hadn't thought to delve
        further into its secrets.
      </p>
      <p>But in this life, it seems worth investigating.</p>
      <p>
        The owner of the village bookshop is an elderly scholar, and the child,
        known as his daughter, is playing with dolls nearby.
      </p>
      <p>I approach them and ask.</p>
      <p>"Do you, by chance, have a book of fairy tales?"</p>
      <p>The scholar's response makes me jolt.</p>
      <p>
        "...A book of fairy tales? We don't deal with such childish books here."
      </p>
      <p>"...What?"</p>
      <p>
        I explain the contents of the fairy tales, asking if they have a book of
        such stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing my description, the scholar, looking annoyed, goes inside
        and rummages through his books for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There's nothing like that here. And stories about the Ender? I have
        lived and studied in this region for twenty years but have never heard
        of such traditional fairy tales. Although I often read books with
        similar tales and sayings to children, I have never come across a book
        mentioning a Supreme Deity or the Ender."
      </p>
      <p>
        Translator Notes: It feels like Seo Eun-hyun is resolving his karmic
        ties. Though he’ll probably speedrun this every cycle in the future, it
        does remind me of the immortal among mortal arcs in other Xianxia.

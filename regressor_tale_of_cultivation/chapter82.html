      <p>Chapter 82: Martial Artist</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon always found Seo Eun-hyun irritating.</p>
      <p>"I am a man without talent."</p>
      <p>When was it?</p>
      <p>
        It was after Kim Young-hoon had reached the Ultimate Pinnacle and
        sparred with Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, to Kim Young-hoon, Seo Eun-hyun seemed inferior in the realm of
        martial arts talent, especially in reading the flow of martial arts or
        creatively disrupting that flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, ironically, Seo Eun-hyun had reached the Ultimate Pinnacle before
        Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        After falling into this world, Seo Eun-hyun had conversed with the
        monstrous Heaven Being cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, since waking up in Yanguo after an old hunchback opened
        a spatial rift, had various martial arts and linguistic knowledge in his
        head, so he assumed Seo Eun-hyun was similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Seo Eun-hyun reached the Five Energies Converging to the Origin
        faster, using just his martial arts knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>He even helped pull Kim Young-hoon up by teaching him martial arts.</p>
      <p>
        Considering his colleagues' immense talents and his own natural sense
        for martial arts, he accepted this reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        After proudly reaching the Ultimate Pinnacle, he found out that Seo
        Eun-hyun had reached the extreme of that realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon thought Seo Eun-hyun, though different in approach, had a
        natural talent too.
      </p>
      <p>However, what Seo Eun-hyun said after their fight was astonishing.</p>
      <p>He claimed he had no talent.</p>
      <p>
        "If he has no talent, what does that make me? Someone who’s not even
        garbage?"
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon nearly burst out with those words but held back.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Seo Eun-hyun was simultaneously mastering cultivation methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not just one element with Heavenly Spiritual Root, but all Five
        Elements!
      </p>
      <p>
        His pace in mastering these methods was similar to the promising
        late-stage Qi Refining cultivators of the Jin Clan, where Kim Young-hoon
        had briefly stayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even those late-stage Qi Refining cultivators hadn't mastered
        multiple elemental methods simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon reaching the Grand perfection of their stage, they typically stole
        Qi Building pills from the Makli Clan and transitioned to Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Seo Eun-hyun seemed to be forcing his breakthrough with all Five
        Elements of a Qi Refining method.
      </p>
      <p>Yet he continued both his martial arts and cultivation training.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon also rose early and slept only after the moon was high.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Seo Eun-hyun used a technique to forcefully stay awake for ten days
        straight without sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon tried the same technique, but once the effects wore off,
        he spent days like a complete wreck.
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't something ordinary willpower could achieve.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun lacked the martial arts sense Kim Young-hoon had.</p>
      <p>
        But he certainly had something else, something different, something Kim
        Young-hoon lacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Everything I've done is part of my life. Just as heaven, earth, and man
        influence each other, what I've done influences my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Kim Hyung understands his life, it will melt into your martial arts."
      </p>
      <p>
        These were Seo Eun-hyun's words during an enlightening conversation
        after a spar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Kim Young-hoon felt that Seo Eun-hyun, though younger, seemed
        like an elder who had lived a much longer life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, Kim Young-hoon could organize his clues for the next
        realm through Seo Eun-hyun's words.
      </p>
      <p>Years passed.</p>
      <p>'This won't do.'</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon gripped his saber.</p>
      <p>
        Initially, he felt he could reach the extreme at any time and easily
        reach every realm.
      </p>
      <p>He had talent, after all!</p>
      <p>
        He instinctively refrained from sharing this, but his martial arts
        talent stemmed from a certain 'sense' he felt upon arriving in this
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following this sense, he believed he would eventually reach the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>But it wasn't so.</p>
      <p>Decades after reaching the Ultimate Pinnacle.</p>
      <p>
        He trained and retrained, following Beyond the Path to Heaven Martial
        Arts, which described the realm beyond the Ultimate Pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>Yet, the wall was still too thick and impenetrable.</p>
      <p>'What must I do...'</p>
      <p>Even with his talent, the next wall seemed too high and rugged.</p>
      <p>It appeared unreachable.</p>
      <p>
        One late night, while wielding his saber, Kim Young-hoon heard a strange
        sound from Seo Eun-hyun's training cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his hearing, honed to a delicate extent from having an Inner Core,
        he could hear what was happening in Seo Eun-hyun's cave, dozens of yards
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't the usual sound of Seo Eun-hyun training in martial arts or
        cultivation in the middle of the night.
      </p>
      <p>Crackling…groaning...</p>
      <p>Sounds like gasping for air.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon entered the Shattered Heaven Peak cave, thinking
        something had happened.
      </p>
      <p>'Has he used that technique to awaken his mind and train again?'</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun often used the technique to drive away sleep and train for
        days, occasionally fainting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, after fainting, Seo Eun-hyun would quickly get up, regain
        consciousness, realize he had fainted, and then properly sleep to
        recover his body.
      </p>
      <p>'It seems he fainted longer this time...'</p>
      <p>Recently, Seo Eun-hyun had indeed been pushing his body harder.</p>
      <p>
        A cultivator could know their own lifespan, and Seo Eun-hyun mentioned
        there wasn't much left for him.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon went deep into the cave to find Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>
        There, he found Seo Eun-hyun, fainted while standing with his sword
        drawn.
      </p>
      <p>'This state again.'</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun had fainted during training, foaming at the mouth and eyes
        rolled back.
      </p>
      <p>"Tsk, he should take it easy."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon was about to wake Seo Eun-hyun when suddenly...</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun, still fainted, swung his sword.</p>
      <p>While unconscious, he continued to move.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun refined the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship from start to
        finish, then began practicing cultivation in a seated position.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was astounding how he could complete his regular training regimen
        even while unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>His body, his life, his energy remembered it.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon stood dumbfounded, watching Seo Eun-hyun train while
        unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun continued until dawn.</p>
      <p>
        Only when the morning sun rose did Kim Young-hoon come to his senses and
        wake Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>"Eun-hyun, you fainted again. Wake up."</p>
      <p>"...Ah, ah...ugh!"</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun regained consciousness, clutching his heart, and looked
        around.
      </p>
      <p>"...Ah, I see. Sorry, Kim Hyung. I should rest my body."</p>
      <p>"...Eun-hyun."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon looked at Seo Eun-hyun and asked.</p>
      <p>"Why push yourself so hard? Isn't this too much?"</p>
      <p>To that, Seo Eun-hyun bitterly laughed and said,</p>
      <p>
        "I have no talent. Without talent, in order to reach high places, one
        must be willing to die even in the evening."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>The willingness to die even in the evening.</p>
      <p>
        After saying that, Seo Eun-hyun collapsed into his sleeping quarters,
        but to Kim Young-hoon, it felt like a heavy blow to his head.
      </p>
      <p>'What have I been doing all this time?'</p>
      <p>For the first time, he felt lazy.</p>
      <p>While he had endlessly strived for the next realm,</p>
      <p>'Maybe... what I've been doing was just self-satisfaction.'</p>
      <p>
        Without the readiness to die, had he ever thought beyond his current
        state?
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon clenched his saber until it nearly shattered.</p>
      <p>
        'The founder of Beyond the Path to Heavens Martial Arts ascended only
        after being ready to die, what have I been doing?'
      </p>
      <p>He felt wronged.</p>
      <p>Regretted the time wasted.</p>
      <p>
        'As a martial artist, I tried to reach the next realm without even being
        ready to face death...?'
      </p>
      <p>He was too ashamed to lift his face.</p>
      <p>
        He returned to his training ground, grasped his saber, and took his
        stance.
      </p>
      <p>"Right, let's die."</p>
      <p>With the resolve to die, he aimed to surpass.</p>
      <p>Until now, he had only verbalized enlightenment.</p>
      <p>
        From now on, he will be different. Ready to face life and death, he
        would truly strive!
      </p>
      <p>From that day, Kim Young-hoon stopped sleeping.</p>
      <p>He didn't eat.</p>
      <p>
        He concentrated his talent to the extreme, focusing solely on his saber.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forgetting the flow of time, the sensation of pain, he lost himself in
        the joy of martial arts training.
      </p>
      <p>Then, he reached Beyond the Path to Heaven.</p>
      <p>Surpassing Radiant Saber of Beyond the Path to Heaven.</p>
      <p>
        The name Surpassing Radiant Saber contained his wish to return home
        faster than light.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it also meant surpassing a person who had loomed like a mountain in
        Kim Young-hoon's heart.
      </p>
      <p>That person was Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon finally stands, wielding what he had built, facing the
        man before him.
      </p>
      <p>'No talent?'</p>
      <p>Will he even know much of a deception that is to those below him?</p>
      <p>'You have strived, Seo Eun-hyun.'</p>
      <p>Far more than Kim Young-hoon can imagine.</p>
      <p>How shocked he was the first time he observed his heart essence.</p>
      <p>Striving as if willing to die in the evening.</p>
      <p>
        The heart essence Kim Young-hoon had while striving for 50 days is basic
        for Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Even if you truly lack talent, with that much effort, you deserve
        confidence.'
      </p>
      <p>No, he should be confident.</p>
      <p>
        That's the respect someone who has reached that level can show to those
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Kim Young-hoon is rather pleased when Seo Eun-hyun, having
        obtained the Formless Sword, looks down on him.
      </p>
      <p>‘I have no advantage other than speed?’</p>
      <p>Right.</p>
      <p>If it’s Seo Eun-hyun, he deserves to say so.</p>
      <p>
        He has every right to say so, having worked so hard that it pains even
        the onlookers.
      </p>
      <p>'But, Seo Eun-hyun.'</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon takes his stance, gripping his saber.</p>
      <p>'Even if speed is all I have, I intend to surpass you this time.'</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun's martial arts.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun's will.</p>
      <p>The effort he has put in!</p>
      <p>'I will surpass them!'</p>
      <p>That's what it means to be a martial artist!</p>
      <p>"Here I go!"</p>
      <p>Time seems to split.</p>
      <p>
        Golden radiance swirls as Kim Young-hoon's saber targets Seo Eun-hyun's
        neck.
      </p>
      <p>'I can't give Formless Sword any chance to react!'</p>
      <p>Strike first to gain the advantage!</p>
      <p>
        In the next instant, Seo Eun-hyun's intent resounds in his
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sword technique he uses, along with the Formless Sword, lunges
        forward.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Layered Mountains.</p>
      <p>The Formless Sword spreads in all directions like thorns.</p>
      <p>A sword free of all shapes and constraints!</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun is surrounded by an invisible barbed fence.</p>
      <p>'Tear apart!'</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon quickly retreats.</p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>
        Just by approaching and retreating, he is already scratched all over.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun's intent resonates again.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Landscape Painting.</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword Gang spreads in all directions, slashing everything
        around.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Formless sword, extending and shrinking in unpredictable orbits,
        spreads destruction within a radius of about 18 meters.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun's technique continues.</p>
      <p>
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Mountain and Valley Transformation,
        Mountain Tiger.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword Gang burrows below and erupts, collapsing the
        terrain, and converges towards Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, merging with the Surpassing Radiant Saber, turns into a
        beam of light, dodging the Formless Sword Gang, then retreats to a
        stable ground to confront Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun emphasizes the basics. In the Severing Mountain
        Swordsmanship dispersed by the Formless Sword, none goes against martial
        principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each is true to the foundation and essence of Severing Mountain
        Swordsmanship.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Joy of Mountains and Peaks.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun, using the Formless Sword, starts rushing towards Kim
        Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>The Formless Sword Gang roams freely, charging at Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>'I can't dodge.'</p>
      <p>He needs to penetrate through.</p>
      <p>Severing Vein Saber Method, Mountain Bird!</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon turns into a ray of light again.</p>
      <p>Speed is a tremendous advantage in combat.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun had provoked him, but if the Surpassing Radiant Saber's
        potential is fully realized, it can potentially far surpass the Formless
        Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        The essence of the Surpassing Radiant Saber is in the instant, while the
        essence of the Formless Sword is its trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The colorless trajectory, changing freely in the void and striking down,
        is unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>'But change means there will be strengths and weaknesses.'</p>
      <p>If there's a strong part, there must be a weak part.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon concentrates.</p>
      <p>
        He needs to analyze the formless trajectory in an instant and approach
        Seo Eun-hyun by flowing through the weakest part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, Seo Eun-hyun will have an overwhelming advantage at a
        distance due to his larger consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>He has to get close for a chance to win.</p>
      <p>Whizz!</p>
      <p>
        Severing Vein Saber Method, Mountain Bird unfolds, and Kim Young-hoon
        dances with the Golden Saber Gang.
      </p>
      <p>Graceful.</p>
      <p>
        With light-footed grace, he strikes the weakest flow of the Formless
        Sword Gang.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        When the weakest flow of the Formless Sword Gang collides with Kim
        Young-hoon's Surpassing Radiant Saber...
      </p>
      <p>"....!"</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon narrowly avoids internal injury.</p>
      <p>'Insane, this is the weakest part?'</p>
      <p>
        Even though he didn’t face it head-on but glided to divert its
        trajectory,
      </p>
      <p>The difference in power is clear.</p>
      <p>
        'Is this what it means to transition from Qi Refining to Qi
        Building...?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Eun-hyun's entire body emits Gang Qi, endlessly powering the
        Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>'What a monster!'</p>
      <p>
        Yet, Kim Young-hoon does not stop Mountain Bird and continues to glide
        past Seo Eun-hyun's Sword Gang, approaching him like a dancing Golden
        Peng
      </p>
      <p>The Peng pierces through the formless storm to face its core.</p>
      <p>Severing Vein Saber Method, Mountain Wind!</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>A ray of light, with the fastest technique, shoots forth.</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword, which had been scattered in all directions until a
        moment ago, suddenly transforms.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Echoing Valley.</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword whirls like a fearsome storm, gripping the ray of
        light.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trajectory of the Surpassing Radiant Saber is caught by the Formless
        Sword, spun around, and then hurled back at Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon narrowly dodges his own rebounding attack and moves
        behind Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rebounding ray of light passes where Kim Young-hoon had just been
        and stikes the cliff behind him.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The cliff fractures like a spiderweb, and a thunderous explosion
        resounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shivers run down Kim Young-hoon's forearm as he prepares for the next
        attack.
      </p>
      <p>'Normally, it wouldn't have such power...'</p>
      <p>
        The power mixed and rebounded by Seo Eun-hyun transformed into that
        formidable force.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon fee;s like he is single-handedly fighting a storm.</p>
      <p>'Severing Vein Saber Method alone won't win.'</p>
      <p>He needs to mobilize all his talent.</p>
      <p>If he doesn’t evolve in this instant, he is doomed!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's mind races on ways to win, and he creates a new martial
        art.
      </p>
      <p>Movement Technique, Seven Color Evasion!</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's movements change, and the Surpassing Radiant Saber
        morphes into seven colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next instant, Kim Young-hoon's form splits into seven, attacking
        Seo Eun-hyun from above, below, and all sides, penetrating the blind
        spots of the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Bouldered Cliff!</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword coalesces around Seo Eun-hyun, spinning like a
        whirlpool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Offense and defense became one, and the size of the Formless Sword
        creates a storm-like effect in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Six of Kim Young-hoon's forms burst immediately, but his real form,
        penetrating the blind spot, swings his saber at Seo Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>'This strike isn’t enough.'</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword will morph to protect Seo Eun-hyun in the next
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the weakest part of the Formless Sword is difficult to cut through
        with the Surpassing Radiant Saber's attack power.
      </p>
      <p>'Next martial art!'</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's face turns red as if burning.</p>
      <p>Blood rushes to his brain.</p>
      <p>A new martial art is created.</p>
      <p>
        A technique to surpass the speed and power of the Surpassing Radiant
        Saber in one instant.
      </p>
      <p>Forty-four Continuous Strikes.</p>
      <p>
        In a flash, forty-four slashes are unleashed, concentrated with
        efficiency beyond Layered Mountains, amplifying the force immensely.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun choses to counterattack instead of defending.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Flowing Ridge.</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword smoothly pierces through Kim Young-hoon's new martial
        art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally, Flowing Ridge is a move to softly stab and make defense
        difficult, not known for its attack power.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when Flowing Ridge collides with the Forty-four Continuous
        Strikes, magnified dozens of times more powerful than the original
        Surpassing Radiant Saber, Kim Young-hoon spits blood and is blown away.
      </p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>
        While being flung away, Kim Young-hoon kicks off the air to regain his
        stance, laughing bitterly.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Even after creating a martial art to divert 30% of its power, I end up
        like this.'
      </p>
      <p>Even a slight brush can shatter his bones entirely.</p>
      <p>'The versatility of the Formless Sword is almost infinite.'</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon ponders.</p>
      <p>'But Seo Eun-hyun's imagination isn't infinite.'</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Seo Eun-hyun's Formless Sword is adapted to Severing Mountain
        Swordsmanship and changes only within that framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I need to create a martial art specifically to counter Severing
        Mountain Swordsmanship!'
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>'Let's play!'</p>
      <p>
        A golden radiance flashes, and in an instant, it strikes Seo Eun-hyun,
        with both exchanging hundreds to thousands of classes per second.
      </p>
      <p>Sword marks, saber scars fly in all directions.</p>
      <p>
        Every time Seo Eun-hyun uses Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Kim
        Young-hoon references several martial arts on the spot to counter it,
        and they are evenly matched for a while.
      </p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's injuries multiply.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Seo Eun-hyun remains unscathed.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon, despite gasping for breath, still smiles.</p>
      <p>"Indeed..."</p>
      <p>An overwhelming disadvantage.</p>
      <p>An insurmountable mountain!</p>
      <p>That is the man before him.</p>
      <p>"The best!"</p>
      <p>He is annoyed with Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>
        How can someone who reaches this realm not believe in themselves, hiding
        behind a lack of talent!
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's head spins to the point of overload, and blood bursts
        from his nose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating three martial arts simultaneously, he approaches Seo Eun-hyun
        again.
      </p>
      <p>Their eyes meet.</p>
      <p>Seo Eun-hyun is also smiling.</p>
      <p>500 years.</p>
      <p>
        For 500 years, Seo Eun-hyun has never truly surpassed Kim Young-hoon
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially the Kim Young-hoon, who after 50 years, has always become a
        monster.
      </p>
      <p>Both feel the same way at this moment.</p>
      <p>"I shall!" (Seo Eun-hyun)</p>
      <p>"I will!" (Kim Young-hoon)</p>
      <p>The two martial artists exclaim simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Qi Mountain Heart Heaven</p>
      <p>Severing Vein Saber Method Variant, Mountain Earthquake</p>
      <p>Applied Martial Art, Mountain Goblin</p>
      <p>Created Martial Art, Tearing the Void</p>
      <p>Created Martial Art, Twelve Light Streams Slash</p>
      <p>The streak of radiance and the void shines brightly.</p>
      <p>"Win!" (Seo Eun-hyun)</p>
      <p>"Surpass!" (Kim Young-hoon)</p>
      <p>
        The next moment, the Formless Sword swells to over sevenfold its size,
        engulfing the space with its formidable presence, while the Surpassing
        Radiant Saber, with unerring precision, targets Seo Eun-hyun's unseen
        vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, the world erupts in a blinding inferno of light.</p>
      <p>
        It’s easy to tell who’s speaking at the end in Korean but the nuances
        don’t translate well into English so I added in brackets who the
        speakers are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also I think this chapter highlights one of the beauties of time loops
        that I personally enjoy greatly. When the insurmountable wall is now
        looking at the MC as the wall.

      <p>I will kill him.</p>
      <p>I will kill that creature.</p>
      <p>
        Fiercely, savagely, I will shred his body into ten thousand pieces and
        kill him.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        As I fly through the air, kicking the void, swarms of black curses pour
        out around me like ants, leaving their mark.
      </p>
      <p>I follow his trail with the demon senses active.</p>
      <p>It isn't hard to track him down.</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy of the places he had passed through are all
        unstable and flickering, and the scent of blood is blatantly strong.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I absorb the Yin Soul Ghost Incantations swirling around me. I turn them
        into spiritual power, converting that spiritual power into internal
        energy for my Formless Sword, and then accelerate the Formless Sword
        even further.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The sound of breaking air rumbles, and the impact of me rushing through
        the void causes the surrounding sand to scatter and turn into a
        sandstorm.
      </p>
      <p>
        With bloodshot eyes, I run towards an area with a strong scent of blood.
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>It’s a desert tribe located south of Cheon-saek City.</p>
      <p>This tribe too has turned into a sea of blood.</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li is continuing his blood sacrifice, gradually regaining his
        Nascent Soul cultivation, and his speed is starting to increase.
      </p>
      <p>I won't be able to catch up at this rate.</p>
      <p>He is likely to keep getting faster.</p>
      <p>What should I do?</p>
      <p>As I ponder, a brown flying dharma treasure zooms towards me.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        I block the dharma treasure with my Formless Sword and glare at the
        person who shot it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You... Is it you! Are you the one who massacred this tribe under the
        Gongmyo Clan?"
      </p>
      <p>
        He looks to be an elder of the Core Formation stage of the Gongmyo Clan.
      </p>
      <p>His face bloodshot, beholds the massacred tribe and shouts at me.</p>
      <p>"You! Answer me!"</p>
      <p>I swing my Formless Sword without a word.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Although weaker than when I was fully prepared for facing Yuan Li, I’m
        still a formidable Core Formation level force.
      </p>
      <p>
        The elder of the Gongmyo Clan is startled by my power and withdraws his
        dharma treasure, glaring at me.
      </p>
      <p>I look at him with empty eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "If you saw what just happened, you would know. The energy of the blood
        sacrifice in this city and the energy of my strike are completely
        different... I am also chasing the monster responsible for this. This
        creature killed all my dear ones."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But, but... There's no proof that you're not involved in this! Do you
        know how precious these resources are? Compensate immediately..."
      </p>
      <p>Kuaang!</p>
      <p>
        I send another Formless Sword attack towards the annoying elder of the
        Gongmyo Clan.
      </p>
      <p>A small valley forms right next to him.</p>
      <p>"Noisy, shut up. Before I kill you."</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Every time I open my mouth, hundreds of curses gush out, filling my
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The curse spells are countless, filling the area around me, appearing
        akin to black mist surrounding me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ugh, how can I trust the words of a devilish cultivator like you who
        practices such devilish arts...!"
      </p>
      <p>"...This is not a devilish art."</p>
      <p>Cough, cough!</p>
      <p>
        Feeling a tightness in my chest, I cough, and more curses flood out of
        my mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It’s a method... a method of curse incantations that only realizes
        one's own pain to understand pain. Yes, a method that sacrifices no one,
        a method that doesn't need to sacrifice anyone... This is not a devilish
        art...! I didn't sacrifice anyone...!"
      </p>
      <p>I scream, clutching my head.</p>
      <p>Hack, hack!</p>
      <p>Black curses continue to cascade every time my mouth opens.</p>
      <p>
        "But why...! Why are they taking them from me...! Why...! Why! Why!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I cry black tears mixed with curses, holding my head, emitting a black
        mist of curse spells from my whole body.
      </p>
      <p>"Why!!!"</p>
      <p>
        It’s then that the elder of the Gongmyo Clan, who has been watching me
        go mad, flinches.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        From far away, in the direction of Cheon-saek City, a blue light
        flashes, and someone flies over.
      </p>
      <p>"Who!!! Who killed Ryeong! Who!!!"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin.</p>
      <p>The head of the Cheongmun Clan.</p>
      <p>
        He seems to have rushed over in a hurry after hearing Cheongmun Ryeong's
        message, but it was already too late.
      </p>
      <p>His eyes meet mine amidst the black mist.</p>
      <p>"You are... You! What is this about! Explain!"</p>
      <p>"Ah, the head of the Cheongmun Clan. Do you know him?"</p>
      <p>"A friend of Cheongmun Ryeong."</p>
      <p>
        "I suspect this person is the monster behind this massacre. That black
        thing... If that's not devilish arts, then what is?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "...I will vouch for his identity. Ryeong who was in Cheon-saek City is
        also dead. This person was Ryeong's friend, so it can't be him."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin vouched for my identity, and I explained the
        situation to him with empty eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "So, you're saying a Nascent Soul old monster pretending to be of Core
        Formation in the Heaven-Treading Desert has started this massacre now
        that the Heavenly Being seniors have ascended...!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I nod, and both Cheongmun Jung-jin and the Gongmyo Clan elder's faces
        grow serious after hearing my explanation.
      </p>
      <p>The elder of the Gongmyo Clan says gravely,</p>
      <p>
        "We must catch him! If what this person says is true, then this Yuan Li,
        the Nascent Soul old monster, is not only regaining his power by
        collecting his Blood Spirit but also absorbing the lives of each city,
        becoming stronger than his original cultivation! Now is the weakest he
        will be, we must catch and kill him!
      </p>
      <p>But Cheongmun Jung-jin looks unwell.</p>
      <p>
        "What do you intend to do? That Nascent Soul old monster is gradually
        regaining his Nascent Soul strength and becoming faster and stronger,
        while we can barely match up, let alone catch him!"
      </p>
      <p>The elder of the Gongmyo Clan takes out a communication device.</p>
      <p>
        "I will contact the elders and clan head! You too, contact the elders of
        the Cheongmun Clan and gather the Core Formation cultivators! If that
        Yuan Li went to the Northern Grasslands as well, the Core Formation
        cultivators of those tribes must be urgently chasing him by now!"
      </p>
      <p>He declares,,</p>
      <p>
        "We must immediately gather all the Core Formation cultivators of the
        continent and kill that Nascent Soul old monster!"
      </p>
      <p>The two Core Formation cultivators sent messages to their clans.</p>
      <p>
        “…Do you have any idea how that Yuan Li, the Nascent Soul cultivator,
        might move?”
      </p>
      <p>I shake my head.</p>
      <p>
        I can follow the traces, but his speed is increasing, widening the gap.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I remember the location of the castle where Yuan Li resided.</p>
      <p>
        “...I don't know where the old monster will go, but I know where he will
        return.”
      </p>
      <p>“What…! Really?”</p>
      <p>
        I recall the black castle I had seen and the corresponding location, and
        share this information with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, then let’s inform the elders of the clan and the head of the Byeok
        Clan. The whole continent should know that a Nascent Soul old monster
        has started his rampage. I’ll also send messages to the Jin Clan of
        Yanguo and the Makli Clan.”
      </p>
      <p>
        "Shengzi will be informed by the clans of Yanguo, and the Gongmyo Clan
        will contact the lords of the Eastern States beyond the Heaven-Treading
        Desert. I don’t know if the Nascent Soul old monster has already visited
        there, but at least we can warn them."
      </p>
      <p>
        “The Cheongmun Clan will also get in contact with the chiefs of the
        Northern Grasslands.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin and the elder of the Gongmyo Clan, with serious
        expressions, took out their communicators and made contacts.
      </p>
      <p>After a while, both nodded.</p>
      <p>
        "With this, the whole continent should be informed. Let's go east to the
        coordinates this person has given, where the Nascent Soul old monster
        will return!"
      </p>
      <p>
        After speaking, the elder of the Gongmyo Clan flies towards the
        Heaven-Treading Desert using the Flying Escape Technique.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        "You should go back and take care of the remains of those who left. You
        were a friend of Ryeong, and his remains too…"
      </p>
      <p>"Let's go together."</p>
      <p>I gaze at Cheongmun Jung-jin.</p>
      <p>"I also have business with that creature."</p>
      <p>
        “…You don’t understand, do you? With your skill, merely at the Qi
        Building stage…”
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>I swing my Formless Sword, showing my true strength.</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin stares at me in surprise.</p>
      <p>
        "I apologize for hiding my strength. I am of Core Formation prowess.
        Please let me take part in avenging Cheongmun Ryeong."
      </p>
      <p>“…Understood.”</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin nods, and I fly with him to Yuan Li’s castle.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>“There’s a formation here.”</p>
      <p>
        Me, Cheongmun Jung-jin, and the elder of the Gongmyo Clan observe the
        giant sandstorm in the middle of the Heaven-Treading Desert.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Seeing this formation, it's likely that within is the residence of the
        Nascent Soul old monster."
      </p>
      <p>“I don’t know much about formations…”</p>
      <p>
        Both look a bit perplexed, and I silently step forward to start
        analyzing the formation.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, do you know how to handle formations?"</p>
      <p>
        "It’s fortunate indeed. After all, you did research formations with
        Ryeong…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of Cheongmun Ryeong, Cheongmun Jung-jin clenches his fists
        tightly.
      </p>
      <p>Days pass.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>In the middle of the Heaven-Treading Desert.</p>
      <p>Here, Core Formation cultivators began to gather.</p>
      <p>
        Core Formation cultivators from the Northern Grasslands, dressed in the
        attire of their tribes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Core Formation cultivators from beyond the eastern direction of the
        Heaven-Treading Desert, ruling as lords.
      </p>
      <p>The Three Clans of Byeokra.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin, head of the Cheongmun Clan, and his six Core
        Formation elders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Head of the Gongmyo Clan, Gongmyo Ryeong, and his six Core Formation
        elders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Head of the Byeok Clan, Byeok Cheon-gi, and his five Core Formation
        elders.
      </p>
      <p>The Two Clans of Yanguo.</p>
      <p>Head of the Makli Clan, Makli Hwang-cheon, and his seven elders.</p>
      <p>Head of the Jin Clan, Jin Yeo-woon, and his five elders.</p>
      <p>The Seven Clans of Shengzi.</p>
      <p>Head of the Jinlu Clan, Jinlu Yeon-cheon, and her eight elders.</p>
      <p>Head of the Ha Clan, Ha Ryeon.</p>
      <p>Head of the Geo Clan, Geo Bok-won.</p>
      <p>Head of the Jun Clan, Jun Je-yeol.</p>
      <p>Head of the Yeoljeon Clan, Yeoljeon Ri.</p>
      <p>Head of the Ori Clan, Ori Cheon-ryeong.</p>
      <p>Head of the Jeon Clan, Jeon Chil-seon.</p>
      <p>
        49 Core Formation cultivators from the Western Three Countries of the
        Heaven-Treading Desert.
      </p>
      <p>
        43 Core Formation cultivators from the Northern Grasslands of the
        Heaven-Treading Desert.
      </p>
      <p>
        54 Core Formation cultivators from the Eastern States of the
        Heaven-Treading Desert.
      </p>
      <p>And three rare Core Formation loose cultivators.</p>
      <p>Over 100 Core Formation cultivators densely surround the formation.</p>
      <p>
        One of the tribal chiefs from the Northern Grasslands shouts angrily,
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is outrageous! We can’t even count how many tribes that Nascent
        Soul old monster has massacred!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Our Byeokra as well! That Nascent Soul old monster has committed
        massacres in dozens of cities! We can’t let such a devil roam free!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "He hid his cultivation waiting for the Heavenly Being seniors to
        ascend. Nobody knows what vile intentions that old monster harbors! We
        can’t let that Nascent Soul old monster roam free!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Core Formation cultivators outside the formation are seething with
        anger, and a few formation masters among them began to dismantle the
        sandstorm formation with my help.
      </p>
      <p>"We must wait here for that old monster, ambush, and kill him!"</p>
      <p>
        Among them, one of the three Core Formation hermits, an old man wearing
        a bamboo hat and gray robes, raises his voice angrily.
      </p>
      <p>
        "He killed my great-grandson! I will kill him! I will grind his bones
        and eat his flesh!!!"
      </p>
      <p>Just like me, those who have lost loved ones.</p>
      <p>
        "That old monster massacred a tribe under the Gongmyo Clan! How precious
        are the ores mined from that tribe! That Nascent Soul old monster must
        pay!"
      </p>
      <p>Those who seek compensation.</p>
      <p>
        "To massacre the bloodline of the grasslands, what a disgrace! I will
        tear his flesh and restore the honor of my fallen tribes!"
      </p>
      <p>Those who sought honor.</p>
      <p>
        "That creature completely destroyed our state's city! Such a dangerous
        being cannot be left free. He must be eliminated quickly!"
      </p>
      <p>Those who want to eradicate Yuan Li before he becomes stronger.</p>
      <p>Many opinions are exchanged, but the conclusion is one.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li, the Bloodwood Practitioner.</p>
      <p>This murderous old monster must be killed.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the efforts of me and several Core Formation masters, the
        sandstorm formation disappeared, revealing the black castle inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        "First, let's invade his headquarters and destroy any dharma treasures
        or formations that might aid him!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, good! We need to be fully prepared to face the Nascent Soul old
        monster!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Silently, I fly among the Core Formation cultivators towards the black
        castle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I approach Cheongmun Jung-jin and inform him regarding the ability of
        the castle.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin shouts to others,</p>
      <p>
        “This castle is a kind of dharma treasure. The Nascent Soul old monster
        can elevate his cultivation by one level inside it! If he recovers his
        early Nascent Soul cultivation, he can wield mid-Nascent Soul strength
        inside. If he recovers his mid-Nascent Soul cultivation, he can wield
        late Nascent Soul strength inside! We must pulverize this castle before
        the old monster returns!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin’s words quickly gained trust and spread among those
        present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Numerous Core Formation cultivators took out their dharma treasures from
        their storage devices and began to strike the black castle.
      </p>
      <p>However, a kind of barrier appeared over the dharma treasure.</p>
      <p>
        The barrier blocked the attacks of the Core Formation cultivators and
        protected the castle from crumbling.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ugh, it seems difficult to penetrate this barrier without a Nascent
        Soul level attack.”
      </p>
      <p>"Then..."</p>
      <p>The Core Formation cultivators quickly convened for a meeting.</p>
      <p>
        "It's an ancient formation. Even if formation masters rush in,
        dismantling this ancient barrier is a remote possibility. There's no
        other way than to break it by force."
      </p>
      <p>"What should we do then..."</p>
      <p>
        Numerous discussions are exchanged, and we, on the Heaven-Treading
        Desert, discuss strategies to confront Yuan Li with serious expressions.
      </p>
      <p>And a few days later.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugugu!</p>
      <p>From afar, beyond the horizon, a blood-red cloud rises.</p>
      <p>
        The faces of the more than a hundred Core Formation cultivators darken.
      </p>
      <p>"Early… Nascent...... Peak...!"</p>
      <p>
        As Yuan Li approaches within the red blood cloud, the Core Formation
        cultivators grit their teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li's momentum is much stronger than when I had faced him, and his
        malice is beyond description.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Haha, the bugs are quick with rumors. Have you come thinking you could
        handle me?]
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, enveloped by the blood cloud, looked around the audience and
        spoke calmly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Even if it's you, do you think you can defeat so many Core Formation
        cultivators...?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin shouts, stepping forward and glaring at Yuan Li..
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li, amidst the blood cloud, looks down at us calmly and speaks,
      </p>
      <p>
        [Just because there are many fireflies, does it compare to the light of
        the sun?]
      </p>
      <p>
        The killing intent of many Core Formation cultivators are directed at
        Yuan Li, who has regained the strength of the peak early stage of
        Nascent Soul.
      </p>
      <p>[Come at me, insects.]</p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>I’m the first to step forward, drawing my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        I have fully recovered my spiritual power and internal energy over the
        past few days.
      </p>
      <p>Definitely. This time for sure.</p>
      <p>I will kill this monster.</p>
      <p>Translator Notes: Well… Prepare yourselves everyone.</p>
      <p>
        On that note, Sir Chang-ho turned out to be a title instead of a name.
        The author didn’t give the hanja/chinese characters so idk what it means
        exactly but could be Blue Tiger Person if translated literally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made the mistake in my misunderstood bias cuz my friend's name is also
        Chang-ho. The guy’s real name appears later in this arc so you’ll find
        out anyway but it’s gonna be a pain in the butt having to make all the
        changes…The author barely uses his real name anyway.

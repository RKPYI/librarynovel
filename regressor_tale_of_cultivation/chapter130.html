      <p>Chapter 130: 11th Cycle's First Day</p>
      <p>Blink.</p>
      <p>I slowly open my eyes.</p>
      <p>This death was more peaceful than any before.</p>
      <p>And at the same time.</p>
      <p>The most painful one.</p>
      <p>Drip.</p>
      <p>Tears fall, but I wipe them away and regain my composure.</p>
      <p>At the end of my life, I fully felt her heart.</p>
      <p>She wished that I would not die but live.</p>
      <p>She hoped that I would no longer be sad.</p>
      <p>Going forward, it will be impossible not to feel sadness in life.</p>
      <p>But, let's not torment myself to the point of collapse.</p>
      <p>Because she would be sad.</p>
      <p>With that resolution, I form a hand seal.</p>
      <p>
        The domain of consciousness vibrates, putting to rest my colleagues
        attempting to awaken.
      </p>
      <p>A familiar headache resounds in my head.</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        I suppress my consciousness right away through the Five Elements Blood
        Curse Banner within my upper dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        No need for hastily splitting my consciousness or eating yellow bamboo
        root. It’s quite convenient.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Stab!</p>
      <p>"…!?"</p>
      <p>I stagger, clutching my stomach.</p>
      <p>'What's this now?'</p>
      <p>After the headache, it’s now the stomach?</p>
      <p>In incomprehension, I clutched my stomach, gritting my teeth.</p>
      <p>
        My stomach, or more precisely my dantian, started hurting as if it’s
        being torn apart.
      </p>
      <p>'Why again...'</p>
      <p>
        After gritting my teeth, I decided to first look for yellow bamboo
        roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after, I consumed a bamboo root and quickly underwent complete
        transformation, rapidly forming my Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only after forming my Inner Core did I feel the pain near my dantian
        subside.
      </p>
      <p>'What exactly is this?'</p>
      <p>Just when I’m wondering,</p>
      <p>I suddenly feel something near my Inner Core.</p>
      <p>'This is...?'</p>
      <p>My eyes widen at the familiar energy I feel from my Inner Core.</p>
      <p>"This is...!"</p>
      <p>
        I hurriedly expel Gang Qi from my Inner Core, refine it into Pure
        Spiritual Force in a rough manner, and form a hand seal.
      </p>
      <p>Chalalalak!</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Around me.</p>
      <p>Three thousand familiar objects reveal themselves.</p>
      <p>The dharma treasure, the Colorless Glass Sword.</p>
      <p>
        The dharma treasure made for me by Hyang-hwa had followed me through
        time.
      </p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>Poof!</p>
      <p>
        After the Colorless Glass Swords appeared, a brightly colored norigae
        also popped out.
      </p>
      <p>I stare blankly at this sight and wipe my eyes with shaking hands.</p>
      <p>I just resolved not to shed too many tears.</p>
      <p>Yet here I am, crying shamefully again.</p>
      <p>With a trembling voice, I murmur.</p>
      <p>"It’s been passed down..."</p>
      <p>The connections between us.</p>
      <p>Transcending time, they returned with me.</p>
      <p>The time I spent with her,</p>
      <p>The moments we shared together,</p>
      <p>Those entire memories,</p>
      <p>Did not completely disappear.</p>
      <p>
        For the first time, I gained a companion that will travel through this
        endless time with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        After spending enough time watching the Colorless Glass Swords and
        collecting my thoughts, I pondered.
      </p>
      <p>'How did they follow me?'</p>
      <p>This is an important issue.</p>
      <p>
        Is it because I refined them into a natal dharma treasure that allowed
        them to follow me?
      </p>
      <p>Or is there something more to it?</p>
      <p>And if there is something more, what can it be?</p>
      <p>After pondering for a while, I come up with one theory.</p>
      <p>‘White-Red Wine.’</p>
      <p>I recall the ability of the immortal liquor called White-Red Wine.</p>
      <p>
        ‘It certainly has the power to strengthen the connection with dharma
        treasures.’
      </p>
      <p>And, thinking about it further.</p>
      <p>When I first drank White-Red Wine.</p>
      <p>
        It was a critical situation, so I couldn't recall it well, but
        certainly....
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It felt like my soul itself was connected to the dharma treasure....’
      </p>
      <p>It was more than just enhancing the connection.</p>
      <p>It was clear....</p>
      <p>
        ‘Through White-Red Wine, my soul and the dharma treasures were connected
        in an instant. As a result, as my soul traveled back in time, did the
        dharma treasures follow me as well?’
      </p>
      <p>That is the only explanation.</p>
      <p>
        To say that only natal dharma treasures can follow me seems
        insufficient, considering that Buk Hyang-hwa's norigae was only turned
        into a dharma treasure at the very last moment with Dan Fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Did White-Red Wine assist the dharma treasure in following my
        regression?’
      </p>
      <p>There seems to be no other possibilities.</p>
      <p>‘Then….’</p>
      <p>
        First of all, in this life, let's get White-Red Wine again and test it.
      </p>
      <p>And maybe if possible….</p>
      <p>‘Not just dharma treasures....’</p>
      <p>If it's possible to regress with others' souls as well.</p>
      <p>If that’s to be the case, it will be an incredible discovery!</p>
      <p>
        ‘Yes, later, I'll go back to Serving Command Palace and get White-Red
        Wine to test.’
      </p>
      <p>Having organized my thoughts, I stand up.</p>
      <p>
        ‘And… shall I try to reproduce the enlightenment from my last life.’
      </p>
      <p>Woo-woong!</p>
      <p>I concentrate my mind and raise the Gang Spheres.</p>
      <p>A total of nine Gang Spheres.</p>
      <p>No… including the Inner Core,</p>
      <p>Ten Gang Spheres.</p>
      <p>Woo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        The Gang Spheres in the air melt into the consciousness domain, and the
        Gang Sphere in the dantian melts down and connects with the Formless
        Sword outside the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, the Formless Sword connected with the Inner Core within my body
        begins to pervade various parts of my body.
      </p>
      <p>Once again, that familiar feeling takes over my whole body.</p>
      <p>
        The feeling of the Formless Sword inhabiting each and every muscle fiber
        and blood vessel.
      </p>
      <p>It’s as if….</p>
      <p>‘As if I have become a Qi Building cultivator... isn’t it?’</p>
      <p>
        Qi Building cultivators have Gang Qi flowing in their meridians, just
        like in this realm, a martial artist has the enlightenment of Beyond the
        Path to Heaven flowing in their entire body.
      </p>
      <p>And that means.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Perhaps, from Treading Heaven Beyond the Path, martial artists can also
        increase their lifespan!’
      </p>
      <p>
        I can’t confirm my lifespan yet as I have not performed the Qi Refining
        Seven Stars Ritual, but I have a feeling that this is the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, I decide to explore a bit more about what I gained by entering
        Treading Heaven Beyond the Path..
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Grrrrr….</p>
      <p>A familiar figure appears.</p>
      <p>“That’s right, I knew you would show up.”</p>
      <p>I exchange the familiar question and answer with the fox again.</p>
      <p>
        The fox, insistent on devouring me three times over, makes me sigh
        slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If that’s the case, let me test the capability of the Treading-Heaven
        realm on you.”
      </p>
      <p>“…?”</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>I rush towards the fox and kick it.</p>
      <p>“Keeek!”</p>
      <p>The fox screams and is flung away.</p>
      <p>The first ability of Treading Heaven Beyond the Path.</p>
      <p>
        Since my body has completely synchronized with the Formless Sword, any
        part of my body used for attack leaves the same trace as if I used the
        Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the first attack and realizing the difference between us, the fox
        looks defeated. But I don’t care and rush towards it again.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>
        Although my body has completely synchronized with the Formless Sword,
        it’s still very much possible to wield it as I originally did.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox, after being hit for the second time, shows a significant droop
        in its tail.
      </p>
      <p>The second ability of Treading-Heaven.</p>
      <p>
        The basic offensive and defensive capabilities have improved
        significantly. Whether it’s because I am using all ten Gang Spheres or
        because it is directly connected to my life force,
      </p>
      <p>
        The limit of power I can draw from the Formless Sword seems to have
        increased.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I had to always hold the Formless Sword to accelerate, but
        now that I am one with the Formless Sword, acceleration is possible just
        by existing.
      </p>
      <p>The acceleration itself is far faster than a simple 10x speed.</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>
        As I quickly charge and strike the fox, it seems to realize it can't
        fully respond to me anymore and looks at me with fearful eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It gauges the distance between us and then, compressing its
        consciousness around its body, flees even faster.
      </p>
      <p>The third ability of Treading Heaven Beyond the Path.</p>
      <p>
        In the past, when I only held the Formless Sword, I mainly flew through
        the air using void steps. Because I couldn’t use the Flying Escape
        Technique like Core Formation cultivators, long-distance flying was
        difficult, and chasing after them using void steps had its limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, being completely one with the Formless Sword, I can fly through
        the air swiftly, much like using the Flying Escape Technique.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh Bang!</p>
      <p>
        I chase after the fleeing fox. Transforming myself into the Formless
        Sword, I impale it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact is so significant that it quakes the earth, given the fox's
        size.
      </p>
      <p>The fox tries to resist, but I extend my hand towards its chest.</p>
      <p>Woo-woong!</p>
      <p>The last ability of Treading Heaven Beyond the Path.</p>
      <p>Shwaak!</p>
      <p>
        My hand touches the vicinity of the fox's chest, and its body stiffens.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first glance, it looks like I am merely touching the fox’s chest. In
        reality, the Formless Sword extended from my hand and passed through the
        fox's hide and flesh, reaching its Demon Core and making its presence
        known.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the first to third abilities correspond to the understanding of ‘all
        Gang Spheres are one, and martial arts and I are one entity,’ as told by
        Young-hoon Hyung-nim,
      </p>
      <p>The last ability is my point of differentiation.</p>
      <p>‘Young-hoon Hyung-nim cut through space.’</p>
      <p>
        And I, who had mimicked Kim Young-hoon’s Surpassing Radiant Saber, also
        succeeded in cutting through space, albeit momentarily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the power attained when reaching Treading Heaven Beyond the
        Path with the Surpassing Radiant Saber seems to be cutting space or
        space escape.
      </p>
      <p>It’s likely due to the difference in what he and I are pursuing.</p>
      <p>He wants to surpass light, and I want to escape everything.</p>
      <p>
        Hence, if the Surpassing Radiant Saber transcends space, it truly
        surpasses light, and if the Formless Sword can selectively cut through
        anything, it truly escapes all limits.
      </p>
      <p>“Pl-please… forgive me.”</p>
      <p>The fox, trembling all over, pleads to me.</p>
      <p>‘What should I do…’</p>
      <p>
        Right now, I can use the Formless Sword infiltrated into the fox's body
        to extract its Demon Core immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, the few times I wrestled with this fox were just to test the
        capabilities of the Treading-Heaven realm. From the beginning, I could
        have extracted the fox’s Demon Core in less than a second.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ponder the fox's fate for a moment and then remove my hand from its
        chest.
      </p>
      <p>“It’s alright, I forgive you.”</p>
      <p>“Th-thank you, thank you…!”</p>
      <p>
        The fox bows its head in gratitude and then dashes away over the
        mountains.
      </p>
      <p>I still harbor some resentment towards the fox.</p>
      <p>Though in my last life,</p>
      <p>
        Having suffered such immense pain, the anguish inflicted by the fox had
        largely faded from my memory.
      </p>
      <p>‘And once is enough to teach it a lesson…’</p>
      <p>I smirk.</p>
      <p>
        It feels like only yesterday that the fox had torn off my arm, but now I
        have grown strong enough to extract its Demon Core in a second without
        any effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, this is because I practiced for 400 years after reaching
        Beyond the Path to Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>I slowly return to my companions.</p>
      <p>
        Using a consciousness technique, I begin transferring the knowledge of
        the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts and
        the enlightenments reaching Treading Heaven Beyond the Path to Kim
        Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>‘It’d be convenient to have a real memory transfer technique.’</p>
      <p>
        I had been transmitting knowledge to Kim Young-hoon through
        consciousness all this time, but in truth, this is more of a ‘formula
        transmission’ rather than a ‘memory transmission.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s more about conveying organized information than transmitting actual
        memories.
      </p>
      <p>As I finish transferring everything to Kim Young-hoon,</p>
      <p>Step, step….</p>
      <p>‘There’s one more ability to Treading Heaven Beyond the Path.’</p>
      <p>The awaited one is approaching from behind.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Sensitivity has become even sharper. Detecting the approach of the fox
        demon and the flow of intent was clearer and more detailed than before.’
      </p>
      <p>In the past, I might not have noticed his approach.</p>
      <p>But now, at this level, it seems permissible to notice.</p>
      <p>I stand up and bow respectfully.</p>
      <p>
        “This cultivator junior, Seo Eun-hyun, greets Senior Mad Lord Jo Yeon.”
      </p>
      <p>[Hoo, watching you fight with the fox was interesting.]</p>
      <p>
        The reason I had a noisy fight with the demon fox, creating a lot of
        commotion when I could have ended it in 1 second was for one reason.
      </p>
      <p>To attract the Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>
        [You, you're a strange one indeed. You're not a Nascent Soul cultivator,
        but how can you play with a mid Core Formation fox as if it’s a toy
        doll? Moreover, is that some kind of body refining technique? Your
        consciousness seems to be enveloping your physical body… Fascinating,
        truly fascinating.]
      </p>
      <p>
        “I am humbled to show such a trivial skill before a senior who has lived
        through countless years.”
      </p>
      <p>[Huh, how curious. I don't sense any spiritual power from you…]</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord fails to perceive my Inner Core this time.</p>
      <p>Of course, that is to be expected.</p>
      <p>
        After reaching Treading Heaven Beyond the Path, my Inner Core has
        completely dissolved into the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>Looking at the Mad Lord, I begin to speak.</p>
      <p>“Senior, do you know the story of a man and a woman?”</p>
      <p>[Hmm?]</p>
      <p>
        “In the mountainous regions of Shengzi... there's a story passed down
        about two immortals. Those who were saved by their righteousness created
        a memorial festival to honor their deeds.”
      </p>
      <p>‘...!”</p>
      <p>Startled, I shiver under the Mad Lord's gaze.</p>
      <p>He looks at me.</p>
      <p>His wide, flickering eyes tells me to continue.</p>
      <p>
        Wrongly speaking to the Mad Lord can lead to being captured alive and
        being turned into his puppet.
      </p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>The story I am about to tell is my own.</p>
      <p>
        “Long ago, in the mountainous regions of Shengzi, I fell in love with
        someone.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I recount my story to the Mad Lord, omitting the parts regarding
        regression.
      </p>
      <p>
        “…And so, I embraced the remains of my beloved and swore. I will tear
        apart the limbs of that man, scatter them in the four directions, shred
        his body and feed it to dogs, and then offer his head at the memorial of
        my beloved.”
      </p>
      <p>[….]</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord continues to look at me with those shimmering eyes.</p>
      <p>
        To an outsider, it’d be unclear whether he is listening to the story or
        glaring at me.
      </p>
      <p>But I can tell from his intent.</p>
      <p>‘It worked.’</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord speaks.</p>
      <p>[What… was that man's name?]</p>
      <p>
        “Bloodwood Practitioner Yuan Li. He is located in the Heaven-Treading
        Desert along these coordinates. Living in a black castle, he is a
        Nascent Soul cultivator hiding his true power.”
      </p>
      <p>[Is that so….]</p>
      <p>Chew, chewchewchewchew....</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the hunchback old man starts biting and chewing his fingers,
        saliva dripping from his chin.
      </p>
      <p>The Mad Lord, in this state, meets my gaze with sparkling eyes.</p>
      <p>[Lead the way.]</p>
      <p>11th cycle’s first day.</p>
      <p>
        What was supposed to be a story to perhaps gain some help from the Mad
        Lord regarding a distant curse, set forth a journey with the Mad Lord to
        Yuan Li's castle.

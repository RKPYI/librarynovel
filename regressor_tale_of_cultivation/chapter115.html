      <p>Chapter 115: What You Trampled On / The Path You Have Tread (3)</p>
      <p>
        I spend a long time looking at the blueprint of the Colorless Glass
        Sword, admiring the artwork she created.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even I, not well-versed in magic artifacts, am awestruck by its artistic
        structure. It’s a great dharma treasure capable of enhancing the power
        of the Formless Sword to 100%, no, 120% of its potential.
      </p>
      <p>This is the blueprint of the dharma treasure she left behind.</p>
      <p>
        As I read the blueprint, tears stream down my cheeks uncontrollably. I
        sit by the grave for a long time, crying, laughing, and mourning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, as night falls and before the next day arrives, I set out for the
        Cheongmun Clan to attend Cheongmun Ryeong's funeral.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong's funeral is held in a grand manner.</p>
      <p>
        He was the pride of the Cheongmun Clan, known as a prominent figure of
        the Qi Building stage. Being the nephew of the clan head Cheongmun
        Jung-jin, his funeral is conducted on a large scale under the clan
        head's direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Numerous elders and senior members of the Cheongmun Clan, along with
        upper-level cultivators, gathered solemnly to witness Cheongmun Ryeong's
        entombment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I watch the scene from behind Cheongmun Jung-jin. No tears flow anymore.
        Suppressing the Yin Soul Ghost Incantation to prevent curses from
        erupting during the funeral is all I can do.
      </p>
      <p>Creak!</p>
      <p>
        His coffin is sealed, and Cheongmun Ryeong is laid to rest in the clan's
        ancestral burial ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, Cheongmun Jung-jin recites a eulogy, and I deeply engrave
        his death in my heart, determined to avenge him against Yuan Li someday.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong's funeral continued for several more weeks.</p>
      <p>
        After it ended, Cheongmun Jung-jin gathered the clan's elder council and
        other members to discuss Cheongmun Ryeong's death, the Heaven-Treading
        Desert massacre, and the Bloodwood Practitioner Yuan Li. As a friend of
        Cheongmun Ryeong and a Core Formation-level powerhouse, I was able to
        attend the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>‘Could it be for another reason’</p>
      <p>
        I ponder, watching Cheongmun Jung-jin unfold the formation Cheongmun
        Ryeong created in front of the elders.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This has been a secret known only to the clan's elder council so far,
        but given that Serving Command Palace will appear near Yuan Li's eastern
        vicinity in two hundred years, it's time to speak up."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin begins.</p>
      <p>
        "First, most of the valuable items in Serving Command Palace have been
        taken by the Heavenly Being seniors. However, as the council knows,
        using Ryeong's formation, it's possible to harvest the remaining
        Longevity Fruits inside. Thus, I propose a plan to enter the Serving
        Command Palace before two hundred years pass to harvest these fruits."
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly, as the clan head, he has to consider everyone’s interests. He
        looks at me cautiously and asks,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Cultivator Seo, although Ryeong's death is regrettable, we cannot let
        the formation you both created go to waste. Could you use the Nether
        Crossing Ship to return to Serving Command Palace…?"
      </p>
      <p>
        He asks cautiously, considering my feelings. However, as soon as I heard
        'Serving Command Palace,' an idea struck me.
      </p>
      <p>"Serving Command Palace."</p>
      <p>"Hm?"</p>
      <p>
        "Serving Command Palace, Serving Command Palace, Serving Command
        Palace...!"
      </p>
      <p>
        As I repeat 'Serving Command Palace' like a madman, the Core Formation
        elders and Cheongmun Jung-jin look at me in shock.
      </p>
      <p>"I can use Serving Command Palace to catch Yuan Li!"</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li will enter Serving Command Palace. He aims to destroy all its
        floors and seek the hidden Serving Command Seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Does the clan head remember! Serving Command Palace! What happens when
        you stimulate its golden order!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Though my words are disjointed, Cheongmun Jung-jin understands and his
        eyes light up.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...! Are you suggesting bringing Yuan Li down to Core Formation level?"
      </p>
      <p>"That's right!"</p>
      <p>I reply, my eyes bloodshot.</p>
      <p>
        "I can catch Yuan Li! I can tear him apart and have a way to take
        revenge!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "...But the method you're suggesting ultimately involves activating the
        Serving Command Palace's formation, sealing the cultivation of everyone
        inside. It's not a long-term solution, and the cultivation restraint
        applies to everyone. If the old monster drops to the Core Formation
        stage, other Core Formation cultivators will drop to Qi Building. In the
        end, nothing changes."
      </p>
      <p>I grin.</p>
      <p>"I can catch him."</p>
      <p>"What?"</p>
      <p>
        "The method I've learned allows me to wield power even under Serving
        Command Palace's restraint. That's how I endured the spatial pressure
        and escaped through the teleportation array like the clan head and
        Cheongmun Ryeong. After activating Serving Command Palace's golden order
        and bringing down Yuan Li to the Core Formation stage, I'm confident I
        can kill him!"
      </p>
      <p>
        At my words, Cheongmun Jung-jin is startled, and the Core Formation
        elders murmur among themselves. The Qi Building elders of the Cheongmun
        Clan, unaware of our conversation, wear puzzled expressions.
      </p>
      <p>"...Can you guarantee that?"</p>
      <p>
        "If you provide me with spirit stones, I can speak with Song Jin and use
        the Nether Crossing Ship to return to Serving Command Palace and prove
        it."
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember the circuit Buk Hyang-hwa had touched and how she did it so
        I’m certain I can do it as well.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin, with a solemn face, looks around the audience.</p>
      <p>"...I can testify to Cultivator Seo’s Core Formation capabilities."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin looks at me.</p>
      <p>"If what you say is true... Cultivator Seo's role will be crucial."</p>
      <p>
        "I am aware. If proof is needed, just give me spirit stones. I'll prove
        it anytime."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin explains the situation to the elders and senior
        members, and after some discussion, we eventually decide to visit
        Serving Command Palace again.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Numerous Flying Escape Techniques lit up the sky. This matter involved
        not only Longevity Fruits but also the possibility of killing Yuan Li, a
        Nascent Soul cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than Cheongmun Jung-jin, myself, and four Core Formation elders,
        two Core Formation elders remained to guard the clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin carried me on a flying artifact, matching the speed
        of the other elders' Flying Escape Techniques as we headed towards the
        Black Wind Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the acceleration of the Formless Sword is fast and boasts
        greater speed in short distances than Flying Escape Techniques, there’s
        a significant difference in long-distance travel between the
        long-distance suited Flying Escape Technique and the combat-designed
        Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, even as a Core Formation-level force, it’s more stable for me
        to travel long distances in this manner on a Core Formation cultivator's
        flying artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        "First, once we enter Serving Command Palace, we'll lay down Ryeong's
        formation to fully grow and harvest the Longevity Fruits over five
        years. Then, after five years, we'll inform the other Core Formation
        cultivators of your plan and open Serving Command Palace. Is that
        alright?"
      </p>
      <p>I nod.</p>
      <p>"If it means killing Yuan Li, anything is fine."</p>
      <p>"Alright then."</p>
      <p>
        Although the Cheongmun Clan will monopolize the Longevity Fruits, it
        doesn't matter. After all, my initial purpose for obtaining the fruits,
        Kim Young-hoon, is dead, torn into eight segments.
      </p>
      <p>Shoo Shoo Shoo</p>
      <p>
        The Core Formation elders of the Cheongmun Clan and I enter the barriers
        in the Black Wind Sea, where the Nether Crossing Ship is located.
      </p>
      <p>Chwaah!</p>
      <p>
        As we penetrate the last barrier, the Nether Crossing Ship appears, and
        sensing our approach, Song Jin comes up on the ship, accompanied by...
      </p>
      <p>"It's been a while, Senior Seo."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran, dressed in a black robe, stands next to Song Jin.</p>
      <p>
        Previously half-human, half-demon with scales across his skin, he now
        appears almost entirely human, save for the dragon horns on his forehead
        and a dragon tail at his back, likely related to the method taught by
        Song Jin. Around him swirls a sinister devilish aura.
      </p>
      <p>'He's reached the pinnacle of Qi Building.'</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it seems he is on the cusp of reaching Core Formation.</p>
      <p>
        I nod in greeting, unable to speak a cheerful word in my current state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Song Jin, noticing my gaze, looks surprised and glances around at us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five Core Formation cultivators and me, a Core Formation-level being,
        all with grave expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Um... I do feel a bit sorry for leaving you all behind in Serving
        Command Palace last time.]
      </p>
      <p>Silence.</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin breaks the silence.</p>
      <p>
        "We're not here to discuss that matter, Senior. It's just that the
        current situation in the continent is chaotic, hence the serious
        demeanor. We hope there's no misunderstanding."
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm, hmm... In that case.]</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin coughs awkwardly and glances at me before speaking to Cheongmun
        Jung-jin.
      </p>
      <p>
        [By the way, what's happening in the continent? I've read the stars, and
        there's a major upheaval in the celestial energy. Although I don't know
        the details, I can tell something significant is occurring.]
      </p>
      <p>At that, I speak up.</p>
      <p>
        "The Bloodwood Practitioner Yuan Li. That old monster regained his
        Nascent Soul cultivation and committed a tremendous massacre near the
        Heaven-Treading Desert. All my dear ones died in that massacre."
      </p>
      <p>[What!?]</p>
      <p>Song Jin looks at me in shock.</p>
      <p>
        [Bloodwood Practitioner? That guy reached Nascent Soul? He was deemed a
        dying Core Formation cultivator when the various sects and tribes
        assessed his potential and was thus left alone...]
      </p>
      <p>
        “He was deceiving everyone. He had already reached the Nascent Soul
        stage but then divided his soul into something called a Blood Soul,
        scattering it near the Heaven-Treading Desert.”
      </p>
      <p>I continue with a listless look in my eyes.</p>
      <p>
        “In the massacre orchestrated by him in the Heaven-Treading Desert,
        cultivators at the Core Formation stage from across the continent came
        forward to seal him. However, 200 years later, the appearance of Serving
        Command Palace at the site of his seal has prompted all factions to
        prepare for a grand war with the Nascent Soul cultivator.”
      </p>
      <p>[Hmm…]</p>
      <p>Hearing my words, Song Jin looks at Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        [Damn, of all things, reaching the Nascent Soul stage... and a danger to
        my disciple? It’s driving me mad.]
      </p>
      <p>“Hmm…?”</p>
      <p>
        I look at Song Jin and Seo Ran with listless eyes and ask, my intent
        turning red again.
      </p>
      <p>“Why is he a danger to Daoist Seo?”</p>
      <p>
        At the anger in my voice, not only Song Jin but also the elders of the
        Cheongmun Clan flinch.
      </p>
      <p>Pointing at Seo Ran, Song Jin says</p>
      <p>
        [It's because of the 'Blood Demon Suppressing Sea Light', a devilish art
        he has mastered. It specializes in the water attribute, particularly
        drawing the true blood of sea demon beasts to maximize his physical
        regeneration. He can also refine and control the souls of demon beasts
        using this art.The most compatible with his Blood Demon Suppressing Sea
        Light are... the Sea Dragon Tribe.]
      </p>
      <p>Worry fills his eyes as he looks at Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        [It's a tale known only to a few, but Yuan Li once hunted a Core
        Formation sea dragon from the Sea Dragon Tribe. Sea Dragon King Seo
        Hweol chased him for three days and nights, admonishing him, and
        mercifully forgave Yuan Li after retrieving the sea dragon’s soul and
        corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol is compassionate, but too soft. If it were Black Ghost Valley,
        anyone who harmed our disciples would have had their soul extracted and
        refined into a ghost!]
      </p>
      <p>'Retrieving the soul and corpse of the sea dragon...?'</p>
      <p>
        I recall the soul of a blood dragon among the seven souls Yuan Li had
        controlled, which resembled a sea dragon.
      </p>
      <p>'If Seo Hweol retrieved it, why does Yuan Li still have the soul?'</p>
      <p>
        […Anyway, with Seo Hweol gone, Yuan Li won't need to worry about the Sea
        Dragon King’s eyes… There's a high chance he will target Seo Ran to
        cultivate Blood Demon Suppressing Sea Light. Seo Ran’s half-dragon blood
        is from royal lineage. Yuan Li, knowing the value of that blood, will be
        desperate to get it.]
      </p>
      <p>Song Jin crosses his arms, looking worried.</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jun-jin then speaks.</p>
      <p>
        “Indeed, given Yuan Li’s nature to drench the entire continent in blood,
        Core Formation cultivators have united to stop his return in 200 years.
        We've come to seek your guidance in devising a plan against him.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Jung-jin then explained the plan using Serving Command Palace
        against Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        [So, the plan is to draw him into Serving Command Palace and kill him?]
      </p>
      <p>“Yes, that's right.”</p>
      <p>[…It's risky.]</p>
      <p>Song Jin expresses his concern.</p>
      <p>
        [You might not know, but Serving Command Palace, also known as
        Liberation Palace, is not the main artifact.]
      </p>
      <p>“Yes?”</p>
      <p>
        Confusion appears on the faces of Cheongmun Jung-jin and the elders.
      </p>
      <p>“What does that mean?”</p>
      <p>
        [Seems you don't know. The Serving Command Palace, crafted by the
        heavenly artisan, is originally a small cylindrical seal the size of a
        palm. The current Serving Command Palace is an enlarged palace built in
        the shape of that seal.]
      </p>
      <p>Song Jin continues his explanation.</p>
      <p>
        [The Serving Command Seal, also known as the Liberation Seal, was made
        before the appearance of the Ascension Gate. It bestows blessings for
        ascension, drawing the blessed one’s fate towards the upper realms,
        closing the distance. However, as a side effect of imposing the
        attraction of fate... The bearer of the Serving Command Seal will
        receive heavenly fate.]
      </p>
      <p>“Heavenly fate... you say?”</p>
      <p>
        [Yes. Core Formation cultivators might not fully grasp the concept of
        fate, but as someone who has reached Heavenly Being, I am aware of the
        power of heavenly fate and must warn you. Luring him into Serving
        Command Palace to fight means there's a chance he might obtain the
        Serving Command Seal and gain the protection of heavenly fate. If that
        happens, unless there's a being with even stronger fate, no one can
        withstand the heavenly fate brought by the Serving Command Seal.]
      </p>
      <p>“Fate... Heavenly fate…”</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin looks puzzled but nods in understanding.</p>
      <p>
        Though Song Jin had fallen to the Core Formation stage, he is evidently
        a remnant soul who reached Heavenly Being, and his experience and
        authority are beyond Cheongmun Jung-jin’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hold on, but Senior. That Serving Command Seal... we weren't aware of
        it. What are the chances he knows about it...”
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Cheongmun Clan elder asks Song Jin, they realize the contradiction
        in their question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because they were unaware, it didn't necessarily mean the ‘old
        monster’ who has lived longer than them wouldn't know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, Yuan Li is aware of the existence of the Serving Command Seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yuan Li knows about the Serving Command Seal. It’s one of the pieces of
        information I obtained while surviving against him.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I can’t reveal my return, so I spoke vaguely, but it’s enough to darken
        the others' expressions.
      </p>
      <p>However, I look at them and say,</p>
      <p>
        “So, are you planning to cancel the plan? If the issue is him getting
        the Serving Command Seal… just kill him before he can obtain it.”
      </p>
      <p>I look around with a listless expression and continue.</p>
      <p>
        “It seems everyone is skeptical since I haven’t proven my strength under
        the restraint. Anyway, let’s go to the Serving Command Palace and I’ll
        prove it first.”
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Jung-jin nods in agreement.</p>
      <p>
        “Either way, regardless of Cultivator Seo’s situation, we need to
        harvest the fruits, so let's proceed.”

      <p>A Cheongmun Clan elder places spirit stones in front of Song Jin.</p>
      <p>
        “We ask for your help, senior. Please use the Nether Crossing Ship to go
        to Serving Command Palace. We need to head there for our own reasons.”
      </p>
      <p>[Well, with these spirit stones...]</p>
      <p>
        After inspecting the spirit stones, Song Jin activates the Nether
        Crossing Ship again.

      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>The Nether Crossing Ship rises.</p>
      <p>I look around with a listless expression and approach Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>“Daoist Seo.”</p>
      <p>“Yes, Senior Seo.”</p>
      <p>“Last time, you promised to fulfill one of my requests, right?”</p>
      <p>“That's right.”</p>
      <p>I take out the space-breaking bead from my belongings.</p>
      <p>“I have a request for Daoist Seo.”</p>
      <p>“That is…”</p>
      <p>“Teach me how to activate this.”</p>

      <p>‘This is definitely...'</p>
      <p>The overall structure of the Sea Dragon Palace in front of me,</p>
      <p>
        And the ritualistic formation I saw in the hidden room on the top floor
        of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>Somehow, their structures overlap in my mind.</p>
      <p>
        After observing the Sea Dragon Palace for a while, I descend and ask Seo
        Ran.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Daoist Seo, do you know anything about the construction of the Sea
        Dragon Palace?"
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, are you asking about the structure of the Sea Dragon Palace?"</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran gestures in the air, softly touching the spiritual energy
        flowing around.
      </p>
      <p>
        "As you are feeling right now, this Sea Dragon Palace always has a flow
        of auspicious energy and comfortable spiritual energy"
      </p>
      <p>"I see."</p>
      <p>
        Indeed, the area where the Sea Dragon Palace is located always has a
        strange flow of auspicious energy, and I could feel a faint sense of
        sacredness.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, absorbing the spiritual energy of the Sea Dragon
        Palace seems to clear my mind somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Sea Dragon Palace itself forms a kind of ritualistic formation, and
        the Dragon King said that this formation is designed to awaken and clear
        the minds of the Sea Dragon Tribe living here, maintaining their pure
        and composed state of mind."
      </p>
      <p>'A formation for mental awakening...?'</p>
      <p>
        I recall the formation in the hidden room of Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If the structures are almost identical, even if the effects are
        slightly different, surely the formation in Serving Command Palace is
        also related to the mind...'
      </p>
      <p>I fall into doubt.</p>
      <p>
        'Why... is there a mind-related formation left in Serving Command
        Palace?'
      </p>
      <p>What was the Sea Dragon King thinking?</p>
      <p>'I'll have to ask Song Jin later if he knows about this formation.'</p>
      <p>"Anyway, let's search the Sea Dragon Palace."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran leads the way, looking around.</p>
      <p>
        "This is the outer palace, with various complex formations, but once we
        enter the inner palace, there are almost no formations, so we can look
        for dharma treasures or spiritual elixirs there."
      </p>
      <p>"Understood."</p>
      <p>
        I followed Seo Ran, breaking through the formations of the outer palace
        and entering the inner palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The deeper into the Sea Dragon Palace, the more intense the auspicious
        and sacred energies seemed to become.
      </p>
      <p>'My mind is becoming clearer...'</p>
      <p>Gradually, my consciousness became clearer.</p>
      <p>What can be in this place?</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran and I decided to split up and search different parts of the Sea
        Dragon Palace.
      </p>
      <p>'There are prohibitions everywhere...'</p>
      <p>
        The outer palace had traps where if one steps wrongly, they fall into a
        maze-like formation. However, the inner palace had active prohibitions
        spread throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Each one is not easy to deal with. It takes two or three strikes with
        the Formless Sword to break them...'
      </p>
      <p>
        But the presence of prohibitions means something valuable is hidden
        inside.
      </p>
      <p>'Where should I start searching...'</p>
      <p>Just when I’m wandering inside the inner palace.</p>
      <p>'Huh?'</p>
      <p>
        I suddenly find one hall among the many, uniquely without any
        prohibitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hall is among the larger ones, and though there are no
        prohibitions, ritualistic scripts are engraved all over, emitting
        spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly, it’s no ordinary place, but strangely, this is the only place
        without prohibitions.
      </p>
      <p>I enter the hall, feeling something odd.</p>
      <p>Creak―</p>
      <p>Startled!</p>
      <p>
        As I opened the door and entered, I trembled at the strong smell of
        blood coming from inside.
      </p>
      <p>‘This place is...'</p>
      <p>The inside of the hall is spacious.</p>
      <p>
        Along the edges of the hall are numerous bookshelves, and in the center,
        there is a large celestial map.
      </p>
      <p>
        The celestial map depicts constellations corresponding to the 28 Stars,
        positions of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, Supreme Palace Enclosure,
        and the Heavenly Market Enclosure.
      </p>
      <p>It also shows the sun and the moon embroidered on it.</p>
      <p>
        And above the beautiful celestial map, there’s dried scattered blood,
        giving off a chilling feel..
      </p>
      <p>‘What on earth is this...'</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, while the bookshelves along the edges are intact, there are no
        books inside, only heaps of black, burnt charcoal.
      </p>
      <p>The bookshelves were all charred, as if...</p>
      <p>
        ‘Did someone kill the inhabitant of this place and burn all the books of
        the hall's owner?'
      </p>
      <p>The most likely suspect is certainly Seo Hweol.</p>
      <p>
        Given his twisted nature, it’s entirely possible he would do something
        like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The reason there are no prohibitions here is perhaps because there's
        nothing left, so there’s no need to set them up.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems I have stumbled upon the scene of someone's crime, with nothing
        else to gain.
      </p>
      <p>I was about to leave the hall when it happened.</p>
      <p>Ssss―</p>
      <p>
        A sensation caught my attention, a sensation only I could perceive,
        having mastered the Yin Soul Ghost Incantation, a curse method.
      </p>
      <p>This is...</p>
      <p>‘A curse?'</p>
      <p>Someone had left a deep, lingering curse here.</p>
      <p>Giying!</p>
      <p>My Inner Core suddenly vibrates.</p>
      <p>
        And then, I feel the intense curse that had been lingering somewhere
        rushing towards me.
      </p>
      <p>‘Oh no...!’</p>
      <p>
        I panic and try to neutralize the curse with the Yin Soul Ghost
        Incantation, but the curse already attaches itself to me.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>-This...</p>
      <p>Someone's 'voice' began to be heard.</p>
      <p>-Will find…here…demi-human...</p>
      <p>A voice filled with intense resentment.</p>
      <p>-Seo Ran...outside…not</p>
      <p>The voice, filled with pain, speaks.</p>
      <p>-Trust him…entrust to him... Ran… look under..celestial map...</p>
      <p>And with that, the voice cuts off.</p>
      <p>Psssh―</p>
      <p>
        The curse that was attached to me, seemingly with the sole purpose of
        conveying that message, disappeared after leaving me with a slight
        headache.
      </p>
      <p>'Look under the celestial map?'</p>
      <p>
        The floor where the celestial map is drawn is made of stone slabs of
        jade.
      </p>
      <p>
        I infuse my arms with Pure Spiritual Force and forcefully insert my
        fingers between the slabs, lifting them.
      </p>
      <p>Uguk, ugrgrgrgruk!</p>
      <p>Gradually, the slabs are lifted up.</p>
      <p>
        Beneath, there is a decaying leather-bound book, seemingly just an
        ordinary item with no spiritual energy, probably just a diary of the
        voice's owner.
      </p>
      <p>‘An item not even detected by my consciousness...'</p>
      <p>
        It seems that these jade slabs had some role in blocking consciousness
        and spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I pull the book towards me using sword control, then put the slabs back
        in place.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugu!</p>
      <p>The slabs were quite heavy, so I wiped off my sweat.</p>
      <p>On the book is a simple title in demon script: 'Diary'.</p>
      <p>‘Why would they want to pass on their diary to Seo Ran?'</p>
      <p>I check the diary for any special spells or techniques.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it’s just a diary, without any traps or backhands.</p>
      <p>Sararak, sararak.</p>
      <p>
        The owner of the diary, a Sea Dragon Tribe elder named Jeon Hyang, was
        an astronomer, responsible for celestial observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the diary's content involved their daily activities as an
        astronomer, noting unusual celestial phenomena, what they ate that day,
        conversations they had, and the weather.
      </p>
      <p>
        -I spoke with a senior of the Heavenly Circle stage today. He told me
        that if I keep observing the World's End, my headache will only worsen
        and advised me to consume an elixir for relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person referred to Heavenly Being cultivators as 'seniors of the
        Heavenly Circle stage'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The demon race often uses the term 'Heavenly Circle' instead of
        'Heavenly Being.’ Those who typically dislike the term 'Heavenly Being'
        tend to hold demon race supremacy beliefs, and they are known to capture
        and consume humans.
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, Jeon Hyang often consumed human elixirs.</p>
      <p>
        -I extracted and consumed the core formed by the livestock trained in
        the Summoning Wind, Coagulating Core Transformation. Indeed, its
        efficacy is remarkable. The headache has disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        -There are rumors that the King has developed an even more exceptional
        livestock cultivation method.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Not only does it involve extracting the cultivation efforts of the
        livestock by infusing them with the true blood of the Sea Dragon tribe,
        but it is also said to be an outstanding method that allows the Sea
        Dragon tribe to resurrect in the livestock's body once, should they die
        in battle. The livestock's body serves as a vessel for this singular
        resurrection."
      </p>
      <p>'Tch...'</p>
      <p>
        Regardless of the species, exploiting another race to this extent, is
        that really right?
      </p>
      <p>
        I flip through the diary, clicking my tongue at the Sea Dragon Tribe's
        anecdotes.
      </p>
      <p>Sararak.</p>
      <p>As I browse, I pause at a certain entry.</p>
      <p>
        -Today, the Dragon King, I, and the other astronomers, along with the
        elders of the Sea Dragon tribe, gathered for a meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        -The King explained the astronomical records we had submitted to the
        elders, sharing a certain speculation he had been considering.
      </p>
      <p>
        -It was a truly chilling speculation. If it were true, it meant that
        those living in this world could only prove their dignity by ascending
        and leaving this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        -A Heavenly Circle elder opposed the King's words. He said it was too
        far-fetched, a speculation. Although I felt chills, I do think the
        King's words were a bit exaggerated.
      </p>
      <p>
        -It was a meeting that gave me much to ponder. I must visit the World's
        End more frequently and observe the heavens more closely."
      </p>
      <p>This was the end of that day's entry.</p>
      <p>‘Speculation? What is the speculation mentioned here?'</p>
      <p>
        What exactly did Seo Hweol think upon seeing the astronomical records?
      </p>
      <p>I continue flipping through the diary.</p>
      <p>The next few pages were records of mundane daily life.</p>
      <p>Then, once again, I stop at a section of the diary.</p>
      <p>-It seems the Dragon King had observed something else separately.</p>
      <p>
        -The King called together the elders and us astronomers, presenting a
        hypothesis about the speculation he had mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>-It was an interesting hypothesis.</p>
      <p>
        -In this world, day and night do not actually exist; rather, it's merely
        that the heaven and earth spiritual energy divides into Yin and Yang,
        circulating in a cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        -On a macroscopic level, the grand flow of spiritual energy divides into
        Yin and Yang, rotating this world, leading to the illusion of day and
        night. In our world, day and night do not actually exist.
      </p>
      <p>'What...?'</p>
      <p>Day and night do not exist?</p>
      <p>What does that even mean?</p>
      <p>I look at the sentence several times, unable to comprehend.</p>
      <p>But still, I can’t understand.</p>
      <p>
        -It was disrespectful to the King, but we astronomers couldn't help but
        laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        -The idea that day and night don't actually exist while the sun and moon
        orbit the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        -As we struggled to contain our laughter, the elders became furious.
        Eventually, we were scolded, listening to the wrathful voice of the
        grand elder.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Normally, such disrespect could have warranted punishment, but the
        King, with a heart as vast as the sea, forgave us.
      </p>
      <p>
        -The King may indulge in somewhat extravagant imaginations, but his
        boundless compassion and heart are truly admirable. I only feel sorry
        towards the King.
      </p>
      <p>'The sun and moon orbit the world...'</p>
      <p>Apparently, in this world shaped as a flat plane,</p>
      <p>
        The heliocentric model, where the world revolves around the sun, doesn't
        apply, but rather a geocentric model, where the sun and moon orbit the
        world, seems to be the accepted theory.
      </p>
      <p>But Seo Hweol's statement concerns me.</p>
      <p>
        'If day and night doesn't truly exist, does that mean neither geocentric
        nor heliocentric models apply to this world?'
      </p>
      <p>With this question in mind, I turn the page.</p>
      <p>
        -Recently, a half-human, half-dragon brat named Seo Ran is causing a
        stir in the Sea Dragon Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        -If it weren't for his royal lineage, I would have driven him out
        immediately, but he always clings to me and annoys me.
      </p>
      <p>
        -The King always greets Seo Ran with a smiling face, but those with
        insight know that the King doesn't really fancy him.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Ironically, that annoying brat follows the King the most, but does he
        realize?
      </p>
      <p>
        -That it's the King who most often orchestrates situations to avoid him?
      </p>
      <p>
        -I wish that brat would soon realize this himself and leave the Sea
        Dragon Palace.
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>Sararak.</p>
      <p>I turn to the next page.</p>
      <p>
        -We astronomers plan to go to the World's End to properly align
        ourselves and observe the orbit of the sun and moon, intending to
        shatter the King's speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Some of the elders subtly support us. They seem to want to prove that
        the King's extravagant speculation is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        -The idea that day and night don't actually exist, as sorry as I am to
        say this about the King who has accomplished so much, it seems that the
        King might have spoken so because of his lack of understanding in
        astronomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        -I won't be able to write in this journal for the next few months. We'll
        be holed up at the World's End, repeatedly observing.
      </p>
      <p>
        -I must take plenty of the livestock's cores with me. The headaches
        worsen when continuously facing the World's End.
      </p>
      <p>Sararak, sararak, sararak.</p>
      <p>The following pages are blank.</p>
      <p>
        As I continue turning the pages, I eventually reach a part where the
        diary resumes.
      </p>
      <p>‘Huh?'</p>
      <p>The handwriting here is incredibly erratic.</p>
      <p>
        It is evident that Jeon Hyang was extremely agitated when writing this
        entry.
      </p>
      <p>-With my own hands, I succeeded in observing the sun and the moon.</p>
      <p>-It's unbelievable. The results are too strange.</p>
      <p>-Neither the sun nor the moon orbits the world!</p>
      <p>-Both celestial bodies are simply fixed in one place in the sky!</p>
      <p>
        -Even the rising and setting of the sun and moon from the east and west
        are just an illusion!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        -The actual position of the sun and moon is in the south, closest to our
        Sea Dragon Tribe's homeland.
      </p>
      <p>-The hypothesis proposed by the King was correct!!!</p>
      <p>
        -Neither the sun nor the moon orbits. They simply remain in place, and
        in this world, there is no day or night. What we thought of as day and
        night is merely the macroscopic circulation of the Yin and Yang of
        heaven and earth spiritual energy!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeon Hyang's handwriting is extremely shaky, as if their hands were
        trembling while writing.
      </p>
      <p>I can feel from his writing that Jeon Hyang was terrified.</p>
      <p>
        -If the King's hypothesis is proven, then what does it say about this
        world?
      </p>
      <p>-Isn’t the form of this world too grotesque?</p>
      <p>
        -Have we been breathing, cultivating, and living in such an ominous
        place?
      </p>
      <p>-How are we any different from maggots?</p>
      <p>
        -I began my observations intending to refute the King's speculation, but
        in the end, the astronomical observations of myself and the other
        astronomers only splendidly proved the King's hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        -The Council of Elders is calling for me. Not just me, but all the other
        astronomers will be gathered too. I'm afraid. Have I inadvertently
        proven such a grotesque truth?
      </p>
      <p>Sararak, sararak.</p>
      <p>In the next page, the handwriting is a bit more stable.</p>
      <p>-Beheading Punishment.</p>
      <p>
        -If that statement is true, then this place is definitely not where we
        should live.
      </p>
      <p>
        -I and the other astronomers, along with all members of the Council of
        Elders, agreed with the King's opinion that all races should ascend
        together at once.
      </p>
      <p>-The King is indeed benevolent.</p>
      <p>
        -Isn't he giving the other races an opportunity to preserve their
        dignity too?"
      </p>
      <p>"Beheading Punishment...?"</p>
      <p>What does that mean?</p>
      <p>
        It seems like Jeon Hyang wrote something in the diary that only they
        knew.
      </p>
      <p>‘Is it some sort of code?'</p>
      <p>I can’t tell at the moment.</p>
      <p>Sararak.</p>
      <p>I turn the pages again.</p>
      <p>
        -The youngest at the Core Formation stage among us astronomers, a naive
        youngster who couldn't even perform transformation, briefly went to the
        continent and was captured and killed by a human devilish cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        -The King chased down that cultivator to reprimand him and retrieved the
        body. Indeed, humans are all treacherous and unreliable trash.
      </p>
      <p>
        -These creatures are best used as livestock. After all, aren't the
        elixirs made from them the most effective?
      </p>
      <p>
        -And the headaches from observing the World's End are also best
        alleviated by the cores of these livestock. Of course, there will be no
        need for them for headaches anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        -The reason for headaches when gazing at the World's End was revealed to
        be due to unintentional eye contact with a Great Boundary True Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Even if it's not the gaze of a True Immortal, observing the World's End
        means continuously witnessing the will of True Immortals, so it's
        natural that the upper dantian is unknowingly under strain.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Now, we astronomers have stopped meaningless astronomical observations.
        Hence, there's no more need for elixirs, and they will be used as
        emergency medicinal materials.
      </p>
      <p>"Great Boundary True Immortal...?"</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the folktale book I read to the child in a previous village
        comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>In the folktale, the sun and moon were depicted as eyes.</p>
      <p>I continue flipping through the pages.</p>
      <p>-I've been feeling terrible lately.</p>
      <p>
        -Is it because I've observed such a terrifying fact with my own hands?
      </p>
      <p>-That fact lingers in my mind and won't leave.</p>
      <p>
        -The realization that I have been unwittingly making eye contact with an
        unfathomable entity fills me with deep fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        -What was that entity thinking while looking at me? Lately, whenever I
        recall that fact, it feels like it's driving me insane.
      </p>
      <p>
        -It's not just me. I can see that the characters of most of the
        astronomers are becoming increasingly volatile. They too always seem to
        have fear written on their faces.
      </p>
      <p>Sarak</p>
      <p>-This is madness!</p>
      <p>
        -The Mad Lord, that perverted old monster, attacked the livestock pen!
        Not only the royal family managing the pen, but also my fellow
        astronomers who were visiting have been captured by that monster and
        turned into living puppets!
      </p>
      <p>-The pen has collapsed, and all the livestock have escaped.</p>
      <p>
        -The King rushed out to pursue the Mad Lord, but he had already fled.
      </p>
      <p>
        -It's so bitter and grievous. All the emergency medicinal materials have
        run away!
      </p>
      <p>
        -Lately, we haven't been observing the heavens, so there's no headache,
        but it's a painfully significant loss.
      </p>
      <p>Sararak, sararak.</p>
      <p>-...The atmosphere has been strange lately.</p>
      <p>
        -Although it's said that our relationship with Black Ghost Valley has
        worsened and we have been in disputes with them, it's unusual how often
        my fellow astronomers are being attacked or go missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Starting with the youngest Core Formation stage astronomer last time,
        from the attacks by the Mad Lord, it seems like my fellow astronomers
        are being targeted unusually often. There are quite a few who have
        disappeared without any apparent reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        -It's likely that the elders, who have been unsupportive of the King and
        encouraging our astronomical observations while opposing the King’s
        extravagant speculations, are putting us in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        -My fellow astronomers discussed this and decided to inform the King
        about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        -I, as the representative, went to the King to report. The King praised
        me with a trusting face, saying I did well in speaking up. He assured us
        of his protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Especially me, being an exceptional astronomer who directly observed
        the sun and the moon, he said I would be firmly protected. I am
        grateful.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Thinking about it, since the fact I observed not only affected the
        astronomers but also changed the expressions of the Heavenly Circle
        elders, it's surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Despite such a terrifying truth that should affect everyone regardless
        of being at the Nascent Soul or Heavenly Circle stage, the King always
        maintains his benevolent smile and gives us faith.
      </p>
      <p>-As expected, he is our King.</p>
      <p>Sararak, sararak....</p>
      <p>I turn the next page.</p>
      <p>
        And then, I see Jeon Hyang's handwriting start to shake again in the
        following entry.
      </p>
      <p>-What is happening!</p>
      <p>-Among the astronomers, I'm the only one left.</p>
      <p>
        -All have either disappeared or died in battles with the Black Ghost
        Valley, at the hands of the Mad Lord, or due to other disasters.
      </p>
      <p>-The King promised to protect us, yet how has it come to this?</p>
      <p>
        -I know it's disrespectful, but I can't help but make a terrifying
        speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        -It’s not the elders who opposed the King, but the King himself is
        orchestrating the disappearance of the astronomers who know the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        -It can't be. He is a benevolent person. I mustn't worry. It's just a
        needless thought.
      </p>
      <p>Sararak.</p>
      <p>And in the very next entry.</p>
      <p>The handwriting became completely distorted, and oozing with rage.</p>
      <p>-Your Majesty!</p>
      <p>-You are pushing the astronomers who know the truth towards death!</p>
      <p>-I too will soon die!</p>
      <p>
        -Promising to firmly protect me meant nothing but to exploit me to the
        end before killing me.
      </p>
      <p>
        -I am going to die. I won't even be able to participate in the
        ascension.
      </p>
      <p>-Why are you doing this to us, Your Majesty? Why?</p>
      <p>-Is the truth we know harmful to the Sea Dragon Tribe?</p>
      <p>
        -It might be. It's so terrifying that even the seniors of the Heavenly
        Circle stage are sometimes tormented by it. Even we who have reached the
        Nascent Soul stage spend sleepless nights.
      </p>
      <p>-Yes, if it's for the good of the Sea Dragon Tribe...</p>
      <p>-If it's for the sake of our tribe, then it can't be helped.</p>
      <p>-Let's accept it.</p>
      <p>
        Their handwriting started in anger but seemed to stabilize as they
        reconciled their thoughts while writing.
      </p>
      <p>....</p>
      <p>Sararak.</p>
      <p>-After accepting my inevitable death, I feel at peace.</p>
      <p>-One must accept that they will one day die.</p>
      <p>-Accepting death, life, in fact, feels renewed.</p>
      <p>
        -Things I couldn’t see before are now visible. This precious life, the
        scenery of the Sea Dragon Palace...
      </p>
      <p>
        -And then, there's Seran, who seems to be ostracized under the King's
        leadership, just like me.
      </p>
      <p>
        -I've recently become close to that child. Perhaps it's a case of shared
        misery.
      </p>
      <p>
        -The child is exceptionally bright. Previously blinded by prejudice
        regarding race and lineage, now I see the child's intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Quite adorable. If this kid had joined the astronomers, I would have
        treated him well....
      </p>
      <p>-The King said he won't take this child on the ascension.</p>
      <p>
        -Instead, he assigned him the task of liberating the souls of the Sea
        Dragon warriors trapped in the wrecked Nether Crossing Ship destroyed in
        the war with the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Indeed... the King, though stern, truly cares for the Sea Dragon Tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Seo Ran, this child too, is pitiable, but... it's for the sake of the
        tribe, so sacrifice is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        -I too will soon die for the sake of our tribe. The King's demeanor
        towards me is subtly changing.
      </p>
      <p>-Perhaps I will die before the Ascension Gate opens....</p>
      <p>Jeon Hyang's diary is nearing its end.</p>
      <p>Sararak.</p>
      <p>And then, when I turn the next page.</p>
      <p>‘This is...’</p>
      <p>Blood.</p>
      <p>The next page is written in dried blood.</p>
      <p>-Seo Hweol!!!</p>
      <p>-I despise you!</p>
      <p>-All of our Sea Dragon Tribe are being deceived by him!</p>
      <p>-He is not a King (王), just an Ignorant Mortal (凡夫).</p>
      <p>
        -Seo Ran, I leave this message for you. If you return to the Sea Dragon
        Palace, read my diary and learn the true nature of Seo Hweol.
      </p>
      <p>-It was all lies.</p>
      <p>-Do not believe anything he has said!</p>
      <p>
        -He is a madman, more deranged than the Mad Lord, consumed by vengeance,
        a broken monster!
      </p>
      <p>-Even to the Sea Dragon Tribe....</p>
      <p>
        -Seo Ran, he is coming to kill me now. I can't leave a long message.
      </p>
      <p>-Be sure to read this diary later!</p>
      <p>-Thank you for being my confidant.</p>
      <p>Sararak....</p>
      <p>That is the last page of the diary.</p>
      <p>
        Although I don’t understand everything, the diary provides many
        insights.
      </p>
      <p>I closed Jeon Hyang's diary.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Grotesque form of the world? Day and night being an illusion? Seo
        Hweol’s true nature...’
      </p>
      <p>Various truths swirl confusingly in my mind.</p>
      <p>‘Even Yuan Li is under the influence of Seo Hweol.'</p>
      <p>What does Seo Hweol want....</p>
      <p>Thud.</p>
      <p>Just when I close the diary.</p>
      <p>Wriggle.</p>
      <p>“Hm...?”</p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle....</p>
      <p>Suddenly, the diary began to wriggle.</p>
      <p>“What...!?”</p>
      <p>I hadn't sensed any presence or spiritual energy infused in it.</p>
      <p>‘But why...?’</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Puff!</p>
      <p>
        From between the pages of the diary, a blue hand reaches out and grabs
        my arms with crushing strength.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>Suddenly, I feel a heavy weight all over my body.</p>
      <p>
        The heaven and earth spiritual energy around me presses down, pinning me
        in place.
      </p>
      <p>“What is this...”</p>
      <p>
        And then, a voice filled with kindness and gentleness, Seo Hweol's
        voice, begins to be heard.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Closing this diary means, Seo Ran, that you have survived without using
        the space-breaking bead and somehow reached the Sea Dragon Palace. Jeon
        Hyang thought he hid the diary well in front of me... but unfortunately
        for him, he didn’t.]
      </p>
      <p>“What...!”</p>
      <p>
        [Regrettably, Ran-ah, that was the extent of your role. Liberating the
        souls of the Sea Dragon Tribe warriors trapped in the Nether Crossing
        Ship was your last utility, and your continued existence is now just an
        obstacle... So, rest now. Go to your mother and father’s side.]
      </p>
      <p>Crack, crackle!</p>
      <p>I struggle desperately to break free from Seo Hweol's grasp.</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>The entire Sea Dragon Palace suddenly begins to tremble.</p>
      <p>"Seo Hweol...!"</p>
      <p>
        Translator Notes: Adding “-ah” is like “Xiao” in Chinese. It’s a suffix
        added to names to denote affection or familiarity, a term of endearment.
        I made sure to include it to further highlight Seo Hweol’s hypocrisy and
        heartlessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        凡夫 is a term used in Buddhism and Taoism to describe someone that is
        not spiritually enlightened, in contrast to the sages and those with
        spiritual understanding. It means Ordinary Person but to fit in the
        context of the setting and meaning, I translated it as ignorant mortal.

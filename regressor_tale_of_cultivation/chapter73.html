      <p>Chapter 73: Eve (6)</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        A black miasma of yin energy surge, and the compressed space within the
        Nether Crossing Ship bursts open.
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>I retreat as far as possible to avoid being swept away.</p>
      <p>
        The inner decks of the Nether Crossing Ship expand endlessly, shattering
        the barriers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sea Fog Barrier is destroyed, and the Illusionary Barrier shatters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless ghosts trapped in the Sea Fog Barrier ascend into the sky, and
        the mass of yin energy that had accumulated begins to dissipate.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the source of the yin energy vanishes, the nearby dark clouds and
        storms start to disappear as if melting away.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>Waves cover the debris.</p>
      <p>
        I watch the debris, equivalent to the size of the mountain range where
        the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect once stood, and silently mourn
        for my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran's body was nowhere to be found, likely swept away by the spatial
        storm.
      </p>
      <p>
        For days, I searched for his remains, but to no avail. Eventually, I
        held a small ritual to honor his spirit and then headed to his abode.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Gliding over the water, my thoughts were heavy with not only Seo Ran's
        death but also the truths he had revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Have I, in my ignorance, handed over two comrades to a dragon who bred
        humans like livestock for elixirs?'
      </p>
      <p>Seo Hweol, outwardly, seemed incapable of such acts.</p>
      <p>
        He didn't have a bad reputation like the Mad Lord and was known for his
        dignified demeanor.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I thought he was the second most likable person after Sir Chang-ho and
        entrusted my colleagues to him...'
      </p>
      <p>But it turned out to be the worst decision.</p>
      <p>'Damn...'</p>
      <p>Had I, with my own hands, committed the most dreadful sin?</p>
      <p>I clench my teeth, lost in complicated thoughts.</p>
      <p>
        'In my ignorance, I handed my colleagues over to the worst being
        possible...'
      </p>
      <p>I can't afford to be ignorant anymore.</p>
      <p>I must gather as much information as possible!</p>
      <p>With that resolve, I head to Seo Ran's underwater cave.</p>
      <p>
        Upon reaching his place, the blue bead Seo Ran gave me emitted light,
        revealing hidden cave entrances.
      </p>
      <p>I cautiously enter the hidden entrances.</p>
      <p>There are three in total.</p>
      <p>
        One was Seo Ran's living space, likely used when he was in his
        demi-human form, with a sturdy bed and human-level living facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another is a space filled with numerous materials – bones and skins of
        demon beasts, unique woods, and stones.
      </p>
      <p>The last is a library.</p>
      <p>
        Inside are numerous, extensive volumes of demon beast methods and books,
        real techniques of the Sea Dragon race, not slave or livestock methods
        like the Summoning Wind, Coagulating Core Transformation I had learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I carefully examine the demon beast methods, sending a silent thanks to
        Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>'Thank you, Seo Ran...'</p>
      <p>I take out the demon beast method books.</p>
      <p>Not only those but also other books, which I began to read.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran, being a demi-human hybrid, had a collection covering not only
        Yanguo, Byeokra, and Shengzi but also other human nations.
      </p>
      <p>I pick out the most worn books and read them.</p>
      <p>
        Among them are demon beast methods, histories of the Sea Dragon Tribe,
        and books about human nations.
      </p>
      <p>[Culture of Yanguo]</p>
      <p>I read one book and then another.</p>
      <p>[Culture of Shengzi]</p>
      <p>
        'Shengzi's mountainous region culture involves festivals held once a
        year...'
      </p>
      <p>
        'The types of festivals include the centuries-old Great Stone Ceremony,
        Recounting Celebration Ceremony, and Twin Immortals Dance...'
      </p>
      <p>I move on to the next book.</p>
      <p>[Culture of Byeokra]</p>
      <p>
        'Byeokra, bordering the desert, is known for its glass crafts, and
        there's even a culture of offering glass crafts to the deceased...'
      </p>
      <p>There are also books about the culture of the Upper Realms.</p>
      <p>[Life of the Upper Realm People]</p>
      <p>
        This book, especially, seemed to have been read by Seo Ran with great
        interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Before marrying in the Upper Realms, couples share two cups of wine
        with each other...'
      </p>
      <p>
        'Among the wines of the Upper Realms are Mo-ryeong Wine, Gye-ryeong
        Elixir, Twin Immortals Wine... and White-Red Wine, a symbolic wine for
        couples made from white lotus and red pear flowers...'
      </p>
      <p>I read on about the various aspects of the Upper Realms' culture.</p>
      <p>In a particularly worn page, I read,</p>
      <p>
        'In the Upper Realms, families wear purple ribbons during family
        gatherings...'
      </p>
      <p>Family.</p>
      <p>
        This section is particularly well-thumbed, as if the reader had lingered
        on it often.
      </p>
      <p>Seo ran's image of reading the book came to mind.</p>
      <p>He might have been reading books here for years.</p>
      <p>I imagine him wandering around the library.</p>
      <p>
        The books about the Sea Dragon Tribe are also heavily worn by his hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially, the records about the mixed blood of the Sea Dragon Tribe
        and the human race are immensely worn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right behind that record, there is a sentence that seemed to have been
        written by Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Typical mixed blood possesses the advantages of both the human race and
        the demon race, but I have such strong demon blood that I can't even
        utilize the human advantages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not entirely wild as a demon. Maybe that's why other members of the
        Sea Dragon Tribe dislike me."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Still, the King patted my head, saying there must be something I can do
        for the Sea Dragon Tribe."
      </p>
      <p>"I will remain loyal to the King and Grandfather Seo Hweol."</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        It seems the reason Seo Ran couldn't pass through the barrier of the
        Nether Crossing Ship was because of his stronger demon blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        While reading the pledge of loyalty to Seo Hweol, I couldn't bear to
        read more of Seo Ran's records and closed the book.
      </p>
      <p>"...I hope you find peace in the afterlife. Seo Hyung."</p>
      <p>
        I gather the demon beast methods from his quarters and head to Yanguo.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I was powerless and weak, unable to do anything. But I will use this as
        a foundation to reach a new future."
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon, based on the demon beast methods, would be able to
        reduce many trials and errors again.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next life, I'll do everything possible to prevent Seo Ran from
        dying.
      </p>
      <p>"This is...!"</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon read the demon beast methods I brought, his eyes nearly
        rolling back in excitement.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you..! This will reduce a lot of trial and error!"</p>
      <p>"That's good to hear."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's face brightens as he reads through the pile of methods
        I brought.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘With this, I wonder if Kim Hyung will be able to see beyond the
        Ultimate Pinnacle in this life…’
      </p>
      <p>
        He happily looks through the methods, organizing the many martial arts
        he had practiced using only Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I told Kim Young-hoon that I will practice cultivation and said I would
        be at the Shattered Heaven Peak in the great mountains of Shengzi, then
        headed there.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I've mastered both the Earth and Water Surpassing Paths. Now I should
        fully master the Fire, Metal, and Wood Surpassing Paths to Cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought that if I familiarized myself with the other element methods,
        I could learn them even faster in the next life.
      </p>
      <p>But when I arrived near Shattered Heaven Peak...</p>
      <p>"There’s a barrier..!"</p>
      <p>I stop and examine the barrier.</p>
      <p>After a while, some figures emerge from within the barrier.</p>
      <p>
        "Damn, now that I think about it. Since the Golden Divine Heavenly
        Thunder Sect is gone, it wouldn't be strange if the noble clans of
        Shengzi have taken over where the sect used to be.."
      </p>
      <p>I feel a headache coming on and look around.</p>
      <p>Shattered Heaven Peak isn't just a single peak.</p>
      <p>
        Most of the mountainous area where the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder
        Sect was located is called Shattered Heaven Peak, and among the many
        peaks, there are places not occupied by noble clans because the dragon
        veins are weak.
      </p>
      <p>"Good, I'll practice there."</p>
      <p>
        I went to a small, inconspicuous peak with moderate dragon veins, sat in
        a lotus position, and began to practice.
      </p>
      <p>This time, I plan to master the Fire Surpassing Path.</p>
      <p>Years passed.</p>
      <p>
        After many years, I finally mastered the Fire Surpassing Path to
        Cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>Ku-ku-ku-ku-</p>
      <p>Three-colored clouds swirl in my dantian.</p>
      <p>"My recovery power... has increased to an amazing level."</p>
      <p>It’s an unbelievable level of recovery.</p>
      <p>
        Even if my cultivation falls to 12th Star due to attempting Qi Building,
        I can recover in a day or two.
      </p>
      <p>But I have only about 10 years left to live.</p>
      <p>"It's futile to try mastering all five elemental methods."</p>
      <p>Four would be my limit.</p>
      <p>But I won't give up.</p>
      <p>Based on the time of this life.</p>
      <p>
        Using the connections of this life as fertilizer, I can sprout new life.
      </p>
      <p>No, I must sprout it!</p>
      <p>Ku-ku!</p>
      <p>I once again attempt Qi Building.</p>
      <p>Again, my spiritual star breaks, and my cultivation falls.</p>
      <p>
        But the three-colored spiritual power in my dantian begins to recover.
      </p>
      <p>"In a day or two, it will all be restored."</p>
      <p>
        Honestly, with this level of recovery power, I feel that even with just
        my Qi Refining skills, I could compete with those who had just entered
        the early stages of Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>Ku-ku-ku-ku-</p>
      <p>
        I observe the swirling spiritual power in my dantian and begin to
        recover my cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>Two days later.</p>
      <p>
        I fully recover to 14th Star Qi Refining and immediately start
        practicing the Metal Surpassing Path.
      </p>
      <p>There is no time to waste.</p>
      <p>I have to elevate my realm as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>Chaaaak!</p>
      <p>A white, metal spiritual power spreads around me.</p>
      <p>My lifespan is almost over.</p>
      <p>
        I have just reached the 9th Star in the Metal Surpassing Path, and
        within my dantian, four colors of spiritual power are swirling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yellow earth energy, black water energy, red fire energy, and white
        metal energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the three-colored clouds, the white energy swirls only a bit, but
        even that slight change lets me feel an increase and decrease in
        recovery power and time.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Now, even if I fall in cultivation due to attempting Qi Building, I can
        raise all the elements of the fully mastered spiritual power back to
        14th Star in half a day..!'
      </p>
      <p>
        If I fully master the Metal Surpassing Path, perhaps I could restore all
        my spiritual power in just an hour or two.
      </p>
      <p>'There isn't much time left..'</p>
      <p>That's when it happened.</p>
      <p>Paah!</p>
      <p>"...?"</p>
      <p>
        The transmission bead I had given to Kim Young-hoon lit up brightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'm currently in Shengzi. Let's meet in the capital city of Jingju
        outside the Great Mountains.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The bead turns off after that message, but I immediately get up and head
        outside the Great Mountains.
      </p>
      <p>'That voice, it sounded resolute.'</p>
      <p>What could it be?</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon was waiting for me at the entrance of Jingju city in
        Shengzi.
      </p>
      <p>"You're here."</p>
      <p>"Kim Hyung."</p>
      <p>"First, let's talk somewhere secluded."</p>
      <p>"Yes, if you wish."</p>
      <p>
        I follow Kim Young-hoon to a secluded valley deep within the Great
        Mountains.
      </p>
      <p>"What brings you here?"</p>
      <p>
        He had been busy researching demon beast methods and hadn't contacted me
        even once.
      </p>
      <p>I am happy to see him, but his complexion seems a bit off today.</p>
      <p>I know that face too well.</p>
      <p>The face I had seen on many others, and the color of their intent.</p>
      <p>It is the face of someone nearing death.</p>
      <p>"Kim... Hyung?"</p>
      <p>"...Eun-hyun."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon smiles bitterly.</p>
      <p>"How long do I have left to live.."</p>
      <p>"What...?"</p>
      <p>
        "Maybe, 10 years. Maybe 20 more years. But I'm just a mortal, not a
        cultivator. I can't live long..."
      </p>
      <p>He draws a saber from his waist.</p>
      <p>
        "Even with the demon beast methods you gave me, I had to go through many
        trials and errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through those trials, though time-consuming... I have succeeded in
        finding 'the real path.' Something beyond simply transforming human
        consciousness into human form..."
      </p>
      <p>"....!"</p>
      <p>"But it's too late."</p>
      <p>Drip, drip...</p>
      <p>Tears fall from Kim Young-hoon's eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "If I knew there was such a realm from the start and focused precisely
        on it through numerous hardships... Now, just 10 or 20 years is too
        little time to reach it!
      </p>
      <p>Even I... need time.."</p>
      <p>"Kim Hyung.."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's lifespan is a bit longer than mine.</p>
      <p>But even he has a limit due to being a mortal.</p>
      <p>"I'm confident I can reach it, but I don't have enough time.."</p>
      <p>He grits his teeth and raises his head.</p>
      <p>
        "I dreamt of mastering martial arts to return to my family... but it
        seems like a vain dream now.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as much as that, I've decided to see the completion of this martial
        art with my own eyes before I die, even if I can't return to my
        family...!"
      </p>
      <p>There is a strange madness in his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "Eun-hyun, I came here today to die! I will burn my life, all my talent,
        even if just for a moment I can reach the next realm before I die!"
      </p>
      <p>He takes out a book from his bosom.</p>
      <p>
        Unlike the Record of Surpassing Path and Martial Arts filled with his
        trials, this book is thin.
      </p>
      <p>There is no title on the book yet.</p>
      <p>'Is everyone leaving me...'</p>
      <p>Seo Ran, and now Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>I close and open my eyes with a heavy heart.</p>
      <p>I can't stop him.</p>
      <p>All I can do is watch.</p>
      <p>Watch and pass it on in the next life.</p>
      <p>Whisk!</p>
      <p>He throws the book to me, and I catch it.</p>
      <p>"...What is this called?"</p>
      <p>Record of Transcending Cultivation and Martial Arts.</p>
      <p>Record of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts.</p>
      <p>Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts...</p>
      <p>And the Record of Surpassing Path and Martial Arts.</p>
      <p>
        A new history of martial arts built up by the determination and blood of
        numerous Kim Young-hoons.
      </p>
      <p>"What does this record contain?"</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon smiles.</p>
      <p>Somehow, his smile feels laced with bitterness.</p>
      <p>"It's not a record."</p>
      <p>"Yes..?"</p>
      <p>"Martial...it's a martial philosophy (武學)!"</p>
      <p>Chaek!</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon takes his stance with his saber in hand.</p>
      <p>
        "What I've poured my entire being, breaking down the old and forging it
        anew into..."
      </p>
      <p>His aura begins to change.</p>
      <p>
        Nine Gang Spheres appear around Kim Young-hoon, and I open my eyes wide.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Let's call it the Beyond the Path to Heaven Martial Arts (越道入天武)!"

      <p>Chapter 142: Madman (2)</p>
      <p>Click, click, click...</p>
      <p>The mechanical devices around me begin to operate.</p>
      <p>I look around for any possibility of escape.</p>
      <p>'I should give up on talking more to this madman.'</p>
      <p>The answer is clear - I am to be modified regardless.</p>
      <p>'Should I suicide?'</p>
      <p>But then...</p>
      <p>I remember Kim Yeon, who has just been captured by the bee puppet.</p>
      <p>
        'If I die like this, will Team Leader Kim be left alone with this madman
        and undergo the same modifications...?'
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't fully realized the insanity of this lunatic until our
        face-to-face encounter, but now it is clear.
      </p>
      <p>I can't leave Kim Yeon alone with the Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>'Suicide... let's not think about that now.'</p>
      <p>So, is escape possible?</p>
      <p>
        'If I use the Formless Sword to cut the circuits of the surrounding
        puppets and escape...'
      </p>
      <p>But that too seems impossible.</p>
      <p>
        It might have worked against Yuan Li, who’s at the Nascent Soul stage,
        but not against this Mad Lord, a Heavenly Being at Grand Perfection, and
        his Four-Axis level puppets.
      </p>
      <p>I’m in the lion's den.</p>
      <p>'Damn it.'</p>
      <p>While I’m contemplating,</p>
      <p>Kuaguagua!</p>
      <p>Numerous puppet arms descend from the ceiling towards my position.</p>
      <p>In shock, I evade the puppet arms with a defensive maneuver.</p>
      <p>[Hmm? You dodged?]</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord's eyes shimmers as I evaded.</p>
      <p>‘Shit...'</p>
      <p>I feel a sense of hopelessness.</p>
      <p>
        If things continue this way, I might not only have an arm modified, but
        my entire body might be forcibly changed. Fear grips me.
      </p>
      <p>I look at the Mad Lord and force a smile.</p>
      <p>"…I'll go willingly."</p>
      <p>
        [Oh, sure. That's a good decision. Lie down. I'll attach something new
        and pretty to you.]
      </p>
      <p>"…."</p>
      <p>I grit my teeth and lay down on the operating table.</p>
      <p>'I wonder if this madman will use anesthesia.'</p>
      <p>I have little hope in this lawless era.</p>
      <p>
        I’m accustomed to the pain of having an arm torn off without anesthesia,
        but I’m worried about Kim Yeon.
      </p>
      <p>'If she gets modified, I should make some anesthesia for her.'</p>
      <p>As expected.</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord approached, and the puppet arms descended from the ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>[Let’s see, open your mouth.]</p>
      <p>
        He says, inserting his hand into my mouth to open it and peers inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Hoho, hoho, hoho… Good, good. I had a hunch from seeing your body
        movements, but you’re a martial artist, aren’t you?
      </p>
      <p>"Uhh, uh."</p>
      <p>
        [Yes, yes. I understand. I don’t know if you heard the rumors, but I
        have a reputation for treating martial artists well. Seeing your teeth,
        you’re an incredible one who reached the Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin. Very good. You are immensely talented, so I will treat you well.
        Now, it's going to shock a bit, so bear with it for a moment.]
      </p>
      <p>"…?"</p>
      <p>Pijjiijijiiit!</p>
      <p>Suddenly, I’m enveloped in a massive electric shock.</p>
      <p>I clench my teeth and endure the shock.</p>
      <p>'He's using lightning as anesthesia?'</p>
      <p>After a while,</p>
      <p>I remain conscious amidst being electrocuted.</p>
      <p>The shock subsides, and the Mad Lord looks at me.</p>
      <p>
        [Hmm? What, you didn't faint? I even used lightning to anesthetize you.
        You have impressive mental strength!]
      </p>
      <p>'Is using lightning as anesthesia normal?'</p>
      <p>While I’m dumbfounded, the Mad Lord grins.</p>
      <p>
        [With such strong mental fortitude, you can probably endure being
        modified while conscious.]
      </p>
      <p>Click!</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, a gag is forced into my mouth, and my limbs are
        restrained.
      </p>
      <p>
        'This damned thing! If the anesthesia didn't work, shouldn't he have
        tried again?'
      </p>
      <p>Then, the puppet arms and devices converge on my left arm.</p>
      <p>Hiss...</p>
      <p>"…."</p>
      <p>
        [Perfect! It turned out truly excellent! Bravo! Not even twitching
        during the modification, I have obtained a truly great disciple!]
      </p>
      <p>I sigh and stand up from the operating table.</p>
      <p>'I'm worried about Team Leader Kim Yeon.'</p>
      <p>
        It’s only because it’s me that I didn't flinch and endured this insane
        modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a normal person, no, even for a typical Core Formation or Nascent
        Soul cultivator, the pain felt from the recent modification is not
        something to easily dismiss.
      </p>
      <p>Click, click...</p>
      <p>I lift my left arm.</p>
      <p>
        For a sudden modification by this madman, the new arm truthfully seems
        quite useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the arm, numerous spiritual energy circuits are tightly packed,
        and the arm moves smoothly according to my will.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I infuse consciousness into it, the sensations in the arm feel
        quite real.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s more than adequate as a prosthetic, and I can sense many embedded
        functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Now, now. Firstly, the basic energy source is designed to absorb energy
        from the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress’s energy source when inside.
        When outside, it will draw on your energy, using it as its energy
        source. Have a test of its performance.]
      </p>
      <p>Click, click, click!</p>
      <p>
        In one corner of the Mad Lord's workshop, several target-like objects
        suddenly sprung up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The puppet arm given by the Mad Lord transmitted instructions on how to
        operate it through my consciousness when I infused it with my
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>Click!</p>
      <p>
        When I extend my left hand and concentrate my consciousness, energy
        gathers in my palm.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        A bright white beam shoots out, instantly turning three targets into
        ash.
      </p>
      <p>'…Never thought I'd shoot beams from my hand.'</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        When I slightly curl my fingers, spiritual energy gathers at the tips,
        forming bright white nails made of Pure Spiritual Force.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh, woosh!</p>
      <p>
        As I swing my hand, the nails extend at will, slicing through the
        targets.
      </p>
      <p>Keeng, click click!</p>
      <p>
        When I clench my fist, various parts of the arm open, revealing nozzles.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Spiritual energy bursts forth from the nozzles, and I fly forward with
        my fist, smashing another target to pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems like it will be useful for enhancing the power of my punches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just from this demonstration, it appears that an ordinary first-rate
        martial artist with just this arm can rival a Qi Refining cultivator at
        the 10th or 11th star.
      </p>
      <p>Of course…</p>
      <p>'All of these functions can be performed with the Formless Sword.'</p>
      <p>
        In my case, with such a high cultivation level, these abilities feel
        somewhat superfluous.
      </p>
      <p>
        These functions feel more like additional capabilities, and the true
        power of the puppet arm must be something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Harmony… It perfectly harmonizes with my body, which has reached the
        Five Energies Converging to the Origin. There's no discrepancy, and the
        flow of vital force (Qi) and blood is natural.'
      </p>
      <p>
        The natural movement and feeling, as well as the balance of the arm,
        seems to be its real advantages.
      </p>
      <p>And, the real reason the Mad Lord made this arm is evidently…</p>
      <p>[What are you doing? Try pulling that out, will you?]</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>The Formless Sword emerges through the left arm.</p>
      <p>[Hoho! It comes out even through that arm!]</p>
      <p>
        He seemed curious if the Formless Sword, formed through heart essence,
        could be emitted through the puppet arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Aside from being attached to my body, it's no different from a dharma
        treasure.'
      </p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword always had the ability to be used in conjunction with
        a dharma treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s no different than overlaying the Formless Sword onto a glass sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord seems to have some inspiration, licking his lips while
        muttering to himself as he looks at my arm.
      </p>
      <p>Then, with sparkling eyes, he suddenly shakes his head.</p>
      <p>[Hmm, hmm…. Alright, that's enough. You can go now.]</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>A bee puppet for transportation appears in the room.</p>
      <p>
        [This fellow will guide you to your new quarters. For now, rest for
        today. I'll start instructing you tomorrow.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord doesn't wait for my response. He approaches the Four-Axis
        wooden man and begins to work like a lunatic.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>I fly off with the bee puppet to somewhere else.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        I land in a grand estate located deep within the Wonderfully Mysterious
        Fortress, having flown through space.
      </p>
      <p>
        The estate is decorated just like a real one, with lush grass, trees,
        and small animals and insects.
      </p>
      <p>Servants are moving around, cleaning and maintaining the estate.</p>
      <p>But I feel a chill.</p>
      <p>'Not a single living thing.'</p>
      <p>
        The grass and trees are intricately made puppets, as are the insects,
        small animals, and the servants.
      </p>
      <p>Click, click…</p>
      <p>As I look around, the servant puppets approach and bow to me.</p>
      <p>"Are you going to guide me?"</p>
      <p>Click, click…</p>
      <p>A servant puppet nods, and I follow it deeper into the estate.</p>
      <p>It shows me my quarters and various places around the estate.</p>
      <p>'It feels desolate.'</p>
      <p>Though the puppets are kind, this lifeless place is suffocating.</p>
      <p>As I look around,</p>
      <p>'Hmm?'</p>
      <p>I sense a faint trace of life energy in the distance.</p>
      <p>'This energy is…'</p>
      <p>I leap towards the source of the energy.</p>
      <p>It’s in an estate next to where I was.</p>
      <p>
        In a corner of the estate, Team Leader Kim Yeon is sitting on a rock,
        dressed in new clothes, looking dazed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wearing a pale pink attire, her face is filled with confusion and fear
        as she watches the servant puppets working.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>I land beside her.</p>
      <p>"Ah, Deputy Seo?"</p>
      <p>As I land next to her, relief flickers across her face.</p>
      <p>
        "I'm so glad! I don't understand what's happening, this place is too
        horrifying. And these grass and trees! They're all like robots, right?
        There's not a single living thing here! What should we do now?"
      </p>
      <p>"…"</p>
      <p>I look at the terrified face of Kim Yeon and sigh.</p>
      <p>"Team Leader Kim, please listen to me carefully."</p>
      <p>
        I wanted to console her, but having undergone the modification of one
        arm, my mood had hardened.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now, you must forget about the modern society we lived in. In this
        world, there are no such things as human rights. That insane Mad Lord
        who kidnapped us might modify us whenever he’s in the mood."
      </p>
      <p>Click...</p>
      <p>I show my left arm to Kim Yeon.</p>
      <p>Her face, initially failing to understand, turns pale.</p>
      <p>"That, what is that? Deputy Seo, you're joking... right?"</p>
      <p>"Team Leader Kim."</p>
      <p>I grab her shoulder and look into her eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "This is no joke. Please listen to me carefully. You might not
        understand, but let me explain this world to you."
      </p>
      <p>I slowly explain to her about this world.</p>
      <p>Martial artists, demon beasts, cultivators...</p>
      <p>Martial arts, spells, the upper and lower realms.</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord Jo Yeon, and the story about him and [Her].</p>
      <p>What Kim Yeon's awakened vast consciousness means.</p>
      <p>"...This is the kind of world we are in. Do you understand?"</p>
      <p>"I... still don't quite..."</p>
      <p>"Let me show you, it'll be faster."</p>
      <p>I form a hand seal.</p>
      <p>
        The puppet arm that has become part of me has no problem channeling Pure
        Spiritual Force, and since it’s much stronger than my original arm,
        there’s no issue in using spells.
      </p>
      <p>"Release (解)!"</p>
      <p>Chalalak!</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the Blood Body Skin Armor that has been boosting my
        regeneration inside my body is released.
      </p>
      <p>Chururururu!</p>
      <p>
        The blood that has seeped into my body falls to the side, trickling back
        into Yuan Li's Blood Body.
      </p>
      <p>Churuk, churururuk...</p>
      <p>
        The Blood Body, which has continuously given me increased regeneration,
        causes my cultivation to drop from late Core Formation to early Qi
        Refining.
      </p>
      <p>"What in the world is this..."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Yeon's eyes widen in shock as she looks at the Blood Body. I form a
        seal with the hand of the Blood Body.
      </p>
      <p>Hwarururuk!</p>
      <p>
        Flames burst from the hand of the Blood Body, and all sorts of
        extraordinary spells appear.
      </p>
      <p>"Now do you believe me? This world is full of such bizarre things."</p>
      <p>
        "I believe it. It's just... I was confused if it was a dream or not. I
        wish someone would tell me it's just a terrible nightmare."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>Kim Yeon tiredly covers her face with both hands.</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle...</p>
      <p>Chalak!</p>
      <p>
        The veins of the Blood Body writhes, and a small centipede bursts out
        from inside.
      </p>
      <p>'Ah, I had forgotten about this little one.'</p>
      <p>
        I had placed it inside the Blood Body, boosting its regeneration ability
        to withstand the spatial pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, given the pressure, it must have burst dozens of times, but
        thanks to the Blood Body, it kept regenerating.
      </p>
      <p>'I feel a bit sorry for it...'</p>
      <p>
        I blocked its pain through the Blood Body, but still, its body burst
        several times.
      </p>
      <p>'For now, stay inside.'</p>
      <p>
        I manipulate the Blood Body to take the centipede back into its veins
        and cover it with flesh, pushing it inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, it’s difficult to recklessly
        bring it out.
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kim Yeon looks a bit calmer and asks,</p>
      <p>
        "But Deputy Seo, how do you know all these things? And this woman…no is
        it a man? Anyway, what is this person?”
      </p>
      <p>
        "Team Leader Kim, as I mentioned, similar to you, all our colleagues
        have awakened strange abilities."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>
        "I'm the same. This body, neither male nor female, is part of the
        abilities I've awakened to, and so is the knowledge I possess."
      </p>
      <p>"Is that so? Oh right, about my ability..."</p>
      <p>"And!"</p>
      <p>I interrupted her.</p>
      <p>"Do not reveal whatever ability you have acquired, no matter what."</p>
      <p>"Why? There's only the two of us here..."</p>
      <p>
        "That's not the issue. It's hard to explain but... can you promise me
        you won't reveal it?"
      </p>
      <p>Squeeze...</p>
      <p>I hold Kim Yeon's hands and look into her eyes.</p>
      <p>Her face flushes red.</p>
      <p>"Yes, yes! I promise. You'll tell me… later, right?"</p>
      <p>"In due time, I will."</p>
      <p>I look at her intent and smile bitterly.</p>
      <p>"So promise me. Keep your secret until death, if necessary."</p>
      <p>"Yes, yes..."</p>
      <p>Looking at her intent, I ponder.</p>
      <p>'It'll be hard to leave her behind in the future.'</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon might feel a bit regretful about parting ways with me,
        but he’ll excitedly venture off on his own journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I don't know what would happen to her in her current state if
        we parted ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        I inform Kim Yeon of a few precautions and teach her a bit more about
        this world.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, our first day in the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress passed.</p>
      <p>From the next day, we received various methods from the Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>
        Basic Qi Refining methods and a method called Wonderfully Mysterious
        Heart Canon.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Wonderfully Mysterious Heart Canon is a type of consciousness
        method. It focuses on training and further developing consciousness.
        It's also a crucial method for controlling the residents of the
        Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress. Until reaching Qi Refining, you should
        learn the Wonderfully Mysterious Heart Canon, and once your
        consciousness becomes stable in the Qi Building stage, I will teach you
        my true consciousness method, the Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart
        Canon."
      </p>
      <p>
        Given that it's meant for controlling the puppets of the Wonderfully
        Mysterious Fortress, it seems to be a consciousness method optimized for
        puppetry.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that day, I helped Kim Yeon with her consciousness method training
        and aided her in mastering the basic Qi Refining methods.
      </p>
      <p>Half a year passed.</p>
      <p>
        Atop the valley where the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress is located.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugu!</p>
      <p>
        After half a year, I see five strands of spiritual energy clouds
        revolving around me.
      </p>
      <p>'Incredible speed.'</p>
      <p>
        Despite not having the Demon Core of the fox and just absorbing the
        spiritual energy from the atmosphere, relying on Understanding before
        Breakthrough, I reached the completion in Five Surpassing Paths to
        Cultivation in just half a year.
      </p>
      <p>In this state, I seem likely to reach Qi Building within a month.</p>
      <p>And Kim Yeon is currently...</p>
      <p>Kurung Kurung!</p>
      <p>
        On the other side of the valley, she failed the Seven Stars Ritual,
        biting her lips anxiously.
      </p>
      <p>Heavenly Rejection.</p>
      <p>I didn't know about it during Kim Young-hoon's time but…</p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, it’s a phenomenon appearing to us who have come from the
        modern world.
      </p>
      <p>"I failed again... What should I do?"</p>
      <p>She asks in a trembling voice.</p>
      <p>I pat her shoulder.</p>
      <p>But she flinches and steps back.</p>
      <p>Over the past half year.</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord has modified not only my left arm but both arms into puppet
        arms, and the one I used to pat her shoulder feels like hard wood rather
        than human flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        I, too, have experienced Heavenly Rejection in the Bright Cold Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in my case, I overcame the phenomenon by tearing through the
        clouds with the beam emitted from the puppet arm given by the Mad Lord,
        without needing to shoot a Gang Sphere.
      </p>
      <p>This means...</p>
      <p>"Deputy Seo... what about me? If the Mad Lord, my, my arms too..."</p>
      <p>
        If Kim Yeon can't overcome Heavenly Rejection she too might be modified
        by the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...There's still time. The next ritual isn't far away so let’s try
        again then. And the Mad Lord as expected..."
      </p>
      <p>I look at her consciousness domain.</p>
      <p>
        Unlike half a year ago, when her consciousness was scattered wildly, her
        consciousness, having learned the Mad Lord's method, is now calmly
        enveloping the heavens and earth in a spherical shape.
      </p>
      <p>"Team Leader Kim won't be modified recklessly like me."</p>
      <p>I look down at the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress.</p>
      <p>Half a year.</p>
      <p>
        After imparting the consciousness method and basic Qi Refining methods
        to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord, intending to create a Four-Axis stage puppet again, has
        been holed up in his workshop in the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress for
        several months, modifying the corpse of the Four-Axis wooden man.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How can you be sure of that? The Mad Lord said he would come out of the
        workshop in two months, right? If I still haven't finished the Seven
        Stars Ritual by then..."
      </p>
      <p>She looks at my arm with a face full of fear.</p>
      <p>'Heavenly Rejection Phenomenon...'</p>
      <p>I look at the clouds dispersing in the sky, lost in thought.</p>
      <p>
        "Team Leader Kim, how far have you progressed in the Wonderfully
        Mysterious Heart Canon?"
      </p>
      <p>"11 stars."</p>
      <p>
        With the Wonderfully Mysterious Heart Canon consisting of a total of 12
        stars, she is just one step away from mastery.
      </p>
      <p>"Perhaps, you might overcome Heavenly Rejection."</p>
      <p>"How so?"</p>
      <p>I show her the puppet arms.</p>
      <p>
        "If the power of the puppet is considered 'my' power, then perhaps if
        Team Leader Kim commands the puppets..."
      </p>
      <p>"No, I don't want to!"</p>
      <p>However, Kim Yeon shakes her head, making a pained face.</p>
      <p>
        "Deputy Seo, you already know! To control those puppets, I have to..."
      </p>
      <p>I sigh softly.</p>
      <p>
        Certainly, it would have been easier if we could freely command the
        puppets of the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress.
      </p>
      <p>But there’s a problem with the Fortress's puppets.</p>
      <p>"I’m telling you my mind becomes strange."</p>
      <p>
        As Buk Hyang-hwa's research on the bee puppet's circuitry had shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        The puppets of the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress contain circuits
        corresponding to the seven emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        And these circuits are interconnected with all the puppets existing
        throughout the Fortress.
      </p>
      <p>When manipulating a lone bee puppet, there are no issues.</p>
      <p>
        But when trying to manipulate the interconnected circuits of all the
        Fortress's puppets, it feels as though the circuits are alive, eroding
        the manipulator's consciousness. The puppeteer will inevitably become
        mentally unstable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed to match the Mad Lord's lunacy, the puppets of the Wonderfully
        Mysterious Fortress are such that anyone other than the Mad Lord who
        tries to manipulate them will become assimilated with him, causing their
        mind to fragment.
      </p>
      <p>This is the difficulty Kim Yeon is currently facing.</p>
      <p>
        'Even with overwhelming talent, she's being held back by the Heavenly
        Rejection Phenomenon…’
      </p>
      <p>I watch her with concern, deep in thought. Then, I say to her,</p>
      <p>"I can't directly help you pierce the heavens."</p>
      <p>"…Then…"</p>
      <p>"But I will try to help you in any way I can."</p>
      <p>"Ah!"</p>
      <p>I look down at my puppet arms.</p>
      <p>
        With her normal mind, she won't be able to withstand the modification
        surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is even if she’s knocked out with electricity before the surgery,
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Mad Lord, after finishing the Four-Axis puppet, learns that she
        is still at the 7th Star of Qi Refining due to Heavenly Rejection, he
        will likely modify her arms as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I might not be able to completely prevent the Mad Lord from modifying
        her, but I'll do my best to... delay it.'
      </p>
      <p>I make this resolve while looking at the terrified Kim Yeon.</p>
      <p>A month passes.</p>
      <p>Kugugu!</p>
      <p>I have reached Qi Building.</p>
      <p>Familiar Pure Spiritual Force flows within my body.</p>
      <p>Kururung!</p>
      <p>
        After splitting the Heavenly Lightning falling towards me and scattering
        the dark clouds,
      </p>
      <p>
        I continue to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and
        practice my methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next cultivation method to practice after the Five Surpassing Paths
        to Cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>Yin Soul Ghost Incantation.</p>
      <p>Patsususus....</p>
      <p>
        Yin Soul Ghost Incantation is not a method where cultivation rises 'when
        feeling pain,' but 'when understanding pain.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the key is 'understanding,' I managed to reach the peak of early
        Qi Building just a day after entering Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>Dark curse scripts circle around my entire body.</p>
      <p>And with this, I should be able to help Kim Yeon.</p>
      <p>'The day after tomorrow is Kim Yeon's Seven Stars Ritual.'</p>
      <p>
        I intend to assist her Seven Stars Ritual through the Yin Soul Ghost
        Incantation.
      </p>
      <p>"Manipulate the puppets?"</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>I speak, looking at the puppets.</p>
      <p>
        "You might feel the madness, but try infusing your consciousness into
        them."
      </p>
      <p>"...Okay."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Yeon, after seeing my firm gaze, nods and extends her consciousness
        towards the puppets.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>The residents of the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress.</p>
      <p>
        The numerous Qi Refining and Qi Building puppets there begin to move.
      </p>
      <p>And then,</p>
      <p>"Ugh, ugh..."</p>
      <p>
        Kim Yeon holds her head, enduring the madness of the Mad Lord with pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold her shoulder and try to align my heart essence as closely as
        possible with hers.
      </p>
      <p>Then,</p>
      <p>
        "Team Leader Kim, I will overlay my consciousness on yours. Please try
        to match the frequency of your consciousness with the structure of the
        Wonderfully Mysterious Heart Canon."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, yes...!"</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>Team Leader Kim Yeon's consciousness and mine align for a moment.</p>
      <p>
        At that instant, the madness of the puppets of the Wonderfully
        Mysterious Fortress, which she is manipulating through her
        consciousness, begins to flood in.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaddeuk!</p>
      <p>Sticky madness.</p>
      <p>
        This madness is unpleasant not just because it causes mental
        fragmentation.
      </p>
      <p>Wriggle, wriggle...</p>
      <p>
        The madness pushes aside the original personality of the manipulator,
        gradually taking over the flesh, and tries to dominate the consciousness
        of the puppeteer.
      </p>
      <p>But this time, it chose the wrong opponent.</p>
      <p>Uddeuk!</p>
      <p>
        I take all the pain Kim Yeon is experiencing and transfer it to myself,
        using curses to make myself a voodoo doll.
      </p>
      <p>Pisit, pisit!</p>
      <p>
        Blood vessels burst in various parts of my head, and blood trickles from
        my nose.
      </p>
      <p>'This level of pain is..'</p>
      <p>Kkuk!</p>
      <p>
        I clench my fist, overwhelming the madness that is trying to devour my
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>'Nothing at all!'</p>
      <p>Kugeuk!</p>
      <p>In this state, I look at Kim Yeon and speak.</p>
      <p>Or rather, there’s no need to say anything.</p>
      <p>Our consciousnesses are connected at this moment.</p>
      <p>[Can you now manipulate the puppets?]</p>
      <p>[Yes...]</p>
      <p>She grimaces a bit, then extends her hands.</p>
      <p>Kugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The puppets line up in an orderly fashion, moving in all directions
        according to her will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hundreds of Qi Building stage puppets begin to heed Kim Yeon's commands.
      </p>
      <p>[Still at this level, I see.]</p>
      <p>[Yes, I'm not used to it yet.]</p>
      <p>[Anyway, this makes it possible for you to try.]</p>
      <p>I speak to Kim Yeon through heart language.</p>
      <p>[Shall we try the Seven Stars Ritual now?]</p>
      <p>Cheolkeok Cheolkeok Cheolkeok...</p>
      <p>Atop the valley.</p>
      <p>The altar for the Seven Stars Ritual.</p>
      <p>
        Surrounding it, a legion of puppets assume their positions, ready to
        unleash their respective spells towards the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seven Stars Ritual in the Bright Cold Realm is no different from the
        previous world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only difference is that the ritual has to be conducted towards
        completely different stars than the twenty-eight stars of the previous
        world.
      </p>
      <p>However, the names invoked during the ritual remain the same.</p>
      <p>
        According to a cultivator the Mad Lord kidnapped months ago, the names
        of the stars and constellations used in the cultivation world's rituals
        are fixed across dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of performing the ritual looking at the actual stars, it’s done
        according to the 'energy' of the stars. Therefore, if a star in another
        realm has similar 'energy', it’s referred to by the same name as in the
        previous realm.
      </p>
      <p>Kurung, Kurung...</p>
      <p>Dark clouds begin to gather in the sky.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Yeon finishes the ritual and stretches her hands towards the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, hundreds of Qi Building stage puppets that are manipulated by her
        emit light simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>Kwagwang, Kwagwagwang!</p>
      <p>
        Hundreds of attacks from the Qi Building stage puppets tear the clouds
        in the sky apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        And since it’s she, herself who moves the puppets to tear the sky, it
        seems the heavens recognize it as her action.
      </p>
      <p>Paaaat!</p>
      <p>
        I can feel Kim Yeon successfully rising to the 7th Star of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>[Ah, ah Eun-hyun Oppa.]</p>
      <p>
        Through her intent, I can feel a deep sense of relief and an
        indescribable surge of emotion.
      </p>
      <p>[Thank you…]</p>
      <p>
        Having overcome the critical stage of Qi Refining, Kim Yeon wipes her
        eyes and looks back at me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing her appearance, I smile bitterly, disconnecting our consciousness
        connection.
      </p>
      <p>"Congratulations, Team Leader Kim."</p>
      <p>I know her feelings better than ever.</p>
      <p>But I absolutely can't accept those feelings.</p>
      <p>
        "Now you won't have to worry about being modified due to the stagnation
        in your cultivation."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, it's all thanks to you, Eun-hyun Oppa. But, aren't we going to
        stop using 'Team Leader' and 'Deputy' titles? Haha."
      </p>
      <p>Kim Yeon slowly descends from the altar.</p>
      <p>"We're not in the company anymore."</p>
      <p>"...What should I call you then?"</p>
      <p>
        "No, more than that, why do you still speak formally to me, Eun-hyun
        Oppa? You used to speak informally at the company."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>'Did I?'</p>
      <p>That was 900 years ago.</p>
      <p>I hardly remember.</p>
      <p>
        "Speak informally. After performing the Seven Stars Ritual, I
        realized..."
      </p>
      <p>She speaks with a deep sense of relief.</p>
      <p>"We, the remaining people, should be close to each other."</p>
      <p>But I know that what she is saying isn't just about being friendly.</p>
      <p>That intent, I know it all too well.</p>
      <p>"In fact, I..."</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>[Oh, have you been well?]</p>
      <p>Suddenly!</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord bursts through space, sticking his head out.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>He looks into the empty air with glittering eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Yeon seems not to understand, but I sense his gaze and feel a chill
        run down my spine.
      </p>
      <p>The Mad Lord is observing the color of Kim Yeon's intent.</p>
      <p>[Oh, ohohoh... Ohoh!]</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord, looking at her intent, lets out a suspicious exclamation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it’s difficult trying to understand the intentions of a madman,
        I’m always tense.
      </p>
      <p>I swallow and ask the Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>
        "...Have you come out already, Ma…ster...? I thought you would stay for
        another month..."
      </p>
      <p>[Ah! The Four-Axis puppet was completed earlier than expected!]</p>
      <p>Chaak!</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord, having torn through space, flicks his hand.</p>
      <p>Kooooo!</p>
      <p>The Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress below begins to rise slowly.</p>
      <p>
        [And, the spy puppet I sent out found the location of the Light Spirit
        Pond, full of materials for injecting into [Her] body. However, it turns
        out the Bright Cold Realm's race occupying the Light Spirit Pond is
        quite formidable. They are called the Cold Spirit Race, and they even
        have Integration stage cultivators of the Cold Spirit Race living there,
        making them a tricky opponent.]
      </p>
      <p>"...What are you going to do?"</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord spreads his arms wide, his eyes bloodshot with madness, and
        shouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        [What do you mean what am I going to do? War, of course! Cold Spirit
        Race or whatever race, I will conquer them all and whatever stands in my
        way I will conquer them too! If the world opposes me, I will conquer the
        world! Hehehehe!! World conquest! World conquest! Now, let's go. The
        method of creating Four-Axis puppets is now stabilized, so from now on,
        we go to war with the Cold Spirit Race!]
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        From within the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, the true and undeniable
        power of the Four-Axis erupts forth in three bursts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, over the past half year, having undergone Heavenly
        Tribulation and risen to Four-Axis, the Mad Lord's momentum envelops
        heaven and earth.

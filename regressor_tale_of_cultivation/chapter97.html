      <p>Chapter 97: Lotus (5)</p>
      <p>"Is there something uncomfortable?"</p>
      <p>"No... Thank you for your hospitality, Cultivator Cheongmun."</p>
      <p>I face Cheongmun Ryeong while hiding my emotions.</p>
      <p>He looks puzzled but does not ask further and takes a seat.</p>
      <p>I sit down as well.</p>
      <p>"I heard you came to discuss formations with me."</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. I saw a spell a Nascent Soul cultivator used the other day, and I
        wanted to create a formation based on that framework, so I came to
        consult with Cultivator Cheongmun, an expert in formations."
      </p>
      <p>"Can I see the kind of formation you are talking about?"</p>
      <p>I show him the design of the formation I have planned.</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong looks over the formation for a while and says,</p>
      <p>
        "So, this is a formation that concentrates strong energy to transform
        into life force, thereby accelerating the growth of heaven and earth
        spiritual plants, correct?"
      </p>
      <p>"That's correct."</p>
      <p>
        "That’s inefficient. It would be faster to use the filthy methods of the
        devil path to refine life force and pour it in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do you think such a formation has never been developed? Even if you
        pour a foolish amount of spiritual energy, it’s bound to be slow in
        accelerating the growth of spiritual plants."
      </p>
      <p>"This is a very important matter to me. Is there really no way?"</p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        After examining the formation for a while, Cheongmun Ryeong looks at me
        and asks.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Cultivator Seo, I don't think you came to me with such a foolish
        formation structure. You must have some more information to request my
        help, correct?"
      </p>
      <p>I nod and take out another book from my belongings.</p>
      <p>
        It’s a book recording information regarding the Longevity Tree and
        Longevity Fruits.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I’ve done detailed research on the heaven and earth spiritual plant I
        want to accelerate in growth. The species of the spiritual plant, its
        location, the condition of the surrounding dragon veins, the uniqueness
        of the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        I even know the current state of the spiritual plant. It's just about to
        bloom and bear fruit, and it will be fully ripened in a few hundred
        years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to use the formation to accelerate the ripening period by a few
        hundred years."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm."</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong carefully examines the book I gave him, stroking his
        beard.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If that's the case, a formation that only applies to that particular
        spiritual plant and accelerates growth for a few hundred years..."
      </p>
      <p>As he looks at the book, he suddenly shudders.</p>
      <p>
        "Hah, the Longevity Fruit...! Just one fruit can extend life by a
        hundred years...!"
      </p>
      <p>"That's right."</p>
      <p>
        "...I should mention this to the clan head. A spiritual plant that can
        extend life by this much is a tremendous treasure, especially for the
        Core Formation clan head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially now, with the Ascension Gate open and many Heavenly Being
        cultivators having ascended... maybe I can get support from the clan
        head."
      </p>
      <p>
        He asks me questions about the book and the formation and we end up
        talking through the night.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, it’s already dawn."</p>
      <p>"Is there an issue?."</p>
      <p>
        "Ha ha, it's been a while since I had so much fun. But I have to report
        to the clan head, so I must leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daoist Seo, among the Qi Building cultivators I've met, you are the most
        knowledgeable and have an outstanding understanding of cultivation
        methods. Honestly, when you first presented that nonsensical formation
        structure, I thought you were mad...
      </p>
      <p>Thanks to you, I’ve learned a lot."</p>
      <p>"No, I’ve learned more from Daoist Cheongmun."</p>
      <p>Daoist.</p>
      <p>A nickname among cultivators of equal standing who are close.</p>
      <p>
        He seemed to like me after talking through the night, and at some point,
        he started calling me Daoist.
      </p>
      <p>-This foolish disciple!</p>
      <p>-Cultivator Seo</p>
      <p>-Daoist Seo</p>
      <p>How my title changes over time.</p>
      <p>Someday.</p>
      <p>Will the word 'Senior' come out of Cheongmun Ryeong's mouth?</p>
      <p>As I see Cheongmun Ryeong off, I feel a lingering bittersweet taste</p>
      <p>
        As I grow more powerful, I can surpass fate and witness new miracles and
        changes.
      </p>
      <p>But somehow, I feel some things should remain unchanged.</p>
      <p>
        I’m afraid of the day 'Senior' might come out of Cheongmun Ryeong's
        mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha ha, Cultivator Seo. Did you have a good talk with Ryeong Hyung?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, Cultivator Cheongmun Dan."</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Dan, who had led me to the main house, approaches and asks.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's been a long time since I’ve seen Ryeong Hyung talk so happily. He
        always grumbles that there are only muscleheads in the Cheongmun Clan.
        It seems he really enjoyed himself for the first time in a while."
      </p>
      <p>
        “I only asked Cultivator Cheongmun questions. To say he was happy makes
        me feel embarrassed.”
      </p>
      <p>
        "Asking proper questions is no small feat. Cultivator Cheongmun Ryeong
        always complains about the ignorance of other Qi Building elders. Last
        night, listening to your conversation, it was rare not to see his usual
        prickliness. I'm truly impressed by Cultivator Seo's knowledge."
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's kind of you to say. It's just that my master... taught me well."
      </p>
      <p>I swallow the bitter taste in my mouth and force a smile.</p>
      <p>"I see. May I ask who your master is?"</p>
      <p>"I apologize, but I prefer not to disclose my master's name."</p>
      <p>
        "I understand. It seems you are young, too. I wish even half of our
        clan's younger members are like Cultivator Seo."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Dan sighs, talking about how the recent generation is chasing
        after easy success and women, and how he should assemble them all and
        discipline them to restore order.
      </p>
      <p>After some idle talk, Cheongmun Dan glances at me and asks,</p>
      <p>
        "What about it, Cultivator Seo? If someone with your knowledge can
        lecture our clan's younger members..."
      </p>
      <p>He’s making an offer for me to join the Cheongmun Clan.</p>
      <p>
        It’s a respectful proposition, unlike the ridiculous act of forcibly
        taking someone of equal status as a son-in-law.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm afraid that being affiliated with a particular place doesn't suit
        my nature..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's a pity. You have such a firm conviction, I wish my descendants
        could learn from you."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You're having a tough time with the young generation of the Cheongmun
        Clan?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I recall the siblings from the Cheongmun Clan who had been freely
        throwing punches at the Spirit Path Conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If all the younger members of the Cheongmun Clan are like that, it must
        be a headache for the elders.’
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, it's not so much difficult as it is frustrating. No, not
        frustrating, but it's infuriating that they're bewitched by strange
        rumors, neglecting their cultivation and chasing after women."
      </p>
      <p>"Chasing after women?"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Dan thumps his chest in exasperation.</p>
      <p>
        "This is all because of the Mad Lord. Damn it. Since everyone saw him
        roaming around the whole world before the Ascension Gate, they believe
        anything related to him must be inherently good, leading some to blindly
        follow him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, the most troublesome is the top heir of the Byeok Clan, that
        rascal! Despite reaching Qi Building, he behaves disgracefully, enticing
        even the innocent children of the Cheongmun Clan to chase after women
        with him!"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Dan thumps his chest again, clearly angry.</p>
      <p>"What exactly happened, if I may ask?"</p>
      <p>
        It seems he was frustrated and desperately wanted someone to listen to
        his grievances.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just listen. Byeok Mun-seong of the Byeok Clan, one day found a
        cultivator in Byeokra with the same qualities as the Mad Lord, a
        Heavenly Being cultivator."
      </p>
      <p>"What...!"</p>
      <p>I’m shocked and look at him in surprise.</p>
      <p>"The same qualities as the Mad Lord..."</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, the same kind of qualities as that mad old man. Therefore, not
        only the Cheongmun, Byeok, and Gongmyo clans but also cultivators from
        other countries showed interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it turned out that although this cultivator has the same
        qualities as the Mad Lord, their qualities are far inferior to the Mad
        Lord."
      </p>
      <p>"What kind of qualities are they?"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Dan looks at me somewhat incredulously and asks.</p>
      <p>
        "Don’t you know about the Mad Lord's qualities? The Mad Lord was born
        with a talent known as 'Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Those with Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent show a natural aptitude for
        creating magic artifacts, formations, puppets, and such. When they
        concentrate on creating something, strange patterns appear on their
        skin, and the number of colors in those patterns determines their rank,
        from Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent of Seven Pattern to One Pattern.
        The more colors, the more impure and useless the talent; fewer colors
        indicate a purer and more innate talent."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, that’s quite a unique quality."</p>
      <p>He continue.,</p>
      <p>
        "Well, true talent in Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent ranges from
        One-Pattern to Three-Pattern. Four-Pattern to Five-Pattern is just
        average, and Six-Pattern to Seven-Pattern is practically useless in
        creation."
      </p>
      <p>I listen to Cheongmun Dan's explanation.</p>
      <p>
        "But the cultivator found by Byeok Mun-seong is just a Four-Pattern
        Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        He discovered a mediocre talent and exaggerated it as if he found
        someone with the same qualities as the Mad Lord. Claiming that securing
        this person would be a tremendous contribution to their clan, he lured
        not only his own clan’s younger members but also those from the
        Cheongmun and Gongmyo clans to chase after the woman!"
      </p>
      <p>"That's unfortunate..."</p>
      <p>
        "If it were someone from the Cheongmun Clan, I’d have given them a good
        thrashing, but I can’t do that to the heir of the Byeok Clan. It's
        infuriating."
      </p>
      <p>"You must be deeply troubled."</p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>"I just discussed this matter with the clan head."</p>
      <p>"Oh?"</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong came out from the main house of the Cheongmun Clan and
        spoke to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The clan head suggested that, together with Daoist Seo, we should
        completely eradicate the root of this problem."
      </p>
      <p>"What do you mean, Ryeong Hyung?"</p>
      <p>
        "The information about the Longevity Fruit brought by Daoist Seo. After
        discussing it with the elders, the clan head decided to support us
        unconditionally."
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems the information about the Longevity Fruit and its accelerated
        growth was told among the clan head and elders.
      </p>
      <p>"But what does that have to do with solving the problem?"</p>
      <p>
        "Well, we need to study formations with Daoist Seo, and we need someone
        to provide the magic artifacts for the formation."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong slowly explains to Cheongmun Dan and me.</p>
      <p>
        "So, the clan head plans to formally request that woman who’s been
        causing a stir among the clan's younger generation lately to create the
        magic artifacts for the formation. By placing an order in the name of
        the Cheongmun Clan, and having that woman busy in her workshop, we can
        legally deal with any of the young heirs from our or other clans who
        cause trouble, considering it an interference with the Cheongmun Clan’s
        affairs."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Indeed... Even though she’s only a Four-Pattern Extraordinary Pattern
        Law Talent, she’s still a highly talented artifact craftswoman,
        certainly capable of producing satisfactory results."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, that's likely. Ha ha, thanks to the formation brought by Daoist
        Seo, we can also resolve the issues with our troublesome younger
        generation"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong grins and pats my shoulder.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, I have a question.</p>
      <p>
        "I understand that those with Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent are
        naturally skilled in creating magic artifacts and such, but what level
        of this talent does the Mad Lord have?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is that even a question? Obviously, he’s a One-Pattern Extraordinary
        Pattern Law Talent."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Mad Lord's talent is truly demonic. Just imagine, before the
        Ascension Gate opened, many Heavenly Being cultivators fled whenever the
        Mad Lord appeared."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan, who might have seen the Mad Lord
        before, both suddenly shiver.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Not as high as One-Pattern Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent, but still
        a Four-Pattern Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent...'
      </p>
      <p>
        I become curious about the cultivator who possesses the same kind of
        talent as the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, Ryeong Hyung. We should proceed in the Cheongmun Clan's decisive
        manner. Should we just kidnap her?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, let's go and kidnap her quickly."</p>
      <p>"...?"</p>
      <p>'What?'</p>
      <p>
        I can't keep up with Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan's conversation
        and ask them for clarification.
      </p>
      <p>"Aren't we supposed to place an official order?"</p>
      <p>
        "Indeed. However, the magic artifacts for the formation must be
        continually refined and experimented with as we research the formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wouldn't it be better if the Cheongmun Clan makes them and conducts
        experiments directly? That's why we plan to kidnap her and have her
        create the artifacts."
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong and Cheongmun Dan look at me as if wondering what the
        problem is.
      </p>
      <p>'Right, this clan is known for its excessive boldness...'</p>
      <p>
        After all, this is the clan that tried to kidnap me for a forced
        marriage when I was weak.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We will officially pay her and place a proper order after kidnapping
        her."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The plan under the clan head's name won't cause her any harm, other
        than temporarily changing her residence."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        I hesitate, not knowing where to start objecting, and then sigh softly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...How about we first meet this Four-Pattern Extraordinary Pattern Law
        Talent cultivator, and then ask for her opinion?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, Cheongmun Ryeong, Cheongmun Dan, and I flew eastward to Byeokra
        on a flying artifact to kidnap the Four-Pattern Extraordinary Pattern
        Law Talent. The creator needed for the formation.
      </p>
      <p>'Wait, this direction is...'</p>
      <p>I feel a sense of déjà vu.</p>
      <p>
        "Daoist Seo seems a bit unfamiliar with the Cheongmun Clan's way, I
        assume?"
      </p>
      <p>“Ah, yes."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong strokes his beard and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        "People of our main house don't act thoughtlessly like thieves. We
        observe the situation and act appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's just that, according to our clan's principle, we tend to be a bit
        more aggressive."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Dan continues.</p>
      <p>
        "We're not kidnapping the artifact craftswoman just for our sake. Right
        now, that woman is surrounded and troubled by the heirs of not only the
        Cheongmun Clan but also the Byeok, Gongmyo, and other clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        She might even prefer to be under the protection of the Cheongmun Clan."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        Thinking about what Cheongmun Dan said, it seems that from the
        craftwoman's perspective, this might not be such a bad option.
      </p>
      <p>"The founder of our clan, Ancestor Cheongmun Chang-ho, once said,</p>
      <p>
        'Always consider the other's perspective when you act, but once you take
        action, do it boldly, no matter how.'"
      </p>
      <p>"I see..."</p>
      <p>
        Thinking about it, the Cheongmun Clan's attempt to capture me for a
        forced marriage wasn't entirely bad for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bit aggressive, but always considering the other's perspective – that

      <p>
        If this world is like a fish tank, then what exactly is the Ascension
        Gate? And what about Serving Command Palace?
      </p>
      <p>'No, that's not it.'</p>
      <p>I erase these wild speculations.</p>
      <p>
        'Maybe this world is just naturally like this. Let's not overthink it.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, if this world is like a fish tank, then why would Ancestor
        Yang Su-jin return to this confined space?
      </p>
      <p>
        Why would such a powerful being, who can tear through the void and come
        back down from the higher realms, do so?
      </p>
      <p>
        'It's probably just the way this world is. Let's not get carried away
        with grandiose thoughts.'
      </p>
      <p>Thinking too big might eventually lead to heart demons.</p>
      <p>"...A world that's not spherical..."</p>
      <p>
        After all, when you think about it, it's a world where Heavenly Being
        cultivators freely roam across the continents.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the structure of such a world is exactly like Earth, that wouldn't
        make sense, would it?
      </p>
      <p>How strong would the world have to be to withstand all that?</p>
      <p>While I’m lost in thought.</p>
      <p>
        "Ah, speaking of a spherical world, it reminds me of another fairy tale
        I read as a child."
      </p>
      <p>"....?"</p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa points to the sky and says,</p>
      <p>
        "In a fairy tale I read when I was young, it said that there are people
        that live in the Astral Realm far away, where the people cling to a
        spherical land.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't it funny? Living on a spherical land. Would the people on the
        bottom side have to keep hanging on so they don't fall off?
      </p>
      <p>I thought it was a fairy tale with really imaginative creativity."</p>
      <p>
        I look up at the night sky, now beginning to be covered by darkness.
      </p>
      <p>'The Astral Realm...'</p>
      <p>A sky full of stars.</p>
      <p>Maybe those stars are proper planets?</p>
      <p>Is this world the only one with such a strange structure?</p>
      <p>
        Or are there more worlds like this with equally peculiar structures?
      </p>
      <p>If only this world is like this, why is it so bizarre?</p>
      <p>
        I ponder a few more things, but it only makes my head feel more
        complicated.
      </p>
      <p>'Enough. For now, there's no way to know.'</p>
      <p>
        The best thing to do is to become a Heavenly Being and then check the
        structure of this world myself.
      </p>
      <p>'Yes, let's focus on what's in front of us for now.'</p>
      <p>
        I calm my mind and board the ship again with Buk Hyang-hwa, who has been
        admiring the sky at World's End for a while.
      </p>
      <p>"Really, it's beautiful. The sky beneath our feet over there..."</p>
      <p>"...Indeed."</p>
      <p>"Sigh, shall we go now?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes. Clan head and Cheongmun Ryeong must be worried, let's return."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Right, and if we're in the far western region... how long will it take
        to return to Byeokra?"
      </p>
      <p>"At least a month or two, I would guess."</p>
      <p>"My father will be worried."</p>
      <p>Seeing her concern for her father, I ask.</p>
      <p>
        "Originally, the prize for Miss Buk's wager was not the magic artifacts,
        but a tour with Miss Buk herself. How about we count this as a tour on
        this occasion?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just hurrying back counts as a tour? Doesn't Cultivator Seo feel it's a
        pity?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's there to regret? I'm originally a wanderer who used to travel
        around the world, so I've had plenty of tours."
      </p>
      <p>At my words, she smiles softly and looks out at the night sea.</p>
      <p>I sense a hint of regret in her intent.</p>
      <p>
        "...On the way back, let's still take a little tour through places like
        Shengzi and Yanguo."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, that would be nice as well."</p>
      <p>‘....?’</p>
      <p>'Why does it seem like she's still not cheered up?'</p>
      <p>Her feelings of regret remain, leaving me puzzled.</p>
      <p>A few days later.</p>
      <p>
        We moved eastward, and we were finally able to reach the mountain range
        where the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This place is called Shattered Heaven Peak in the mountain range where
        the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect was located. Miss Buk must have
        heard of it, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa marvels at the scenic beauty of Shattered Heaven Peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        'The places that were destroyed by me and Kim Young-hoon in my previous
        life are still intact, bringing back memories.'
      </p>
      <p>Pointing to one of the peaks, she says,</p>
      <p>
        "I've read about it in ancient texts. The highest peak used to house the
        Heavenly Lightning Banner, a sacred treasure of the Golden Divine
        Heavenly Thunder Sect. It was said to be an incredible immortal
        treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an artisan, it's a pity I never saw it. I wanted to see one of the
        Three Great Treasures of the world, but I only saw the ruined Nether
        Crossing Ship."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Three Great Treasures refer to the sacred treasures of three sects
        that were renowned throughout the continent.
      </p>
      <p>The Black Ghost Valley's Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Lightning Banner of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>The Blue Sky Armor of the Heaven Creation Sect.</p>
      <p>
        Each of these treasures are either an immortal treasure or a unique
        dharma treasure that matches immortal treasures in significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially notable among them is the Heavenly Lightning Banner of the
        Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, which is a true immortal treasure,
        as per the legend that Golden Deity Yang Su-jin used it in the immortal
        realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the legend of the Nether Crossing Ship, which can traverse the
        realm of the dead, the Heavenly Lightning Banner is said to be able to
        artificially induce Heavenly Tribulations, its power and status evident
        even without seeing it firsthand.
      </p>
      <p>'However, there's hardly any rumors about the Blue Sky Armor...'</p>
      <p>
        Every time Sir Chang-ho appears wearing that blue armor, it’s likely the
        Blue Sky Armor, a unique dharma treasure, but it seems to have no
        special functions other than appearing solid.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, no one really knows much about the Blue Sky Armor.</p>
      <p>
        It’s a secret of the Cheongmun Clan, and as an outsider, it’s clear they
        wouldn't inform me.
      </p>
      <p>'Well, I don't really care about immortal treasures anyway.'</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa is lost in thought, gazing endlessly at the highest peak
        of Shattered Heaven Peak, where the Thunder Banner was said to have
        resided.
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>"Ah...!"</p>
      <p>Below Shattered Heaven Peak.</p>
      <p>
        Several elders and youths, who look to be gathering herbs below,
        respectfully bow to us flying on our magic artifact.
      </p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa asks in surprise,</p>
      <p>
        "Why are those mortals bowing to us? We haven't done anything for
        them..."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm... Miss Buk, have you never been outside of Cheon-saek City?"</p>
      <p>
        "Well, not exactly... I haven't really left the eastern part of Byeokra
        much. I did visit Yanguo. But that was just a short business trip for
        three days due to a magic artifact, and I hurried back..."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, I see."</p>
      <p>I explain to her the mortal’s perception of cultivators.</p>
      <p>
        "In Cheon-saek City and eastern Byeokra, as it's the territory of the
        Gongmyo Clan, quality magic artifacts are abundant, attracting many
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, mortals there are quite familiar with cultivators, whereas
        in Yanguo and Shengzi, the majority of mortals don't even know of the
        existence of cultivators, often thinking of them as immortals from
        legends."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, I see..."</p>
      <p>
        'I guess I understand why Buk Joong-ho stayed quiet about the bet his
        daughter made with that Byeok Clan fellow, conditioning the bet on a
        tour.'
      </p>
      <p>She seems too ignorant of the outside world.</p>
      <p>"But, those people down there seem to be praying for something?"</p>
      <p>"It seems so."</p>
      <p>"Shouldn't we help them?"</p>
      <p>After a moment of contemplation, I respond.</p>
      <p>"Follow your heart."</p>
      <p>
        After all, she’s not a malevolent person and even generously offered
        water to travelers in the desert, so her intervention with mortals
        wouldn't be a problem.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        She lowers the altitude of the flying artifact to approach those
        earnestly praying.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, look, immortals!"</p>
      <p>"The immortals have responded to our prayers!"</p>
      <p>"Immortals, please help our village!"</p>
      <p>They plead in the language of Shengzi, and I translate for her.</p>
      <p>"Oh dear. Elder, what seems to be the trouble?"</p>
      <p>She asks the most earnest-looking elder, and I translate her words.</p>
      <p>"What's the matter?"</p>
      <p>
        Externally, it might seem arrogant, but considering my mental age, this
        elder honestly looks like a mere child to me.
      </p>
      <p>'I'll be older than Yuan Li if this life goes on.'</p>
      <p>
        With a self-mocking smile, I asked the elder, who hurriedly bows and
        answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, immortal! We wish you would help our village. Every fortnight, a
        centipede demon appears in our village, devouring young men and women of
        marriageable age.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've reported to the authorities, but they've been silent. We invited
        martial experts to defeat it, but they all became food for the centipede
        demon!
      </p>
      <p>Please, help us..."</p>
      <p>
        'If they requested the authorities, the cultivator clans should have
        taken action...'
      </p>
      <p>I sense something strange and listen to their story.</p>
      <p>
        The village in the mountainous region of Seoak was peaceful until one
        day, a centipede demon began to appear, devouring young men and women
        every fortnight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the demon seemed intelligent, it didn't understand other
        offerings, and after reporting to the authorities, suspicious-looking
        people visited the centipede. Yet since then, the authorities have
        ignored the village’s pleas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overwhelmed with frustration, the village of Seoak invited martial art
        experts to capture the demon, but the experts were all devoured by the
        demon in turn, and their interference only provoked it to consume more
        villagers.
      </p>
      <p>
        'After those suspicious people visited, the authorities pretended not to
        know anything?'
      </p>
      <p>
        There must have been a deal between the cultivator clans and the demon.
      </p>
      <p>After deducing this, I share my conclusions with Buk Hyang-hwa.</p>
      <p>
        "What should we do, Miss? It seems like a complicated situation, do you
        want to help?"
      </p>
      <p>After some contemplation, she nods.</p>
      <p>
        "I want to help. As long as it doesn't interfere with Cultivator Seo's
        schedule."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, I have nothing urgent. If Miss Buk wishes to help, I will assist
        as well."
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>
        After our discussion, we address the waiting elder and other herb
        gatherers.
      </p>
      <p>"We will help. Lead the way."</p>
      <p>"Thank you so much...!"</p>
      <p>
        Following the elder's guidance, we disembark from the ship and head to
        Seoak village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many houses in the village are destroyed, and deep pits, seemingly the
        footprints of the centipede, are scattered around.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Every time the centipede demon tries to attack, we try to stop it, but
        it just destroys anything in its way, finds the hidden young men and
        women, and devours them..."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        "Because of this, many people have created hidden spaces in their homes
        to hide, or they are preparing to leave the village. If the immortals
        hadn't offered to help, our Seoak village might have been disbanded."
      </p>
      <p>I ask the elder.</p>
      <p>"Alright, do you know where this centipede demon lives?"</p>
      <p>
        "There's a large cave beyond that peak, the demon lives deep inside
        it..."
      </p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa and I nod in agreement.</p>
      <p>"Understood, we will go and check it out."</p>
      <p>
        Crossing the peak mentioned by the elder, we arrive at the cave where
        the centipede is said to reside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human bones are scattered everywhere, and a tremendous energy looms
        within.
      </p>
      <p>'So, it's a late Qi Building demon.'</p>
      <p>
        I understand why the cultivator clans couldn't deal with this demon.
      </p>
      <p>
        A late Qi Building demon is considered an elder-level among cultivator
        clans, even among the high-ranking elders.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s unreasonable for Core Formation masters or venerable elders to
        intervene for mere mortal affairs.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        As we enter the cave, the centipede demon’s consciousness echoes in our
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>[Who, are you?]</p>
      <p>I stare into the darkness of the cave.</p>
      <p>
        Something rustles inside, and soon a giant centipede reveals itself.
      </p>
      <p>I also reply through consciousness to the centipede.</p>
      <p>
        [Why are you attacking human villages and eating them? There are many
        other prey. Besides...]
      </p>
      <p>Remembering the reaction of the fox demon, I say.</p>
      <p>
        [Human flesh doesn't seem that tasty to your kind, so why specifically
        hunt for humans?]
      </p>
      <p>The centipede rustles its antennae and replies.</p>
      <p>[Human, flesh. If eaten, I can birth, offspring like me.]</p>
      <p>[What?]</p>
      <p>
        [I, am lonely. My kin don't have, same intellect, as me, when I have
        children, they live short lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before, I had friends, I could talk to. One day, humans moving the
        heavens, take all away. Ones with strong energy were taken, and now,
        only I, alone.]
      </p>
      <p>I listen to the centipede demon's story.</p>
      <p>
        [So, I thought, if I eat people with intellect, my offspring too, will
        have it. Therefore, I ate those called maidens and bachelors, with pure
        blood among humans.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Demon beasts are originally born by living long enough to obtain a Demon
        Core.
      </p>
      <p>But how long can ordinary beasts live?</p>
      <p>
        Typically, for an ordinary beast to become a demon beast, it either
        happens with extremely slim chances or they are born as special species
        like the Mighty Tiger Tribe, Holy Peng Tribe, or the Sea Dragon Tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, ordinary demon beasts, not being of such special species, don't
        necessarily inherit these traits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultivators marrying each other have a higher chance of transmitting
        spiritual roots to their offspring.
      </p>
      <p>That's why there are cultivator clans.</p>
      <p>But what about demon beasts?</p>
      <p>
        They are collectively called demon beasts but are in fact entirely
        different species, and it's incredibly difficult for the same species to
        meet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if they mate, the chances of transmitting spiritual traits are
        lower than human cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>And such a thing is not solved by eating human flesh.</p>
      <p>[...Eating them won't make your offspring born with Demon Cores.]</p>
      <p>[No, they surely will!]</p>
      <p>[Who told you that?]</p>
      <p>
        [My instinct! Humans, even without demon cores, are smart! Surely, if I
        eat smart humans...]
      </p>
      <p>I interrupt the centipede.</p>
      <p>
        [There's no such thing. The only way for your children to become like
        you is for them to survive long enough to awaken and embrace their
        spiritual nature and form their own Demon Cores.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [No! Your kind, those with spiritual power, come to me, say they support
        me! They let, consume the village, ask for my shed skin in return!]
      </p>
      <p>
        'It seems the cultivator clans left the centipede alone in exchange for
        its shed skin.'
      </p>
      <p>
        For cultivator clans, the loss of one or two mortal villages are
        insignificant, and the centipede is unexpectedly powerful, so they
        pretended to support it while taking its shed skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        [They just deceived you with their so-called support. Their
        encouragement doesn't suddenly make your offspring miraculous.]
      </p>
      <p>[Lies! Don't lie! Stop!]</p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing my words, the centipede suddenly contorts its body in
        anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        [My offspring, all become, me! You two, pure maiden and bachelor, I eat
        you, it might possible!]
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>The centipede twists its body and emits poison.</p>
      <p>
        I counter the poison with my spiritual power and look at Buk Hyang-hwa.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems communication is futile. It looks like this creature has
        already consumed dozens of people..."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, it seems right to end its life."</p>
      <p>
        She closes her eyes in sorrow, seeing the human bones scattered
        throughout the cave.
      </p>
      <p>I grip my Formless Sword and take a step towards the centipede.</p>
      <p>That's when it happens.</p>
      <p>Screech!</p>
      <p>
        The centipede lets out a scream, and thousands of bats fly out from
        deeper within the cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, other centipedes, snakes, scorpions, and numerous
        venomous creatures crawl out from all around.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The centipede lunges at me, who has drawn the Formless Sword, and I am
        thrown outside the cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creature, sensing my Pure Spiritual Power, attacks me first, and the
        venomous creatures summoned by the centipede rushes towards her.
      </p>
      <p>"Miss Buk, are you alright?"</p>
      <p>
        I shout to her, who is being targeted by the venomous creatures, and Buk
        Hyang-hwa silently activates her storage device.
      </p>
      <p>Thud, thud!</p>
      <p>Thud thud thud thud!</p>
      <p>
        Dozens of flying sword magic artifacts, mirrors, lutes, bells, daggers,
        wheels, looms, drums, and hundreds of other magic artifacts burst out
        from her storage device, filling the space around her.
      </p>
      <p>"Don't worry about me."</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>Numerous magic artifacts simultaneously activate, emitting light.</p>
      <p>"I always keep my bag well-stocked."</p>
      <p>
        As she speaks, flying swords and numerous magic artifacts fly out in all
        directions, repelling the venomous creatures and scattering powerful
        spells.
      </p>
      <p>"Hah..."</p>
      <p>
        I chuckle at the sight of her pulling out countless magic artifacts and
        scattering them around.
      </p>
      <p>'No need to worry about her.'</p>
      <p>
        I raise my Formless Sword, facing the giant centipede spreading a toxic
        mist in front of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        [It's unfortunate about your offspring, but the humans you've eaten were
        innocent and eating them has nothing to do with your offspring gaining
        spiritual nature. Yet, you insist on continuing to eat people, leaving
        me no choice.]
      </p>
      <p>Whirr!</p>
      <p>I swing the Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        In an instant, the sword transforms, clearing away all the toxic mist
        and striking the centipede fiercely.
      </p>
      <p>'Tough.'</p>
      <p>The centipede's carapace is quite hard.</p>
      <p>
        'Even though I swung to clear the mist rather than to attack, I didn't
        expect it to block it in one go...'
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the centipede, having taken a hit from the Formless Sword, is
        spewing venomous blood and staggering.
      </p>
      <p>It clearly isn't in good shape.</p>
      <p>"Goodbye."</p>
      <p>
        I descend towards the centipede, embedding the Formless Sword into its
        head.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>It isn't much of a battle.</p>
      <p>A Core Formation level Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>For a late Qi Building centipede demon, it really isn’t a match.</p>
      <p>[Screech, screech...]</p>
      <p>
        Despite having the Formless Sword embedded in its head, the centipede
        demon struggles a few times.
      </p>
      <p>[My... offspring... my children...]</p>
      <p>It murmurs and spews venomous blood for a moment.</p>
      <p>[I... won’t, die, easily...]</p>
      <p>Whirr!</p>
      <p>A wave radiates from the centipede's head, spreading around.</p>
      <p>
        The wave reaches the venomous creatures summoned by the centipede, and
        those attacking Buk Hyang-hwa suddenly scatter in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>'That just now...'</p>
      <p>
        Knowing demon language, I could understand the wave emitted by the
        centipede.
      </p>
      <p>
        'This demon... ordered the venomous creatures to continue attacking the
        village.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting tonight, the venomous creatures will begin attacking the
        village.
      </p>
      <p>"You ended it quickly."</p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, Miss, are you still thinking of making me a magic artifact after
        seeing that?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ahaha, it's a matter of pride for me. I will definitely make it."</p>
      <p>She clenches her fists and nods.</p>
      <p>"Now that the centipede demon is dead, I have something to say."</p>
      <p>
        I explain the final command the centipede demon had given to the
        venomous creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since we've agreed to help, we should take care of those venomous
        creatures too. Miss, do you have any ideas?"
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        After pondering for a moment, Buk Hyang-hwa quickly comes up with a
        solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Such a command ability typically lasts 3 to 5 months, maybe up to half
        a year at most. So, we can set up a protective magic artifact in the
        village that operates for about half a year?
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the venomous creatures attack only at night, we can just prevent
        them from leaving the village during the night. If they can hold out for
        about half a year, the rest should naturally resolve itself."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh..."</p>
      <p>It seems a magic artisan can be quite useful in this regard.</p>
      <p>"That's a good idea."</p>
      <p>"Yes, but..."</p>
      <p>She looks around inside the cave and says,</p>
      <p>"Shall we collect the remains?"</p>
      <p>
        I call the people of Seoak village, extract the poison from the cave
        with my spell, and let them enter to collect the remains of their
        relatives.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, thank you so much..."</p>
      <p>
        The village chief, in tears, retrieves his son's remains, takes my hand,
        and bows deeply.
      </p>
      <p>"Really... thank you..."</p>
      <p>"It's nothing."</p>
      <p>
        I calmly accept the chief's gratitude and inform him about the final
        command the centipede demon had given to the venomous creatures.
      </p>
      <p>"That... how..."</p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry, my friend here will resolve that issue in a few days."
      </p>
      <p>
        I point to Buk Hyang-hwa, who is also receiving thanks from the
        villagers.
      </p>
      <p>
        "And I'll guard against the venomous creatures’ intrusion for those few
        days."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah...! Thank you!"</p>
      <p>The village chief bows to me and then to Buk Hyang-hwa.</p>
      <p>
        She doesn’t understand the language of Shengzi but responds with a warm
        smile to the chief's gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>All the remains have been collected.</p>
      <p>"Let's return to the village now."</p>
      <p>"Just a moment, Cultivator Seo."</p>
      <p>"Yes?"</p>
      <p>
        Buk Hyang-hwa points to the centipede demon's corpse, which had fallen
        down the valley below.
      </p>
      <p>"Could you accompany me down there?"</p>
      <p>"Of course."</p>
      <p>We approach the vicinity of the centipede demon's body.</p>
      <p>
        "Is there something you need? Oh, are you looking for materials for your
        magic artifact?"
      </p>
      <p>"Um..."</p>
      <p>She gazes at the centipede demon for a while, then smiles faintly.</p>
      <p>
        "No, it's not that. I was just thinking of burying this demon as well."
      </p>
      <p>Buk Hyang-hwa approaches the centipede demon and continues,</p>
      <p>
        "After all, this demon was a mother to its offspring. Though it was a
        heinous demon that devoured innocent mortals, its actions were driven by
        maternal love, making it hard to view it as pure evil. And..."
      </p>
      <p>She fiddles with her jade norigae as she speaks.</p>
      <p>"It somehow reminds me of my own mother."</p>
      <p>"I understand. Let's bury it together."</p>
      <p>We simultaneously use earth spells to bury the centipede demon.</p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Buk Hyang-hwa takes a glass bracelet from her storage device
        and places it on the grave.
      </p>
      <p>
        'It's said in Byeokra, that they place glass artifacts on the graves of
        the deceased...'
      </p>
      <p>"Now let's go."</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>
        I follow Buk Hyang-hwa, taking one last look at the grave she had made
        for the centipede demon, with the glass bracelet glistening on top.
      </p>
      <p>Seoak village is in a festive mood.</p>
      <p>
        Having collected the remains of the deceased and after a period of
        mourning, the absence of fear and the prospect of not having to flee the
        village seems to greatly uplift the villagers.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We plan to hold a modest village festival, combining it with a memorial
        service for the deceased. Would the two immortals kindly grace the
        festival with your presence?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I convey the chief's words to Buk Hyang-hwa, who expresses curiosity and
        agrees to attend.
      </p>
      <p>"Miss Buk agrees to participate."</p>
      <p>"Understood. And Sir Immortal...?"</p>
      <p>The village chief asks me.</p>
      <p>'Should I participate...?'</p>
      <p>Not particularly interested in festivals, I hesitate.</p>
      <p>"If your partner participates, why should you hesitate, Sir? Hehe."</p>
      <p>"...We are not exactly partners."</p>
      <p>"Oh, I see. You haven't married yet?"</p>
      <p>"No, Miss Buk is actually betrothed to someone else."</p>
      <p>"Oh, I apologize."</p>
      <p>
        "It's fine. I will guard the outskirts of the village against the
        venomous creatures while you prepare for the festival."
      </p>
      <p>
        After explaining the festival to Buk Hyang-hwa, I head to the outskirts
        of the village.
      </p>
      <p>The sun is about to set.</p>
      <p>"Hmm?"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, I notice a little girl outside the village holding a book.
      </p>
      <p>"Child, go back to the village. The festival is about to start."</p>
      <p>"Oh, Sir Immortal."</p>
      <p>The child looks at me and replies,</p>
      <p>"I'm waiting for my sister. She said she will back soon."</p>
      <p>"Is that so? Where did your sister go?"</p>
      <p>
        "My sister went over that mountain! She said she will come back after
        working at a rich house over that mountain!"
      </p>
      <p>The mountain the child points to is where the centipede had lived.</p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        I look at the child innocently holding the book and waiting, unsure of
        what to say, and fall silent for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>"By the way, what's that book?"</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, it's a book filled with old stories. My sister said she will read
        it to me when she returns, so I'm waiting here."
      </p>
      <p>I look at the child with a bittersweet feeling.</p>
      <p>"It's late now, why don't you go inside?"</p>
      <p>
        "I'll wait a little longer. The adults in the village said, 'Many people
        have returned today.' My sister will come back too."
      </p>
      <p>"Child. Let me read the book to you."</p>
      <p>"Um... I wanted my sister to read it to me..."</p>
      <p>
        "I'm an immortal, aren't I? If I read it to you, it will bring you
        blessings."
      </p>
      <p>The child looks at me with innocent eyes and asks,</p>
      <p>"Really?"</p>
      <p>"Of course."</p>
      <p>"Then please read it."</p>
      <p>
        I take the storybook from the child and use an earth spell to lift some
        soil, creating chairs for us to sit on.
      </p>
      <p>"Wow..."</p>
      <p>"Interesting, isn't it? Sit down. I'll read it to you."</p>
      <p>I open the storybook.</p>
      <p>
        Then, feeling as if my eyeballs are about to pop out, I involuntarily
        gasp.
      </p>
      <p>"What...!"</p>
      <p>On the first page of the book, there is a subtitle,</p>

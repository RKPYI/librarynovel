      </p>
      <p>I recall the contents of the stele I had seen on Ascension Path.</p>
      <p>The upper part that was torn off and couldn't be seen.</p>
      <p>
        'Clearly, given the edges on this stele, this must be the upper part of
        that stele!'
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven’t made the connection before as it seemed unrelated to Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking about it.</p>
      <p>
        Back then, I saw the stone tablet inscribed with ‘Golden Divine Heavenly
        Thunder’ near the black castle.
      </p>
      <p>'I never imagined.'</p>
      <p>This guy is related to the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect.</p>
      <p>Of course, the details will have to wait...</p>
      <p>'I'll have to subdue him first and see.'</p>
      <p>As Yuan Li vomits blood, I charge right in front of him.</p>
      <p>Kugugugung!</p>
      <p>
        My Formless Sword, swung at tremendous speed, clashes against his
        defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as the castle isn’t completely turned to dust, it seems he can
        still exert the power of the Nascent Soul within it.
      </p>
      <p>'But the situation is different from my last life.'</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>I kick Yuan Li squarely.</p>
      <p>
        He looks to erect a shield, but my Formless Sword permeates right
        through, kicking him in the stomach.
      </p>
      <p>Puhak!</p>
      <p>He spits out a mouthful of blood.</p>
      <p>
        And then, having been kicked by my Formless Sword, he is blown away,
        flying out of the punctured black castle.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>
        Once outside the castle's domain, his cultivation falls to the level of
        a mere Core Formation Great Perfection.
      </p>
      <p>[You, you bastard...!]</p>
      <p>
        Grinding his teeth, Yuan Li pulls out seven scrolls from his storage
        artifact.
      </p>
      <p>He opens the scrolls, while summoning two blood cloud ghost kings.</p>
      <p>Seven demon souls also emerge.</p>
      <p>But…</p>
      <p>"In the name of Prince Seo Ran."</p>
      <p>Seo Ran's voice echoes across the desert.</p>
      <p>
        "Children of the sea, kneel before the bloodline of the Sea Dragon
        King."
      </p>
      <p>Ziiing!</p>
      <p>Seo Ran's command becomes an order, binding the demon souls.</p>
      <p>The dragon demon soul immediately prostrates itself.</p>
      <p>
        The other demon souls, initially resisting Seo Ran's command, also
        reluctantly knelt down.
      </p>
      <p>"I can't hold demon souls above Core Formation for long!"</p>
      <p>Seo Ran urgently shouts, and I nod.</p>
      <p>-Kyaaaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>-Guaaaaaa!!</p>
      <p>Ahead, two ghost kings scream, each wielding a scythe.</p>
      <p>But, from behind, another booming voice is heard.</p>
      <p>[Under the name of the Nether Crossing Ship.]</p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>
        [All ghosts shall bow before the boat that crosses the River of the
        Netherworld.]
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        From the Nether Crossing Ship behind me, a strong suction force
        targeting ghosts manifests.
      </p>
      <p>-Guaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>-Kyaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>
        The two ghost kings scream, trying their best to resist being sucked
        into the Nether Crossing Ship and planting their scythes into the desert
        to hold their ground.
      </p>
      <p>In an instant, three of Yuan Li’s major forces are neutralized.</p>
      <p>'Seo Ran and Song Jin are a perfect match against Yuan Li.'</p>
      <p>
        I realized this in my past life when I saw Seo Ran subdue Yuan Li using
        the Summoning Wind, True Blood Transformation, but in this life, their
        compatibility is even more apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, if Yuan Li could properly recall his ghost kings and supply
        the energy of a Nascent Soul to his demon souls and ghost kings, even
        Seo Ran and Song Jin would find it hard to neutralize Yuan Li so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        But once driven out of the black castle, he became much easier to
        handle.
      </p>
      <p>Step, step...</p>
      <p>I draw my Formless Sword and walk towards him.</p>
      <p>[Krgh, You! Damn you! You think you can defeat me so easily?]</p>
      <p>Boong Boong Boong!</p>
      <p>
        Around him, bone dagger dharma treasures, a spear dharma treasure, and a
        crystal skull staff float up.
      </p>
      <p>Above him, the Five Elements Blood Curse Banners emerge.</p>
      <p>Charararak!</p>
      <p>The Five Elements Blood Curse Banners fly towards my head.</p>
      <p>But I let the banners hit me.</p>
      <p>Puk!</p>
      <p>
        With a slight sting, the Five Elements Blood Curse Banners are absorbed
        into the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner located in my upper dantian.
      </p>
      <p>[What...!]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li trembles in dismay.</p>
      <p>Step, step...</p>
      <p>I walk slowly towards Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>
        [That reaction, you also have the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner...
        alright…then...!]
      </p>
      <p>Seventeen bone dagger dharma treasures spin.</p>
      <p>I swing my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>The link that connects the dharma treasures to Yuan Li severs.</p>
      <p>The dharma treasures fall to the ground.</p>
      <p>[Eh, eek]</p>
      <p>A ghost king emerges from the blood-colored spear, grabbing it.</p>
      <p>
        Immediately upon emerging, the ghost king, resisting the suction of the
        Nether Crossing Ship, desperately plants the spear into the ground.
      </p>
      <p>Eventually, all Yuan Li has left is the crystal skull staff.</p>
      <p>[Krrrgh...!]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li begins casting a spell with a murmuring voice.</p>
      <p>Chwajwajwajwaj!</p>
      <p>
        From the staff, blood trees sprout in the desert, and a sea of blood
        covers the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>Clouds of blood erupt from the blood sea, enveloping him.</p>
      <p>Instantly, the area transforms into his domain.</p>
      <p>Blood-red ghosts rush towards me.</p>
      <p>From the blood clouds, numerous skulls fall like rain on top of me.</p>
      <p>
        Blood from the sea surges, turning into arrows of blood shooting at me.
      </p>
      <p>The whole area is dyed in blood.</p>
      <p>And then, I swing my sword.</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>With a single slash.</p>
      <p>That slash sweeps away all the miscellaneous spells.</p>
      <p>
        Even after that, the slash does not lose momentum, changing its
        trajectory and extending in all directions like thorny vines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li resists with numerous spells, but the slash permeates through
        the stronger parts and cuts through the weaker ones, nullifying them
        all.
      </p>
      <p>Finally.</p>
      <p>Chwak!</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li's body is swept up by the storm of colorless trajectories and
        turns into a bloody mess.
      </p>
      <p>Of course.</p>
      <p>Churuk, chururuk!</p>
      <p>
        As he absorbs the blood fog, his flesh begins to wriggle and regenerate.
      </p>
      <p>But the regeneration takes too long.</p>
      <p>It takes two full breaths.</p>
      <p>In two breaths, I can swing my Formless Sword hundreds of times.</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>Kwang, kwang!</p>
      <p>
        All the miscellaneous things in front of me are swept away, and I
        quickly approach Yuan Li, who is regenerating, and kick him.
      </p>
      <p>Jjeoong!</p>
      <p>As he’s regenerating, he is again blown far away into the desert.</p>
      <p>Chururururuk!</p>
      <p>
        Like a cockroach boasting its vitality, he regenerates even while being
        blown away.
      </p>
      <p>But in no time, I am already above him.</p>
      <p>
        I bend my legs, then extend them, stomping down on Yuan Li with both
        feet.
      </p>
      <p>Puukkk!</p>
      <p>Yuan Li's body, struck by my feet, splits in two and falls below.</p>
      <p>Chalak Charalak!</p>
      <p>From his severed body, fish made of blood appear and fly at me.</p>
      <p>Boong Boong, Boong, Boong!</p>
      <p>My Formless Sword rotates around me.</p>
      <p>
        In a state of unified offense and defense, I ground all the approaching
        fish and again plummet down towards him.
      </p>
      <p>Cheulpuk!</p>
      <p>His upper body, split in two, explodes into a bloody mess.</p>
      <p>He again regenerates his upper body from his lower half.</p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>I feel the air burst behind me.</p>
      <p>
        Having turned Yuan Li's upper body into a blood mist, I approach his
        regenerating lower half and raise my hand.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>I slam my hand down.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        As Yuan Li's body tries to regenerate, a chasm forms beneath him, and he
        is split in half.
      </p>
      <p>"Keep regenerating, you cockroach."</p>
      <p>Churuk Churururuk!</p>
      <p>The halved body begins to reattach itself.</p>
      <p>Hwaruruk!</p>
      <p>His blood turns into Blood Fire and envelops me.</p>
      <p>
        But with my Formless Sword flowing through my entire body, I break
        through the Blood Fire and reach out.
      </p>
      <p>Kwak!</p>
      <p>My hand grasps Yuan Li's head.</p>
      <p>"I'll kill you until you die."</p>
      <p>With that, I grab his head and slam it into the desert floor.</p>
      <p>Toogwaang!</p>
      <p>His upper body again vanishes along with sword scars.</p>
      <p>By now, Yuan Li's regeneration has visibly slowed.</p>
      <p>Shik Shiririk!</p>
      <p>
        I watch Yuan Li, wriggling and regenerating his upper body, and raise my
        foot.
      </p>
      <p>[Wa-wait a moment…]</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>
        In my past life, I killed him too easily, watching out for the Mad Lord
        and Seo Hweol.
      </p>
      <p>It was fortunate that I killed him quickly.</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord was slightly outmatched among the many Heavenly Being
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I dragged it out like this back then, Seo Hweol might have come in
        person.
      </p>
      <p>[Wai-]</p>
      <p>Peong!</p>
      <p>After blowing up his face again.</p>
      <p>
        Whenever he tries to regenerate properly, I relentlessly attack him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intermittent spells flying towards me are so weak that I can fend them
        off with my Formless Sword-imbued body, and even those are getting
        weaker.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>When I blew up his face once more.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing that it takes him so long to even regenerate somewhat, I step on
        his stomach and finally stop attacking.
      </p>
      <p>"It’s a little refreshing."</p>
      <p>[Krgghh krghaaaargh...!]</p>
      <p>
        “I feel a little sorry about this. But you see, I had quite a bit pent
        up.”
      </p>
      <p>[Cough, cough!]</p>
      <p>
        "Now that your regeneration seems to have slowed down quite a bit… If I
        crush your Golden Core now, you'll die, won't you?"
      </p>
      <p>[Krrgh…]</p>
      <p>Gasping for breath, Yuan Li looks up at me and asks.</p>
      <p>
        [Why, just why are you doing this to me? Are, are you... a Nascent Soul
        cultivator?]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Think of it that way. In fact, I could have crushed your Golden Core
        and severed your soul right away, but I wanted to hit you a bit."
      </p>
      <p>[Ah, thank, thank you... for sparing me.]</p>
      <p>I look down at him with a slight smile.</p>
      <p>"I never said I'd spare you, though..."</p>
      <p>[P-please spare me... I won't make you regret it...!]</p>
      <p>"How so?"</p>
      <p>[There is a lot of wealth in my castle...!]</p>
      <p>"If I kill you, all of that becomes mine anyway, doesn't it?"</p>
      <p>[I, I can also teach you the devilish arts I have mastered!]</p>
      <p>"I'm not interested in devilish arts."</p>
      <p>
        [Wh-what do you want then! I know a lot! If you have any questions,
        please just ask!]
      </p>
      <p>I grab his hair.</p>
      <p>"Now you seem ready to talk."</p>
      <p>Step by step...</p>
      <p>I drag him toward the Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>I place Yuan Li on the deck of the Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>
        "You are now my slave. You cannot defy my orders, and if I choose to
        kill you, you must submit without resistance. Understand?"
      </p>
      <p>[Yes, yes! If you sp-spare my life right now...]</p>
      <p>"Swear it on the Nether Crossing Ship."</p>
      <p>[...!]</p>
      <p>I can feel Yuan Li's intent flare up in anger and fear.</p>
      <p>
        "You didn't swear sincerely. I guess I should kill you right now..."
      </p>
      <p>
        [I swear! I swear! I swear on the Nether Crossing Ship! I will follow
        your commands!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, Yuan Li swears a ghostly oath on the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if he breaks his oath, his soul will be instantly sucked into the
        Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>I command him.</p>
      <p>"Wait here for now."</p>
      <p>It’s time to check the contents of the stele.</p>
      <p>Ta-att</p>
      <p>
        I jump down and read the upper part of the stele that’s been intriguing
        me.
      </p>
      <p>"What exactly does it say..."</p>
      <p>
        The upper part of the stele is a bit longer and contains much more
        content than the lower part.
      </p>
      <p>The content of the stele is as follows:</p>
      <p>
        ―A warning to future generations: all immortal treasures in the world
        are ultimately connected to True Immortals and the force of attraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who are not yet prepared and are connected to True Immortals,
        calamity will inevitably come.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the few advantages of this grotesque and bizarre world is that
        due to its ominous nature, most True Immortals find it difficult to read
        and locate heavenly fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, descendants. If you happen to obtain an immortal treasure, or
        something of the Immortal Realm, leave it in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not underestimate the desires and powers of those who have reached
        the Great Boundary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who possess an immortal treasure and ascend will inevitably be
        noticed by True Immortals, no matter where they ascend to.
      </p>
      <p>Especially my descendants.</p>
      <p>
        Growing up in the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, if you happen to
        possess the Heavenly Lightning Banner, heed my warning, and ...
      </p>
      <p>The content ends there.</p>
      <p>I connect this content of the stele in Ascension Path.</p>
      <p>
        ―...Leave it behind for future generations, relinquish your desires, and
        ascend. Those who do not adhere will face calamity.
      </p>
      <p>"...It's not just encouragement to let go of desires."</p>
      <p>It’s a much more specific warning than I expected.</p>
      <p>
        I think of the three Heavenly Beings, each hoarding their sect's
        treasures, and the Sea Dragon King who left considerable treasures in
        the Sea Dragon Palace.
      </p>
      <p>'The Sea Dragon King knew this warning.'</p>
      <p>And…</p>
      <p>"...Ah."</p>
      <p>
        The warning was intended for the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect.
      </p>
      <p>But the current generation of the sect...</p>
      <p>"Didn’t they take the Heavenly Lightning Banner as is?"</p>
      <p>
        The Nether Crossing Ship of Black Ghost Valley is a 'counterfeit' of an
        immortal treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Blue Sky Armor of Azure Tiger Saint is an 'exceptional' dharma
        treasure beyond ordinary ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Heavenly Lightning Banner is a rumored 'immortal treasure' of
        Yang Su-jin.
      </p>
      <p>'Jeon Myeong-hoon, this guy...'</p>
      <p>I can’t help but worry for him.</p>
      <p>
        I have been most worried about Deputy Oh and Team Leader Kim, who were
        captured by Seo Hweol and Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        But unexpectedly, the most concerning might be Jeon Myeong-hoon, who
        could be entangled with a Great Boundary existence right now.
      </p>
      <p>Crackle, crackle...</p>
      <p>
        I look at the stele floating in front of me, sparking with lightning.
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li quietly came to stand beside me.</p>
      <p>
        "What's your relationship with the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect?
        What is this black castle?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [This castle, 40,000 years ago, was in Ascension Path. It was originally
        a shrine dedicated to Golden Deity Yang Su-jin. I am a descendant of the
        clan that managed the shrine.]
      </p>
      <p>The torn-off parts of the castle.</p>
      <p>
        I remember the remnants of the stone structure in Ascension Path, which
        seemed to have something ripped off from it. That was another part of
        this castle.
      </p>
      <p>
        "So, you have no connection with the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder
        Sect?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [After the shrine was torn from Ascension Path and flown to the desert
        during the war 40,000 years ago, my clan was forgotten in the memories
        of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect.]
      </p>
      <p>"I see..."</p>
      <p>I continue to question him.</p>
      <p>"What was your original purpose?"</p>
      <p>
        [...After all the Heavenly Being cultivators ascended, my goal was to
        rule the entire continent, harnessing the resources to master devilish
        arts to an extreme degree. Then, with the blessing of the Serving
        Command Seal, I planned to ascend to an upper realm called the Blood Yin
        Realm (血陰界), not the one connected to the Ascension Gate.]
      </p>
      <p>"The Blood Yin Realm?"</p>
      <p>
        [Yes. Nowadays, thanks to Yang Su-jin's Ascension Gate, everyone ascends
        through the gate. However, 120,000 years ago, depending on the
        cultivation method practiced, the upper realm one ascended to differed.
        The upper ream connected to the Ascension Gate isn't suitable for
        practicing devilish arts. Though it's hundreds of times better than this
        world, it's still not optimized for devilish arts. Hence, I was planning
        a more traditional ascension through the Serving Command Seal.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Knowing about the Blood Yin Realm, it seems you have information about
        the upper realms. Tell me about it."
      </p>
      <p>Yuan Li cautiously begins his story.</p>
      <p>
        [There are currently six known upper realms: Blood Yin, True Devil,
        Ancient Force, Nether Ghost, Purple Gold, and Bright Cold. I don't have
        information about Ancient Force, Nether Ghost, and Purple Gold, but the
        Bright Cold and True Devil realms are well-known. The Bright Cold Realm
        is currently connected to the Ascension Gate. The True Devil Realm is
        adjacent to the Bright Cold Realm and is at war with it.]
      </p>
      <p>His explanation continues.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran also joins in, listening carefully, and Song Jin evaluates Yuan
        Li's story from above the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        [In the times before the Ascension Gate, if one practiced ordinary
        immortal or righteous cultivation methods, they would ascend to the
        Bright Cold Realm. Practicing devilish arts led to the True Devil Realm.
        Ascending to the True Devil Realm allows one to receive the True Devil
        Qi, enabling a transformation into the devil race.]
      </p>
      <p>"What about the Blood Yin Realm then?"</p>
      <p>
        [The Blood Yin Realm was originally part of the True Devil Realm but
        separated due to the overwhelming evil, yin, and turbid energy.
        Ascending there instead of the True Devil Realm allows absorption of the
        realm’s power, potentially becoming a far more exalted being than the
        devils of the True Devil Realm.]
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        In essence, Yuan Li's plan was to commit a massacre across the entire
        continent, gather extreme devilish energy, and ascend to a more
        exceptional realm suited for him.
      </p>
      <p>Then...</p>
      <p>'What is Seo Hweol planning to achieve through such a person?'</p>
      <p>Did he also desire to go to the Blood Yin Realm?</p>
      <p>'No, he has too many schemes laid out in this world.'</p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol's objective isn't an upper realm, but specifically this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't deduce Seo Hweol's purpose from just listening to Yuan Li's
        explanation.
      </p>
      <p>"Did you hear anything from Seo Hweol?"</p>
      <p>
        [From the Sea Dragon King? No, but... not from him directly, but I did
        steal one of his cultivation methods and a drop of his blood. If you
        want it, I can give it to you.]
      </p>
      <p>"…No need."</p>
      <p>
        This guy doesn't even realize he is being used by the Sea Dragon King.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘So, this guy’s goal and the Sea Dragon King’s goal coincides. Is the
        massacre he was planning to commit for the Blood Yin Realm somehow what
        the Sea Dragon King wants…?’
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm... right."</p>
      <p>I remember there’s one more thing to obtain from this bastard.</p>
      <p>
        “If you wanted the Serving Command Seal’s blessing for your ascension,
        you must have wanted the seal, correct?”
      </p>
      <p>[Yes, that is correct.]</p>
      <p>
        “Then, you must also have the method to break down all the floors of
        Serving Command Palace?”
      </p>
      <p>
        [Yes, I have analyzed the energy flowing through the layers of Serving
        Command Palace and prepared a formation to break down all of its floors.
        If you want it, I'll give it to you…!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li takes out red flag dharma treasures from his storage artifact,
        hands them to me, and explains how to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to the formation Cheongmun Ryeong and I created, it’s a
        formation specifically for Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>"Alright, and..."</p>
      <p>I asked Yuan Li a few more questions.</p>
      <p>
        Then, I learned the location of his treasure vault and even where he hid
        his Blood Spirits.
      </p>
      <p>
        After following him around the inside of the black castle, I came across
        what he had been hiding, just as I expected.
      </p>
      <p>"This is..."</p>
      <p>I gaze at a large blood-red jar.</p>
      <p>
        The jar is sealed with a pristine white cloth, and although its color is
        red, it doesn't emit the foul stench of blood like Yuan Li's other
        items. Instead, a fragrant scent wafts from within.
      </p>
      <p>"What's inside this?"</p>
      <p>[Inside is... my Blood Body.]</p>
      <p>"...What is this Blood Body made of?"</p>
      <p>
        [Among Blood Bodies, the basic Blood Body itself is cultivated from my
        blood in a spiritual fluid. Later, if I wish to add special functions, I
        dissolve collected materials into the jar, slowly synthesizing them with
        the Blood Body.]
      </p>
      <p>"Collected materials?"</p>
      <p>
        [Yes, solutions made of impressive enemies' corpses dissolved in blood.]
      </p>
      <p>"...How many 'materials' have you dissolved in this Blood Body?"</p>
      <p>Yuan Li's subsequent revelation surprises me.</p>
      <p>
        [Currently, the Blood Body is purely accumulating spiritual power and
        practicing devilish arts with unadulterated devilish energy, so nothing
        has been synthesized yet. Originally, I planned to find my Blood
        Spirits, regain cultivation, and slowly synthesize it over the next 200
        years.]
      </p>
      <p>"Understood... Hand over everything you know about the Blood Body."</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li writes down everything about creating, manipulating, and
        synthesizing the Blood Body, and hands it to me.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, I successfully gathered everything I needed from Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>"It seems I've heard everything worthwhile now."</p>
      <p>
        [Yes, I have told you everything truthfully, without omission. Of
        course, my usefulness doesn't end here. There are also those whom I've
        made slaves by implanting the Five Elements Blood Curse Banners in
        advance...]
      </p>
      <p>
        Just then, Song Jin, who has been listening to Yuan Li's story, speaks
        up.
      </p>
      <p>[Let me sift through his mind a bit.]</p>
      <p>[What...!]</p>
      <p>
        [He appears to have told the truth, but why take the words of a devilish
        cultivator at face value? Surely the secrets he's been hiding are far
        greater than what he's blurted out so far. If I just delve a little into
        his upper dantian, I can make him spill everything, even the secrets
        he's unaware of.]
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, that sounds reasonable."</p>
      <p>I nod.</p>
      <p>"Go ahead."</p>
      <p>[Wait a moment!]</p>
      <p>
        "Stay still, Yuan Li. If you resist, I'll kill you. Are you planning to
        break your oath to the Nether Crossing Ship?"
      </p>
      <p>[Ju-just wait, Master!]</p>
      <p>But Song Jin's hand reaches Yuan Li's head faster.</p>
      <p>Soon after.</p>
      <p>[Aaaaaaagh!]</p>
      <p>Yuan Li trembles violently and screams.</p>
      <p>Then, Song Jin speaks.</p>
      <p>
        [He told most of it, but he had sealed some information in his mind.
        Roughly tearing through those seals revealed the following…]
      </p>
      <p>
        The information Song Jin reveals includes methods for offering
        sacrifices to high-ranking entities in the Blood Yin Realm and efficient
        rituals for blood sacrifices.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, it also includes Yuan Li's personal history and more.</p>
      <p>"Not particularly useful information."</p>
      <p>
        [Regardless, the fact that he dared to hide things from you is
        significant. Especially the method of making sacrifices to entities in
        the Blood Yin Realm can be threatening, as it might allow one to break
        free from the Nether Crossing Ship's oath.]
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, is that so?"</p>
      <p>It didn't really concern me.</p>
      <p>[And...]</p>
      <p>After rummaging through Yuan Li's mind for a while, Song Jin says,</p>
      <p>
        [As for information about the Sea Dragon King, it seems he was lying
        about being unaware.]
      </p>
      <p>"...! Is there any information?"</p>
      <p>Song Jin's eyes flare with ghostly fire.</p>
      <p>[...No.]</p>
      <p>Song Jin clicks his tongue.</p>
      <p>
        [The remnant of Seo Hweol that appeared when I struck with my full power
        during my prime... It seems a seal was placed in this one's mind to
        automatically erase any information about Seo Hweol upon activation. The
        seal was embedded in his upper dantian. He didn't even realize the
        information in his mind was being erased.]
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>It means there's no way to obtain information about Seo Hweol.</p>
      <p>"So that's it then?"</p>
      <p>[That's all.]</p>
      <p>Shiiik!</p>
      <p>Song Jin releases Yuan Li, who collapses, clutching his head.</p>
      <p>I look down at him.</p>
      <p>"Alright, now that we've obtained all the useful information, die."</p>
      <p>[Wait! I, I still have uses!]</p>
      <p>"Even after extracting all the information you've hidden?"</p>
      <p>
        [No! My influence, obtained through covert operations around the world,
        isn't just this!]
      </p>
      <p>"Is that so?"</p>
      <p>
        [The three clans of the West, the four tribes of the North, the five
        lords of the East are all under my control....]
      </p>
      <p>"Interesting."</p>
      <p>I raise my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>"Farewell."</p>
      <p>
        [Why, why, why! Ah, no! Please don’t! I don’t want to die! Master,
        master, master! You son of a bitch!!!!]
      </p>
      <p>Slice.</p>
      <p>My Formless Sword gleams as it cleanly severs Yuan Li's soul.</p>
      <p>Thus, Yuan Li, having spilled everything, perished.</p>
      <p>"Don't worry..."</p>
      <p>
        'Next time, I won't torture you with false hope and will grant you a
        swift death.'
      </p>
      <p>I gaze coldly at Yuan Li's lifeless body, murmuring to myself.</p>
      <p>Song Jin chuckles.</p>
      <p>
        [Not caring about betrayal, I see. You never intended to spare him from
        the start.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's not betrayal. We were never on the same side to begin with. I
        simply cut down an enemy."
      </p>
      <p>I look at the jar said to contain Yuan Li's Blood Body.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Opening the cloth that sealed the jar, I see a familiar beauty inside,
        neither male nor female.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the devilish method I acquired from Yuan Li, I separate my
        consciousness and insert it into the Blood Body.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>The Blood Body accepts my consciousness, opening its eyes.</p>
      <p>It rises to its feet.</p>
      <p>
        The Blood Body is a naked, pale-white figure, with jet-black hair
        cascading down, covering its vital parts.
      </p>
      <p>'Yuan Li was cultivating his original devilish arts in it...'</p>
      <p>
        Apparently, not having grown as much as it would in 200 years, the Blood
        Body's cultivation is only at the later stages of Core Formation.
      </p>
      <p>"It will be quite useful when investigating the Ascension Gate."</p>
      <p>
        After all, having a puppet that can go ahead and face death first is
        very useful.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover...</p>
      <p>Thump, thump...</p>
      <p>
        I manipulate the Blood Body, dressing it in Yuan Li's blood robes and
        equipping it with his dharma treasures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li's dharma treasures are still functional, making it a truly
        useful puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The spirit stones and elixirs beneath the castle can be taken by Senior
        Song Jin. I don't particularly need such resources.
      </p>
      <p>[Oh, really?]</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin, delighted, plunders Yuan Li's treasure vault, loading up the
        Nether Crossing Ship with spirit stones for recharging.
      </p>
      <p>While rummaging through Yuan Li's castle...</p>
      <p>"This is..."</p>
      <p>
        I found something familiar among the items scattered in Yuan Li's vault.
      </p>
      <p>A jade norigae.</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>It belonged to Wolryang's great-grandson.</p>
      <p>'He said he was devoured long ago...'</p>
      <p>I decide to bring the norigae to Wolryang.</p>
      <p>Shortly after.</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin and Seo Ran began to move the Nether Crossing Ship again at my
        request.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>The Nether Crossing Ship roamed the vast Northern Plains.</p>
      <p>
        We fed Yuan Li's Blood Spirits, hidden across the Northern Plains, one
        by one to the Nether Crossing Ship, eradicating any chances of Yuan Li's
        resurrection.
      </p>
      <p>During this process...</p>
      <p>
        I spotted a familiar face among the bewildered mortals and cultivators
        watching the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>It was Wolryang.</p>
      <p>I descended from the Nether Crossing Ship and approached him.</p>
      <p>"Who, who are you?"</p>
      <p>
        Wolryang looked at me with a wary expression. I walked up to him and
        handed him the norigae.
      </p>
      <p>"...This is..."</p>
      <p>I briefly told Wolryang about his great-grandson's story.</p>
      <p>Yuan Li, who lived in the Heaven-Treading Dessert.</p>
      <p>The many he had devoured.</p>
      <p>And among them, the relic of Wolryang's great-grandson...</p>
      <p>"...Thank you..."</p>
      <p>Wolryang exuded an indescribable mix of pain and slight relief.</p>
      <p>"Really, thank you...!"</p>
      <p>
        I listened to Wolryang's words of gratitude for a while and joined him
        in a moment of silence for those sacrificed by Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nether Crossing Ship continued to move, visiting the areas near the
        Heaven-Treading Dessert, the North, the East, the Southern Seas, and the
        vicinity of the Western countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, from the prow of the Nether Crossing Ship, I spot a familiar city.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The Nether Crossing Ship hovers above Cheon-saek City, targeting Yuan
        Li's last Blood Spirit hidden in its center.
      </p>
      <p>Kiiiiing!</p>
      <p>
        Yuan Li's Blood Spirit, concealed in the heart of Cheon-saek City, emits
        monstrous screams as it is devoured by the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Phew, it's all over now. The chances of resurrection was less than a
        penny the moment his soul was severed, but to go this far... You're
        quite ruthless.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "...It's not so much about guarding against Yuan Li's resurrection..."
      </p>
      <p>I smile bitterly.</p>
      <p>"I just wanted to completely erase his existence from this world."</p>
      <p>
        I gaze down at Cheon-saek City and the countless people living there.
      </p>
      <p>I hope for Yuan Li’s traces to not linger in their daily lives.</p>
      <p>Squeeze...</p>
      <p>
        I hold not the norigae given to Wolryang, but the jade norigage that has
        become my dharma treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Senior, I have someone to meet briefly. Could you please wait for me?"
      </p>
      <p>[Alright.]</p>
      <p>
        Holding the jade norigae, I land in front of a familiar workshop located
        in the center of Cheon-saek City.
      </p>
      <p>Thump, thump...</p>
      <p>My heart is racing.</p>
      <p>What should I say first?</p>
      <p>I...</p>
      <p>Creak...</p>
      <p>I open the door to the magic artifact store and step inside.</p>

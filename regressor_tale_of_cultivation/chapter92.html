      <p>Chapter 92: 10th Cycle's First Day</p>
      <p>Blink!</p>
      <p>I open my eyes and look around.</p>
      <p>The familiar scent of the forest surrounds me.</p>
      <p>'...I died.'</p>
      <p>
        I didn’t expect to survive, but it’s frustrating not to have inflicted
        any significant damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I guess my final act of cursing the Longevity Fruits was my last
        struggle...'
      </p>
      <p>I click my tongue.</p>
      <p>'Is that the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator?'</p>
      <p>
        I recall how Yuan Li's spell engulfed the entire desert like a sandstorm
        when he used the blood mist.
      </p>
      <p>
        'A Core Formation cultivator being akin to natural disaster?
        Ridiculous.'
      </p>
      <p>'That' is what a real disaster should be.</p>
      <p>Core Formation is merely a stage of mimicking a disaster.</p>
      <p>I sense my companions gradually awakening around me.</p>
      <p>
        I stimulate my consciousness and use a sleeping spell to put them all
        back to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I realize something odd.</p>
      <p>'Why... doesn't my upper dantian hurt?'</p>
      <p>
        I haven’t separated my consciousness with the Formless Sword and have
        yet to adjust its size.
      </p>
      <p>Yet, my upper dantian is unharmed.</p>
      <p>There’s no sign of it swelling.</p>
      <p>'What...ugh!'</p>
      <p>"Kuhuk...!"</p>
      <p>
        A piercing sudden headache grips me, and I clutch my head, writhing on
        the ground.
      </p>
      <p>"Cough, kuhuk..!"</p>
      <p>It feels like my soul is being torn apart!</p>
      <p>It hurts!</p>
      <p>So much pain!</p>
      <p>And then, I understand why.</p>
      <p>'How... how could...'</p>
      <p>In the core of my consciousness.</p>
      <p>Where my soul resides.</p>
      <p>There, five blood-red flags are embedded.</p>
      <p>"Aaargh..!"</p>
      <p>The Five Elements Blood Curse Banner left by Yuan Li.</p>
      <p>It has followed me through my return, remaining in my soul.</p>
      <p>"Uhk, uhk...!"</p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, after a while of rampaging and tearing through my soul, the
        Five Elements Blood Curse Banner gradually quiet down and begin to
        settle.
      </p>
      <p>After a while.</p>
      <p>"Hoo, hoo..."</p>
      <p>
        The outburst of the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner finally ceases, and
        I can finally get up.
      </p>
      <p>"...This is insane.."</p>
      <p>I suddenly feel a chill crawl up my spine.</p>
      <p>Return isn't invincible.</p>
      <p>
        I should have realized that my consciousness and soul are maintained
        through each return.
      </p>
      <p>
        The restraints connected to my consciousness and soul return with me!
      </p>
      <p>'Have I been too complacent until now...'</p>
      <p>
        If a high-level cultivator intentionally brainwashes me or imposes a
        restraint on my consciousness, that restraint will continue after my
        return.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, if I ever fall into the hands of a high-level
        cultivator, I could become their slave for eternity.
      </p>
      <p>'What to do about this Five Elements Blood Curse Banner..?'</p>
      <p>
        If the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner that returned with me is
        connected to Yuan Li, he might have noticed by now in the
        Heaven-Treading Desert.
      </p>
      <p>'I should be safe for a few days at least.'</p>
      <p>
        But considering Yuan Li is a Nascent Soul cultivator who only emerged
        after waiting for the Heavenly Being cultivators to ascend, he wouldn't
        dare show his face at this point when the world is still filled with
        Heavenly Being cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Maybe I should ask the arriving Heavenly Being cultivators to take a
        look?'
      </p>
      <p>
        If I ask Sir Chang-ho, given his character, he might at least check it
        out once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Holding onto that hope, I first find some yellow bamboo roots and
        undergo complete transformation.
      </p>
      <p>Creak, crack...</p>
      <p>
        Harmony settles in my upper, middle, and lower dantian, and my physical
        body evolves to effortlessly contain the greater consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>'Now even the slight headache has disappeared.'</p>
      <p>I observe my consciousness and upper dantian once again.</p>
      <p>
        'However, this Five Elements Blood Curse Banner. If not for Yuan Li's
        mental restraint, it would be quite useful in the early stages of
        return.'
      </p>
      <p>
        The Five Elements Blood Curse Banner suppresses my consciousness,
        preventing my upper dantian from swelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to this, I don't have to separate my consciousness to avoid
        headaches at the beginning of my return.
      </p>
      <p>
        With just the Formless Sword and the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner,
        the overload of my upper dantian caused by consciousness is completely
        resolved.
      </p>
      <p>"Then, let's..."</p>
      <p>First, I carry my companions and take them to a cave.</p>
      <p>
        After that, I cast a stronger sleeping spell and observe my
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>Deep within my consciousness.</p>
      <p>Inside my soul.</p>
      <p>There, five blood-red flags are implanted.</p>
      <p>I scrutinize with the demon senses.</p>
      <p>
        The flow of Yin and Yang energy from the five flags is suppressing my
        consciousness through mutual reinforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the Yin and Yang spiritual energy is not connected to a distant
        place.
      </p>
      <p>The same is true for the intent.</p>
      <p>
        'The intent of another flows, but it is gradually scattering and not
        particularly connected externally.
      </p>
      <p>'For now, it seems Yuan Li is not connected to it.'</p>
      <p>
        Even the remnants of his intent are slowly dispersing and my intent is
        taking over where his is scattering.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I wonder, will Yuan Li's intent completely disappear when it scatters?"
      </p>
      <p>Judging by the speed, it seems it will all dissipate soon.</p>
      <p>
        But I have an ominous feeling about the intent flowing through the
        restraint.
      </p>
      <p>'It's my intent, but it doesn't listen to me.'</p>
      <p>
        The intent flowing over the restraint moves according to its own logic,
        not mine, contributing to the suppression of my own consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>
        As I try to move with my consciousness and Dual Energy Sword Control,
        the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner vibrates, pressuring my
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>"Ugh..."</p>
      <p>
        Moving my consciousness any further seems like it will bring the pain of
        my soul being torn again.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Moving consciousness greatly is restricted by the Blood Curse Banner.'
      </p>
      <p>Fortunately, during the last moments of my past life.</p>
      <p>
        When I was in front of Yuan Li, even moving my body was restricted, but
        now, perhaps because Yuan Li's intent is dispersing, there is no pain
        unless I move my consciousness significantly.
      </p>
      <p>'I need to at least alleviate the restraint.'</p>
      <p>
        Observing the flow of the restraint, I wait for Yuan Li's intent to
        completely disperse.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all traces of him are gone, I carefully examine the restraint.
      </p>
      <p>'This is...'</p>
      <p>
        I observe the Blood Curse Banner and soon understand the fundamental
        principle it is based on.
      </p>
      <p>
        'A restraint interpreting human consciousness as the Five Elements.'
      </p>
      <p>
        If it isn't for my complete mastery of the Five Surpassing Paths to
        Cultivation and understanding of Five Elements spiritual energy, I
        wouldn't have been able to discern the fundamental principle of the
        restraint so easily.
      </p>
      <p>"Huh, interesting."</p>
      <p>
        Of course, spiritual energy, consciousness, and soul aren't exactly the
        same, so even though I have mastered the Five Elements and understand a
        bit of the logic of Five Elements spiritual energy, I can't instantly
        dismantle the restraint.
      </p>
      <p>
        'But if I understand this method of corresponding the Five Elements to
        human consciousness...'
      </p>
      <p>
        As I’m interpreting the symbols of the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner.
      </p>
      <p>'Wait, this is.'</p>
      <p>I suddenly realize these symbols are very familiar to me.</p>
      <p>I re-realize the basis of the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner.</p>
      <p>"Curse spell..."</p>
      <p>A spell that maximizes others' pain and suppresses the opponent.</p>
      <p>
        These symbols are quite similar to the curse symbols of the Yin Soul
        Ghost Incantation.
      </p>
      <p>'That's right.'</p>
      <p>
        A spell interpreting the human mind as the Five Elements and finding the
        pain each element can inflict on the human mind.
      </p>
      <p>That is the true nature of the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner.</p>
      <p>Chalalalak!</p>
      <p>
        Understanding the basis of the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner, I
        realize I can interfere with the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner
        implanted in my soul with my consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Human mind is the Five Elements. The realization I had when I
        understood the Gang Sphere, that I am not just myself, and similar to
        how the Five Elements are interdependent, the mind is also made up of
        different parts...'
      </p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>
        My intent slowly moves, manipulating the Five Elements Blood Curse
        Banner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Five Elements Blood Curse Banner, deeply embedded in my soul, begins
        to move and gradually surface above my soul.
      </p>
      <p>'Push it out...!'</p>
      <p>Paaaat!</p>
      <p>My consciousness is returning.</p>
      <p>
        The size of my previous consciousness is gradually coming back, allowing
        me to move it as I will.
      </p>
      <p>"Aah..."</p>
      <p>
        I raise my consciousness, which had been uncomfortably suppressed by the
        Five Elements Blood Curse Banner, like a body stretching after being
        stuck somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>It feels like I can live a little again.</p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>Click!</p>
      <p>
        My consciousness entangles again in the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner
        while trying to rise, regaining only about 70% of its mobility. At this
        point, I open my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is there something more I need to do to completely release the metal
        restriction?"
      </p>
      <p>
        With over 70% of consciousness regained, there's almost no discomfort. I
        can even move the remaining 30% if I endure the pain, so I’m not
        worried.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, no matter how much I try to push out the Five Elements Blood
        Curse Banner further, it does not disappear. Something is missing.
      </p>
      <p>‘Damn, that Bloodwood. He left me a troublesome legacy.’</p>
      <p>
        At this point, I stop researching the mental restraint and decide to
        leave the rest to Sir Chang ho and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If Sir Chang-ho can't do it, after listening to the will of Song Jin
        remaining in the Nether Crossing Ship, I'll have to ask him for help."
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, being the remnant soul of a Heavenly Being cultivator, he
        must know a lot and surely have a solution.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>I calm my consciousness and open my eyes again.</p>
      <p>The sun is setting.</p>
      <p>After looking at my sleeping colleagues, I fall into thought.</p>
      <p>"What is fate..."</p>
      <p>
        Fate, as mentioned by the remnant shadow of Yang Su-jin from Shattered
        Heaven Peak.
      </p>
      <p>Fate, as realized by Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        Fate, as explained by Yuan Li after obtaining the Serving Command Seal.
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord mentioned that fate indeed exists.</p>
      <p>
        It also seems possible to interfere with fate to some extent upon
        reaching the top of cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>'And, the Ender...'</p>
      <p>The last life, when I saw the remnant shadow of Yang Su-jin.</p>
      <p>
        'Despite becoming a being who can interfere with fate, even Yang Su-jin
        ended up like that. Is something overseeing the entire Three Thousand
        Worlds, looking for the Enders?'
      </p>
      <p>What is the Ender, and what is this world?</p>
      <p>I look up at the sky where the sunset is giving way to the stars.</p>
      <p>Then...</p>
      <p>
        I suddenly get the feeling that these stars are watching over the land
        like eyes and shudder.
      </p>
      <p>‘Damn, I’m overthinking.’</p>
      <p>The idea of each star being an eye is as creepy as it gets.</p>
      <p>I shake my head.</p>
      <p>'I've been through too much in my past life...'</p>
      <p>
        Ascending to Qi Building, realizing Beyond the Path to Heaven, capturing
        Song Jin with Seo Ran, watching over his death, learning the Nether
        Crossing Ship's steering method, learning about Serving Command Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon dying after seeing the path above Beyond the Path to
        Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spending several hundred years inside Serving Command Palace, then being
        killed by the Nascent Soul cultivator Yuan Li.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems my mind is unstable due to experiencing too much for too long.
      </p>
      <p>I calm my throbbing head and sigh.</p>
      <p>I look back at the sleeping Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>I remember the him from my last life.</p>
      <p>'He told me to live a bit more like a human.'</p>
      <p>Yes, maybe taking it easy in this life isn't such a bad idea.</p>
      <p>Living life like a human...</p>
      <p>'Forget Serving Command Palace, fate, Ender, and take some rest.'</p>
      <p>
        Especially after the last life, tortured in soul by Yuan Li, the desire
        for rest seems more urgent.
      </p>
      <p>
        'This life, I should hear from the Heavenly Being cultivators about the
        Five Elements Blood Curse Banner and take it easy to recover my mental
        health.'
      </p>
      <p>
        With that thought, I slowly circulate my internal energy with the night
        air.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>Gradually, an Inner Core forms in my dantian.</p>
      <p>
        My whole body tingles pleasantly as if letting out a satisfying burp.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Koong, Koong!</p>
      <p>
        Not long after forming my Inner Core, a white behemoth approaches from
        beyond the forest.
      </p>
      <p>I frown slightly at the figure who interrupted my comtemplation.</p>
      <p>Koong, Koong, Koong!</p>
      <p>[You... What kind of demon beast dares to enter my forest?]</p>
      <p>"...Master of the forest."</p>
      <p>A Core Formation demon fox living in Ascension Path.</p>
      <p>Seeing it, I first politely address it.</p>
      <p>"I was accidentally swept into a spatial rift and landed here."</p>
      <p>
        The creature, after all, has been somewhat gentlemanly so far,
        retreating after taking just one arm and showing some manners.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Please be merciful and allow me to stay in this forest for a few days."
      </p>
      <p>I will also maintain my manners to the end.</p>
      <p>
        [You beast, stop talking nonsense. If you want to stay in my forest, you
        have to offer your limbs.]
      </p>
      <p>"...Master of the forest, I beseech you. Please let me stay."</p>
      <p>
        [How dare you, a member of the demon race, enter another's territory
        uninvited and ask for mercy?]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master of the forest, I apologize for the rudeness. I beseech you one
        last time, please..."
      </p>
      <p>[Enough! Hand over your Demon Core, intruder!]</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>The fox raises its front paw to strike me down.</p>
      <p>Wham!</p>
      <p>[What...]</p>
      <p>And then, I raise my Formless Sword to fend off its paw.</p>
      <p>
        "Sigh... I've pleaded three times. Isn't three times enough patience?"
      </p>
      <p>I was a bit worried, actually.</p>
      <p>
        It would have been somewhat unfair if this damned creature had
        unexpectedly retreated in a gentlemanly manner.
      </p>
      <p>But it seems there’s no big difference this time as well.</p>
      <p>"Today is a dog-eating day, you filthy fox."</p>
      <p>I stare straight at the fox and smile brightly.</p>
      <p>Feeling the momentum of my Formless Sword, the fox flinches.</p>
      <p>Maybe, I have been waiting for this day all along.</p>
      <p>"Shall we start fox hunting..."</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        I put my colleagues into a deeper sleep with a sleeping spell and take a
        step towards the fox.
      </p>
      <p>It’s going to be a long night.</p>
      <p>Fox Hunting</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>A leaf flutters down in the wind.</p>
      <p>And I make the first move.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Qi Mountain Heaven Sky!</p>
      <p>
        My Formless Sword instantly enlarges and plunges down onto the fox's
        head.
      </p>
      <p>Our eyes meet briefly in a split second.</p>
      <p>Red intent targets me from all directions.</p>
      <p>A flurry of white claws follow the intent, rushing towards me.</p>
      <p>
        A direct hit will tear my body, now reduced to a mortal's level from Qi
        Building, to pieces.
      </p>
      <p>However,</p>
      <p>Whoosh, Whoosh, Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Holding the Formless Sword, I move with formless trajectories and
        footwork.
      </p>
      <p>Mountain Lord’s Soaring Flight!</p>
      <p>Kuang! Kuang! Kuang!</p>
      <p>
        My Formless Sword strikes down on the fox, scattering its attacks
        around.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dust cloud rises, and from its center, a hot wind blows, dispersing
        the dust.
      </p>
      <p>"This... bastard!"</p>
      <p>
        The fox, marked with sword scars, displays its fury towards me, who is
        unscathed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no reason not to avoid it when I can see all the trajectories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of responding to the fox's anger, I retract my Formless Sword
        and take the stance of the Severing Vein Saber Method.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a cultivator uses spells to dominate the space around them, turning
        the environment into 'one for themselves,'
      </p>
      <p>
        A martial artists understands the space around them and adapts
        themselves to fit the environment.
      </p>
      <p>The surrounding trees.</p>
      <p>Leaves falling from the trees.</p>
      <p>The breathing of my sleeping colleagues.</p>
      <p>Heartbeats.</p>
      <p>
        The spiritual energy, strength, heartbeat, and the sounds between the
        muscles felt from the fox.
      </p>
      <p>'Focus more.'</p>
      <p>Insects crawling on the ground.</p>
      <p>Dewdrops falling at the first clash between me and the fox.</p>
      <p>The wary breathing of the fox, the sound of my own heartbeat.</p>
      <p>
        Grasping all this information, I find the optimal path and transform my
        Formless Sword into the optimal shape.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Vein Saber Method, Mountain Wind!</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword becomes a gust of wind, shooting towards the fox's
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>An attack too fast to react to!</p>
      <p>Psiaaat!</p>
      <p>
        Leaves falling between me and the fox are all sliced by the Formless
        Sword, which then reaches the fox's chest.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an instant, the fox's consciousness compresses into a shape identical
        to itself, enveloped in white rays.
      </p>
      <p>Kuuu Guang Guang Guang!</p>
      <p>'It didn’t penetrate.”'</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword fails to pierce the fox. The Core Formation fox's
        hide indeed has significant defensive power, further enhanced by the
        fox's unique ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, unable to withstand the Formless Sword's power, the fox is pushed
        back and flies into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>
        I kick off the air and rise in front of the fox, lifting my Formless
        Sword.
      </p>
      <p>Auuuuu!</p>
      <p>The fox howls.</p>
      <p>
        Thousands of fire foxes appear around it, transforming into clones
        identical to the white fox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hundreds and thousands of these clones surround me, all rushing in at
        once.
      </p>
      <p>"Pointless."</p>
      <p>
        I don’t waste my strength and use intent and demon senses to identify
        the real body, then swing my Formless Sword at it.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship</p>
      <p>
        Layered Mountains, Mountain Echoes Valley Responds, Nine Mountains Eight
        Seas
      </p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword stretches out, entangling the real fox, hitting it
        with wave-like forms, then slices in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clones rush at me, but reading the optimal flow among numerous
        paths, I dodge them all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clones, targeting each other, eventually run out of strength and
        vanish. The fox, battered by my Formless Sword, uses another ability.
      </p>
      <p>Squeak!</p>
      <p>A flash seems to sparkle, and the scenery before me changes.</p>
      <p>
        Within a burst of white light, I hear moans and excited breaths from all
        directions, and a sensation of ecstasy begins to seep into my body.
      </p>
      <p>"An illusion?"</p>
      <p>I smirk, raising my hand to grasp the void.</p>
      <p>"How trivial."</p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>I connect to the core of the Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>I feel my heart essence.</p>
      <p>The pain of life perceived in those heart essence.</p>
      <p>The sharpness as if my whole body is buried in transparent blades.</p>
      <p>
        The pain wakes my mind, shattering the illusion before it can fully
        unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
        During that brief moment, the fox seems to have hidden itself, vanishing
        from sight.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Landscape Painting!</p>
      <p>Shaaaa!</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword extends in all directions, disturbing the
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, the fox, which has been hiding and waiting for an opportunity,
        reveals itself again, preparing to cast another spell.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Flowing Ridge!</p>
      <p>Kwang!</p>
      <p>I dash forward like a dart, smoothly stabbing at the fox.</p>
      <p>Kuaang!</p>
      <p>
        A burst of white light erupts from the fox's mouth, facing off against
        me.
      </p>
      <p>I immediately change my stance.</p>
      <p>
        The trajectory of the Formless Sword also changes as the sword move
        unfoldes.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Ascending Vein!</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>The Formless Sword rises from below, striking the fox's jaw.</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>
        The white beam explodes inside the fox's mouth, engulfing its head in a
        flash of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, it seems the fox is not significantly harmed as it wraps light
        around its three tails and swing them at me.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Echoing Valley!</p>
      <p>
        I surround myself with the flow of the Formless Sword, capturing the
        fox's attack and returning the force back to it.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>Another explosion echoes as the fox is thrown back.</p>
      <p>Kraaa!</p>
      <p>
        Enraged, the fox howls as it falls, scattering white flashes in all
        directions, and collapsing the surrounding terrain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its form of consciousness further compresses into a shape identical to
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>"Looks like you're getting a bit heated up."</p>
      <p>I smile, revealing my teeth.</p>
      <p>"Let's see who wins."</p>
      <p>
        Surrounded by hundreds and thousands of threads of intent I glare at the
        fox, and it glares back at me.
      </p>
      <p>The fox, surrounded by white light, charges at me.</p>
      <p>The speed of a Core Formation cultivator's Flying Escape Technique!</p>
      <p>
        No, combining the natural speed of the demon fox, it’s much faster and
        more ferocious than any ordinary Core Formation cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Joy of Mountains and Peaks!</p>
      <p>Thousands of crossing formless trajectories block the fox.</p>
      <p>
        The fox howls, and thousands of fire foxes fill the surroundings again.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, the trajectory of the fire foxes seem much faster and more
        complex, rushing towards me.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Bouldered Cliff!</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword envelops me, turning defense and offense into one,
        shredding the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Flowing Ridge!</p>
      <p>
        I hold the Formless Sword and cross numerous threads of intent, stabbing
        at the fox.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox, seemingly enraged, starts to wildly thrash about in an attempt
        to capture me.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a swipe of its front paw, a mountain in front crumbles, and the
        energy from its tail evaporates a river behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Mountain and Valley Transformation!
      </p>
      <p>
        I shoot the Formless Sword into the ground, warping the terrain around
        me. My will transforms the landscape, dropping the fox into a deep pit.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The fox drains its energy and conjures several white spears around it,
        shooting upwards from the pit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, 108 Lights Emerging Peak, Layered
        Mountains!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword splits into a hundred and eight parts, overlapping
        the move of Layered Mountains, creating a hundred and eight colorless
        thorny boulders inside the pit, shredding the fox's spell.
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Mountain Tiger!</p>
      <p>
        The colorless thorny rocks, formed by the Formless Sword, concentrate in
        an instant and plunge into the fox.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>An explosion echoes from the pit.</p>
      <p>
        Between the clouds of dust, a burst of white light explodes, and the fox
        struggles fiercely.
      </p>
      <p>Kraaao!</p>
      <p>The light gathers, forming the shape of a fox tens of meters large.</p>
      <p>
        The mountain-sized fox raises its head from the pit and opens its mouth
        towards me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I intuitively guess that this is the most powerful ability the fox can
        wield.
      </p>
      <p>"Is this the end?"</p>
      <p>I look at the fox with a cold face and sneer.</p>
      <p>"Compared to the monsters of Nascent Soul, this is cute."</p>
      <p>Fwoosh!</p>
      <p>The gigantic fox charges towards me.</p>
      <p>
        The energy inside it boils. If it explodes, even an ordinary Core
        Formation cultivator will not stand a chance whether it hits or misses.
      </p>
      <p>But I smile bitterly, holding my stance and facing the white light.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Ultimate Move, Severing Mountain!</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The ultimate move of Severing Mountain Swordsmanship is unleashed. The
        Formless Sword explodes and the sword moves from the first to
        twenty-first are used in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Powered by the twenty-first move, Heavenly Lake, the energy gathered
        from the previous twenty moves pour towards the fox's spell, causing an
        explosion of white and colorless light.
      </p>
      <p>When the light subsides...</p>
      <p>Shhhh...</p>
      <p>Across the distance, the fox and I lock eyes.</p>
      <p>I regain my momentum and take the stance of Transcending Peaks.</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Twenty-Third Move</p>
      <p>Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains!</p>
      <p>
        As my depleted energy returns, I am ready to unleash the ultimate strike
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox seems to recognize my momentum as its eyes are filled with
        panic.
      </p>
      <p>"Kr, kruk...!"</p>
      <p>The fox howls again.</p>
      <p>
        White flashes shoot towards me from all around, but their number and
        power are significantly less than before.
      </p>

        Lake...
      </p>
      <p>Severing Mountain!</p>
      <p>
        Once again, the ultimate move of Severing Mountain Swordsmanship is
        executed through the Formless Sword, and the fox, terrified, barely
        evades the concentrated power of Severing Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You, you bastard! How can you continuously perform such techniques..."
      </p>
      <p>
        I silently maintain Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains, gathering
        strength again.
      </p>
      <p>Thirty-eight times.</p>
      <p>
        That is the number of times I can unleash the ultimate move of Severing
        Mountain Swordsmanship through Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exceeding that will strain my body beyond endurance, leading to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, lying in bed for a day or two after using Endless Mountains
        Beyond Mountains is inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
        But considering that, I can now use an attack that rivales the fatal
        blow that the Core Formation demon fox had unleashed with all its might,
        38 times in a row.
      </p>
      <p>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</p>
      <p>Severing Mountain!</p>
      <p>Mountains split.</p>
      <p>The fox is thrown down.</p>
      <p>
        The Severing Mountain Swordsmanship executed through the Formless Sword
        has reached its true potential, living up to its name – a technique that
        cuts and splits mountains.
      </p>
      <p>"You, you bastard. Get away!"</p>
      <p>
        After enduring three Severing Mountains, the fox can no longer bear it
        and starts to retreat from me.
      </p>
      <p>Fwoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Numerous fire foxes rise in the air again, and I slash through them all
        with the Formless Sword, rushing towards the fox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amidst the explosion of white and colorless trajectories, I surpass
        numerous flows and blasts, striking the fox once more with Severing
        Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>
        A flash of light spreads out, and a hill behind the fox is split in two.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox, barely evading Severing Mountain, gasps for breath and begins
        to flee rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>
        Applying a martial arts technique I learned from Kim Young-hoon in my
        past life, I fuse the Formless Sword directly into my arm.
      </p>
      <p>In that state, I chase after the fox and grab its tail.</p>
      <p>
        Then, with the arm fused with the Formless Sword, I swing it forcefully.
      </p>
      <p>Kooowooow!</p>
      <p>The body of the house-sized fox is lifted into the air.</p>
      <p>Kwaang!!!</p>
      <p>I fling the fox far into a distant mountain.</p>
      <p>It pierces through three mountain peaks, and the fox screams.</p>
      <p>"Keeeek!"</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>
        Once again, I fuse momentarily with the Formless Sword and fly, kicking
        the fox's jaw.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shockwave alone makes the fox roll its eyes, and a web-like crack
        forms on the mountain peak behind it.
      </p>
      <p>"Shhh..."</p>
      <p>I bring my finger to my lips.</p>
      <p>"Be quiet."</p>
      <p>"Ke, kek..."</p>
      <p>
        "In front of the master of the forest, what disgrace are you showing?"
      </p>
      <p>I speak, gripping the fox's head.</p>
      <p>
        The fox looks at me trembling in fear, and I slam its head into the
        ground with the power of the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now I am the master of this forest. Shut your mouth and show respect."
      </p>
      <p>Koo kwang, koo kwang!</p>
      <p>Several times, I grab the fox's head and slam it into the ground.</p>
      <p>Each time, the earth trembles, and dust clouds rise.</p>
      <p>Despite all this, this Core Formation demon fox is still not dead.</p>
      <p>It indeed has incredible vitality.</p>
      <p>"Let's make you vomit out everything inside your belly."</p>
      <p>
        I grab the back of the fox's neck, lift it once more, and throw it into
        a valley created by the split mountain.
      </p>
      <p>Kwa kwang!</p>
      <p>
        I follow up and keep hammering the beast into the valley floor with the
        Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>"Keeeek!"</p>
      <p>"I said be quiet."</p>
      <p>Kwaak!</p>
      <p>Again, I grab its scruff.</p>
      <p>"Now, then..."</p>
      <p>"Ke, kek...save, save me..."</p>
      <p>"Let's see if fox orbs really exist."</p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>Holding the Formless Sword, I raise it high.</p>
      <p>The fox, terrified, howls.</p>
      <p>"I, eek... Are you going to kill me!"</p>
      <p>Fwoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The fox's tail begins to blaze with bright light, seemingly using a
        spell that draws upon its origin, as its aura surges once again.
        However, I calmly swing down the Formless Sword I have raised.
      </p>
      <p>Koo kwa kwang!!</p>
      <p>
        The valley shakes once more as the fox is hammered into the ground. Yet,
        I furrow my brow noticing that only a single strand of white fox fur
        remains where the fox had been, indicating it used an ability to swap
        its body at the last moment.
      </p>
      <p>It’s an unusual technique indeed.</p>
      <p>
        But it hasn't escaped far. A white light is seen flying off in the
        distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold the Formless Sword and chase after the fox that burned its tail
        as it fled.
      </p>
      <p>'Faster, even faster!'</p>
      <p>I accelerate, relentlessly pursuing the fox.</p>
      <p>Gradually, I close the distance between us.</p>
      <p>The fox, turning back with eyes filled with terror, shout,</p>
      <p>"Hi, hiieek, don't chase me! Go away, you monster!"</p>
      <p>"Who are you calling a monster?"</p>
      <p>Kuaang!</p>
      <p>
        I swing the Formless Sword, and the fox, pale with fear, narrowly dodges
        it again.
      </p>
      <p>"You human-eating fox monster"</p>
      <p>"Go away! Just go!"</p>
      <p>Koo koo koo!</p>
      <p>A small valley forms where the fox had dodged.</p>
      <p>
        The fox clenches its teeth and speeds away even faster, and I follow.
      </p>
      <p>It’s the reverse of our past life.</p>
      <p>
        Previously, the fox had chased me, but now I am the one hunting the fox.
      </p>
      <p>Koo kung, koo kung, koo koo kung!</p>
      <p>
        As I unleash the Formless Sword, several hills fly away, and the fox
        frantically dodges the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        We pass numerous mountains and rivers, covering a quarter of the
        Ascension Path in our chase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox is caught several times but manages to escape using its bizarre
        tail-burning technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, the white light burning from the fox's tail begins to
        fade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above a small lake, the fox finally stops, gasping for breath as it
        looks at me.
      </p>
      <p>
        With an expressionless face, I hold the Formless Sword and approach the
        fox.
      </p>
      <p>"St-stop! Please stop! I beg for mercy!"</p>
      <p>The fox pleads, gasping for breath.</p>
      <p>Throughout several lifetimes, this creature had torn off my arm.</p>
      <p>
        My arm throbs with pain, partly due to the effects of Endless Mountains
        Beyond Mountains, but also due to the unpleasant memories associated
        with the fox.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...Spare me. If you spare me I will recognize and obey you as the
        master of this forest. Please, spare my life."
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox grovels before me, begging for its life, and I approach and kick
        its belly.
      </p>
      <p>"Keeek!"</p>
      <p>Once again, it screams and spits out blood as it falls.</p>
      <p>Now, the fox is covered in blood.</p>
      <p>In contrast, I am unscathed, not even a single tear on my clothing.</p>
      <p>I have reached such a level where I can hunt the fox.</p>
      <p>"Spare me..."</p>
      <p>I look down at the pitifully begging fox indifferently.</p>
      <p>
        The fox has always told me that if I wanted to stay in the forest, I
        would have to offer a limb.
      </p>
      <p>"...Do you wish to live in my forest?"</p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>"Vomit out the Demon Core. Do that, and I'll spare you."</p>
      <p>"Guh..."</p>
      <p>The fox grimaces in pain.</p>
      <p>But I just look down at it impassively.</p>
      <p>
        Though I have always suffered because of this creature, I have never
        been directly killed by it.
      </p>
      <p>This is mercy.</p>
      <p>
        After writhing in agony for a while, the fox clenches its eyes shut and
        opens its mouth.
      </p>
      <p>Cough, cough!</p>
      <p>Pffft!</p>
      <p>
        The fox retches a few times, and soon, a fist-sized, brightly shining
        core emerges from its mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox's spiritual essence and power are concentrated in this Demon
        Core, the source that has kept it as a demon fox.
      </p>
      <p>I catch the Demon Core floating in the air.</p>
      <p>
        The fox's eyes, once sharp with intelligence, dull as the Demon Core
        containing its essence is removed.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, the fox's body shrinks.</p>
      <p>
        The consciousness of the Core Formation demon fox diminishes and
        retreats into its skull.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox, having vomited the Demon Core, turns back into a normal animal,
        though its body still bears three tails due to the physical
        transformation it had undergone.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment, the fox looks at me dumbly, then it glances at the Demon
        Core in my hand with a covetous gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as I frown, it whimpers like a neighborhood puppy and scampers
        off into the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The monstrous fox that had torn off my arm in ten lifetimes is no more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only a small, peculiar fox with three tails remains, lost and fleeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I watch the small fox running away for a moment, then I hold the Demon
        Core and return to where my companions are.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, another fate is overcome.</p>
      <p>
        I smile lightly and head towards my companions, floating through the
        air.
      </p>
      <p>"Ha, haha...hahahaha...!"</p>
      <p>
        After ten lifetimes, I have finally gained the strength early in life to
        defeat the fox that had threatened me!
      </p>
      <p>
        I laugh until tears form, looking at my companions, still deeply asleep
        under my sleep spell.
      </p>
      <p>'Maybe now, I can take my companions outside Ascension Path.'</p>
      <p>
        If we can leave without being detected by the Heavenly Being
        cultivators, perhaps...
      </p>
      <p>'Maybe we can all live this life together.'</p>
      <p>I smile, massaging my body.</p>
      <p>
        Using Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains in my current state, where I
        can only use 70% of my consciousness, is enough to defeat the fox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I resolve the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner and can use all my
        consciousness, I might be able to defeat the fox without resorting to
        Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If only I can quickly recover my cultivation, I can increase the output
        of Gang QI and easily defeat the fox...'
      </p>
      <p>
        I have spent over two hundred years with Gang Qi coursing through my
        veins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this body, with only blood flowing through its veins, feels
        awkward.
      </p>
      <p>
        'First, I need to recover my body, slowly regain my cultivation, and
        find out how to absorb the power contained in the Demon Core...'
      </p>
      <p>
        I decide to first use spiritual herbs to soothe my body, aching from
        using Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains, and turn my attention away
        from my companions.
      </p>
      <p>Just as I turn to look for herbs...</p>
      <p>Fwoosh!</p>
      <p>A rough, wrinkled hand grabs my head.</p>
      <p>
        [No matter how I look at it, this is so fascinating I could die. What in
        the world is this?]
      </p>
      <p>
        A hunchback old man with eyes full of madness, grabs my head while
        lifting the corners of his mouth in a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Translator Notes: This is going to be the longest and most tumutluous
        cycle yet. Prepare yourself.

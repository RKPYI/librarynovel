      <p>Chapter 17: 4th Cycle's First Day</p>
      <p>Ah.</p>
      <p>I opened my eyes.</p>
      <p>A familiar feeling.</p>
      <p>"Another regression, it seems."</p>
      <p>I recalled the last moments of my past life.</p>
      <p>Resisting until the very end...</p>
      <p>"Finally, I have ascended."</p>
      <p>Yes, I'm fully conscious now.</p>
      <p>In that last moment, I certainly...</p>
      <p>"I reached the peak!"</p>
      <p>
        Overwhelmed with excitement, I looked up at the sky, oblivious to my
        surroundings, and shouted.
      </p>
      <p>"Finally! At last!!!"</p>
      <p>I had reached the long-coveted peak!!!</p>
      <p>Buzz!</p>
      <p>A familiar sound echoes.</p>
      <p>Jeon Myeong-hoon, a face I haven't seen in a while, is there.</p>
      <p>
        But I didn't even glance in his direction, just closed my eyes again.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>Jeon Myeong-hoon's hand cuts through the air towards me.</p>
      <p>
        Feeling his movement, I awakened 'that sensation' I had reached just
        before dying.
      </p>
      <p>'I can see it!'</p>
      <p>Even with my eyes closed, it's vivid.</p>
      <p>A red trajectory was aimed at my cheek.</p>
      <p>
        With my eyes still shut, I dodged Jeon Myeong-hoon's slap with the
        optimum movement.
      </p>

            window.pubfuturetag.push({

              id: "pf-6108-1",
            });

      <!--/sse-->
      <p>"This guy dodged it?"</p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Jeon Myeong-hoon swung his hand several more times, but I, still with
        closed eyes, dodged every one of his strikes with minimal movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I can see it. Jeon Myeong-hoon's next move. The direction of his hand.
        It's cearly visible.'
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, I could dodge someone like Jeon Myeong-hoon without even
        looking, but that was all based on decades of martial arts training and
        'predicting' where he'll strike.
      </p>
      <p>But now, it's different.</p>
      <p>The red threadlines reveal his path.</p>
      <p>
        Whether my eyes are open or closed, these threadlines are vividly
        present.
      </p>
      <p>This is not 'prediction,' but more like 'premonition.'</p>
      <p>'Is this the [vision] of a peak master?'</p>
      <p>
        I finally understood why a first-raate master, even when outnumbering
        the enemy, could never defeat a peak master.
      </p>
      <p>
        'It's visible. The direction and trajectory of attacks by inferior
        first-rate warriors are clearly visible. How could they win if their
        attacks can't even touch a peak master?'
      </p>
      <p>
        To confront a peak master, a first-rate warrior would need to attack
        with dozens of people in a swarm strategy.
      </p>
      <p>'Setting aside the direction and trajectory of the attack.'</p>
      <p>
        I set my determination and faced Jeon Myeong-hoon, who was rushing
        towards me.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the red lines indicating his trajectory disappeared,
        and my vision was filled with blue lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Face, shoulders, chest, arms, flanks, stomach, lower abdomen, pelvis,
        legs, knees, feet.
      </p>
      <p>Blue lines densely targeted dozens of spots.</p>
      <p>Instinctively, I knew.</p>
      <p>
        These blue lines indicate the opponent's vulnerabilities and the optimal
        path for my attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gap in combat skills between me and Jeon Myeong-hoon must be so vast
        that so many vulnerabilities are exposed.
      </p>
      <p>'So that's it. The red and blue back then.'</p>
      <p>
        <em
          >"Ah, a master of Three Flowers. The first I've seen in this city
          besides myself."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >"Three Flowers aren't common. Most live their lives only in red and
          blue. I, too, haven't met a master like you in a long time."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A conversation between Kim Young-hoon and Pal Jik-tae, supreme elder of
        the Qia River sect, during my second regression.
      </p>
      <p>Pal Jik-tae indeed mentioned 'red and blue' back then.</p>
      <p>At the time, I didn't understand a word, but now I do.</p>
      <p>'He was talking about this 'vision' that peak masters see.'</p>
      <p>The red line to read the opponent's attack.</p>
      <p>The blue line for the optimal attack.</p>
      <p>
        This dual-colored world, where one can exchange gaps, was the world of
        peak masters, the 'red and blue' world he mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>When I reached this conclusion.</p>
      <p>Dripâ€•</p>
      <p>'What?'</p>
      <p>I suddenly felt a nosebleed.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I felt 'pain.'</p>
      <p>It hurts!</p>
      <p>As if my brain is burning!</p>
      <p>'Damn, does using this [vision] overload the brain?'</p>
      <p>
        I quickly sealed the acupoints of Jeon Myeong-hoon, who was rushing at
        me, quickly deactivated [vision], and put him to sleep with
        sleep-inducing herbs.
      </p>
      <p>There was pain the moment I activated [vision], but I ignored it.</p>
      <p>
        However, as the usage time extended, the pain intensified, eventually
        feeling like my brain was burning.
      </p>
      <p>
        'The time I used [vision] in the scuffle with Jeon Myeong-hoon was mere
        moments, and yet the pain is this intense...'
      </p>
      <p>What's the problem?</p>
      <p>
        After pondering for a while, I calmed my still-confused colleagues, took
        them to a cave, lit a fire, cooked fruits and grilled mushrooms, and put
        them to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the sun set and all my colleagues were asleep, I sat outside the
        cave and organized my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's sort out what 'Pinnacle Realm' is all about."</p>
      <p>
        The Pinnacle Realm essentially overloads the brain to visualize and read
        the opponent's path of combat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even for a blind person, if they can read the opponent's path, two
        colors vividly appear in their mind, as if experiencing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's more than visualization; it's like my brain arbitrarily colors the
        paths I foresee in blue and red.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Using this vision, I can read every movement of my opponent and target
        their vulnerabilities with the optimal path."
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why, in my past life, Kim Young-hoon's constant application of
        maximized senses to me seemed like an 'imitation of the Pinnacle Realm.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I indirectly calculated the opponent's path by maximizing the senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        But due to my lack of talent, I only awakened to this Pinnacle Realm at
        the very end, despite having imitated it.
      </p>
      <p>"Amazing."</p>
      <p>
        Once again, I looked at the world through the vision of the Pinnacle
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>Watching the leaves fall at night, I envisioned the blue lines.</p>
      <p>
        Hundreds, thousands of blue threads appeared, directed at the leaves.
      </p>
      <p>I grabbed a nearby branch and swung it towards the leaves.</p>
      <p>The branch was blunt, not even shaped like a sword.</p>
      <p>
        Even the leaves, fresh and fluttering in the night breeze, were not easy
        targets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, the moment I struck the leaves with the branch, following the
        optimal path the blue lines showed, they were sliced.
      </p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>
        The leaves were cut cleanly in half by the blunt branch, not imbued with
        any internal energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the first day of my regression in my previous life, I had briefly
        reached this state.
      </p>
      <p>I was unconscious then, but now my consciousness is clear.</p>
      <p>
        I stood up, holding the branch, and danced with it as if it were a
        sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I danced amidst the fluttering leaves, they all were cut by the
        branch.
      </p>
      <p>Swish, swish!</p>
      <p>Countless sword strokes pierced the leaves.</p>
      <p>Thousands of optimal paths extended before my eyes.</p>
      <p>
        I closed my eyes, imagining the fluttering leaves as first-rate masters.
      </p>
      <p>
        With no internal energy and only a slightly thick branch in hand, could
        I defeat so many first-rate masters?
      </p>
      <p>"I can win!"</p>
      <p>First-rate masters, each armed with their weapons, charged at me.</p>
      <p>
        Spears, swords, hidden weapons, maces, polearms, fists, lances,
        broadswords, and countless other weapons assaulted me.
      </p>
      <p>But I wasn't afraid.</p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Continuously dancing with my sword, I dodged the first-rate masters'
        weapons and linked the optimal sword paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        With my single sword stroke, their techniques were dismantled, their
        balance destroyed, and all were defeated.
      </p>
      <p>"Haa..."</p>
      <p>When I opened my eyes, there were numerous split leaves around me.</p>
      <p>Drip...</p>
      <p>
        Despite the nosebleed and the burning sensation in my brain from using
        the vision, I felt exhilarated.
      </p>
      <p>"I am now a peak master!"</p>
      <p>
        I stopped the nosebleed with a medicinal herb, then wandered around
        digging up centuries-old yellow bamboo roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Perhaps the inability to maintain the vision for long is due to the
        lack of internal energy."
      </p>
      <p>
        A certain level of internal energy is necessary to endure and extend the
        duration of the vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        After digging up the roots, I chewed and swallowed them right there,
        leaving only a few for Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I had ascended to a peak master, there was no need to sell
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yellow bamboo roots... I'll leave just a couple for Kim Young-hoon and
        consume the rest."
      </p>
      <p>
        There were about ten roots around my vicinity in Ascension Path, and
        probably more if I expanded my search, but it wasn't necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consumed eight yellow bamboo roots, excluding the two for Kim
        Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>Gurgling...</p>
      <p>
        Guided by the Dragon Vein Qi Method, the immense spiritual power of the
        yellow bamboo roots surged through my meridians.
      </p>
      <p>Whew...</p>
      <p>An immense reserve of internal energy accumulated in an instant.</p>
      <p>
        I had more internal energy now than in my previous life, where I had
        practiced for 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>"Shall I try again?"</p>
      <p>
        Aided massive internal energy, I activated the peak master's vision
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I practiced with the vision for about an hour with no significant
        issues.
      </p>
      <p>The burning discomfort started after about a meal's time.</p>
      <p>"That's my limit, about an hour and a half."</p>
      <p>
        No matter how much internal power I had, it only delayed the onset of
        pain; it didn't eliminate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The only way is to repeatedly train using the peak master's vision."
      </p>
      <p>
        To reduce the burning pain and gradually acclimate my brain to the
        vision.
      </p>
      <p>"Endless training is the answer."</p>
      <p>
        I might not be a genius, but this is the best way for someone not born
        with talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This life's goal is to first overcome the burning pain when using the
        peak master's vision and ultimately...
      </p>
      <p>"Three Flowers Gather at the Summit...!"</p>
      <p>
        To reach the Three Flowers Gather at the Summit, also known as the
        pinnacle of pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I won't aim for the Five Energies Converging to the Origin realm in
        this life. The Three Flowers Gather at the Summit is already challenging
        enough."
      </p>
      <p>The realm of Three Flowers was somewhat graspable.</p>
      <p>As the supreme elder of Qia River Sect said, "The third."</p>
      <p>Red symbolizes the enemy's intent; blue, my intent.</p>
      <p>
        Besides these, there is a 'third' color, the line that separates the
        Three Flowers Gather at the Summit from the rest of the Pinnacle Realm.
      </p>
      <p>The third.</p>
      <p>"Though I can't quite grasp what it is."</p>
      <p>
        The leap from first-rate to peak felt insurmountable, but reaching the
        Three Flowers Gather at the Summit from the peak seems slightly easier.
      </p>
      <p>Smiling, I looked at Kim Young-hoon, sleeping in the cave.</p>
      <p>"Surely, I'll be able to learn much more from him now."</p>
      <p>
        Having reached the peak, the level of teaching I could receive from Kim
        Young-hoon would be incomparable to when I was just a first-rate master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, I possessed the six volumes of insights and the final formula
        left by the previous Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        This life's Kim Young-hoon will certainly surpass the one from before!
      </p>
      <p>
        "I, too, in this life, will achieve the Three Flowers Gather at the
        Summit and get closer to being a true cultivator!"
      </p>
      <p>
        With that resolution, I peacefully watched the rising morning sun in
        front of the cave.
      </p>

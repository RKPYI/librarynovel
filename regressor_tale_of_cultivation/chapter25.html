      <p>Chapter 25: 5th Cycle's First Day</p>
      <p>As I opened my eyes, a familiar scent filled the air.</p>
      <p>It was the forest Ascension Path.</p>
      <p>'I've returned again.'</p>
      <p>
        First, I swiftly pressed the sleep acupoint on Jeon Myeong-hoon, who was
        trying to say something to me, making him fall deeply asleep at an
        invisible speed.
      </p>
      <p>'I'm not sure if I succeeded in cutting down the Crown Prince.'</p>
      <p>It seemed like my body had moved, but I wasn't certain.</p>
      <p>'Did I manage to be of any help...'</p>
      <p>I hadn't known cultivators had such things.</p>
      <p>
        Naturally, thinking I had reached a new realm, I was too complacent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as martial artists often hide 30% of their true power and keep
        life-saving herbs a secret, it would make sense for cultivators to have
        something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Given he didn’t use it until the very end, it seemed more like an
        external object rather than his own power. Probably a type of magical
        device.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Next time, when confronting a cultivator, I'll need to check for such
        life-saving devices first.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gathered my thoughts, feeling the vitality coursing through my young
        body.
      </p>
      <p>The regression was evident.</p>
      <p>'In my last life... I reached Three Flowers Gather at the Summit.'</p>
      <p>It was an achievement I had always dreamed of.</p>
      <p>
        It was also the goal I desperately wanted to achieve in my previous
        life.
      </p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>'I died too soon.'</p>
      <p>In all my past lives, I had died according to my natural lifespan.</p>
      <p>
        Living for about 50 years each time, steadily achieving and advancing.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in the 4th cycle, I died before my time for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>'It's a pity.'</p>
      <p>
        Had I lived a few decades more and further refined my enlightenment, I
        might have even reached Five Energies Converging to the Origin
      </p>
      <p>'...It's over. No use dwelling on it.'</p>
      <p>I sighed softly, shaking my head.</p>
      <p>It was all in the past now.</p>
      <p>
        Being granted another life was a miracle, and I silently expressed
        gratitude for this new life.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Uh, look at this Deputy Manager Seo. Section Chief Jeon doesn’t wake up
        no matter how hard we shake him. And where are we now..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon and Chief Oh Hyun-seok were holding the pale Jeon
        Myeong-hoon, and worried.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Um, I've studied oriental medicine before, so let me take his pulse."
      </p>
      <p>"Really? I'll trust you then!"</p>
      <p>
        Pretending to take Jeon Myeong-hoon's pulse, I pressed his acupoint
        again to wake him up.
      </p>
      <p>"Uh...? Where is this..."</p>
      <p>
        Before he could fully regain consciousness, I pressed his sleep
        acupoint, putting him back to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Um, seeing that he just woke up, it seems he was just sleeping. He must
        have been accumulating fatigue."
      </p>
      <p>"That's a relief then."</p>
      <p>
        "But shouldn’t we wake him up? He doesn’t even know what's going on..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ignoring the discussion between Kim Young-hoon and Oh Hyun-seok about
        whether to wake Jeon Myeong-hoon, I pointed to a large tree nearby.
      </p>
      <p>"I'll climb up that tree to see if there's anything around."</p>
      <p>"Huh?"</p>
      <p>
        Without waiting for their response, I approached the tree and executed
        the martial arts I had realized in my last life.
      </p>
      <p>Mountain Lord Martial Art and Transcending Peaks Step’s True Form.</p>
      <p>Mountain Lord’s Soaring Flight.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Just like a tiger leaping over a great mountain, I swiftly climbed up
        the tree branches and came back down.
      </p>
      <p>"Wow... Deputy Manager Seo. That's amazing."</p>
      <p>"When did you learn that?"</p>
      <p>"Ha ha..."</p>
      <p>
        I casually explained that there was nothing around and persuaded
        everyone to go to the cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, after making a windbreak and preparing a campfire in the cave, I
        continued to consolidate the realization of Three Flowers Gather at the
        Summit.
      </p>
      <p>'Constantly connecting with the opponent.'</p>
      <p>
        When I first entered Three Flowers, it was only a connection with the
        opponent I was fighting. However, the more I became accustomed to it, it
        seemed possible to connect not only with enemies but also with nearby
        allies and structures.
      </p>
      <p>'If this ability is maximized...'</p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I could read the myriad intents flowing through the world,
        connecting not only with living beings but also with the world itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        'That would probably be the realm of Five Energies Converging to the
        Origin.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I smiled lightly as I made an educated guess about the realm of Five
        Energies.
      </p>
      <p>I burst into laughter.</p>
      <p>"Ha ha, ha ha ha!"</p>
      <p>
        Oh Hyun-seok, who was gathering branches for the campfire, looked at me
        curiously.
      </p>
      <p>"Why are you laughing?"</p>
      <p>"Oh, nothing. Just remembered something funny."</p>
      <p>
        I had always thought that reaching the peak of Three Flowers was the
        ultimate end.
      </p>
      <p>But Three Flowers was not the end.</p>
      <p>
        Rather, it was just the beginning of the journey towards Five Energies.
      </p>
      <p>I guess it's the same with Five Energies Converging to the Origin.</p>
      <p>The end is just the start to a new beginning.</p>
      <p>I am still so weak.</p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>'Someday, I will definitely reach there.'</p>
      <p>The beginning to reach the end.</p>
      <p>Naturally, my goal in this life is Five Energies!</p>
      <p>Now, only one step is left to become a cultivator.</p>
      <p>Soon it was night.</p>
      <p>All my colleagues at the company had fallen asleep,</p>
      <p>
        Jeon Myeong-hoon, who had been sleeping all day, tried to wake up, but I
        knocked him out again by hitting the back of his neck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving my colleagues behind, I went outside the cave, dug up yellow
        bamboo roots, and channeled internal power.
      </p>
      <p>Then I chose a suitable branch and carved it into a wooden sword.</p>
      <p>Woo-woong-</p>
      <p>
        When I infused energy and intent into it, a white Sword Gang formed on
        the wooden sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        It certainly wasn't the sturdy body I had trained for a lifetime in my
        past life.
      </p>
      <p>However, no longer did my grip ache even when holding a sword.</p>
      <p>'Good, a new life.'</p>
      <p>
        Right after death, which always strikes at the last moment, the life
        that follows feels so grateful.
      </p>
      <p>I closed my eyes for a moment and contemplated my body.</p>
      <p>
        After looking at the Sword Gang, I sniffed the scent carried by the
        wind.
      </p>
      <p>'It's over there.'</p>
      <p>Tadat!</p>
      <p>
        Using Mountain Lord’s Soaring Flight, I climbed onto a tree and ran
        towards the direction of the scent, jumping across trees.
      </p>
      <p>Shu-shush!</p>
      <p>
        Every time I stepped, it seemed like trees passed by me in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>This unforgettable scent.</p>
      <p>In a giant rural area far away.</p>
      <p>There.</p>
      <p>There was a fox.</p>
      <p>Zzzt, Zzzt!</p>
      <p>
        As soon as I visually confirmed the fox's territory, tension swirled
        throughout my body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox's domain was over 30 zhang (100m) in radius, centered around the
        fox.
      </p>
      <p>'Core Formation...!'</p>
      <p>
        Now, I could roughly gauge the level of the opponent by the size of
        their domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my last life, I once glimpsed at the Core Formation cultivator of the
        Jin Clan, and his domain was about that size.
      </p>
      <p>Woo-woong-</p>
      <p>
        Maintaining the vision of a peak master, I observed the fox's territory,
        shimmering in purple.
      </p>
      <p>Then, as if the fox sensed something strange, it opened its eyes.</p>
      <p>Shuk!</p>
      <p>
        I quickly refined my intent to cut off the fox's perception, erasing my
        presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox looked around for a while but, not finding anything unusual,
        closed its eyes and fell asleep again.
      </p>
      <p>'It's a good thing I was far outside its domain.'</p>
      <p>
        If I had been inside the fox's domain, it would have been impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the consciousness of a lower level practitioner at Qi Refining,
        the consciousness of a Core Formation being was much denser and richer.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was doubtful whether I could even find an intent in that gap to
        secretly cut.
      </p>
      <p>'...As expected, I can't face the fox with my current level.'</p>
      <p>The difference in level was absurd.</p>
      <p>
        'Not mentioning killing the fox, but even to escape, I need to reach
        Five Energies.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, it would be presumptuous to even try to penetrate those
        dense layers of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>'...First, I need to practice the state of Three Flowers a bit.'</p>
      <p>
        As I focused on the giant purple area before me, the purple area began
        to turn red, distinguishing my consciousness from the fox's.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the state of Three Flowers, intent could simply appear purple, but
        like this, I could also perceive the other’s consciousness by dividing
        into red and blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        After integrating and separating the purple, blue, and red intents for a
        while, I slowly descended to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>And took a step towards where the fox was.</p>
      <p>Shuk!</p>
      <p>
        With each step, I simultaneously cut through the fox's consciousness
        again.
      </p>
      <p>Another step.</p>
      <p>One more.</p>
      <p>
        Gradually approaching the fox's domain, I continuously sharpened my
        intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I can't enter inside of the domain. But... it's possible to get as
        close as I can!'
      </p>
      <p>How close can I get to the fox?</p>
      <p>
        Consciousness seemed to dominate space based on some sort of boundary,
        but in fact, that boundary was not clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though it looked like there were boundaries when viewed with the
        vision of a peak master, in reality, a faint consciousness was
        constantly flowing beyond that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was approaching the fox by cutting through that faint consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>'How capable am I?'</p>
      <p>How far can I reach?</p>
      <p>Where am I now!</p>
      <p>
        This was an opportunity to test myself and at the same time, to
        understand and train in the Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts.
      </p>
      <p>Boo-woong! Boo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        My wooden sword split the air, barely cutting through the faint
        consciousness of the fox.
      </p>
      <p>With each step, sweat dripped from my entire body.</p>
      <p>
        With each division of countless consciousnesses, my heart pounded with
        tension.
      </p>
      <p>'No, I can do more.'</p>
      <p>I took another step.</p>
      <p>Only thirty steps left to the fox's domain.</p>
      <p>When I took another step, cutting through the consciousness,</p>
      <p>Woo-woong-</p>
      <p>The fox's consciousness intensified.</p>
      <p>It had sensed something was off.</p>
      <p>
        I quickly cut through the consciousness and stepped into the fox's
        blindspot.
      </p>
      <p>'It's far...'</p>
      <p>
        If I were Kim Young-hoon from my past life, I could have easily passed
        this distance and entered the fox's domain.
      </p>
      <p>But this was my limit.</p>
      <p>
        Twenty-nine steps to the proper inner area of the consciousness domain.
        That was my current level.
      </p>
      <p>'No, it's not.'</p>
      <p>I gritted my teeth.</p>
      <p>'I can go further.'</p>
      <p>With all my concentration, I saw even more consciousnesses.</p>
      <p>Sweating, I swung my sword again.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>The consciousness was cut again by the intent on my sword.</p>
      <p>'Is this my limit?'</p>
      <p>Then what am I supposed to do?</p>
      <p>My original limit was much lower.</p>
      <p>
        Far from getting close to the fox, I was always waiting in the cave to
        be torn apart.
      </p>
      <p>I've constantly overcome my limits to reach this point.</p>
      <p>This time, too, I will overcome my limit.</p>
      <p>'Squeeze out your brain!'</p>
      <p>Until the brain busts into flames!</p>
      <p>
        It's comfortable now that I'm used to the peak state, but when I first
        reached the peak state, I had to constantly endure my brain burning!
      </p>
      <p>It felt like my brain was on fire.</p>
      <p>More details of the consciousness became visible.</p>
      <p>I took another step.</p>
      <p>
        The distance till the inner area of the fox's domain was gradually
        closing.
      </p>
      <p>Twenty-seven steps.</p>
      <p>Twenty-five steps.</p>
      <p>Twenty-two steps.</p>
      <p>Twenty steps.</p>
      <p>Fifteen steps.</p>
      <p>And...</p>
      <p>'Ten steps!'</p>
      <p>
        Maybe because I overloaded my brain too much, my brain was screaming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tension exceeding the limit had my muscles and body tightly
        contracted.
      </p>
      <p>'One more step, and I'll really be caught.'</p>
      <p>
        The next step was where the color of the fox's consciousness faintly
        leaked out.
      </p>
      <p>If I go one step further, I might be caught by the fox.</p>
      <p>'...Well, what does it matter?'</p>
      <p>Though sweat poured down my entire body, I smirked.</p>
      <p>'If I can take one more step, I don't mind dying.'</p>
      <p>My body screamed madly.</p>
      <p>It felt like smoke would come out of my brain.</p>
      <p>'If you want to live, squeeze out more!'</p>
      <p>I'm a dunce.</p>
      <p>
        So, when the opportunity comes, if I don't squeeze out all my ability, I
        can't move forward.
      </p>
      <p>I can't move forward without dying!</p>
      <p>Blood rushed to my brain.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I was able to move half a step further.</p>
      <p>Half a step.</p>
      <p>
        Originally, I tried to take one more step, but my body instinctively
        prevented me from going any further.
      </p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>'I've crossed the limit.'</p>
      <p>I wasn't caught.</p>
      <p>
        The fox was still asleep, and my body had gone far beyond what I thought
        was my limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        I smirked and quietly killed my presence, cutting through consciousness
        and stepping back.
      </p>
      <p>'This was the end for this life.'</p>
      <p>In the next life, I might be able to go a little deeper.</p>
      <p>
        Having completely escaped the influence of the fox's consciousness, I
        thought as I ran back to the cave.
      </p>
      <p>'Next time, even more...'</p>
      <p>I'll go deeper!</p>
      <p>Drip...</p>
      <p>As I arrived at the cave, blood flowed from my nose.</p>
      <p>It seemed to be due to overloading my brain.</p>
      <p>
        But even with the feeling of collapsing from exhaustion, I smiled,
        showing my teeth.
      </p>
      <p>"Ha ha, hahahaha!"</p>
      <p>This life.</p>
      <p>The first day I woke up!</p>
      <p>I had succeeded in overcoming another limit.</p>
      <p>
        I will continue to surpass my limits and surely reach the next realm!
      </p>
      <p>The fifth regression.</p>
      <p>Five Energies Converging to the Origin seemed to be in sight.</p>

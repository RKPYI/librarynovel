      <p>Chapter 54: Heavenly Thunder (1)</p>
      <p>Crackling, thundering...</p>
      <p>
        From the dark clouds in the sky, a blue light flashed, followed by the
        sound of thunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somehow, if the sky also had consciousness, I thought its color would be
        fiery red.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems as if the sky, angered, was challenging me who forcefully
        dispersed the clouds.
      </p>
      <p>"Strike me if you can."</p>
      <p>I squeezed out Gang Qi and levitated it above my hand again.</p>
      <p>
        Dozens, hundreds, thousands of Sword Gangs gathered above my hand,
        forming a Sword Gang Sphere.
      </p>
      <p>With a burst of light, another star appeared above my hand.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the sky did not strike me with heavenly lightning.</p>
      <p>
        It just rumbled, as if deciding to observe for a while, dispersing the
        clouds.
      </p>
      <p>'Could I block the lightning now...?'</p>
      <p>
        I smiled wryly at the thought, but it seemed impossible to stop
        lightning with a Gang Sphere.
      </p>
      <p>How could I block a force that strikes at the speed of light?</p>
      <p>
        The power contained in the Gang Sphere is sufficient, but the speed is
        lacking to block it.
      </p>
      <p>'Well, anyway, I'll think about that later...'</p>
      <p>I gazed at the Gang Sphere I had formed in front of me.</p>
      <p>
        In the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts, many parts
        that I didn't understand before now made sense.
      </p>
      <p>'The trials and errors of Kim Hyung...'</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to him pioneering the realm ahead, I could avoid groping in the
        dark with trial and error.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the Gang Sphere is not just a bomb to be thrown and
        explode.
      </p>
      <p>Hmmmm~</p>
      <p>
        I sat cross-legged on the altar, closing my eyes and floating the Gang
        Sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Gang Sphere seems powerful, it is just a brute mass of
        energy.
      </p>
      <p>That meant...</p>
      <p>With a deep breath...</p>
      <p>I could inhale it into my body.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, it was just reabsorbing my internal energy, so there would be
        no increase in cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>However...</p>
      <p>
        'The pressure and suction that formed in the dantian. Now I understand
        why that suction occurred.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a sign that I was approaching the Ultimate Pinnacle beyond the
        Five Energies Converging to the Origin.
      </p>
      <p>The Gang Sphere entered my body, settling in the dantian.</p>
      <p>
        I infused intent into it, so much so that I felt like I was condensing
        myself into a small bead.
      </p>
      <p>The dantian is the field of the mind, right?</p>
      <p>
        I condensed myself into the field of the mind, so it would be strange if
        there were no changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gang Sphere in the dantian settled naturally at the center of
        pressure and suction.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took root and I felt the pressure and suction increase many times
        over.
      </p>
      <p>'This is...!'</p>
      <p>
        Until now, my dantian was a mix of cultivated spiritual power and
        martial arts internal energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as the Gang Sphere exerted suction, the mixed internal energy was
        all drawn into the Gang Sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the internal energy flowing through my meridians, along
        with spiritual power, separated and was drawn into the center of the
        Gang Sphere in the dantian.
      </p>
      <p>'Ah...'</p>
      <p>I felt it.</p>
      <p>
        The internal energy could enter the Gang Sphere as much as my
        consciousness allowed!
      </p>
      <p>
        It felt like the limit of internal energy in my dantian has expanded
        enormously.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Gang Sphere in the dantian, the more I infused energy, the more
        it compressed endlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        'No, the Gang Sphere in the dantian can no longer be called just a Gang
        Sphere.'
      </p>
      <p>
        It has become something different, mingled with the nature of the
        dantian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes... Instead of a Gang Sphere, it would be better to call it an Inner
        Core.
      </p>
      <p>As the Inner Core formed, I realized something.</p>
      <p>'Ah, that's it.'</p>
      <p>
        Before, I felt apprehensive about the internal energy of the Dragon Vein
        Qi Method flowing through the spiritual meridians.
      </p>
      <p>I didn't know why I felt that way then.</p>
      <p>But now, I understand.</p>
      <p>Humming!</p>
      <p>
        As I practiced the Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation, I felt the
        spiritual energy entering much faster than before.
      </p>
      <p>The manipulation of spiritual power became much easier.</p>
      <p>
        It was like living in a smoggy city and then coming to the countryside
        with clean air and breathing freely.
      </p>
      <p>
        'So far, the cultivation method was hindered because the internal energy
        in the meridians was mixed with spiritual power.'
      </p>
      <p>In a previous life.</p>
      <p>
        There was a time when I thought Kim Young-hoon had a slightly better
        aptitude for cultivation than me.
      </p>
      <p>
        He reached the 2nd Star of Qi Refining faster than me, without a good
        teacher or much time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But thinking about it now, it wasn't that he had slightly better
        aptitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        He just didn't have a mixed energy like me but stored his internal
        energy well in the Inner Core, preventing the internal energy from
        mixing turbulently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inhaling the heaven and earth spiritual energy, I practiced my
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>It was much faster than before.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I utilized the Hidden Consciousness Technique.</p>
      <p>A technique that compresses consciousness to speed up cultivation!</p>
      <p>
        With the efficiency of the Hidden Consciousness Technique, it felt
        vastly superior compared to before.
      </p>
      <p>
        'At this rate... isn't this efficiency comparable to that of a True
        Spiritual Root instead of a Mixed Spiritual Root?'
      </p>
      <p>I was astonished by the tremendous efficiency of my cultivation.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, whether it is a True Spiritual Root or a Mixed Spiritual
        Root, both are still considered inferior spiritual roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for me, who has a Mixed Spiritual Root, such an increase in
        cultivation efficiency was incredibly significant.
      </p>
      <p>
        After checking the speed of my cultivation, I started to explore other
        effects of the Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Internal energy burst forth from the Inner Core.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, the Inner Core became a central axis, forming a central
        origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike before, when I layered Gang Qi in the void to form a Gang Sphere,
        it was now possible to create a Gang Sphere directly within the Inner
        Core!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gang Sphere emitted light from my palm, scattering its radiance.
      </p>
      <p>The technique that Kim Young-hoon had shown before.</p>
      <p>
        If it weren't for the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts
        he left, I too would have struggled to transform the Gang Sphere into
        the Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I'm fortunate I could create the Inner Core immediately after resolving
        the trial and error.'
      </p>
      <p>I clenched my fist again, absorbing the Gang Sphere.</p>
      <p>Then I stood up and flexed my feet.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>In an instant, I closed a distance of five meters.</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the Inner Core providing a central origin, my internal energy
        efficiency has overwhelmingly improved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strengthening of my body through internal energy reached extreme
        levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        My reaction speed, strength, and stamina have become incomparably
        stronger.
      </p>
      <p>"Haap!"</p>
      <p>I drew internal energy from my Inner Core and threw a punch.</p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>
        The internal energy, which previously could only weakly cover my sword,
        now displayed tremendous power when released from the Inner Core,
        shattering a boulder one meter in diameter.
      </p>
      <p>
        'There is no waste in my internal energy use. My control over internal
        energy is now perfectly refined.'
      </p>
      <p>Using the same techniques would now yield much stronger effects.</p>
      <p>
        I practiced various techniques several times while familiarizing myself
        with the Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, I pondered the difference between the Golden Core formed
        by Core Formation cultivators and the Inner Core I created.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Does the Golden Core formed by Core Formation cultivators have the same
        effect as my Inner Core?'
      </p>
      <p>
        After some thought, I concluded that they were entirely different,
        despite any superficial similarities.
      </p>
      <p>
        'After all, the martial arts of the martial world are just degenerated
        versions of cultivation methods. Even if they look similar, they are
        never the same. When a Core Formation cultivator forms a Golden Core,
        their power can shatter mountains and split seas.'
      </p>
      <p>
        While a Qi Building cultivator like Makli Wangshin could destroy one or
        two pavilions with a whirlwind,
      </p>
      <p>
        A Core Formation cultivator with the same spell could lift and
        obliterate the entire palace with a whirlwind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps a Core Formation cultivator could level an entire imperial city
        in the time it takes to count from one to ten with their eyes closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In comparison, my Inner Core only improved the efficiency of martial
        arts and sped up the use of Gang Sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        After experiencing the abilities of the Inner Core several more times, I
        checked the effects of completing the Seven Stars Ritual of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the sky, I felt as if I could understand what celestial
        energy is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accepting the heaven and earth spiritual essence, it seems I could
        interpret the will of the heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, as a Qi Refining cultivator, I couldn't understand much, but
        looking at the sky, I clearly knew how much life I have left.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also had an intuition to guess the weather for the next day by looking
        at the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        'My lifespan is always the same, so it's useless for me... and the
        weather can be calculated using the methods taught by my master.'
      </p>
      <p>
        As my realm advances, my ability to read celestial energy will grow
        stronger. I felt that in the future, I will be able to vaguely glimpse
        fortunes and destinies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt confident that I could quickly master both the Six Harmonies (8th
        Star) and the Five Elements (9th Star) of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>
        This confidence stemmed from my past life, when after getting stuck at
        the Seven Stars Ritual, I continuously previewed the realms beyond,
        almost fully grasping their meanings.
      </p>
      <p>"Sigh..."</p>
      <p>
        Settling down, I began practicing the 8th Star of the Earth Surpassing
        Path Method. The influx of heaven and earth spiritual energy was
        incomparably faster than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The internal energy that had been hindering my spiritual power usage
        were all absorbed into my Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the Hidden Consciousness Technique also in effect, my cultivation
        speed accelerated to the level of a True Spiritual Root cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>A year passed.</p>
      <p>
        With the addition of the dense spiritual energy from Ascension Path, it
        took me just over a year, with some trial and error, to advance to the
        9th Star of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Six Harmonies involved stimulating the consciousness in the four
        cardinal and two diagonal directions with spiritual energy, increasing
        the size of the consciousness and filling the entire spiritual meridians
        with spiritual power.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a complete understanding of this realm and consistent practice, I
        was able to reach it quickly.
      </p>
      <p>Now at the 9th Star, the Five Elements</p>
      <p>
        From this stage, the properties of the basic cultivation methods began
        to be significantly emphasized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, the basic spells were like controlling ordinary elements,
        but from the 9th Star, one could exert proper mystical abilities.
      </p>
      <p>"Haap!"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        As I formed the hand seals and activated the mystical abilities recorded
        in the Earth Surpassing Path, a massive wall of earth rose before me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two-meter-high earthen wall, formed with spiritual power, was not
        only solid but also capable of shooting earthen projectiles, allowing
        both offense and defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could also ride on the collapsed wall as if sliding on the ground,
        build earthen houses, and freely use earth-moving techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        The range of mystical abilities and techniques related to the earth
        element has significantly increased compared to before.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the stage of the Five Elements, the process of forming true words
        and hand seals for spells and mystical abilities matching the properties
        of the cultivation method is greatly simplified.
      </p>
      <p>Snap!</p>
      <p>
        Quickly forming basic hand seals, I completed an earth-element spell
        that previously required a full set of true words and hand seals.
      </p>
      <p>Around this time, I decided to leave Ascension Path.</p>
      <p>
        'For the Six Harmonies, dense spiritual energy might be necessary, but
        from the Five Elements onwards, it's not needed.'
      </p>
      <p>I just needed enough spiritual energy of my own element.</p>
      <p>
        For that, it was better to enhance my earth attribute spiritual power on
        the ground below rather than on Ascension Path.
      </p>
      <p>I looked at the residence where I had stayed for over 41 years.</p>
      <p>Next to it was an altar, 60 meters in size, bearing my traces.</p>
      <p>
        After a brief look, I turned and headed towards the outskirts of
        Ascension Path.
      </p>
      <p>Below, the Ascension Path.</p>
      <p>After packing basic food and water, I jumped down.</p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>The wind lashed at me.</p>
      <p>The ground approached rapidly.</p>
      <p>Suddenly.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        I felt like I was 'passing through' something and, feeling strange, I
        looked up to see that Ascension Path had vanished without a trace.
      </p>
      <p>'Was it surrounded by some kind of barrier...?'</p>
      <p>
        After all, the Heaven-Treading Desert was frequently traversed even by
        mortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        If such an enormous floating island existed, it would surely be
        well-known.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unable to hide my amazement, I drew a Gang Sphere from my palm and shot
        it into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The Gang Sphere was suddenly blocked by the void and crumbled away.</p>
      <p>
        'It seems easy to leave from the inside, but hard to enter from the
        outside.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I had finished what I needed to do on Ascension Path, so it
        didn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>The desert ground drew nearer.</p>
      <p>Reading the wind's course, I kicked the void.</p>
      <p>Boom! Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the Inner Core, even though I used less internal energy, Void
        Stepping showed much greater efficacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I decelerated rapidly and the sandy floor neared, I landed on the
        ground almost as if stepping down stairs.
      </p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>Sand scattered all around.</p>
      <p>
        I formed a hand seal using earth attribute spiritual power to shake off
        the sand flying towards me.
      </p>
      <p>'Let's see, where should I go first?'</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps I should head north, where the suspicious stone structure seemed
        to have flown off.
      </p>
      <p>Or maybe west, towards the direction of Byeokra.</p>

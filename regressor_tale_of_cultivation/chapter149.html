      <p>Chapter 149: 14th Cycle's First Day</p>
      <p>
        No matter how many times I experience it, I can never get used to it.
        It’s always an unpleasant sensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterall, every moment before death is a completely different situation.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        A barrier unfolds on the Flying Immortal Platform under my feet, and the
        surrounding space stabilizes.
      </p>
      <p>The situation is right after ascending to the Bright Cold Realm.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>That disgusting voice I heard at the end of my last life.</p>
      <p>
        "Make your choice. We'll soon scatter according to the guidance of the
        Bright Cold Realm's seniors. Which faction will you join?"
      </p>
      <p>I blink my eyes and look around.</p>
      <p>Jin Byuk-ho.</p>
      <p>Heo Gwak.</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Sunwoo.</p>
      <p>Seo Hweol...</p>
      <p>And.</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>After looking around once more,</p>
      <p>
        I look at Kim Yeon, who is foaming at her mouth, collapsed next to the
        Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>"...Could you please hold on for a moment?"</p>
      <p>
        Without waiting for Seo Hweol's response, I immediately approach the
        collapsed Kim Yeon next to the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord's eyes sparkle, but ignoring his gaze, I immediately press
        the acupoint of the fainted Kim Yeon.
      </p>
      <p>"Uh, Ugh!"</p>
      <p>Kim Yeon gasps for breath and opens her eyes.</p>
      <p>"Wha, what…? Is that you, Deputy Seo…?"</p>
      <p>And before Kim Yeon could fully regain her consciousness.</p>
      <p>I hugged her tightly.</p>
      <p>"Hoho…"</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord looks at me with interest, and confusion is evident in the
        eyes of the others.
      </p>
      <p>"Yeon-ah."</p>
      <p>I call her name.</p>
      <p>"I like you. And I will continue to like you."</p>
      <p>The promise I made with her in the last life.</p>
      <p>Continuing into the future, into the next life.</p>
      <p>Even if the Kim Yeon of the next life is not the one I know.</p>
      <p>I promised to love her, over and over again.</p>
      <p>So, without hesitation, I held her and confessed.</p>
      <p>"Ye, yes…?"</p>
      <p>Kim Yeon looks around, bewildered, not understanding the situation.</p>
      <p>Then, her face suddenly turns bright red.</p>
      <p>"Ah, no… Is this, a dream?"</p>
      <p>
        While holding her, I infuse her body with the spiritual power of Yuan
        Li’s Blood Body without revealing my Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>A small spell is engraved within her body.</p>
      <p>A spell so I can continue to track her position in the future.</p>
      <p>
        Since it’s made referencing the spiritual energy circuits of the
        Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, there’s no worry of being detected by
        the Mad Lord inside the fortress.
      </p>
      <p>After holding the still confused her a bit longer,</p>
      <p>I stand up and speak.</p>
      <p>"Sir Jo Yeon."</p>
      <p>
        A madman doesn’t understand unless spoken to under the logic of the
        madman.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I have fully understood the logic of this madman by associating
        with him for over a thousand years..
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeon has the qualities of an excellent puppeteer. As someone who was
        her colleague, I can attest to that."
      </p>
      <p>"Hoh…?"</p>
      <p>
        "So, please raise her to be an excellent puppeteer. Someday, I will
        enter the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress and become one of your
        [residents]. As a [resident] of the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, I
        wish to be controlled by Yeon, who has become a puppeteer. I wish to be
        controlled by a fully accomplished puppeteer, so please do not modify
        her too much."
      </p>
      <p>
        I fully lay bare my infatuation in front of him, saying I wish to be
        manipulated by the person I love.
      </p>
      <p>There’s no logic more appealing to a madman obsessed with puppets.</p>
      <p>As expected, the Mad Lord bursts into tears and claps wildly.</p>
      <p>
        "Ahhh…! Beautiful! Okay, okay! I'll do that! I will teach this child
        well. But, does that mean you want to become a [resident] right now?"
      </p>
      <p>I shake my head.</p>
      <p>
        "No. If you modify me in my current state, you would only get a Qi
        Building stage puppet. I do not wish for such a weak puppet to be used
        by Yeon. Therefore, I will train to become a more excellent puppet and
        will come to the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress on my own someday."
      </p>
      <p>"Aaaaaah…!"</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord sheds tears of emotion.</p>
      <p>
        "What a splendid fellow! Okay, okay! The doors of the Wonderfully
        Mysterious Fortress will always be open for you!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Yeon, with a puzzled expression, listens to our conversation, and
        the Mad Lord, moved to tears, pats my shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adjusting my explanation to fit the logic of the madman seems to have
        made it clear.
      </p>
      <p>'This should be for the best.'</p>
      <p>I bow to the Mad Lord and turn around.</p>
      <p>I can't take Kim Yeon away from this madman right now.</p>
      <p>
        It’s clear that trying to take what he considers his would only make him
        more agitated and lash out….
      </p>
      <p>I turn my back on the Mad Lord and look at the other forces.</p>
      <p>It’s obvious who I will go to.</p>
      <p>'First….'</p>
      <p>
        "I have always admired the reputation of Azure Tiger Saint Cheongmun
        Sunwoo, the founder of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect and the great
        ancestor of the Cheongmun Clan. Since I have had connections with the
        people of the Cheongmun Clan before, may I have your permission to
        receive the teachings of Azure Tiger Saint?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I speak in the language of Byeokra and perform a respectful bow to Azure
        Tiger Saint.
      </p>
      <p>Azure Tiger Saint laughs heartily with his arms crossed.</p>
      <p>
        "Hahaha! Good! The Azure Heaven Creation Sect does not discriminate
        against anyone, so you too can become a distinguished disciple of our
        sect!"
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you!"</p>
      <p>
        And just like last time, when the green-armored wooden man tells us to
        go to our respective forces,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don’tWantToDon’tWantToDon’tWantToDon’tWantTo ... Do not command me...!
        [She] is speaking! Silence!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord, having a tantrum, opens a box and takes out the
        Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>And, just like last time, the same scene unfolds.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol quickly flees with Gyu-ryeon and the demon beasts, and Azure
        Tiger Saint erects a familiar barrier.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>The blue barrier covers my surroundings.</p>
      <p>The sky flashes as the Mad Lord and Four-Axis cultivators collide.</p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord, once again, captures the green-armored wooden man with the
        Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress and flies off into the distance with
        [Her].
      </p>
      <p>[That madman!]</p>
      <p>[Issue a bounty for him!]</p>
      <p>
        The cultivators on the Flying Immortal Platform shout angrily towards
        the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>As the cultivators are raging against the Mad Lord,</p>
      <p>Azure Tiger Saint looks at me worriedly and asks.</p>
      <p>
        "By the way, are you really going to become a puppet to seek out that
        madman?"
      </p>
      <p>I shake my head.</p>
      <p>
        "No. I only said so because the person who was collapsed next to him is
        someone I like."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hahaha! Brilliant! To deceive that madman, the Mad Lord, for the sake
        of a comrade!"
      </p>
      <p>Azure Tiger Saint laughs heartily.</p>
      <p>Fsssh...</p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint lifts the barrier, and Jin Byuk-ho and Heo Gwak also
        release their barriers, laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's quite the feat. Deceiving that madman to ensure the safety of a
        comrade."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's a pity. Black Ghost Valley would have treated you well if you
        chose to come.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Heo Gwak looks at me with their androgynous appearance, licking their
        lips.
      </p>
      <p>I also show my respect and reply.</p>
      <p>
        "Having a small connection with Elder Song Jin of Azure Ghost Valley, I
        too feel a bit regretful."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, with Elder Song?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, the great person who decided to stay in the lower realm to protect
        the Nether Crossing Ship that was destroyed in battle with the Mad
        Lord."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, to think you were an acquaintance with Elder Song, truly
        regrettable. If you had come, we would have treated you well."
      </p>
      <p>"Haha, having had a relationship with the Cheongmun Clan before..."</p>
      <p>"Then, it can't be helped..."</p>
      <p>After briefly interacting with Heo Gwak,</p>
      <p>I then respectfully address Jin Byuk-ho.</p>
      <p>
        "I have something to say to the Sect Master of the Golden Divine
        Heavenly Thunder Sect."
      </p>
      <p>"What is it?"</p>
      <p>Jin Byuk-ho, who was watching our conversation with interest, asks.</p>
      <p>I speak directly without beating around the bush.</p>
      <p>
        "By any chance, do you know about the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder
        Sect's immortal treasure, the Heavenly Lightning Banner?"
      </p>
      <p>"...? Of course. It's the divine artifact of our sect..."</p>
      <p>"Then..."</p>
      <p>
        Without hesitation, I tell Jin Byuk-ho about the contents of the upper
        stele that was in the lower realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...thus, due to the great war 40,000 years ago, the top part of the
        stele was damaged. And as I mentioned, possessing the immortal treasure
        Heavenly Lightning Banner can be dangerous..."
      </p>
      <p>Kwarrrr!</p>
      <p>Lightning struck down from the sky towards me.</p>
      <p>"...!"</p>
      <p>I clench my teeth and collapse as I’m struck by the lightning.</p>
      <p>
        [How dare you, spouting nonsense about our sect's immortal treasure as
        if you know anything about it...!? Do you have any proof that what
        you're saying is true? If you knew this, why didn't you speak up when we
        met last time?]
      </p>
      <p>Kurung, Kurung!</p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho's body is enveloped in golden lightning, transforming into a
        lightning deity.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You wouldn't say something absurd like you didn't know this when we met
        in the lower realm last time, would you? You're not going to tell me
        that during the few days of our ascension, you found the old temple of
        the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect in the middle of the
        Heaven-Treading Desert, discovered the top part of the stele in the
        center of that temple, and deciphered the ancient language to learn all
        this?]
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        He guessed correctly, but admitting it would seem like a mockery to him
        and will only fuel his anger further.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Be thankful you joined the Azure Heaven Creation Sect! If it weren't
        for Azure Tiger Saint's face, I would have turned you into ashes and
        sold your soul to Black Ghost Valley!]
      </p>
      <p>Pajijijijitt!</p>
      <p>
        After absorbing the golden lightning back into his body, he turns and
        walks away from the Flying Immortal Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other cultivators from the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect who have
        come with him follow suit.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, honestly, your words don’t carry much credibility, so it's no
        wonder Master Jin of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect reacted
        that way. Maybe when you have cultivated more and your words carry more
        weight, you can try speaking again."
      </p>
      <p>Tap, tap!</p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint pats my shoulder, and a blue spiritual energy envelops
        my body, healing my wounds.
      </p>
      <p>"...Thank you."</p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>Then, from above the sky.</p>
      <p>
        The Four-Axis cultivators who failed in their pursuit of the Mad Lord
        descended.
      </p>
      <p>[First, let’s make identity plaques for everyone. Follow me.]</p>
      <p>
        Guided by the Four-Axis cultivators, members of the Golden Divine
        Heavenly Thunder Sect, Azure Heaven Creation Sect, Black Ghost Valley,
        as well as various other cultivators from the righteous and devilish
        alliances followed them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We descended from the Flying Immortal Platform and moved to another
        location.
      </p>
      <p>
        [This place is called Kunlun Castle, located in the domain known as the
        Kunlun Central Area.]
      </p>
      <p>
        A blue-skinned cultivator of another race led us and continued
        explaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        [With the vitality of the Bright Cold Realm and the opening of spatial
        rifts connecting to the lower realms, we built the Flying Immortal
        Platform here to manage those who come from the lower realm. Since
        numerous races ascend from numerous lower realms, there are no wars or
        conflicts in this place.]
      </p>
      <p>'Numerous lower realms...'</p>
      <p>Indeed, there are other lower realms besides the Head Realm.</p>
      <p>
        'In my past life, I only lived as a puppet for countless years, never
        having access to proper information.'
      </p>
      <p>At best, I only know when major events will occur.</p>
      <p>
        We follow the Four-Axis cultivator through several gates of Kunlun
        Castle, moving towards a destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we pass through a large blue jade-colored gate of Kunlun Castle,
      </p>
      <p>Bustle, bustle...</p>
      <p>We see a massive crowd.</p>
      <p>"Oh, who are these?"</p>
      <p>Interest sparkles in Azure Tiger Saint's eyes.</p>
      <p>I look at the people in the grand hall, slightly intimidated.</p>
      <p>Each one is a Heavenly Being cultivator.</p>
      <p>
        [These are cultivators who ascended from different lower realms than
        you. They came up using different Flying Immortal Platforms. Kunlun
        Castle has many such platforms.]
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing his words, the Four-Axis cultivator flies up and shouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Cultivators who ascended from the Astral Realm, head over there, and
        those from the Decaying Corpse Realm, go in that direction!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Following his words, dozens of cultivators head to their respective
        destinations.
      </p>
      <p>Azure Tiger Saint asks the Four-Axis cultivator.</p>
      <p>"What are the Astral Realm and Decaying Corpse Realm?"</p>
      <p>
        [Oh, I haven’t explained that to your group yet. To put it simply... was
        your land flat or round?]
      </p>
      <p>"Um...?"</p>
      <p>
        [The lower realms protected by some invisible force, where the land is
        flat, are collectively called the Decaying Corpse Realm. The lower
        realms where the land is round and the sky stretches infinitely are
        known as the Astral Realm.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Azure Tiger Saint and others look towards where the
        Decaying Corpse Realm cultivators go.
      </p>
      <p>"Then we must be from the Decaying Corpse Realm."</p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint walks among the Decaying Corpse Realm ascended
        cultivators, and Jin Byuk-ho and White Bone Ghost Devil also lead their
        respective Heavenly Being elders into that group.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Being cultivators from other lower realms, sensing the
        early Four-Axis stage auras emanating from Azure Tiger Saint, White Bone
        Ghost Devil, and Jin Byuk-ho, cautiously step back.
      </p>
      <p>[Now, let's issue the identity plaques. Everyone...]</p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint’s Heavenly Being elders, and the Nascent Soul
        cultivators following them were able to receive their identity plaques.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the numerous disciples of the sects brought from the lower
        realm were told they couldn't all receive identification plaques.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Damn it! You’re telling me you brought your entire sects to ascend
        together!? How is that even possible with the spatial pressure
        increasing to insane levels!?]
      </p>
      <p>
        The elder of Kunlun Castle responsible for creating identification
        plaques is visibly frustrated, shouting loudly.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Are you telling me I have to create identity plaques for millions of
        these people!? Stop talking nonsense! Make some sense! What kind of
        monsters are you to collectively ascend your entire sects!? Even if you
        reduced the burden by deploying formations within compressed spaces, it
        still doesn’t make sense!]
      </p>
      <p>
        After some arguing, it was decided that the disciples of the three sects
        would go to the Human Territory to receive their plaques.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        We, led by the Four-Axis cultivators who came to meet us from each race.
      </p>
      <p>Scattered from Kunlun Castle to various racial territories.</p>
      <p>
        "Ha, this is crazy. Our Human Race ascended in such large numbers this
        time..."
      </p>
      <p>Our Four-Axis guide,</p>
      <p>
        Heo Ryeong, one of the ancestors from Black Ghost Valley, looks at us
        incredulously.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Really... Even though they are my latter generation, what have they
        done?"
      </p>
      <p>"Heo Gwak greets the ancestor."</p>
      <p>
        "...I heard you ascended to the Four-Axis as soon as you ascended.
        Really... this generation, huh..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Heo Ryeong looks around at us for a moment, then with a flick of his
        tongue, floats into the air.
      </p>
      <p>"Now then, everyone follow me! We're going to the Human Territory!"</p>
      <p>
        Including other human cultivators who ascended from different lower
        realms, those from the three sects took out their flying artifacts and
        headed towards the Human Territory.
      </p>
      <p>Whooooosh!</p>
      <p>
        Chief Oh Hyeon-seok and I first boarded the flying artifact provided by
        Azure Tiger Saint and flew off.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could have flown there directly with my Formless Sword, but fearing I
        might be mistaken for a spy from the Heart Tribe, I slowly unraveled the
        Formless Sword from within my body and dispelled it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Four-Axis cultivators fly at the front, and since the flying
        artifact carrying me and Chief Oh follow right behind Azure Tiger Saint,
        I can hear the conversations among the Four-Axis cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ancestor, could you perhaps give us a brief explanation about the
        Bright Cold Realm?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sure, it's not anything difficult. Although there must’ve been
        information handed down to you, let me explain first..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Information regarding the Bright Cold Ream begins to flow from Heo
        Ryeong’s mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There are three major tribes in the Bright Cold Realm: the Heaven Tribe
        (天族), the Earth Tribe (地族), and the Heart Tribe (心族)."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm? But it seemed like there were many more races in the grand hall we
        were just in..."
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the Heavenly Being cultivators following behind mutters in
        confusion, and Heo Ryeong responds.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's correct. There are an enormous number of races. However, since
        it's impossible to know all of them, in the Bright Cold Realm, the
        characteristics of the races are broadly divided into three: Heaven,
        Earth, and Heart."
      </p>
      <p>He continues his explanation.</p>
      <p>
        "The criteria for dividing into the three major tribes is just one
        thing: [Vision].
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heaven Tribe are those who find rituals suitable for their race,
        offer sacrifices to the heavens, and possess the eyes to read celestial
        energy. Our Human Race is included in this category.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Earth Tribe are those who train their bodies, pushing physical
        limits to awaken certain senses, possessing the eyes to read the
        spiritual energy of the Earth. Mostly, the demons born from beasts make
        up the absolute majority.
      </p>
      <p>And lastly, the Heart Tribe..."</p>
      <p>
        I listen even more intently, focusing on Heo Ryeong's explanation
        regarding the Heart Tribe.

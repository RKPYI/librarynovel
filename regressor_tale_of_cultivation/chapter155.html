      <p>“Hm?”</p>
      <p>Azure Tiger Saint’s eyes sparkles while watching Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
      <p>
        An odd momentum is flowing from Seo Eun-hyun's body, something entirely
        different from Azure Heaven Creation Sect's body refining methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course Azure Tiger Saint, being that he is, didn't particularly doubt
        its origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it’s someone who ascended alone without even achieving the Qi
        Refining stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s entirely possible for him to have learned some strange technique
        unknown to him or to possess a special ability.
      </p>
      <p>'Huh?'</p>
      <p>
        However, Azure Tiger Saint momentarily felt an eerie energy from Seo
        Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>
        An energy he would not wish to encounter even in his dreams was
        fleetingly felt from him.
      </p>
      <p>'The Mad Lord!?'</p>
      <p>The Azure Tiger Saint shuddered.</p>
      <p>
        Indeed, the power felt from Seo Eun-hyun was similar to that felt from
        the puppets of the Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Thinking back, he definitely said strange things to the Mad Lord last
        time... A spy of the Mad Lord? No, that can't be. That maniac wouldn't
        have the sanity left to send a spy...'
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh....</p>
      <p>But before Azure Tiger Saint could dwell further on his suspicion.</p>
      <p>The strange energy felt from Seo Eun-hyun dissipated once again.</p>
      <p>'...It should be a misunderstanding.'</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        What is now felt from Seo Eun-hyun is definitely the power of body
        refining! Azure Tiger Saint shakes his head while looking at Seo
        Eun-hyun.
      </p>
      <p>'Even if he truly learned the Mad Lord’s method, so what?'</p>
      <p>After all, he is already one of his disciples.</p>
      <p>
        Having personally accepted him as a disciple, it’s also necessary as a
        master to trust and watch over his disciple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint thought this way, looking at his two disciples rising
        to the Qi Building stage.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>I begin controlling my Qi (vital force) and refining my mind.</p>
      <p>The start is nothingness, the void..</p>
      <p>From there, I recall the time when I first held a sword.</p>
      <p>At this moment, I am a mere third-rate martial artist.</p>
      <p>And then the next moment.</p>
      <p>Continuously refining from nothingness, I improve further.</p>
      <p>From a third-rate martial artist to a second-rate martial artist.</p>
      <p>From a second-rate martial artist to a first-rate martial artist.</p>
      <p>'I will enter the pinnacle!!'</p>
      <p>Paaah!</p>
      <p>As I refine my mind, I reach the pinnacle.</p>
      <p>Beyond the pinnacle is Three Flowers Gather at the Summit.</p>
      <p>Paaah!</p>
      <p>
        As my mind awakens, numerous intents begin to be captured in my vision.
      </p>
      <p>'I will enter Five Energies Converging to the Origin.'</p>
      <p>
        The intents intertwine and finally unify, forming the domain of
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reaching Five Energies Converging to the Origin and creating a
        domain of consciousness, I thought the lines of intent had no more
        meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, after recently sparring with Azure Tiger Saint and escaping
        from seniors a few times, I realized something.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to think that after creating a domain of consciousness, I could
        directly read the opponent's movements through that domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, the method of 'reading' those movements can also be done through
        the lines of intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, using the domain of consciousness for assessing the battlefield
        and preparing techniques, while purely using the lines of intent for
        combat, turned out to be the valid approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint probably also embodied this understanding through
        combat, making effective use of the threads of intent in battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        If both my opponent and I possess the same domain of consciousness, then
        during combat, the one who encompasses more within their sight wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the numerous lines of intent, the path optimized for me and the
        path optimized for the opponent appears distinctly clear within the
        domain of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unified domain of consciousness is finely decomposed to the level of
        intent and separately encompassed within my field of vision.
      </p>
      <p>It looks as if countless intents are swirling around the world.</p>
      <p>
        With the perspective of the Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon, I
        coldly analyze these intents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The powers held by intent, the thoughts and emotions, and their subtle
        influences on heaven and earth spiritual energy are analyzed with the
        Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I begin to approach the Ultimate Pinnacle by analyzing the intents
        emanating from me and those around me.
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>Inside my body, in the core of my dantian, a Gang Sphere is formed.</p>
      <p>
        However, instead of being expelled outward, the Gang Sphere starts to
        dissipate within the dantian.
      </p>
      <p>Unlike usual, it does not transform into the Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        Through the Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon, the Gang Sphere
        starts to spread throughout my body as [Mad Lord’s Circuits].
      </p>
      <p>
        Before it manifests as the Formless Sword, I intentionally spread the
        energy of the Gang Sphere throughout my body like circuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally, installing circuits meant for puppets into a human body would
        result in significant strain.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why the Mad Lord transformed healthy humans into puppets, so it
        didn't matter if they were subjected to strain.
      </p>
      <p>But, with my [current flesh], it’s doable.</p>
      <p>Crack, crackle crack!</p>
      <p>
        My entire body momentarily exhales an aura akin to a dharma treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this state, I crush the Gang Sphere and lay it out in circuits, then
        inject the spiritual energy accumulated through the body refining method
        into the circuits.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Through the circuits, a momentum similar to that of a typical body
        cultivator is emitted.
      </p>
      <p>'Not yet.'</p>
      <p>
        Through the Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon, I follow the
        threads of the analyzed intents and naturally infuse these intents into
        the circuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, using the Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts, I make sure no one can detect anything odd even
        if flows of intent are directed at me.
      </p>
      <p>Martial Arts, Puppetry, Body Refining.</p>
      <p>
        The integration of these three fields is something only I, who have
        mastered all three, could attempt!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have installed the circuits of a living puppet within my own body.
      </p>
      <p>‘There is no enlightenment from the Four-Axis stage.’</p>
      <p>It’s to be expected.</p>
      <p>
        After all, [General Seo] back then was no different from a dharma
        treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if one handles something akin to an external divine object for a
        thousand years, it remains an external divine object.
      </p>
      <p>It's impossible to gain enlightenment about any state from it.</p>
      <p>However,</p>
      <p>
        ‘If one handles something for a thousand years, one inevitably grasps
        the principles of that external divine object.’
      </p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>How the Mad Lord's circuits could amplify power,</p>
      <p>How they could produce great force from a small amount of energy,</p>
      <p>I could understand that much.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Through the circuits, the energy in my body begins to surge
        dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>Naturally, reaching the Four-Axis stage is out of the question.</p>
      <p>However,</p>
      <p>‘The power I had equivalent to the Qi Building mid-stage…’</p>
      <p>Rushes to the peak of Qi Building!</p>
      <p>
        This is the extent I can reach using Puppetry, Body Refining, and the
        state of Ultimate Pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here, without raising any suspicion, I must advance to Beyond the
        Path to Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I crushed the Gang Sphere as soon as it was created and transformed it
        into circuits.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The circuits are currently flowing with the energy of body refining
        methods, making it appear outwardly no different from other body
        refining methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Without revealing my martial arts… I will advance to Beyond the Path to
        Heaven!’
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>Sharp energy begins to gather throughout my body.</p>
      <p>
        The circuits created with the crushed Gang Sphere slowly transform into
        the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the Formless Sword still maintains the form of the Mad Lord's
        circuits, with the power of the body refining methods swirling inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, since the Mad Lord's circuits amplify power, the
        characteristics of the Formless Sword itself are completely overshadowed
        by the power of body cultivation!
      </p>
      <p>‘Now, finally…’</p>
      <p>I carefully begin my approach to Treading Heavens Beyond the Path.</p>
      <p>
        Right after my return, I hid the realm of Treading Heavens Beyond the
        Path so as to not to be detected, and since then, I did not allow my
        body to reach that state, fearing discovery.
      </p>
      <p>But today.</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>'Today, I can enter that realm once more.'</p>
      <p>Perhaps from now on, it will always be possible without worry.</p>
      <p>
        Brilliance flares up from my entire body, as if the radiance between
        heaven and earth converge towards me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power of the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture, amplified
        endlessly by the Mad Lord’s circuits made from the Formless Sword,
        explode.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>The form of the exploding power is shaped by my will.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the power takes the form similar to a sword.</p>
      <p>A sword of five colors covers my body.</p>
      <p>Finally.</p>
      <p>'I have reached Treading Heavens Beyond the Path!'</p>
      <p>Kiiiing!</p>
      <p>
        Although it appears extremely splendid on the outside, the unique aura
        emitted by the integration of the Formless Sword's unique consciousness
        is obscured within the power of the body refining method.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that state, I gather the clouds of spiritual energy revolving in my
        dantian, beginning the creation of a star in my dantian.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>A brilliantly colored star is formed.</p>
      <p>As the celestial energy changes, my lifespan extends again.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, dark clouds thicken in the sky, occasionally emitting
        blue flashes.
      </p>
      <p>"Haaaap!"</p>
      <p>
        Chief Oh Hyun-seok shouts beside me, reaching the Qi Building stage.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, blue lightning strikes next to me, targeting him.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>"This mere static electricity, can it compare to Master’s touch!"</p>
      <p>
        Chief Oh Hyun-seok gathers Qi in his fist and thrusts it towards the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>
        The blue flash emitted from his hand bursts the thunderbolt and flies
        straight into the sky, piercing through the thunderclouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching this, I hesitate no longer and fully enter the Qi Building
        stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        My lifespan completely transforms, and heavenly lightning strikes down
        upon me.
      </p>
      <p>And then, I raise my hand.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>I, too, use a fist.</p>
      <p>
        The five-colored light gathered in my fist is shot towards the heavenly
        lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the five-colored light, unlike Chief Oh's, does not destroy the
        lightning but slices through it, advancing into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The heavenly lightning and the dark clouds are cut apart directly by my
        fist, carving a giant sword scar in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>"Hooo..."</p>
      <p>I smile, reading the celestial energy beyond the clouds.</p>
      <p>
        It’s impossible right now to permeate and cut only what I want to with
        the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be possible if I fully reveal the power of Treading Heavens
        Beyond the Path, but in my current state where Treading-Heaven is hidden
        within the body refining method and the Mad Lord's circuits, it’s
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p>But.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        While the void where Chief Oh Hyun-seok's fist stuck is merely clear,
        the void where I split seems to ripple somehow.
      </p>
      <p>A strike of the Nascent Soul stage!</p>
      <p>Indeed.</p>
      <p>
        Through the method of engraving the Mad Lord's circuits as the Formless
        Sword in my body along with martial arts and body cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am able to deliver a blow corresponding to the Nascent Soul stage in
        an instant.
      </p>
      <p>I closely observe the sky.</p>
      <p>
        The lifespan given by Treading Heavens Beyond the Path, discovered
        during my past life's Seven Stars Ritual.
      </p>
      <p>'Treading Heavens Beyond the Path extends life by 49 years.'</p>
      <p>
        Compared to cultivation methods that directly change celestial energy,
      </p>
      <p>
        Or demon beast methods that indirectly change celestial energy by
        maximizing vitality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Martial arts itself has no part in changing celestial energy or
        maximizing vitality.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it does make one somewhat healthier and more vigorous, but not to
        the extent that it influences celestial energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather, because martial arts became increasingly powerful, the side
        effect of increased vitality became excessively strong, slightly
        altering celestial energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likely, Kim Young-hoon in the lower realm will also reach Treading
        Heavens Beyond the Path, and there will be an increase of about 50 years
        in lifespan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Including one or two Longevity Fruits, his lifespan will increase by at
        least 250 years or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I cannot be certain about the realm above Treading Heavens Beyond
        the Path, it's likely that lifespan will increase a bit more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I've known since my past life, it seems I rarely had the chance
        to think separately about the realm of Treading Heavens Beyond the Path
        like this.
      </p>
      <p>For Kim Young-hoon, will 250 years be sufficient?</p>
      <p>
        In my past life, even after 1000 years, I hadn't heard any news of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, being a puppet of the Mad Lord, treated as a public enemy in
        the Bright Cold Realm, it wouldn't have been possible to properly gather
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        And since the Ascension Gate doesn't open precisely every thousand
        years, who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If it's him, given enough time, he can certainly reach the extreme.'
      </p>
      <p>While I could worry about my other colleagues,</p>
      <p>There’s no need to worry for him.</p>
      <p>I gather my energy, contemplating.</p>
      <p>
        'I've managed to conceal Treading Heavens Beyond the Path within the Mad
        Lord's circuits and the body refining method. Of course, delivering
        attacks that transcend planes is impossible without fully revealing
        Treading Heavens Beyond the Path, but my combat prowess itself has
        reached the Nascent Soul stage.'
      </p>
      <p>I organize my thoughts.</p>
      <p>
        'Now, it's about time to take on sect missions and meet other
        colleagues...'
      </p>
      <p>As I’m lost in thought.</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>Without a moment to react, a red intent strikes my face.</p>
      <p>
        Without giving me a chance to dodge, a fist as big as a pot lid hits
        squarely on my face.
      </p>
      <p>"Keeeuk!"</p>
      <p>I spit blood, lifted into the air.</p>
      <p>A blow so fast that there was no room to dodge or react!</p>
      <p>And then, the hearty voice of Azure Tiger Saint echoes all around.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        [Now that you've reached the Qi Building stage, your lifelines have
        become a bit tougher, so let's 'properly' train, my disciples!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Quickly shaking off the blood on my face, I see that Chief Oh Hyun-seok
        was also sent flying far away.
      </p>
      <p>Booong!</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, without a moment to check my body that has reached the
        Qi Building stage, the Azure Tiger Saint appears above me.

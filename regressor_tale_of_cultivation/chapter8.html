      <p>Chapter 8: Heaven-Sent Talent (2)</p>
      <p>Four months later.</p>
      <p>Director Kim Young-hoon smoothly reached the Pinnacle Realm.</p>
      <p>Chew, chew, chew...</p>
      <p>
        After consuming the yellow bamboo root I gave him, he sat cross-legged
        and began circulating his Qi.
      </p>
      <p>Wooosh...</p>
      <p>
        As he did so, the phenomenon of Three Flowers Gather at the Summit
        occurred above his head, marking his attainment of peak expert status.
      </p>
      <p>"Ha ha, the world looks completely different now."</p>
      <p>"...Your talent is truly remarkable, every time I see it."</p>
      <p>
        Originally, it would take Director Kim Young-hoon around six to seven
        months to reach the peak. However, learning the Severing Mountain
        Swordsmanship, a first-rate martial art from the beginning, seemed to
        lower the difficulty of reaching the peak. He achieved it two months
        earlier than I expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, while practicing the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, he even
        developed a new martial art named Severing Vein Saber Method, modifying
        all the sword forms of the original method into saber techniques.
      </p>
      <p>Anyone would be astounded by his martial prowess.</p>
      <p>"That's right. Even I find myself quite extraordinary."</p>
      <p>"...I have something to give to you, Director."</p>
      <p>
        Admiring his incredible talent, I took out a book from my possession and
        handed it to him.
      </p>
      <p>‘Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts.</p>
      <p>
        It was a martial art against cultivators, created by Director Kim
        Young-hoon in my past life after reaching Five Energies Converging to
        the Origin, dedicating his remaining life to it. I had reorganized it
        into book form during these four months he was training to reach the
        peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I found this martial art book in a bookstore. The owner claimed it was
        an incredible martial arts manual, but I couldn't understand a single
        word. Thinking I was scammed, I came to you for advice."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, let's see."</p>
      <p>
        I handed him the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting
        Martial Arts.
      </p>
      <p>After a while, his eyes widened. I could feel him trembling.</p>
      <p>"What is this... What kind of martial art is this?"</p>
      <p>"...I don't know."</p>
      <p>"Ah, I see. That makes sense."</p>

      <p>Director Kim Young-hoon pressed his head hard, explaining to me.</p>
      <p>
        "This is a martial arts manual that can only be understood by those who
        have reached the peak... No, those who have attained Three Flowers
        Gather at the Summit beyond the pinnacle. It's terrifying. I never knew
        such a martial philosophy existed. Anyone who can master this art can
        surely become the greatest under the heavens. You've brought another
        incredible stroke of fate!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ha ha, I thought I was scammed because it sounded too fantastical. But
        about Three Flowers Gather at the Summit, isn't that the same level as
        the Pinnacle Realm?"
      </p>
      <p>
        A martial arts manual that only those who have reached beyond the
        pinnacle can understand?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah, seeing me reach the Pinnacle Realm must have confused you. But even
        I know I'm an exceptional case. There are stages in the peak: early,
        middle, and late. Three Flowers Gather at the Summit is a state that
        only those who have reached the late stage of the Pinnacle Realm can
        realize."
      </p>
      <p>"I see..."</p>
      <p>This was news to me.</p>
      <p>
        Oddly, even though I had risen to the position of chief strategist in
        the Wulin Alliance in my past life, I never had access to information
        above first class.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to martial standards, the levels of martial artists were
        classified as first, second, and third.
      </p>
      <p>Anyone who begins learning martial arts is considered third-rate.</p>
      <p>
        Those who have learned at least one martial technique or internal energy
        method and can utilize them in combat are early third-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who have learned both martial techniques and internal energy are
        mid third-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who have mastered both and can use them simultaneously are late
        third-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using both martial techniques and internal energy simultaneously is
        incredibly challenging. Mismanaging internal energy can lead to immense
        pain or mental derangement. There's no room for error.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I remember it felt like splitting my head in two when I first learned
        martial arts.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who overcome these difficulties and become skilled in martial arts
        are considered early second-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who can use both martial techniques and internal energy in combat
        without awkwardness are mid second-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who can do so without conscious thought, having these abilities
        ingrained, are late second-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past few months, I managed to reclaim the mid second-rate
        prowess I had in my previous life.
      </p>
      <p>'I'm about to reach late second-rate soon...!'</p>
      <p>
        Crossing the threshold of martial arts proficiency and achieving
        completion marks the first-rate stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        When martial techniques and internal energy become fully integrated into
        one's body, achieving freedom within martial arts, that's early
        first-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reaching a level where the essence of martial arts is realized, refining
        Qi usage and being able to project sword energy, is mid first-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        When one's martial prowess (武) and intent (意) fully merge, achieving
        the pinnacle of swordsmanship known as the unity of sword and body
        (劍身合一), shortening both the time to manifest and prepare sword
        energy, is referred to as the late first-rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such information, spanning from early third-rate to late first-rate, was
        all gathered in my past life when I served as a strategist in the
        Martial Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        'However, information regarding the Pinnacle Realm was tightly guarded.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Young-hoon, a close associate, would awkwardly smile and evade the
        question when I inquired.
      </p>
      <p>'Is it because it's impossible to comprehend unless experienced?'</p>
      <p>
        Even those who reached the extreme of late first-rate would occasionally
        hint at it, but no martial artist at the Pinnacle Realm ever disclosed
        detailed information about the Pinnacle Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "By the way, Director Kim, could you possibly explain what the Pinnacle
        Realm is like?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Curious, I asked Kim Young-hoon about the Pinnacle Realm, but he just
        awkwardly laughed, giving the same response as in my previous life.
      </p>
      <p>"Sorry, but you wouldn't understand even if I told you."</p>
      <p>
        "I’m not making fun of you. Having premature knowledge of the peak could
        lead to dangerous delusions and madness. The world we see is... entirely
        different from yours."
      </p>
      <p>He apologized and shifted the conversation.</p>
      <p>
        "Now that I've reached the peak, I think I'll go around challenging
        sects to gauge my skills. Will you join me?"
      </p>
      <p>"Sure, why not?"</p>
      <p>
        A month later, Kim Young-hoon had taken down the signboards of every
        small and mid-sized martial arts school in Yonghyeol City.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my previous life, the capital, Seokyung, had seven large factions,
        the Four Stars Three Demons. However, most cities had one or at most two
        large factions.
      </p>
      <p>Yonghyeol City had one large faction, Qia River Sect.</p>
      <p>
        Since Kim Young-hoon had already taken down the signboards of all the
        smaller schools, Qia River Sect was tense even before our challenge.
      </p>
      <p>"It's an honor to meet the famous warrior Young."</p>
      <p>Arriving at Qia River Sect, the sect leader personally greeted us.</p>
      <p>
        "Fifty-three small schools, thirty-two mid-sized schools, eleven
        mid-sized sects, a total of ninety-six signboards taken by a grand
        master like you, it's an honor."
      </p>
      <p>"I did not intend to challenge so many schools..."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon modestly spoke to the sect master.</p>
      <p>
        "If there had been even one worthy opponent, a draw, or a defeat, I
        would have stopped..."
      </p>
      <p>"Not a single one was a match for you."</p>
      <p>
        Indeed, after reaching the peak with the Severing Vein Saber Method and
        awakening his latent talent, Kim Young-hoon mastered Record of
        Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts,
      </p>
      <p>
        None of the ninety-six sects in Yonghyeol City could withstand even
        three moves from him.
      </p>
      <p>"I hope the Qia River Sect will be different."</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, surely. Our faction is filled with remarkable masters, fitting
        for warrior Young’s level."
      </p>
      <p>Following the sect leader, we headed to Qia River Sect's arena.</p>
      <p>The challenge was a three-round match.</p>
      <p>
        Three of Qia River Sect's best would face Kim Young-hoon, and if he
        defeated all three, he'd take Qia River Sect's signboard.
      </p>
      <p>A daunting challenge format for Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>"Hahaha, no matter."</p>
      <p>Confidence filled Kim Young-hoon's eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "With Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts,
        I'm invincible! Since learning it, I've become an adult, and others mere
        toddlers. Why should I fear three toddlers coming at me?"
      </p>
      <p>The three-round challenge at Qia River Sect began.</p>
      <p>The first challenger was Qia River Sect's sect leader.</p>
      <p>"I didn't expect you to come out first..."</p>
      <p>Qia River Sect's sect leader, Mun Ye-eik, replied with a wry smile.</p>
      <p>
        "No one among our elders or the best of Yonghyeol City's mid-tier
        schools can withstand you for three moves. Surely, you're a top master
        even among those at the peak. Qia River Sect's Elders Council will face
        you!"
      </p>
      <p>The gong for the start of the match sounded.</p>
      <p>
        Mun Ye-eik, Qia River Sect's sect leader, was a renowned peak master in
        the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Even the top masters from eleven mid-tier sects who were quickly
        defeated by Kim Young-hoon, were considered inferior to Mun Ye-eik.'
      </p>
      <p>
        I watched the duel between the two masters, curious about the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>Swish!</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon drew his saber.</p>
      <p>Mun Ye-eik also unsheathed his flexible sword.</p>
      <p>Attack!</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon charged first, straight at the sect leader. As Mun Ye-eik
        swung his flexible sword, it seemed to encircle Kim Young-hoon from all
        sides.
      </p>
      <p>Wham!</p>
      <p>
        But then, Kim Young-hoon's body split into seven shadows, each darting
        towards the weakest points of Mun Ye-eik's sword barrier.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm!"</p>
      <p>
        Determined not to let the shadows escape, sect leader Mun Ye-ik chased
        after the illusions with his soft sword, like a snake pursuing its prey.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Whoosh, whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        His soft sword split into thousands of strands, seemingly slicing
        through the illusions.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, not one of the illusions was the real body, and in the
        enclosure created by the soft sword, the shadows of Kim Young-hoon
        vanished completely.
      </p>
      <p>Then it happened.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        From the sky, Director Kim Young-hoon leaped down, rotating in the air
        and charging towards the sect leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving seven illusions below, his real body had leapt up into the air.
      </p>
      <p>“Gasp...!”</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>The blade of his saber touched the throat of Mun Ye-ik.</p>
      <p>Ding―</p>
      <p>It was a victory for Director Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>The move he used to win only took 2 seconds.</p>
      <p>“Will the challenger continue the consecutive battles?”</p>
      <p>
        The elder conducting the martial arts contest asked with a stern face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Director Kim Young-hoon, without even stepping down from the arena,
        nodded his head.
      </p>
      <p>The next opponent was a bald old man with a white beard.</p>
      <p>
        "I am Ik Cheon-bae, a grand elder of Qia River Sect, currently a member
        of the Elders' Council," he introduced himself briefly and took his
        stance.
      </p>
      <p>Ding―</p>
      <p>
        The bell rang again, and this time, it was Elder Ik Cheon-bae who
        charged towards Director Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>Chatter!</p>
      <p>He too wielded a soft sword as his weapon.</p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>Ding―</p>
      <p>
        He too could not last more than ten seconds before having to kneel
        before Director Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>'He lasted over three seconds.'</p>
      <p>
        It was a testament to his immense strength that he managed to withstand
        Director Kim Young-hoon, who had mastered the Record of Transcending
        Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts, for over three seconds. Yet,
        Director Kim Young-hoon looked slightly disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>"Shall we continue the consecutive battles?"</p>
      <p>
        The elder running the contest now had a face resembling sour grapes.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's continue."</p>
      <p>
        The final opponent in the series of three battles was an old man in
        plain martial clothes, with a long beard and white hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I am Pal Jik-tae, the Supreme Elder of Qia River Sect, and the current
        Head of the Elders' Council. I see you've made it past the third."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>
        Only then did Director Kim Young-hoon's eyes light up with interest at
        the sight of the old man known as the Supreme Elder of Qia River Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        "A master of Three Flowers Gather at the Summit, eh? This is the first
        time I've seen someone of this level in this city."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's rare for people to reach the third. The vast majority live their
        lives only in red and blue. It's been a long time since I've met a
        master like you."
      </p>
      <p>"Huh, how many other masters of Three Flowers have you met?"</p>
      <p>
        "Mostly one per major faction's Elders' Council. There are one or two in
        the wilderness too... If you're curious, travel around the cities of
        Yanguo and visit the major factions. I hear you've been challenging the
        mid-level factions; keep in mind that those little fish won't help you
        much at our level."
      </p>
      <p>"I appreciate the advice, senior."</p>
      <p>'Third? Red and blue?'</p>
      <p>I pondered over the hints dropped by the old man.</p>
      <p>
        'Why is Three Flowers referred to as the third? What are red and blue?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking around, the other disciples and elders of Qia River Sect seemed
        just as puzzled by the situation, staring blankly at the arena.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the sect leader and elders who had been defeated by Kim Young-hoon
        and stepped down from the arena looked on in astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>'It seems impossible to understand unless one is a peak master.'</p>
      <p>Then it happened.</p>
      <p>Gasping for breath!</p>
      <p>Pal Jik-tae suddenly exclaimed, sweating profusely.</p>
      <p>"What kind of martial art have you mastered?"</p>
      <p>
        "...This martial art is called Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts."
      </p>
      <p>
        " Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts... I've
        never seen such a monstrous martial art in my life... Is it really meant
        for fighting humans?"
      </p>
      <p>"...?"</p>
      <p>What's going on?</p>
      <p>There was no clash, was there?</p>
      <p>Director Kim Young-hoon smiled wryly and said,</p>
      <p>"I will let you take the lead."</p>
      <p>
        "...I am envious. To be able to learn such a terrifying martial art that
        can overturn Qia River Sect's 300 years of history in one go..."
      </p>
      <p>Finishing his words, Pal Jik-tae adjusted his stance.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Pal Jik-tae swung his soft sword, launching an attack.</p>
      <p>
        The soft sword whistled through the air, surrounding Director Kim
        Young-hoon on all sides.
      </p>
      <p>It appeared to be the same technique used by Mun Ye-ik at first.</p>
      <p>However, Director Kim Young-hoon didn't create illusions this time.</p>
      <p>
        Instead, he focused on the only open space, the sky above, and leaped
        into the air with his saber.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Just then, the tip of Pal Jik-tae's soft sword shot towards the sky like
        an arrow.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        Director Kim Young-hoon twisted his body in mid-air, deflecting the tip
        of the soft sword and escaping its enclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next moment, he charged at Pal Jik-tae like a bolt of lightning,
        swinging his saber.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A massive explosion split the ground of the martial arts field.</p>
      <p>Their weapons collided in mid-air, sparking flames.</p>
      <p>"Ah...!"</p>
      <p>For a moment, I lost sight of both of them.</p>
      <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>
      <p>
        With explosive sounds, Director Kim Young-hoon's figure briefly
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed like he was thrusting his saber, but Pal Jik-tae, almost
        imperceptible to the eye, dodged all the thrusts and exchanged blows
        with Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Pal Jik-tae's soft sword explosion blew up a corner of the martial arts
        field.
      </p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>
        Director Kim Young-hoon's flurry of saber energy shattered the bell
        beside the arena. The elder judging the contest gasped in horror and
        rolled away to dodge the energy.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Director Kim Young-hoon stepped forward three times, charging at Pal
        Jik-tae.
      </p>
      <p>In those three steps, his stance seemed to change over ten times.</p>
      <p>
        But the transitions were so fast it was hard to follow with the eyes.
      </p>
      <p>It felt more like a video screen stuttering.</p>
      <p>'Damn... peak masters are indeed monsters.'</p>
      <p>It was the same in my past life.</p>
      <p>
        As a close aide to the Wulin Alliance leader, I had the opportunity to
        see peak masters fight a few times.
      </p>
      <p>'I couldn't understand a thing back then, either.'</p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, having seen many fights then, I could at least follow with
        my eyes now.
      </p>
      <p>
        But other disciples, instructors, and guardians of Qia River Sect who
        seemed to be at a similar level to me were simply staring blankly at the
        arena, their eyes glazed.
      </p>
      <p>None of them could follow the movements of the two masters.</p>
      <p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Pal Jik-tae's soft sword cut through the air, undergoing three changes
        in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, curiously, with every shift he made, Pal Jik-tae's body sustained
        slashes, and marks from the saber emerged.
      </p>
      <p>
        With each of his three changes packed into one technique, Director Kim
        Young-hoon struck three times.
      </p>
      <p>And finally.</p>
      <p>Swoosh, clang!</p>
      <p>
        Director Kim Young-hoon's saber cut through Pal Jik-tae's soft sword.
      </p>
      <p>The soft sword fell outside the arena, severed.</p>
      <p>Swoosh―</p>
      <p>
        Director Kim Young-hoon's saber touched Pal Jik-tae's neck, who sighed
        in defeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I accept my defeat. I'll remove the signboard of Qia River Sect. Our
        faction will close its doors for three years!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "...I have witnessed that no martial art in Yonghyeol City can match
        that of Qia River Sect. It was a duel from which I too learned much."
      </p>
      <p>
        The two martial artists respectfully bowed to each other and stepped
        down from the arena.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's go back, Seo Eun-Hyun."</p>
      <p>"Have you grasped how far your skills extend?"</p>
      <p>"...It's not my skill."</p>
      <p>Director Kim Young-hoon's expression seemed somewhat gloomy.</p>
      <p>
        "Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial arts. I
        merely adopted the forms of this martial art as instructed. I haven't
        fully mastered this martial art, haven't gained freedom within it, nor
        grasped the intent."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "This martial art... whoever created it, I don't know. But I haven't
        surpassed the intentions of its creator. The deeper I delve into and
        execute this martial art, the more I feel how much of a novice I am
        compared to its creator."
      </p>
      <p>
        I was at a loss for words, watching him be self-critical and gloomy
        about his own martial art.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Today's battle showed me how insignificant my skills are. As the senior
        advised, I will travel to various cities and seek out peak masters for
        duels... Will you join me?"
      </p>
      <p>"...Of course."</p>
      <p>
        I had already decided to dedicate this life solely to the martial path.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I will follow you, Hyung-nim, in my quest to become a peak master."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Haha, I look forward to it. But Hyung-nim, you say? I'm a bit
        embarrassed. There's not much age difference between us. Haha..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Isn't it better for people from the same hometown to address each other
        as brothers?"
      </p>
      <p>In this life, I will surely become a peak master.</p>

      <p>Chapter 80: Qi Building</p>
      <p>The Five Elements form a perfect circle.</p>
      <p>"Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation!"</p>
      <p>
        Surpassing the Five Elements, truly entering the path of cultivation!
      </p>
      <p>
        The five spiritual clouds of yellow, black, red, white, and green start
        to rotate and compress in the dantian.
      </p>
      <p>Ku-gu-gu-gu!</p>
      <p>'Here we go!'</p>
      <p>A Spiritual Energy Star forms.</p>
      <p>
        The twists of spiritual energy from the Five Elements Spiritual Roots
        are blocked by the changes of all five methods of the Five Surpassing
        Paths to Cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>‘Suppress them!'</p>
      <p>
        The changes of the Five Elements rotating in the dantian gradually
        expand their reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the transformations of the Five Elements begin to consume the
        twists of the Five Elements Spiritual Roots.
      </p>
      <p>My achievements devour the fetters I am born with.</p>
      <p>Woo-woo-woong!</p>
      <p>Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of times?</p>
      <p>I've challenged Qi Building countless times.</p>
      <p>I've understood all the changes of the Five Elements!</p>
      <p>Ku-gu-gu-gu!</p>
      <p>
        All transformations of the Five Elements ascend to my hand, and the
        five-colored star begins to stabilize.
      </p>
      <p>Pa-aa-aaat!</p>
      <p>
        A dazzling orb of light, different from the mere point of spiritual
        power I've been cultivating, shines within my dantian.
      </p>
      <p>The words of Mad Lord come to mind.</p>
      <p>'Creating the flow of fate, extending lifespan...'</p>
      <p>
        Through the unified spiritual meridian, spiritual power circulates and
        gets absorbed by the Spiritual Energy Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the Spiritual Energy Star compresses it into Pure Spiritual Force.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pure Spiritual Force then circulates through the entire spiritual
        meridian, making the whole body accustomed to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the Spiritual Energy Star itself prevents the Pure Spiritual Force
        from running rampant, it's safe even if it flows to sensitive areas like
        the upper dantian or heart.
      </p>
      <p>Ku-gu-gu-gu!</p>
      <p>
        Gang Qi, or Pure Spiritual Force, starts flowing throughout my body.
      </p>
      <p>Thump, thump, thump!</p>
      <p>I no longer need to forcefully compress the heart with Gang Qi.</p>
      <p>
        Gang Qi naturally flows through the spiritual meridian, extending my
        lifespan.
      </p>
      <p>Changes occur in the celestial energy.</p>
      <p>
        Beyond my fated star, a new position forms, granting me an additional
        300 years of lifespan from the heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If the path of cultivation is about creating a continuation of fate,
        like the stars... Perhaps cultivation is ultimately a process of
        becoming like the heavens.'
      </p>
      <p>I gain a slight insight into the path of immortality.</p>
      <p>
        Through it, my ability to read celestial energy has slightly improved
        since the Qi Refining stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, just by looking at the sky, I can get a sense of great fortunes and
        misfortunes.
      </p>
      <p>'From now on, the concept of time will change a bit.'</p>
      <p>
        After reaching Core Formation, I'll receive another 300 years, totaling
        600 years of lifespan.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Nascent Soul, I'll get an additional 600 years, making it about 1200
        years in total.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting from now, having received an extra 300 years from the heavens,
        my lifespan will be significantly longer.
      </p>
      <p>Roar, roar...</p>
      <p>
        The dark clouds that gathered around Shattered Heaven Peak dissipate and
        soon vanish.
      </p>
      <p>"Ha, haha. Hahahaha!"</p>
      <p>
        I sort through my thoughts and laugh loudly, resonating throughout the
        entire peak.
      </p>
      <p>Finally.</p>
      <p>After several lifetimes, finally!</p>
      <p>"I have overcome fate...!!!"</p>
      <p>Surpassing fate, overcoming lifespan.</p>
      <p>Cururuk</p>
      <p>I deeply understand Kim Young-Hoon's words that life is joy.</p>
      <p>
        Through martial arts, I have redefined myself and gained higher
        enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>Having overcome fate, I have been granted an additional 300 years.</p>
      <p>How can I not be grateful?</p>
      <p>
        Once again, I confirm my achievement of reaching the Qi Building stage,
        releasing Pure Spiritual Force throughout my body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I can only produce a slender thread of Pure Spiritual Force,
        as there is only one source of conversion, the single Spiritual Energy
        Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        But undoubtedly, it is Pure Spiritual Force, and with Gang Qi flowing in
        my body, it's like having constant defensive Gang Qi activated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up to the Qi Refining stage, cultivators, though capable of using
        spells, still feel somewhat human.
      </p>
      <p>
        But from the Qi Building stage, one truly begins to transcend humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Gang Qi flowing throughout my body, attacks from martial artists
        with Sword Energy or Sword Silk will not even break my defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Sword Gang should have no effect if the concentration of Pure
        Spiritual Force is increased.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Unless it's an attack at the Gang Sphere level, the defensive Gang Qi
        flowing normally should be sufficient. Additionally, Pure Spiritual
        Force is circulating throughout, boosting vitality.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the one Qi Building expert in pill-refining from the Makli Clan.
        Even if several organs are torn out, Pure Spiritual Force will keep them
        functioning for days, making it unproblematic unless the head, heart, or
        abdomen is severely injured.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore.</p>
      <p>
        Covering internal energy with Pure Spiritual Force forms Sword Gang. In
        that case, freely pouring the Pure Spiritual Force flowing throughout my
        body into my Inner Core should allow me to produce infinite output of
        Gang Qi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frankly, any energy flowing through my body can be scooped up in
        whatever amount I wish and utilized in my Inner Core without any
        noticeable impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I ascend to Qi Building, most importantly, my consciousness has grown
        even more.
      </p>
      <p>Swish...</p>
      <p>I release my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        Then my consciousness returns to its original spherical domain,
        enveloping me.
      </p>
      <p>Woosh...</p>
      <p>
        Around me, within a radius of about 3 Zhang (approximately 9 meters),
        becomes covered with my consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continue to cultivate in Qi Building, the domain of my
        consciousness will only grow larger.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If I didn't reach Qi Building in this life, the size of my
        consciousness would remain the same, so my head wouldn’t explode right
        away in the next life. But now that I've reached Qi Building and been
        granted more life, thinking about the current size of my
        consciousness...'
      </p>
      <p>
        However, after pondering and moving my consciousness for a while, I
        quickly found the answer in the realm of Beyond the Path to Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh...</p>
      <p>
        My consciousness changes into the Formless Sword, and as I activate my
        will, it completely splits and begins to swirl around me.
      </p>
      <p>'This is possible even without internal energy.'</p>
      <p>
        My skill in handling pure consciousness had greatly increased, having
        reached the realm of Beyond the Path to Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next life, if I wake up and immediately split the Formless Sword,
        it seems I'll be able to avoid overload in the upper dantian.
      </p>
      <p>'I can at least stay relieved for now...'</p>
      <p>
        For now, I am greatly relieved that I wouldn't be trapped in a cycle of
        my head constantly exploding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I don't know what will happen if I continue to cultivate and
        my consciousness grows, but for now, I have extinguished the urgent
        fire.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh...</p>
      <p>I revert the Formless Sword back.</p>
      <p>I ponder over the cultivation methods I will learn in the future.</p>
      <p>'Now that I've been given 300 years, I should think slowly...'</p>
      <p>
        Until now, I always felt rushed due to the constraint of a 50-year
        lifespan.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now that I've been granted 300 years in a single life, I feel
        incredibly relaxed and peaceful.
      </p>
      <p>The stages of Qi Building are broadly divided into four.</p>
      <p>
        Many people casually called them early, mid, late, and Grand perfection,
        but there are official names for each stage of Qi Building..
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Qi Refining, where each stage is called Star, it is called
        Constellation in Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        1st Constellation: Horn, Neck, Root, Room, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket
      </p>
      <p>
        2nd Constellation: Ladle, Ox, Girl, Emptiness, Rooftop, Chamber, Wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        3rd Constellation: Legs, Bond, Stomach, Hairy Head, Net, Beak, Triple
        Stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        4th Constellation: Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Extended Net, Wing,
        Chariot.
      </p>
      <p>They are called by these names.</p>
      <p>
        They corresponds to the twenty-eight stars existing in the Astral Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Qi Building cultivators start from the Spiritual Energy Star
        corresponding to the 1st Constellation and go up to the 28th Spiritual
        Energy Star corresponding to the 4th Constellation. Creating all
        twenty-eight Spiritual Energy Stars in the dantian signifies reaching
        the Grand Perfection of Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seven Stars Ritual performed during the Qi Refining phase is of
        great help in Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seven Stars Ritual involved receiving heaven and earth spiritual
        blessings by borrowing the names of seven out of the twenty-eight
        constellation stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the type of constellation chosen at that time, it can
        either assist in the practice of the 1st Constellation, 2nd
        Constellation, 3rd Constellation, or the 4th Constellation.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I performed the ritual for the Seven Stars of the Azure Dragon this
        time, so I should have an advantage in the practice of the 1st
        Constellation.'
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, I recall an interesting fact.</p>
      <p>
        Typically, the vast majority of cultivators perform the Seven Stars
        Ritual only twice in their lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless they choose the wrong time for the ceremony, causing it to fail,
        or some extraordinary rare phenomenon like Heavenly Rejection occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, the blessings received during the Seven Stars Ritual are
        only for seven stars, and depending on which constellation one chooses,
        the timing of the help received in Qi Building changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, those with insufficient talent receive blessings from the stars
        of the 1st Constellation or 2nd Constellation, hoping for help in the
        early to mid-stages of Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those with outstanding talent receive blessings from the stars of the
        3rd Constellation or the 4th Constellation, aiming to quickly pass
        through the early to mid-stages and focus on the later stages.
      </p>
      <p>'This cursed regression ability might be helpful sometimes.'</p>
      <p>
        In my case, every time I regress, the state of cultivation is completely
        reset, and I have to perform the Seven Stars Ritual again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, if I receive blessings from the 1st Constellation in the early
        stage, refresh my understanding of that stage, and in the next life,
        skip the 1st Constellation with prior knowledge and receive blessings
        from the 2nd Constellation...
      </p>
      <p>
        'Reaching the Grand Perfection of Qi Building by receiving blessings
        from all four constellations doesn't seem like a far-fetched idea.'
      </p>
      <p>Maybe Qi Building might be a bit easier than Qi Refining.</p>
      <p>I am lost in thought regarding Qi Building when.</p>
      <p>"Eun-hyunl."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon approaches me.</p>
      <p>After nearly ten years, speaking with his voice.</p>
      <p>
        "It seems that cultivators from various cultivator clans that have
        settled in Shattered Heaven Peak are coming this way."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, that makes sense."</p>
      <p>
        With lightning striking and clouds splitting, it’s natural for them to
        come here.
      </p>
      <p>"Then Sha-"</p>
      <p>Just as I am about to utter the word 'Shattered Heaven Peak.'</p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>
        A flash of lightning sparks before my eyes, and the entire surroundings
        are engulfed in a strange glow..
      </p>
      <p>
        I realize in an instant that I have been transported to some bizarre
        place.
      </p>
      <p>'What's this...?'</p>
      <p>
        I am about to go on alert, but then I realize that my physical body has
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been sucked into this strange world in the state of
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>'What's the situation here?'</p>
      <p>As I look around in confusion.</p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>Crackle, crackle...</p>
      <p>The bizarre space begins to fill with lightning of all colors.</p>
      <p>Red, blue, gold, white, jade, pink, dark red...</p>
      <p>And across the world of lightning.</p>
      <p>A shadowy figure emerges, like a dark shadow.</p>
      <p>I tense up at this incomprehensible situation and watch the figure.</p>
      <p>
        The figure has no discernible outline, and its entire body is a dark
        shadow, almost ghost-like.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it doesn’t feel like the aura of a ghost, it’s more akin to a
        bizarre phantom.
      </p>
      <p>As I observe the entity.</p>
      <p>Drip...</p>
      <p>"...!"</p>
      <p>From the face area of the shadow.</p>
      <p>Blood begins to flow from where I assume the eyes would be.</p>
      <p>It looks like a resentful spirit shedding bloody tears.</p>
      <p>
        [I am Yang Su-jin, the first Sect Master of Golden Divine Heavenly
        Thunder Sect, the remnant shadow of the fate left behind. You, the next
        generation's Ender.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering this space means that you've miraculously achieved the
        conditions I set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before realizing your fate, entering Shattered Heaven Peak, surviving
        the heavenly lightning, and uttering 'Shattered Heaven' - all Enders who
        miraculously achieve this near-impossible probability can come here.]
      </p>
      <p>'Yang Su-jin!?'</p>
      <p>
        [I, the founder of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, Yang Su-jin,
        have created an attraction of fate within Shattered Heaven Peak that
        inevitably draws in Enders. Therefore, an Ender will inevitably come to
        Shattered Heaven Peak at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, for an Ender, who is less than a bug before realizing their
        fate, to be struck by heavenly lightning here and survive against all
        odds, and to then utter 'Shattered Heaven,' would require an
        unbelievable miracle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such an event is impossible, but without a miracle, there will be no
        escaping [it]s notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I leave this warning here for future generations, relying solely
        on the possibility of such a miracle.]
      </p>
      <p>Crack, sizzle...</p>
      <p>Around the figure introduced as the remnant of Yang Su-jin.</p>
      <p>The lightning that surrounds us starts turning blood red.</p>
      <p>
        [Future generations, whether you are the next Ender, or the one after,
        or even thousands or millions of generations later, never reveal the
        fate you have been given. I don't know what gift you may have received,
        but under no circumstances should you ever speak of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter where you go in the Three Thousand Worlds, [it] will know what
        you have received.
      </p>
      <p>Keeping your fate a secret is the only slim chance you have.]</p>
      <p>Crackle, sizzle!</p>
      <p>The entire area fills with blood-red lightning.</p>
      <p>
        More and more blood tears flow from the eyes of the figure introducing
        himself as Yang Su-jin's remnant.
      </p>
      <p>
        [If you have already revealed your secret, then, future generations,
        even that slim chance has vanished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not even think of returning to your homeland or escaping the curse of
        fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just give up on the thought of cultivation, live ordinarily among
        mortals, and die an ordinary death. Forgetting your homeland forever and
        living and dying that way is the only way to find happiness for an Ender
        who has revealed their own fate.]
      </p>
      <p>Drip, drip...</p>
      <p>
        His shadow starts to bleed and then begins to dissolve into the
        blood-red lightning.
      </p>
      <p>[Everyone living their fate feels averse to revealing it.</p>
      <p>
        Especially for an Ender, this feeling is much stronger. Yet, many take
        their fate lightly and end up revealing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I, too, once revealed my fate and ended up like this, so, future
        generations, heed my warning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you don't reveal your fate, [it] will be after you, but if you
        do reveal your fate, any means of resistance against [it] will
        completely disappear.
      </p>
      <p>Future generations, never take my warning lightly. Never...]</p>
      <p>Crackle, sizzle...</p>
      <p>
        Eventually, completely dissolving into the blood-red lightning, he
        vanishes.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>The next moment.</p>
      <p>"...It's time to leave.."</p>
      <p>
        I return to the real world, and Kim Young-hoon arrives in front of me.
      </p>
      <p>What happened in that strange world occurred in less than a second.</p>
      <p>'Ender? [It]? Caught? What shouldn't be revealed?'</p>
      <p>"Right, but... are you okay? You don't look well..."</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, no, it's nothing. I guess I pushed myself a bit too hard to reach
        Qi Building. But anyway..."
      </p>
      <p>I look around and click my tongue.</p>
      <p>"It looks like we're surrounded."</p>
      <p>Indeed.</p>
      <p>
        Dozens of Qi Building cultivators from various clans of Shengzi surround
        us at Shattered Heaven Peak, each wielding their own magic artifacts and
        standing on their flying artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who are you to occupy Shattered Heaven Peak, jointly selected as a
        sacred ground by the clans of Shengzi!
      </p>
      <p>What are you plotting? Speak the truth now!"</p>
      <p>
        One of the older Qi Building cultivators points at us angrily and
        shouts.
      </p>
      <p>I step forward and bow.</p>
      <p>
        "Greetings, I am a cultivator who has just reached the stage of Qi
        Building. The phenomenon just now was due to a special method I was
        practicing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my ignorance, I only thought this land belonged to the Golden Divine
        Heavenly Thunder Sect, not knowing it was part of the territory of the
        Shengzi clan alliance. So please forgive my mistake. I will not set foot
        in the Great Mountain Range again."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, with the recent massacre near the Heaven-Treading Desert and the
        war predicted to happen in 200 years, the entire continent is in chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        You lot seem suspicious! And to be a loose Qi Building cultivator at
        this time! No, this won't do, we're taking you in!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could you please forgive us just this once? I really have just broken
        through to Qi Building, and the recent phenomenon was due to a special
        method I practiced."
      </p>
      <p>
        The leading Qi Building cultivator scoffs at my words and begins to
        channel his magic artifacts's power.
      </p>
      <p>He seems not to listen anymore.</p>
      <p>"Surrender quietly!"</p>
      <p>"...Sigh."</p>
      <p>I look at Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        "I tried to let this go peacefully, but that's not going to happen."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, can't be helped. None of them seem to be at Core Formation, so
        let's just warm up. You need to get used to Beyond the Path to Heaven
        anyway."
      </p>
      <p>"That's true."</p>
      <p>As we speak, the cultivator with the magic artifact yells out.</p>
      <p>
        "What nonsense are you spouting! A 1st Constellation Qi Building
        cultivator and a Qi Refining 3rd or 4th Star losing their minds..."
      </p>
      <p>In the next instant.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon grabs his saber.</p>
      <p>"Ha..!"</p>
      <p>And the Qi Building cultivators around us shudder.</p>
      <p>
        If they have performed the Seven Stars Ritual and have the ability to
        read celestial energy, they will have felt it.
      </p>
      <p>A great misfortune appears right before them.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon's consciousness turns golden.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, Gang Spheres rise around him.</p>
      <p>
        My consciousness also transforms into the shape of a sword, and nine
        Gang Spheres rise around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "These bastards, using some bizarre and grotesque sorcery! Do you really
        think you two can defeat all of us?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Clan leader, they're using bizarre methods we've never seen before.
        Could they be Core Formation seniors?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Nonsense! They do not have a Core Formation senior's consciousness!
        Everyone, take out your magic artifacts!"
      </p>
      <p>The next moment.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon's golden consciousness merges with his saber, becoming
        tangible.
      </p>
      <p>My colorless consciousness disperses like mist before solidifying.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon grips the golden saber, and I grasp the formless void.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I ascended to Beyond the Path to Heaven, Kim Young-hoon's intent
        became much clearer and more vivid.
      </p>
      <p>Our intents intersect.</p>
      <p>[Beyond the Path to Heaven.]</p>
      <p>[Beyond the Path to Heaven.]</p>
      <p>"Surpassing Radiant Saber."</p>
      <p>"Formless Sword."</p>
      <p>
        Back to back, we swing our respective Surpassing Radiant Saber and
        Formless Sword at the surrounding Qi Building cultivators.

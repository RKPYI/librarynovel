      <p>Chapter 95: Lotus (3)</p>
      <p>Rumble...</p>
      <p>
        Unexpectedly, Song Jin doesn’t rush into an attack but observes me
        instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        [What are you? I've never heard of a human possessing a Demon Core, nor
        such bizarre techniques... It seems you know something about me.]
      </p>
      <p>A clear defensive stance!</p>
      <p>
        'It seems he can't fully sense me because I entered quietly without
        smashing the barrier as I did in my past life.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to when he had absorbed all the ghostly energy of the Nether
        Crossing Ship and displayed Core Formation peak level prowess in my
        previous life, he currently hasn't absorbed the ship’s ghostly energy,
        so only a mid Core Formation stage aura is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How could I not have heard of the infamous Black Ghost Valley? Let
        alone a Heavenly Being cultivator leading it!"
      </p>
      <p>
        [Heh, you must’ve heard the Mad Lord killed me, are you mocking me?]
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>Song Jin gathers enough ghostly energy.</p>
      <p>He launches an attack.</p>
      <p>Screaach!</p>
      <p>
        Thousands of white bone skeletons rise like a tidal wave around me and
        surge towards me.
      </p>
      <p>I extend my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Layered Mountains, Mountain and Valley
        Transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword spreads in all directions in the shape of thorny
        terrain, completely dominating the surrounding space.
      </p>
      <p>Then the sword undergoes another transformation.</p>
      <p>
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Severing Vein Saber Method, Fist
        Technique, Leg Technique, Foot Technique, Ground Technique, Spear
        Technique...
      </p>
      <p>A mix of numerous martial art changes.</p>
      <p>
        Every field I researched together with Kim Young-hoon in my past life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over 200 years, I had further developed and refined my Formless Sword,
        using hundreds of transformations per second to push Song Jin back.
      </p>
      <p>
        His spells break apart, completely overwhelmed by my Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>The first clash.</p>
      <p>And in this first encounter, Song Jin is overwhelmingly outmatched.</p>
      <p>Kuuaaaaaa!</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin's body absorbs the ghostly energy around him, transforming into
        a huge monster ghost.
      </p>
      <p>The form I had seen last time.</p>
      <p>
        However, this time he seems to maintain his sanity, calmly observing his
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Dragon Vein, Qi Mountain Heart Heaven,
        Cliff Edge.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword moves even faster, grows larger, and reaches a speed
        that is unmatchable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire body of the monster ghost is slashed in an instant, and Song
        Jin, reverting from his monster ghost form, casts a new spell.
      </p>
      <p>Rumbling!</p>
      <p>Blue ghost fire gathers in his hands.</p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>Severing Vein Saber Method, Mountain Wind!</p>
      <p>Whizz!</p>
      <p>
        The ultra-fast thrust hits the weak spot of the ghost fire before he can
        react, causing it to explode right in his hands.
      </p>
      <p>[Argh...]</p>
      <p>Three clashes.</p>
      <p>That alone makes the difference in our strengths clear.</p>
      <p>
        The Formless Sword, honed and refined over 200 years, has reached an
        extreme level of proficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the Formless Sword when I first faced Song Jin, it has
        undergone a change as vast as the difference between heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had he been in his prime, a living Heavenly Being, it would have been
        entirely different. But at this point, he can't defeat me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Song Jin grits his teeth, looking at me as he realizes he can't win.
      </p>
      <p>
        But instead of further pressuring him, I decide to change the topic a
        bit.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm... I too have seen the Mad Lord."</p>
      <p>
        I recall the battle between the Mad Lord and Seo Hweol in the clouds
        unseen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol, who covered the entire Ascension Path with water with a
        single gesture.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the Mad Lord, who consistently overpowered him and the Sea Dragon
        Tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Honestly, just surviving a battle with such a monster and leaving
        behind a remnant soul is nothing to be ashamed of."
      </p>
      <p>[...]</p>
      <p>Song Jin falls silent at my words.</p>
      <p>His intent is mixed with shame, anger, depression, and lamentation.</p>
      <p>
        [...You're right. In that war, the Mad Lord suddenly decided to attack
        us, and he rushed in unprepared. He destroyed a third of our main forces
        just like that. If he had fully prepared for war against us, Black Ghost
        Valley's 500,000 years of history would have ended that day.]
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>Song Jin sighs.</p>
      <p>
        [So why... Why has a strong one like you invaded the Nether Crossing
        Ship, and why are you after it? This ship is in ruins, and you don’t
        seem to need its ghostly energy for your cultivation...]
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm..."</p>
      <p>I think about making up an excuse but decide to tell the truth.</p>
      <p>[...You came looking for that half-dragon's belongings?]</p>
      <p>At his words, Seo Ran, who is hiding behind me, flinches.</p>
      <p>Song Jin's eyes blaze with even more intense blue ghost fire.</p>
      <p>
        [There's nothing of yours in this ship. What belongs to Black Ghost
        Valley stays in Black Ghost Valley. Abandon your greed and leave..!]
      </p>
      <p>But Seo Ran steps forward after swallowing hard.</p>
      <p>
        "Please, senior, I implore you. What I seek is... an heirloom of my
        mother."
      </p>
      <p>Crackle!</p>
      <p>Intense blue ghost fire surges from Song Jin's eyes.</p>
      <p>
        [Why are you searching for your mother's heirloom in the Nether Crossing
        Ship of Black Ghost Valley!]
      </p>
      <p>
        "...That is because my mother was a disciple of Black Ghost Valley."
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin seems to shudder, alternating his gaze between me and my
        Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recalling the three clashes just moments before, he is sizing me up.
      </p>
      <p>I don't avoid his gaze.</p>
      <p>
        In my past life, I had hunted him with Kim Young-hoon right after
        obtaining the Formless Sword, and over 200 years, I had further honed
        the Formless Sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, even if he absorbs all the ghostly energy of the Nether Crossing
        Ship and fights me, I don't think I will be easily outmatched.
      </p>
      <p>Especially now that he was unprepared for my sudden visit.</p>
      <p>'Come at me.'</p>
      <p>
        After a moment of eye contact with me, Song Jin lets out a small sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        [...Fine. I'll give you half a day. Search the Nether Crossing Ship and
        find your mother's heirloom. If you can't find it within half a day, as
        an elder of Black Ghost Valley, I'll find a way to expel you for
        trespassing...!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently feeling burdened by the prospect of direct combat, Song Jin
        ultimately agrees to a compromise.
      </p>
      <p>Woosh...</p>
      <p>The raging ghost fire in his eyes subsides.</p>
      <p>I also sheathe my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>
        [Remember, half a day. If you don't find your mother's heirloom within
        that time, you must leave the Nether Crossing Ship..!]
      </p>
      <p>"Understood."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran expresses his gratitude to Song Jin, and I glance at him before
        moving past.
      </p>
      <p>Then, about half an hour later.</p>
      <p>In the lowest level of the Nether Crossing Ship.</p>
      <p>
        I find the room where Seo Ran’s mother's heirloom was located in my past
        life and promptly retrieve a jade slip for Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>"By any chance, could it be this?"</p>
      <p>"Ah...!"</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran's face turns tearful as he shakily takes the jade slip from me.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, thank you so much, senior..."</p>
      <p>"It’s nothing. But it seems that the ghost is quite angry..."</p>
      <p>Outside his mother's room.</p>
      <p>There stands Song Jin, fists clenched and trembling with anger.</p>
      <p>
        [You... How do you know about that child's room? You... What is your
        relationship with her...!?]
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran also looks at me with a puzzled expression.</p>
      <p>'Did I make it seem that way...?'</p>
      <p>
        True, going straight to Seo Ran's mother's room might have given him the
        impression that I have some relationship with her.
      </p>
      <p>Anticipating a hassle, I concoct a slight lie.</p>
      <p>
        "I once met White Bone Ghost Devil Heo Gwak, the Grand Elder of Black
        Ghost Valley, in Ascension Path. They were pleased with a certain
        valuable item they obtained and told me to ask for what I wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was then that Seo Hweol, the Sea Dragon King who was also there,
        asked me to fulfill Seo Ran's request. To efficiently complete this
        task, I asked Heo Gwak about the location of Seo Ran’s mother's room."
      </p>
      <p>[What...]</p>
      <p>
        After listening to my explanation, Song Jin looks incredulous but
        reluctantly nods.
      </p>
      <p>[...Alright, let's say that's true..]</p>
      <p>
        "How about stepping aside from the door? Both Seo Ran and I wish to
        leave. Didn't we find the heirloom within the half-day you proposed?"
      </p>
      <p>[...Wait.]</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin, with his eyes ablaze with ghost fire, looks at us and speaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You, half-dragon boy. Your mother was special to me too. So now, right
        here, read your mother's will with me.]
      </p>
      <p>"What..."</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran looks uncomfortable, but under Song Jin's intimidating presence,
        he reluctantly sits down to read the jade slip.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no interest in meddling in Seo Ran's family affairs and step
        back, while Song Jin moves behind Seo Ran to read together.
      </p>
      <p>After a while...</p>
      <p>"...Keugk"</p>
      <p>
        Tears begin to fall from Seo Ran's eyes, and the intensity of ghost fire
        in Song Jin's eyes weakens.
      </p>
      <p>No, it softens.</p>
      <p>
        [...Foolish child. Didn't you know that aside from the Sea Dragon King,
        the Sea Dragon Tribe is mostly self-centered and despicable creatures?]
      </p>
      <p>
        He raises his ghostly arm, trembling, and snatches the jade slip from
        Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran doesn't resist and lets Song Jin take the slip.</p>
      <p>
        [You fool...! What was so good about your husband who died so
        irresponsibly? You ignorant thing...! Foolish...!]
      </p>
      <p>Crack!</p>
      <p>The jade slip starts to break under Song Jin's grip.</p>
      <p>Only then does Seo Ran hurriedly snatch it back.</p>
      <p>Song Jin glares at Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>
        [I never liked you from the start, but now my dislike has grown even
        more. The fact that your existence ruined that child's life angers me
        greatly...]
      </p>
      <p>Crack...</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, I see the ghostly body forming a new face over Song Jin's
        skull.
      </p>
      <p>Ghostly energy converges into his skull, creating a face.</p>
      <p>It’s the face of a middle-aged man I have seen before.</p>
      <p>
        Song Jin’s face, materialized from the dark ghostly substance, is
        shedding blue tears.
      </p>
      <p>[Right now, I want to kill you on the spot, but...]</p>
      <p>He glances at me and grumbles.</p>
      <p>
        [Be thankful for that unique individual sent by Seo Hweol. I'm terrified
        of dying meaninglessly, failing to protect the Nether Crossing Ship...
        So I'll leave you be for now...]
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran silently listens to his words, then suddenly bows to Song Jin.
      </p>
      <p>"Please, tell me about my mother."</p>
      <p>[What...]</p>
      <p>
        "I have lived my life despised even by the Sea Dragon Tribe, considered
        a half-breed. Even the Sea Dragon King left me behind, saying I couldn't
        accompany him in this battle of life and death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please, senior. Elder. I want to know what kind of person my mother was.
        I implore you... tell me about my mother."
      </p>
      <p>[This boy now...]</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>Dark blue ghostly energy fills the cabin.</p>
      <p>
        But I reveal my Formless Sword and disperse the ghostly energy, causing
        Song Jin to glare at me.
      </p>
      <p>"What's so difficult about telling a story?"</p>
      <p>I look into his heart essence and intent, asking.</p>
      <p>
        "It seems you really want to tell her story, but you're hesitating."
      </p>
      <p>
        Though he appears as a ghostly figure, his heart image is a clear sea
        with a red-sailed boat.
      </p>
      <p>He is clearly a good person.</p>
      <p>
        His true feelings exposed, Song Jin clenches his teeth and shiveres for
        a moment, then drops his arms.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh...</p>
      <p>The ghostly energy subsides again.</p>
      <p>[...Seo Hweol sent a fearsome man.]</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>Song Jin staggers and then sits down on a bed in the cabin.</p>
      <p>
        He’s silent for a while, and so is Seo Ran, both looking at each other.
      </p>
      <p>A moment of silence lingers in the cabin.</p>
      <p>I read Song Jin's heart and step outside the cabin.</p>
      <p>He no longer has any intention of harming Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, I hear Song Jin talking to Seo Ran inside the cabin.</p>
      <p>Initially, his voice is slow and heavy, reluctant..</p>
      <p>
        But gradually, Song Jin's speech quickens and he becomes more
        expressive.
      </p>
      <p>Seo Ran responds to him, and they begin to share stories.</p>
      <p>'...This is an unexpected sight.'</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran and Song Jin sitting side by side, engrossed in conversation.
      </p>
      <p>I ponder for a moment, lifting my Formless Sword.</p>
      <p>Once you break free from fate, more and new things approach you.</p>
      <p>Unspoken words and misunderstood connections.</p>
      <p>Meeting anew and shaping a new future.</p>
      <p>
        I glance back at the cabin once more, reading the intent flowing from
        within, and walk onto the deck of the Nether Crossing Ship.
      </p>
      <p>Black Ghost Valley's formation hidden in the Black Wind Sea.</p>
      <p>The center of the cylindrical well-shaped formation.</p>
      <p>There, an open sky is visible.</p>
      <p>Night has fallen.</p>
      <p>Stars twinkle faintly beyond the clouds.</p>
      <p>"Let's become stronger."</p>
      <p>Stronger and even more stronger.</p>
      <p>
        To grow strong enough to break free from all attractions of fate, to
        create a new future and new connections.
      </p>
      <p>That is my resolve.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Ran and Song Jin talk through the night and continue their
        conversation until the sun sets.
      </p>
      <p>And once more, they talk well through the night until dawn.</p>
      <p>Days pass like this.</p>
      <p>
        The nature of their conversation and emotional exchange is unknown to
        me.
      </p>
      <p>However.</p>
      <p>[I have decided to take this boy as my disciple.]</p>
      <p>
        Connections beyond fate sometimes give birth to miracles beyond
        imagination.
      </p>
      <p>Song Jin decided to take Seo Ran as his disciple.</p>

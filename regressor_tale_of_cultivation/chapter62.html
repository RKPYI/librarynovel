      <p>Chapter 62: Violent Storm (2)</p>
      <p>
        Having jumped from Ascension Path, it took several days to reach Byeokra
      </p>
      <p>
        Having reached the 14th Star of Qi Refining and possessing sufficient
        spiritual power, I could quickly cast spells. Perhaps due to this,
      </p>
      <p>
        Or maybe it was because I brought a lot more food from Ascension Path
        than before,
      </p>
      <p>
        Or perhaps because I didn’t waste time searching for traces of the
        Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect like last time,
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I managed to avoid the dreadful predicament of running out of
        water.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Of course, it would have been better if I had a little more water.'
      </p>
      <p>Licking my dry lips, I entered the Cheon-saek City in Byeokra.</p>
      <p>
        'Next time, after the Earth Surpassing Path, I should practice the Water
        Surpassing Path to the level of 3rd or 4th Star of Qi Refining.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I possess the Five Elements Spiritual Roots I should be able to
        master other elements as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning at least the initial part of the Water Surpassing Path will be
        helpful for crossing deserts.
      </p>
      <p>
        While purchasing basic necessities and clothing in Cheon-saek City and
        about to enter Byeokra, I was stopped.
      </p>
      <p>"Halt for a moment. Which clan’s young master are you?"</p>
      <p>A subtle pressure of spiritual power could be felt.</p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, a presence with a slightly larger consciousness than
        mine enveloped my consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh-</p>
      <p>
        The air shimmered, and a middle-aged man adorned with numerous glass
        bracelets emerged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man in white was adorned with glass ornaments all over his body,
        emitting faint spiritual energy from each.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Each one is a magic artifact... He must be wealthy to be covered in
        them.'
      </p>
      <p>I observed him cautiously, a little tense.</p>
      <p>
        Wearing magic artifacts all over meant not only wealth but also
        possessing enough spiritual power to activate them all.
      </p>
      <p>'A cultivator in the Qi Building stage..!'</p>
      <p>Maintaining my guard, I replied politely to his question.</p>
      <p>
        "I am a loose cultivator named Seo Eun-hyun. May I know the purpose of
        your inquiry, senior?"
      </p>
      <p>"A loose cultivator? Not affiliated with any clan?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, not affiliated."</p>
      <p>
        The ring-shaped glass artifact around the man’s neck turned a clear
        blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The fact that the Listening Ring turns blue means you are telling the
        truth. You’re not a spy sent by another clan to scout the Gongmyo Clan’s
        territory then…"
      </p>
      <p>'An artifact that can discern truth and lies?'</p>
      <p>
        The whirlwind of spiritual energy within the ring was dizzying just to
        look at.
      </p>
      <p>"Quite young, aren’t you? How old?"</p>
      <p>
        My physical age was about 40, considering I fell into this world at 29
        and about 10 years have passed.
      </p>
      <p>"I have reached my forties."</p>
      <p>"Hmm, you look remarkably young."</p>
      <p>
        My aging was slow due to rejuvenation and the Inner Core, so I still
        maintained the appearance of my early twenties.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, reaching the 14th Star of Qi Refining in your forties implies
        you have remarkable talent… What is your spiritual root?"
      </p>
      <p>"I possess the Five Elements Spiritual Roots."</p>
      <p>
        "Five elements...? At that age, with all five elements, you reached the
        14th Star of Qi Refining?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Qi Building cultivator in white looked at me with amazement and then
        spoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        "More talented than expected. Tempting... I am Buk Joong-ho, an external
        elder of the Gongmyo Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was once a loose cultivator too, but a former elder of the Gongmyo
        Clan recognized my talent and recommended me as an external member of
        the clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gongmyo Clan welcomes talented individuals regardless of background.
        Why not join the Gongmyo Clan?"
      </p>
      <p>"Ah..."</p>
      <p>
        It seems he approached me not only to determine if I was a spy but also
        to recruit talent.
      </p>
      <p>I relaxed my excessive tension while maintaining basic caution.</p>
      <p>
        "I am deeply honored by your offer, but unfortunately, I must decline as
        there are certain things I cannot do if I belong to a clan."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm… that's regrettable. Think about it carefully. It seems you're at
        the peak of Qi Refining. If you join our clan, you'll receive support
        for Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you reach Qi Building, you could become an external elder like
        me. If you choose to become a son-in-law of the main family, becoming an
        internal elder is also possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        You know the Gongmyo Clan is renowned for refining magic artifacts,
        correct? Join us and you'll receive high-quality artifacts for free."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Um... I am truly sorry, but I really have things to do that prevent me
        from joining a clan."
      </p>
      <p>"Huh... Well, if that's the case…"</p>
      <p>Buk Joong-ho clicked his tongue, disappointed.</p>
      <p>
        "If you ever change your mind and want to join a clan, make sure to
        visit the Gongmyo Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an external elder, my sincere dedication to Gongmyo Clan speaks
        volumes of its remarkable life, does it not?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cheongmun Clan is nothing but a battleground where one must
        constantly fight to prove themselves if their strength is unverified.
        And the Byeok Clan, they are just wallflowers - dull and foolish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to seek out Gongmyo Clan if ever you grow weary of your loose
        cultivator lifestyle!"
      </p>
      <p>"...Yes, I suppose I will."</p>
      <p>'Why is he so keen on recruiting me?'</p>
      <p>His promotion of the Gongmyo Clan was suspiciously earnest.</p>
      <p>
        After exchanging pleasantries with Buk Joong-ho, I left Cheon-saek City
        and headed towards the territory of the Cheongmun Clan. I planned to
        participate in the training conference as before and meet Cheongmun
        Ryeong.
      </p>
      <p>After all, shouldn't I see how his life is doing at least once?</p>
      <p>
        It was when I entered the registration office for the training
        conference of the Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>"Wow, what do we have here? A fresh talent!"</p>
      <p>"....!"</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a muscular giant burst out from a corner of the office.</p>
      <p>'A Qi Building cultivator...!'</p>
      <p>And I knew him.</p>
      <p>
        He was Cheongmun Ryeok-shin, a Qi Building elder. I occasionally greeted
        him during my previous life when I studied under my master.
      </p>
      <p>
        'A man who was right behind my master in the rankings of the Immortal
        Combat Meeting...!'
      </p>
      <p>
        As I was flustered, Cheongmun Ryeok-shin approached me, grabbed my
        shoulder, and exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "A Qi Refining cultivator at the extreme level, and your consciousness
        is almost comparable to Qi Building! What a tremendous talent! You, join
        the Cheongmun Clan!
      </p>
      <p>I'll support any aspirant who challenges Qi Building!"</p>
      <p>"Ah, no, I..."</p>
      <p>
        "Silence! I won't allow any defiance! Do you think talents like you are
        common?"
      </p>
      <p>'Damn it...!'</p>
      <p>
        Apparently, being a Qi Refining cultivator at 14th Star, just before Qi
        Building, was more valuable than I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, in their eyes, I was a potential elder-level talent just rolling
        around, awaiting a bit of support.
      </p>
      <p>"No thank you, I don't need it!"</p>
      <p>I hurriedly fled the registration office.</p>
      <p>
        I knew they were all aggressive except for my master and a few others,
        but I hadn't expected this level of stubbornness.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The entrance of the registration office exploded, and Cheongmun
        Ryeok-shin charged at me like a madman.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You! Why don't you obediently become a part of the Cheongmun Clan! I
        will make you my family's son-in-law!"
      </p>
      <p>"Wait, wait! I only came to meet Cheongmun Ryeong!"</p>
      <p>"What? You came to see my brother?"</p>
      <p>He paused!</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeok-shin stopped mid-air, then stroked his chin and laughed
        heartily.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, it's true my brother has much to teach! Alright! So you want to
        be his disciple!"
      </p>
      <p>"No, that's not what I..."</p>
      <p>
        "Fine! Then you're either going to be his disciple or my family's
        son-in-law!"
      </p>
      <p>My head started to hurt.</p>
      <p>'I knew he was stubborn, but...'</p>
      <p>
        When I was Cheongmun Ryeong's disciple, I hadn't seen such greed. But
        meeting me now, a 14th Star Qi Refining cultivator, seemed to bring it
        out in him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Fine! I'll arrange for you to meet him. But you can't go to any other
        clan! You'll either be my family's son-in-law or his disciple!"
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>I felt I had somehow gotten myself into trouble.</p>
      <p>Meeting Cheongmun Ryeok-shin was unexpected.</p>
      <p>But Cheongmun Ryeong was the same as before.</p>
      <p>In the territory near the main house of the Cheongmun Clan.</p>
      <p>My meeting with Cheongmun Ryeong happened again.</p>
      <p>
        "Tch, at such a young age you've reached the extreme of Qi Refining.
        With such talent, why seek me? I agreed to meet you because Ryeok-sin
        was being a nuisance, but if you have questions, ask them quickly and
        leave."
      </p>
      <p>He hadn't changed.</p>
      <p>'Even if I live several lives...'</p>
      <p>People don't change.</p>
      <p>"...I possess the Five Elements Spiritual Roots."</p>
      <p>
        I cautiously revealed my spiritual roots, and saw a flicker of surprise
        in Cheongmun Ryeong's eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Five Elements Spiritual Roots...? Someone with Five Spiritual Roots
        reaching extreme Qi Refining at this age...? No, don't talk nonsense!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of explaining, I recited my understanding of the Seventy-two
        Earthly Sha True Words.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, it wasn't through the victor's privilege of the training
        conference that I met my master.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was because Cheongmun Ryeok-shin, a Qi Building elder, had set the
        stage for me, a peak Qi Refining cultivator with potential. Thus, it
        seemed appropriate to spend a night discussing with Cheongmun Ryeong.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I spoke of my understanding and experience of the Seventy-Two Earthly
        Sha True Words, a glint of interest appeared in Cheongmun Ryeong's eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "So it is. With that level of understanding... you've carved your path
        following the method of Understanding before Breakthrough. I never
        thought there would be another like me..."
      </p>
      <p>We spent the entire day immersed in conversation.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong, too, seemed delighted to meet someone who understood
        the method of Understanding before Breakthrough as well as I did, and he
        didn't cease our discussion.
      </p>
      <p>The next day dawned.</p>
      <p>
        "...Your understanding and realization up to the 7th and 8th stars of Qi
        Refining aren’t behind me at all. Impressive. You truly are a
        once-in-a-lifetime talent."
      </p>
      <p>
        I discussed with Cheongmun Ryeong my realization from the 1st to the
        14th star of Qi Refining. My repeated experiences and insights up to the
        7th and 8th stars were, I realized, on par with Cheongmun Ryeong.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also eagerly inquired about my realization from the 9th to the 14th
        Star, and particularly about the principles and methods of transitioning
        from the 14th Star of Qi Refining to Qi Building.
      </p>
      <p>I had now become quite learned in these principles and theories.</p>
      <p>Before we knew it, morning had arrived.</p>
      <p>"Do you not wish to become my disciple?"</p>
      <p>
        Once again, Cheongmun Ryeong, having seen my level of expertise of
        Understanding before Breakthrough, seemed interested in taking me as his
        disciple.
      </p>
      <p>I replied with a gentle smile.</p>
      <p>
        "Even if one is taught for just a day, they will be a father for a
        lifetime. You are already my master."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, cut the flattery! Being a teacher for a day and whatnot, I truly
        want to take you as my real disciple. Have you really no intention of
        joining our main family?"
      </p>
      <p>I smirked bitterly and bowed to my master.</p>
      <p>
        "...I have duties unaligned with joining a clan. I'm afraid it's not
        possible."
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>My master fell silent.</p>
      <p>After a moment of silence, he sighed softly.</p>
      <p>
        "...I can't keep someone who wants to leave. Rarely do I come across
        someone as agreeable as you...
      </p>
      <p>Fine then. Go! Just go away!"</p>
      <p>I bowed to my master and left the room where we had been talking.</p>
      <p>'Farewell.'</p>
      <p>Just as I was about to leave the Cheongmun Clan's territory,</p>
      <p>Thud!</p>
      <p>
        A muscular middle-aged man. Cheongmun Ryeok-shin blocked my path with a
        stern expression.
      </p>
      <p>"Where do you think you're going?"</p>
      <p>"...Excuse me?"</p>
      <p>"I asked where you are going."</p>
      <p>
        "I was just leaving after receiving teachings and saying my goodbyes to
        Grandmaster Cheongmun Ryeong..."
      </p>
      <p>"What the...!!!"</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A powerful surge of power burst forth.</p>
      <p>
        "How dare you receive teachings from Elder Cheongmun Ryeong for a whole
        day and then try to escape without fulfilling your duties as a
        disciple!"
      </p>
      <p>"No, it's not like that..."</p>
      <p>
        "You ungrateful wretch! You dare to make light of the great Cheongmun
        Clan! I cannot allow someone as impudent as you to become Elder
        Cheongmun Ryeong’s disciple.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll match you with a suitable branch family and make you my
        son-in-law!!!"
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeok-shin's hand thrust towards me.</p>
      <p>I felt a chill run down my spine.</p>
      <p>'If he catches me, I'll be forced into marriage...!'</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>I evaded his grasp and leaped into the air.</p>
      <p>"You dare to escape!"</p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>Clods of earth rose from the ground and flew towards me.</p>
      <p>Each clump transformed into hands trying to grasp me.</p>
      <p>I immediately extended my Gang Sphere from my hand.</p>
      <p>Bang! Crack, crackle!</p>
      <p>
        The shining sphere revolved around me, bursting all the earth hands
        attempting to capture me.
      </p>
      <p>Vroom!</p>
      <p>I linked the Gang Sphere, accelerating my thoughts.</p>
      <p>Zoom!</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, I swiftly rushed through the air, heading out of the
        territory.
      </p>
      <p>I could sense Cheongmun Ryeok-shin's bafflement behind me.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeok-shin stood with a dumbfounded expression, watching the
        direction Seo Eun-hyun had escaped.
      </p>
      <p>'Escaped from the hands of a Qi Building cultivator...?'</p>
      <p>
        Among cultivators in the Qi Refining stage, even a single star
        difference had a significant disparity in power.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the gap between Qi Refining and Qi Building stages is
        incomparable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young Seo who just fled, even if he was at the peak of Qi Refining,
        shouldn’t be able to match a mid-level Qi Building cultivator from
        Cheongmun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, his plan was to have the young man captured by Cheongmun's
        special technique and forcibly married to one of his descendants.
      </p>
      <p>But he broke the spell and escaped?</p>
      <p>A mere peak Qi Refining youngster?</p>
      <p>"...Qi Building..."</p>
      <p>A twisted smile spread across Cheongmun Ryeok-shin's lips.</p>
      <p>"He's immediately a Qi Building level combatant...!"</p>
      <p>
        Many elders above the Nascent Soul stage, considered usable talents,
        ascended to the higher realms, depleting the continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The disappearance of strong cultivators above the Core Formation realm
        had already thrown the four directions into chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such times, a peak Qi Refining talent with the potential to reach the
        Qi Building stage was a rare treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further amongst them, one who could somewhat stand against a Qi Building
        cultivator, despite being only at Qi Refining...
      </p>
      <p>
        "He's a big catch! Ha-ha! I'll force-feed him a potion and marry him off
        to my descendant!"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeok-shin's eyes went wild.</p>
      <p>
        He took out a transmission device and sent a message to some Qi Building
        elders nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, he entered a house in the estate where Cheongmun Ryeong was
        located, where Seo Eun-hyun had his discussion.
      </p>
      <p>"Ryeong Hyun-nim! Why didn't you capture such a talent?"</p>
      <p>"He said he had things to do, what could I do?"</p>
      <p>
        "Hyung-nim, that's frustrating! That guy brushed off my attack and ran
        away!"
      </p>
      <p>"What?"</p>
      <p>
        "Don't you get it!? That kid could easily fulfill the role of a Qi
        Building elder if we bring him in!
      </p>
      <p>
        Hyung-nim, it looks like you like that kid too. Why didn't you catch
        him!? Be honest with yourself, Hyung-nim. Weren't you looking for
        someone who could understand your knowledge?"
      </p>
      <p>"......"</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeok-shin continued.</p>
      <p>
        "Catching him aligns with the clan head's order to nurture talents in
        preparation for the upcoming chaotic political situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also means, Hyung-nim, you could find a disciple to inherit your
        lifelong wish!!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is frustrating! How long will you just wait! It's what you've
        always wanted, Hyung-nim, why sit and hesitate? Be honest!"
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong remained silent for a moment.</p>
      <p>Then he looked up, meeting Cheongmun Ryeok-shin's eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeok-shin flinched at the intense desire in Ryeong’s eyes.
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, you're right."</p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeong stood up.</p>
      <p>
        "It aligns with the clan head's order, and I should be more honest with
        myself..."
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun Ryeok-shin felt a tremendous spiritual pressure.</p>
      <p>'It's been a while since I've seen Hyung-nim like this.'</p>
      <p>The towering figure of the Cheongmun Clan rose.</p>
      <p>
        "This is the first kid who understands precious knowledge in this
        muscle-headed clan. Yes... I must catch him now...!"
      </p>
      <p>His eyes flashed with a green light.</p>
      <p>
        I kicked off the air and reached the edge of the Cheongmun Clan's
        territory.
      </p>
      <p>Ahead was the clan's protective barrier.</p>
      <p>I extended my consciousness.</p>
      <p>A star of light emitted from my hand.</p>
      <p>Then.</p>
      <p>"Is this the guy Ryeok-shin told us to catch?"</p>
      <p>A Qi Building elder flew towards me.</p>
      <p>As he formed hand seals, the clan's barrier strengthened.</p>
      <p>"Just surrender..."</p>
      <p>Kuuaaang!</p>
      <p>
        Ignoring the elder's words, I sent a Gang Sphere towards the barrier.
      </p>
      <p>A tremendous explosion echoed, and a hole appeared in the barrier.</p>
      <p>"What...!"</p>
      <p>
        The Qi Building elder was shocked, and I quickly passed through the
        barrier, escaping the territory.
      </p>
      <p>However, I suddenly felt a chill.</p>
      <p>Behind me, two immense spiritual pressures were chasing me.</p>
      <p>'Master!?'</p>
      <p>Master and Cheongmun Ryeok-shin were rapidly following me.</p>
      <p>"Stop, you!"</p>
      <p>"When caught, you'll be married off to my descendant!"</p>
      <p>"What nonsense! He’s to marry my descendant!"</p>
      <p>"Whatever! The first to catch him decides who he marries!</p>
      <p>He won't escape becoming a member of our family!"</p>
      <p>'What madness... Why!'</p>
      <p>I accelerated my mental capabilities and kicked off the air again.</p>
      <p>
        In an instant, I widened the gap between us, but as they took to the
        skies, they closed in again.
      </p>
      <p>'I must escape to Yanguo!'</p>
      <p>
        Once I cross the Yanguo border, Qi Building cultivators can't follow!
      </p>
      <p>I frantically headed east, kicking through the air.</p>
      <p>
        Behind me, a tremendous wooden attribute spiritual power whirled, and a
        giant wooden figure formed in the air, chasing me.
      </p>
      <p>"You can't escape!"</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Huge restraining spells shot from the wooden figure.</p>
      <p>'I can't be caught!'</p>
      <p>
        I released a Gang Sphere. Summoned from the world of intent, a clone
        identical to me appeared, releasing intent.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The Gang Qi I infused into the Gang Sphere emerged, forming thousands of
        Sword Gang in the air.
      </p>
      <p>Cheongmun and my master watched in awe.</p>
      <p>"Is this the technique of Externalizing Spirit?"</p>
      <p>Boom, bang, boom!</p>
      <p>
        The Sword Gang from the Gang Sphere clashed with the restraining spells,
        neutralizing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "My desire grows even stronger. What kind of technique has he mastered?"
      </p>
      <p>"No time to wonder, Hyung-nim! He's getting away!"</p>
      <p>
        The surrounding earth gathered around Cheongmun Ryeok-shin, covering his
        body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon after, a giant earthen figure, identical to Cheongmun Ryeok-shin,
        stepped onto the earth.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        With a powerful slap, dozens of gigantic earthen hands emerged from the
        ground, reaching towards me.
      </p>
      <p>"Just get caught and marry!"</p>
      <p>"Damn it, I have things to do!"</p>
      <p>
        I fired Gang Qi in all directions, but it couldn't scratch the Qi
        Building level spells..
      </p>
      <p>The earth hands soon formed a prison, trapping me.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>But I had already regenerated another Gang Sphere.</p>
      <p>The light swirled, creating an exit for me.</p>
      <p>I accelerated my thoughts.</p>
      <p>
        Dodging another set of wooden restraining spells, I quickly headed east.
      </p>
      <p>The pursuit by Cheongmun Clan elders continued for days.</p>
      <p>
        Several other elders, summoned by Cheongmun Ryeok-shin, joined the
        chase, bombarding me with spells as I fled.
      </p>
      <p>On the fourth day of fleeing, I felt a strange sensation.</p>
      <p>How many times have I used Gang Sphere?</p>
      <p>
        Had I ever relied on it so desperately since reaching the Ultimate
        Pinnacle?
      </p>
      <p>
        I floated the Gang Sphere above my hand, sensing something I hadn't
        understood before.
      </p>
      <p>
        'The Gang Sphere has always reacted to the principle of Three Talents.'
      </p>
      <p>Why was that?</p>
      <p>An unknown reason then, but it seems clear now.</p>
      <p>Another self resides within the Gang Sphere.</p>
      <p>In a way, the Gang Sphere is a person.</p>
      <p>But a person isn't made up of themselves alone.</p>
      <p>Born and living under the grace of Heaven and Earth.</p>
      <p>
        A person is formed through countless connections, perhaps even including
        Heaven and Earth.
      </p>
      <p>This realization came during the pursuit by my master.</p>
      <p>
        If a master's grace is like Heaven and Earth, then Heaven and Earth have
        given me something as significant.
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps.</p>
      <p>
        If the many connections I've formed have made me who I am, then what
        Heaven and Earth have given is also part of me.
      </p>
      <p>The light on my hand vibrated.</p>
      <p>
        Centering on myself, I divided the light into Yin and Yang, Heaven and
        Earth.
      </p>
      <p>The cycle of Heaven and Earth began around the person.</p>
      <p>'So that's it...'</p>
      <p>Finally, I glimpsed a path further into the Ultimate Pinnacle.</p>
      <p>The Gang Sphere split into two.</p>
      <p>
        With a burst of energy, I launched both Gang Spheres to either side,
        erasing numerous spells in one fell swoop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raising two more spheres, I realized many more possibilities opened up.
      </p>
      <p>"Accelerate, threefold!"</p>
      <p>
        A multitude of spiritual wooden roots covered the sky and earth,
        transforming into a prison trying to capture me.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I delved into that fleeting instant, escaping through a tiny
        gap just before the prison solidified.
      </p>
      <p>"This kid...!"</p>
      <p>"He's gotten faster!"</p>
      <p>Now, the border of Yanguo was within reach.</p>
      <p>
        I descended to the ground, knelt, and deeply bowed towards Cheongmun
        Ryeong.
      </p>
      <p>I had gained this enlightenment through my master's heart.</p>
      <p>I hadn't formed as deep a connection as in my past life.</p>
      <p>This person is not the same as that person.</p>
      <p>Yet, even so.</p>
      <p>'I will not forget your kindness.'</p>
      <p>Since my master's grace was as great as Heaven and Earth.</p>
      <p>I could understand a bit about Heaven and Earth.</p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>And,</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry. I cannot marry or be bound to a clan."</p>
      <p>What happens if I marry and have children?</p>
      <p>What becomes of my mind if they disappear with regression?</p>
      <p>I dreaded to even imagine.</p>
      <p>
        Additionally, being bound to a clan, especially since I demonstrated my
        strength, would mean being treated as an elder and prevented from
        traveling to other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I need to visit Yanguo, go to Shengzi to seek traces of the Golden
        Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, and learn demon beast methods in the Black
        Wind Sea. Being tied to the Cheongmun Clan will be difficult for me.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you for your concern. I am truly grateful!"</p>
      <p>After the final farewell.</p>
      <p>
        I quickly crossed the border of Yanguo, leaving behind the myriad spells
        that pursued me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Ryeong seemed to adjust the flow of dragon veins, but only to
        an extent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once inside Yanguo, the Dragon Veins no longer shifted, and the
        Cheongmun elders ceased their pursuit.
      </p>
      <p>"That was intense. I almost got caught."</p>
      <p>
        I let out a small sigh and recomposed myself after crossing a few more
        mountains.
      </p>
      <p>I felt strange.</p>
      <p>
        Those who had not paid much attention to me before changed their
        reactions so dramatically once I reached the peak of Qi Refining.
      </p>
      <p>'My stomach feels queasy...'</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it was land sickness from having floated in the air for so long
        and then suddenly walking on stable ground.
      </p>
      <p>I feel strange and queasy.</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, looking at the ground, I realized tears were flowing from my
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah..."</p>
      <p>That's it.</p>
      <p>I understood why I felt strange, why I am queasy.</p>
      <p>I wanted to be caught.</p>
      <p>I know the Cheongmun Clan is a good clan.</p>
      <p>I know the elders who tried to capture me fiercely are good people.</p>
      <p>
        Cheongmun Clan, known for its strength and pride, is also a place I know
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe I could have married there, become a son-in-law, and receive
        teachings from my master. Interact with the elders and live happily.
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, I wanted that.</p>
      <p>"But then what?"</p>
      <p>Everything disappears.</p>
      <p>Everything becomes nothing, forgotten.</p>
      <p>
        Even now, seeing my master and disciples again, I keenly feel how
        different it is from my previous life's connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were to blend in, have children, and immerse myself in those
        connections.
      </p>
      <p>What kind of pain would I have to endure?</p>
      <p>From the enlightenment I just gained, I know.</p>
      <p>Humans are not made up solely of themselves.</p>
      <p>A being is formed within the connections of Man, Heaven, and Earth.</p>
      <p>Yet, if all those connections eventually crumble and disappear,</p>
      <p>What meaning does that being's life have?</p>
      <p>"Farewell."</p>
      <p>
        Swallowing this queasy feeling, I bow again in the direction of my
        master.
      </p>
      <p>Someday.</p>
      <p>In the far, far future.</p>
      <p>After I get to live a real life, I will greet you again.</p>
      <p>I went to find Kim Young-hoon.</p>

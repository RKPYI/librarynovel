      <p>Chapter 153: Azure Heaven Creation Sect (4)</p>
      <p>Red lines stretch out from all sides, enveloping the surroundings.</p>
      <p>Seven from the rear.</p>
      <p>Three from the front.</p>
      <p>Two red lines from each side.</p>
      <p>The only empty spaces are above in the sky and below the ground.</p>
      <p>
        However, going below ground would be no different than voluntarily
        entering the training hall to be trapped.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the sky, even if there are no intents targeting there right now,
        it’s too easy to be targeted by others.
      </p>
      <p>'Then…'</p>
      <p>
        I decide to charge towards the senior brother rushing at me from the
        rear.
      </p>
      <p>Seven intents target my limbs.</p>
      <p>
        From the fighting spirit emanating beyond their intent, it's clear
        they're willing to break my limbs if necessary to capture me for the
        training hall.
      </p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>The first touch aims for my shoulder.</p>
      <p>Allowing it would dislocate my shoulder.</p>
      <p>
        I bend my waist slightly to dodge the hand, then place my hand under the
        senior's arm and slightly change direction.
      </p>
      <p>Wobble!</p>
      <p>"…!"</p>
      <p>
        As I change direction, he feels the force he was about to exert on me
        shift to one side, causing him to stagger.
      </p>
      <p>In that moment, the intent wildly fluctuates.</p>
      <p>Taatt!</p>
      <p>
        I manage to pass through the gaps of the trembling intent, initially
        escaping the encirclement of the seniors.
      </p>
      <p>'This isn't the end.'</p>
      <p>
        Though I've escaped the encirclement, there's still a long way before
        freedom.
      </p>
      <p>'The only way to escape the training hall in one go is…'</p>
      <p>I roll my eyes, looking far off at a cliff.</p>
      <p>
        If I fall off the cliff next to the training hall, they won't pursue
        further.
      </p>
      <p>'Twenty steps to the cliff.'</p>
      <p>I can make it!</p>
      <p>Taatt!</p>
      <p>I hurriedly speed up my steps toward the cliff.</p>
      <p>
        But, as expected, the seniors of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect posses
        tremendous speed.
      </p>
      <p>Pababat!</p>
      <p>They quickly catch up to me.</p>
      <p>
        Purely due to their high physical capabilities, they don't even need
        movement techniques or lightness skills.
      </p>
      <p>"Stop right there!"</p>
      <p>"Where do you think you're running off to"</p>
      <p>Dududududu!</p>
      <p>Chilling footsteps sound from behind.</p>
      <p>
        Half a dozen muscular giants, regardless of gender, chase me as if
        they’re starved dogs given a bone.
      </p>
      <p>"He’s heading for the cliff! Catch him!"</p>
      <p>A muscular, bald senior sister shouts as she chases after me.</p>
      <p>Chaak!</p>
      <p>
        Two of the senior brothers reach out simultaneously towards my
        shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>Reading their intent, I duck and dodge their hands.</p>
      <p>Paatt!</p>
      <p>From beneath the ground, red lines rise towards my legs.</p>
      <p>
        In a crouched position, I kick off the ground, propelling myself
        forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spot I kicked off from sprouts a pair of hands that grab at the air.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        From above, like a meteor falling, the muscular, half-bald senior sister
        descends upon me.
      </p>
      <p>Taat, tat!</p>
      <p>I deftly step aside, avoiding her landing spot.</p>
      <p>Kwaang!</p>
      <p>She lands where I was, extending her fingers towards me.</p>
      <p>
        Her log-like fingers scratch wildly at where I previously was, and
        finding no response, she propels herself towards my new location.
      </p>
      <p>Kuang!</p>
      <p>
        I twist half a step to avoid her, then using a lightness technique, I
        shake her off and again dash towards the cliff.
      </p>
      <p>Only eight steps to the cliff!</p>
      <p>"Our fresh recruit is running away!"</p>
      <p>"Catch him!"</p>
      <p>'I can definitely escape!'</p>
      <p>I smirk and begin to step even faster.</p>
      <p>But then.</p>
      <p>Pababat!</p>
      <p>From beneath the ground, dozens of red lines burst into the air.</p>
      <p>'Damn…'</p>
      <p>Phuk, phuk, phuk!</p>
      <p>
        And from beneath the ground, several Four-Cloud and Three-Cloud
        disciples reveal themselves.
      </p>
      <p>"Where do you think you're escaping...!?"</p>
      <p>"We can't be the only ones suffering..!"</p>
      <p>A total of 16 seniors stand in my way.</p>
      <p>Countless lines of intent densely fill the space ahead.</p>
      <p>There's seemingly no way forward.</p>
      <p>But in this world of intent, I close my eyes.</p>
      <p>Dozens, hundreds of intents obscure my vision.</p>
      <p>
        It's impossible to dodge all these attacks and without Formless Sword or
        Gang Sphere, counterattacking is difficult.
      </p>
      <p>If so,</p>
      <p>'I'll use it to my advantage.'</p>
      <p>Ta-att!</p>
      <p>
        Using a lightness technique, I deflect one of the reaching hands towards
        me, utilizing the initial stance of Echoing Valley to redirect it
        towards another senior.
      </p>
      <p>“Kugh!”</p>
      <p>Buuung, bung bung!</p>
      <p>Several fists and kicks aim for me.</p>
      <p>
        I use the force of a leg kicking towards me and throw it back at a
        senior rushing from behind, catch a fist coming from the side, and
        redirect it towards another senior extending his leg from the front.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading dozens of intents and deflecting hundreds of attacks towards
        other targets, I dodge numerous hands and finally break through the
        throng of senior brothers and sisters.
      </p>
      <p>Paaatt!</p>
      <p>And then, I leap down the cliff.</p>
      <p>'Finally, I've escaped!'</p>
      <p>Just as I’m about to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p>“…!”</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>From the cliff, a giant hand made of dirt reaches out towards me.</p>
      <p>"This dogsh-"</p>
      <p>I forgot in my rush that these people are originally cultivators..</p>
      <p>But my panic is only momentary.</p>
      <p>
        Quickly analyzing the situation, I position my body in mid-air as I see
        the dirt hand reaching for me.
      </p>
      <p>And.</p>
      <p>Thwook!</p>
      <p>Just as the hand almost touches my feet,</p>
      <p>'Now!'</p>
      <p>
        With gleaming eyes, I use the force of the hand to leap even further
        away.
      </p>
      <p>Paaang!</p>
      <p>In an instant, the peaks of the training hall recedes from view.</p>
      <p>
        The seniors of the Earth Body Training Hall watch me escape with regret,
        smacking their lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a flash, the peaks of the Wooden Hall, Water Hall, and Metal Hall
        pass before my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>“…Huh?”</p>
      <p>I feel an ominous sensation and look back.</p>
      <p>
        I used the force from the dirt hand to leap further, but somehow that
        caused me to head towards the…
      </p>
      <p>'Fi-Fire Training Hall!'</p>
      <p>
        After quickly realizing my ominous fate, I desperately try to change
        direction, but it’s too late.
      </p>
      <p>Huarurururu!</p>
      <p>
        A giant flame dragon opens its mouth, engulfing me as I fly through the
        air.
      </p>
      <p>Kwarrr!</p>
      <p>
        Caught in the mouth of the flame dragon, I fall somewhere, feeling
        intense heat around me.
      </p>
      <p>'….God damn it'</p>
      <p>Escaping the tiger's den only to enter a bear's cave.</p>
      <p>
        "Haha, newbie. Flying through the air to our Fire Path Body Training
        Hall, is that a declaration of intent to practice the Fire Path Enduring
        Origin Scripture?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hey, wait. Have we tested this newbie's spiritual root? If it's not a
        Fire Spiritual Root, we should politely transfer him to another training
        hall!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Huahaha, I immediately did with my flame dragon spell. This kid is
        definitely a Fire Spiritual Root!"
      </p>
      <p>Huarururu!</p>
      <p>
        The flame dragon that caught me transforms into chains of fire, binding
        me tightly.
      </p>
      <p>Thump, thump, thump, thump!</p>
      <p>
        Around me, several seniors of the Fire Path Body Training Hall with
        their bodies glowing red-hot, encircle me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "…I think I've come to the wrong place, could you let me go, please...?"
      </p>
      <p>"Haha. Everyone, add another log, we've got a newbie!"</p>
      <p>My plea goes unheeded, and I'm tied tightly to a stake.</p>
      <p>
        "Now, I'll teach you the intricacies of the Fire Path Enduring Origin
        Scripture, so listen well."
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, I already understand."</p>
      <p>"Oh, you do? That's good. Lads, cook the newbie!"</p>
      <p>And then, the pile of firewood below me is ignited.</p>
      <p>
        "Newbie, if you use the Fire Path Enduring Origin Scripture properly,
        you'll have no problems. Give it a try."
      </p>
      <p>I’m engulfed in flames.</p>
      <p>Huarurururu!</p>
      <p>
        Engulfed in flames, I grit my teeth and forcefully operate the Fire Path
        Enduring Origin Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though it feels like I’m turning to ash, operating the Fire Path
        Enduring Origin Scripture somehow prevents me from dying.
      </p>
      <p>'It hurts.'</p>
      <p>Excruciatingly so.</p>
      <p>It feels like I’m turning into smoked bacon.</p>
      <p>But within these flames, I sense something.</p>
      <p>'Ah, I see...'</p>
      <p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...</p>
      <p>
        In my past life trapped in 'General Seo' for a thousand years, I haven't
        felt this sensation for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>Pain.</p>
      <p>Feeling pain, I realize something.</p>
      <p>'It hurts. But... being in pain means.'</p>
      <p>I'm 'alive'.</p>
      <p>'Yes, I am...'</p>
      <p>Alive!</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>"Hooo…"</p>
      <p>
        I absorb the flames in accordance with the secret method of the Fire
        Path Enduring Origin Scripture, grinning amidst the blazing fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I made a big fuss over nothing after being spared from physical pain
        for too long.’
      </p>
      <p>The visual effect was so astonishing that I panicked prematurely.</p>
      <p>But, is there truly nothing more agonizing than this pain?</p>
      <p>‘Of course not.’</p>
      <p>
        In the midst of flames and suffering, I realize something far more
        tormenting than pain.
      </p>
      <p>Death.</p>
      <p>
        To close one's eyes in powerlessness and misery, having achieved nothing
        and saved no one.
      </p>
      <p>Isn't that truly more agonizing?</p>
      <p>Sizzle…</p>
      <p>Within the scorching heat, I find my calm.</p>
      <p>‘Regardless, I can become stronger.’</p>
      <p>
        With this kind of training, it should help me amass enough strength so
        as not to die powerlessly anymore.
      </p>
      <p>‘What have I been doing until now…’</p>
      <p>This isn’t the time to be complaining.</p>
      <p>Kim Yeon is suffering under the tyranny of the insane Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>
        Jeon Myeong-hoon and the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect is doomed
        to be annihilated by a True Immortal in a few decades.
      </p>
      <p>Who knows what Seo Hweol will do to Oh Hye-seo.</p>
      <p>Kang Min-hee will go mad and destroy the entire Black Ghost Valley.</p>
      <p>
        Azure Tiger Saint is going to eventually die and Oh Hyun-seok will
        become crippled after that.
      </p>
      <p>To save everyone.</p>
      <p>Or at the very least, to find out why and what is happening.</p>
      <p>‘I shouldn't be sitting here moping around, Seo Eun-hyun!’</p>
      <p>
        In the midst of searing pain, I face my seniors looking on with
        satisfaction with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>"Senior brothers, senior sisters, seniors...!"</p>
      <p>It hurts.</p>
      <p>
        But now, in the midst of burning pain, I finally know what I need to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is this all!? I had some expectations hearing that the Fire Path Body
        Training Hall is a thrilling place, but this is so lukewarm I can't even
        tell if the fire has been lit or not!"
      </p>
      <p>The veins on the seniors’ faces who were stoking the fire bulged.</p>
      <p>
        "I'm going to catch a cold from the chill! Make it hotter! This junior
        is catching a cold!”
      </p>
      <p>"…Ha, haha…."</p>
      <p>
        At my words, the faces of the three or four seniors who tensed up began
        to laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hahahaha! Alright, we've got quite the character here! Alright, newbie!
        We'll do as you say! We can't have our adorable junior catching a cold!
        You guys, bring some lava over here!"
      </p>
      <p>I laugh as I’m turning into charcoal.</p>
      <p>
        Yes, it hasn't been long since I returned to being human from a puppet.
      </p>
      <p>I’ve been too dramatic.</p>
      <p>Today, I've regained my senses.</p>
      <p>The time for pretense is over.</p>
      <p>Let's become stronger!</p>
      <p>Even more so!</p>
      <p>From a certain day onward.</p>
      <p>
        Rumors started circulating in the Azure Heaven Creation Sect's Five
        Elements Body Training Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hey, have you heard the rumor? If you go to the Fire Path Body Training
        Hall early in the day, there's a newbie tied up burning since dawn."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, really?"</p>
      <p>
        "But listen, what's scary is that if you go to the Metal Path Body
        Training Hall around the morning, you can see a newbie, who looks
        exactly like the one burning at dawn, being ripped apart there."
      </p>
      <p>"Wow, a hardworking newcomer, isn't it?"</p>
      <p>
        "No, the story's not over yet. I was just passing by the Water Path Body
        Training Hall after lunch, and I saw the guy who was in the Metal Path
        Body Training Hall in the morning diving into the deepest part of the
        Water Path Body Training Hall.""
      </p>
      <p>"Wow... Three different training halls...? Is that even possible?"</p>
      <p>
        "That's what I'm saying. But what's even scarier is that, while going up
        after dinner, I saw a newbie who looked exactly like that guy, receiving
        impact training in the Wood Path Body Training Hall."
      </p>
      <p>"Wow...? You must’ve been mistaken, right?"</p>
      <p>
        "How could that be? And I don't know if they saw this wrong, but one of
        the juniors passing by the Earth Path Body Training Hall at midnight
        said he saw a newbie, looking exactly like the one I saw, coming out
        from under the Earth Path Body Training Hall..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that quintuplets joined the Azure Heaven Creation Sect at
        the same time?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "If that were the case, it’d be an interesting rumor, but no such rumor
        exists. In other words…."
      </p>
      <p>"They’re all the same person?"</p>
      <p>The two burly men gaped in amazement.</p>
      <p>
        "Training in all Five Elements Body Training Halls? What kind of absurd
        rumor is that?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's what I'm saying. Usually, mastering only one of the Five
        Elements Enduring Origin Scripture and moving on to the Starlight
        Protecting Void Body is the norm for most..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Does that mean, then, this newbie possesses the Five Elements Spiritual
        Roots?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It appears so. Being a possessor of the Five Elements Spiritual Roots,
        he seems to be attempting to master all five methods of the Five
        Elements Enduring Origin Scripture."
      </p>
      <p>"…That's insane."</p>
      <p>
        "If he masters all five methods of the Five Elements Enduring Origin
        Scripture, he would literally gain tremendous resistance against the
        Five Elements themselves... Wait, hold on!"
      </p>
      <p>One of the burly men pointed somewhere.</p>
      <p>"There, that’s the newbie!"</p>
      <p>"Oh, that’s the newbie?"</p>
      <p>
        With curious expressions, the two men looked at a man who had been
        climbing the mountain path since dawn.
      </p>
      <p>
        I glanced at the two senior brothers discussing me from afar, took a
        deep breath, and continued my ascent to the Five Elements Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s been about 3 months since I started my formal training at the Five
        Elements Hall.
      </p>
      <p>Nine months since my return.</p>
      <p>
        I’d been training with the insane methods of the Five Elements Hall and
        the vast heaven and earth spiritual energy of the Bright Cold Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, I’ve been training on the best spiritual veins of Azure Cold
        Island, a place in the Bright Cold Realm where the spiritual veins
        converge, and I’ve already reached the extreme stage of Qi Gathering.
      </p>
      <p>‘Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation is completed.’</p>
      <p>Sigh...</p>
      <p>
        As I exhaled, spiritual clouds of five colors circled around me before
        flowing back into my body.
      </p>
      <p>
        After mastering Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation, I’ve been also
        diligently training in the Five Elements Enduring Origin Scripture at
        the Five Elements Hall.
      </p>
      <p>Crack, crack...</p>
      <p>I clench and unclench my fist.</p>
      <p>
        Compared to three months ago, my body has become significantly stronger
        and more robust.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of physical strength alone, my body is comparable to a Qi
        Building cultivator's body filled with Gang Qi, even though I’m still at
        the Qi Gathering stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If I combine the Qi Refining method mastered through Understanding
        before Breakthrough, a Qi Building cultivator’s body, and the state of
        Five Energies Converging to the Origin…’
      </p>
      <p>
        Even at my current Qi Gathering cultivation, I feel like I can compete
        with a mid-stage Qi Building cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘No, with the Mad Lord's techniques to neutralize the opponent's magic
        artifacts…’
      </p>
      <p>
        My actual combat power can reach the level of late-stage Qi Building
        even without including puppets.
      </p>
      <p>Crack, crack...</p>
      <p>I clench and unclench my fist again, organizing my thoughts.</p>
      <p>"Not enough."</p>
      <p>But I’m not satisfied.</p>
      <p>I’m still only at the Qi Building stage in terms of power.</p>
      <p>Certainly, my growth rate isn't slow.</p>
      <p>
        A body harmonized with the Five Energies Converging to the Origin
        assimilates the strengthening of the body swiftly.
      </p>
      <p>
        My body after complete transformation is very compatible with the body
        refining methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the seniors of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect were surprised by my
        remarkable growth.
      </p>
      <p>"But, it's not enough!"</p>
      <p>I clench my fist tighter and look up at the Five Elements Hall.</p>
      <p>‘Faster... I must reach higher.’</p>
      <p>At this rate, I can't save anyone yet.</p>
      <p>
        With a firm resolve, I continue my ascent to the Five Elements Hall.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        That day, I also practiced swordsmanship in the depths of the Water
        Training Hall, holding my breath in a place with dense water pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        To not forget the basics, I must continuously imprint them on my body!
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>The water pressure crushes my whole body.</p>
      <p>‘Not enough.’</p>
      <p>
        While practicing Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, I continuously analyze
        the Qi Building methods I will cultivate in the future with the
        experience of Understanding before Breakthrough.
      </p>
      <p>‘It’s not enough!’</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        In that state, I also train the Mad Lord’s Wonderfully Mysterious Innate
        Heart Canon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally, training in multiple techniques at once can lead to demonic
        possession due to confusion and lost focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mental demons can appear, or the circulation of vital force and blood
        can become entangled and explode.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, blood rushes to my head, causing a throbbing pain.</p>
      <p>
        A surge of anger wells up, and a violent desire to smash everything in
        sight writhes within me.
      </p>
      <p>Symptoms of demonic possession.</p>
      <p>However, I resolve the possession quite simply.</p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>I raise my fist and punch my own face.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Blood rushes to my head, and the about-to-explode energy and blood burst
        forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The air that filled my lungs expel completely and rises upwards as
        bubbles.
      </p>
      <p>Gurgle, gurgle...</p>
      <p>Demonic possession? Mental demons?</p>
      <p>
        Such nuisances are only distractions that arise from having too much
        idle thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        When life hangs in a balance to such an extent that one can't afford
        such distractions, naturally, those foolish thoughts scatter.
      </p>
      <p>Gurgle, gurgle...</p>
      <p>I exhale in the water pressure, sending out a distress signal.</p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        A green spiritual energy swims towards me, grabs my body, and pulls me
        up to the surface of the water.
      </p>
      <p>A while later.</p>
      <p>"Puhah!"</p>
      <p>I gasp for the sweet air, regaining my consciousness.</p>
      <p>Wo-woong!</p>
      <p>
        One of the senior brothers with a Wooden Spiritual Root places his hand
        on my head, healing my injuries.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, senior brother. Thank you."</p>
      <p>
        "Well… it's good to be diligent, but aren't you pushing yourself too
        hard lately?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Such words coming from the mouth of a fearsome senior brother of the
        Five Elements Hall meant that I was indeed training like a madman.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Rushing things too much can lead to trouble. You should pace yourself."
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a surprisingly warm advice coming from someone who would throw
        his juniors into water with stones tied to their feet.
      </p>
      <p>I nod and acknowledge his advice for now.</p>
      <p>"Alright, the healing is done."</p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>
        After expressing my gratitude, I immediately dive back into the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see the senior brother making a slightly queasy face above the water
        surface.
      </p>
      <p>After glancing at his expression, I descend towards the deep abyss.</p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>
        Utilizing Water Surpassing Path to Cultivation, I manage to breathe for
        a moment underwater by manipulating the spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>"Hoo..."</p>
      <p>
        It might seem funny to breathe underwater, but surprisingly, those who
        learned water-based methods can do such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it doesn't help with lung capacity training and I tend to avoid
        it.
      </p>
      <p>I form a hand seal and speak.</p>
      <p>"Storage Scroll, open."</p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>
        The scroll tied to my waist rises in the water and unfolds beside me.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scroll, obtained from the elder of the West Spirit Gate last time,
        was a kind of storage magic artifact commonly known as a ‘storage
        scroll.’
      </p>
      <p>
        I take out a jade tablet from the Storage Scroll that I snatched from
        the elder.
      </p>
      <p>
        The jade table has a method inscribed in the language of the Bright Cold
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The method's name is "Three Spirits Technique," which allows one to
        create three avatars of oneself to be stored in a safe place. If the
        main body is in danger and loses their cultivation or body, the avatars
        can be used to regain the cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a suitable method for cultivators above the Nascent Soul stage who
        frequently lose their physical bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A notable feature is that creating more than three avatars will
        gradually reduce the cultivation of the avatars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, trying to recover cultivation through a weaker avatar can
        pose problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, if only one avatar is created instead of three or more, its
        power will be as formidable as the main body itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘In short, it's a technique that serves both as insurance for one's life
        and future cultivation in case of loss, and also allows for using the
        avatar as an offensive tool.’
      </p>
      <p>It seems quite useful.</p>
      <p>As I’m reading the Three Spirits Technique again,</p>
      <p>‘Wait a moment.’</p>
      <p>
        After looking at the formula of the Three Spirits Technique, I use
        spiritual energy to inscribe the formula of the Devil Legion Terracotta
        Scroll in the water.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I hastily compare the formulas of the two methods.</p>
      <p>"...Wait, these methods..."</p>
      <p>I read both formulas simultaneously, realizing something.</p>
      <p>=+=</p>

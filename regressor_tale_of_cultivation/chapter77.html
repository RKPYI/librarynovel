      <p>Chapter 77: Fate (2)</p>
      <p>Mad Lord began his explanation.</p>
      <p>
        [As the most basic example, from the moment a human is born, they are
        continuously drawn towards 'death,' which is the force of attraction of
        their fate.]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord draws two points in the air and connects them with a line.</p>
      <p>
        [This is the basic structure of life. It starts here and ends there. The
        slight differences in each being's lifespan introduces changes in fate.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord draws several more lines above and below the line connecting
        the two points.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Let's say this line represents life. The endings of other lives,
        represented by these different lines, influence it. Since fate has a
        force of attraction, it pulls slightly towards where other fates end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, fate is not a smooth, straight line from life to death, but
        becomes chaotic, influenced by the fates of other beings.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The original line becomes uneven, adjusting to the endpoints of the
        other lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        [We call this the play of fate or connections. These connections and
        fate determine our lives, and what is meant to happen, will inevitably
        happen.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "...So, the saying that what is meant to happen will happen means..."
      </p>
      <p>
        [Let's assume there's a close friend. That friend has a different
        lifespan and fate than me, meeting the fate of death earlier than me.
        That fate is closely attached to me and also has a force of attraction,
        so I inevitably get involved in the friend's death.
      </p>
      <p>This is why what is meant to happen will 'definitely' happen.]</p>
      <p>
        "So, does this mean that events unrelated to death are also fated to
        happen?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [No, there are no events in this world that are not related to birth and
        death. Do you know how many lives are born and die in the air we
        breathe, even in a single moment? I may have explained fate using simple
        lines, but the cycle of birth and death in fate is so complex and
        endless that it can never be simply expressed.]
      </p>
      <p>"I see..."</p>
      <p>
        [As all beings, in the cycle of birth and death, carry life, it can be
        said that every event ultimately has a force of attraction.]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord erases the lines in the air and randomly dots points.</p>
      <p>
        [Following these forces of attraction in life, every being embarks on a
        long and short journey...]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord starts connecting the points from the first one.</p>
      <p>
        Eventually, all points are connected, forming a complex and intricate
        trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>[What do you think, looking at this?]</p>
      <p>'A child's scribbles?'</p>
      <p>I swallow what I was about to say and reply to him.</p>
      <p>"I don't quite understand."</p>
      <p>
        [Points creating attraction, and lines drawn towards them... Doesn't it
        resemble constellations in the night sky?]
      </p>
      <p>"Ah..."</p>
      <p>Tick, tick, tick...</p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord continues to dot points with Pure Spiritual Force beyond the
        connected lines.
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, it resembles stars in the night sky.</p>
      <p>
        [I've never reached the stars in the star realm, but ancient texts from
        cultivators who roamed the star realm say that the stars in the night
        sky also exert a force of attraction.]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord strokes his chin and continues his explanation.</p>
      <p>
        [Stars are much like fate, aren't they? Or rather, if those texts are
        true, it's more like fate resembles constellations. Fate is like
        constellations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life is thus a journey of swimming through a sea of stars, finding
        forces of attraction close to one's fate…And events close to one's life.
        Being pulled by the attraction of fate, these events 'inevitably'
        happen...]
      </p>
      <p>Something seems to come to his mind, and Mad Lord looks bitter.</p>
      <p>
        [...Anyway. If we view fate as constellations and life as swimming
        through a sea of stars,
      </p>
      <p>
        The principle of cultivators observing the celestial energy and reading
        their fate is roughly like that. Detecting the nearest force of
        attraction of fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the way for cultivators to escape the force of fate's
        attraction is simple. When ordinary life goes from here to there.]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord connects points in the air.</p>
      <p>
        The constellation drawn by connecting the points ends at a certain spot.
      </p>
      <p>The distance to the next point is quite far.</p>
      <p>It looks like the line could not be extended further.</p>
      <p>
        [Between these stars, create a suitable star and head towards the next
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stages of cultivation, such as the Seventy-Two Earthly Sha,
        Thirty-Six Heavenly Gang, Seven Stars Ritual, Qi Building's Spiritual
        Energy Star, Core Formation's Star Domain, are not there for nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        They create something similar to a star within the body, artificially
        creating a flow of fate, thus extending their fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how cultivators extend their lifespan and why they are called
        beings against the heavens.]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord smirks as he continues his explanation.</p>
      <p>
        [Then, if fate is meant to happen but one wants to escape it, how? How
        to escape this trajectory of fate? Simple.]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord redraws the constellation.</p>
      <p>
        [The closest thing in this fate is the next fate, but if the master of
        the life desires a different fate...]
      </p>
      <p>
        He daws a line from one star to another, illustrating the line moving
        towards a different constellation than originally intended.
      </p>
      <p>
        [It's difficult to move to a different fate because the force of
        attraction of the next fate pulls in the existence.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The line tries to move to a different constellation but is held back by
        the force of attraction of the determined fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        [So, what should be done? The method is simple. Escape the force of
        fate’s attraction.]
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        The line escapes the force of attraction of the predetermined star and
        lands in a different one.
      </p>
      <p>"...How do you do that?"</p>
      <p>
        [How, you ask? Power! If there is power to escape the force of
        attraction, one can escape from fate.]
      </p>
      <p>
        As he clenches his fist, all the constellations and drawings he had made
        in the air disappear instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        [If you can't change fate, it's evidence of your weakness. Overwhelming
        power to escape the force of attraction of fate! And the bone-grinding
        effort to escape that force! With just these two, we can reach a
        different fate than the one pre-determined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things that are meant to happen will happen, but depending on the effort
        of the being, we may not suffer from those inevitable events.]
      </p>
      <p>
        As Mad Lord continues his explanation, his eyes sparkle with excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        [If fate torments me, then I should become stronger than fate! Where
        else can you find such a clear solution! I, too, have strived and
        strived to escape from my predetermined fate...]
      </p>
      <p>Mad Lord clutches the box beside him, gasping for breath.</p>
      <p>
        [I will escape the fate of never meeting her again and will see her no
        matter what. By any means! If I keep trying, I will definitely see her
        again. Definitely, with her...]
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord caresses the box with shining eyes, muttering to [something]
        inside it.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ah, my love. I love you. Please, please, talk to me again, hold the
        fan, and dance those steps like before. Not being able to see you is not
        the fate I want. If I can see you again, I will throw away all my fate
        and gather strength to leap to a different fate. To a place where I can
        see you. So please...]
      </p>
      <p>
        He scratches the box frantically, speaking crazily to something inside.
      </p>
      <p>'Certainly, he's not in his right mind.'</p>
      <p>I look at Manager Kim Yeon, who had been knocked out by Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>'Power...'</p>
      <p>The power to escape fate.</p>
      <p>And effort.</p>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>I am still lacking in everything.</p>
      <p>
        I simply lack the ability to change the current situation with my power.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why what is meant to happen happens, and I can only watch as my
        colleagues are handed over to the madman and hypocrite.
      </p>
      <p>"...Thank you for your teachings."</p>
      <p>I feel a bit more understanding regarding fate thanks to him.</p>
      <p>'Yes, fate will definitely happen, but it can be changed.'</p>
      <p>In this life.</p>
      <p>No one had their arm torn off by the fox.</p>
      <p>
        Because I distracted the fox and became strong enough to run away from
        it for several days.
      </p>
      <p>
        'If I become stronger, strong enough to knock down the fox, maybe I can
        escape the fate’s attraction of the fox.'
      </p>
      <p>Let's become stronger.</p>
      <p>
        Stronger and stronger, increase the lifespan through cultivation, and
        create a constellation to escape all fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Someday, if I become strong enough to escape even from the grasp of the
        Heavenly Being cultivators, then I can truly escape all fate...'
      </p>
      <p>
        After scratching the box for a while in a frenzy, Mad Lord looks at me
        and Kim Young-hoon alternately and flicks his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you for the teachings today. I have a few more questions to
        ask..."
      </p>
      <p>
        [That's enough answers for now. Go on. [She] is calling me. She needs my
        help. She says she needs oiling in her joints. She's calling me, she
        is...]
      </p>
      <p>Swoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Before me and Kim Young-hoon could react, we are pushed into a spatial
        rift by Mad Lord's gesture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see the Mad Lord open the box lid and bury his upper body inside,
        sinking into the darkness.
      </p>
      <p>Once again, we found ourselves in Yanguo.</p>
      <p>'The force of fate’s attraction...'</p>
      <p>
        If there really is such a thing as the force of fate’s attraction, even
        if Mad Lord sends us randomly, ending up in Yanguo is also because the
        force of attraction pulls us there.
      </p>
      <p>I pondered over fate, chewing over Mad Lord's words.</p>
      <p>
        His words made me feel like I could grasp the concept of the Qi
        Building's Spiritual Energy Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Kim Young-hoon woke up, I transferred knowledge into his mind
        using a technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon was confused about the knowledge in his head, and asked
        me about my conversations with the Heavenly Being cultivators. I
        explained that I had the knowledge in my head too, and that's how I
        conversed with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I managed to persuade Kim Young-hoon sufficiently and helped him
        establish himself in Yanguo. After raising him to the level of Three
        Flowers Gather at the Summit, I taught him the Beyond the Path to Heaven
        Martial Arts, the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting
        Martial Arts, and other such teachings, hoping that one day he would
        surpass the Ultimate Pinnacle and enter a new realm. Then, we parted
        ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, I secretly infiltrated the Jin Clan, seeing my disciples, and
        once again, I caught a glimpse of my master from a distance at the
        Cheongmun Clan.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, I headed towards the Black Wind Sea.</p>
      <p>
        Before heading to Seo Ran's abode in the Black Wind Sea, I look at the
        dark bead Seo Hweol had given me. It was the bead that, in my past life,
        Seo Ran used to completely destroy the Nether Crossing Ship in a mutual
        self-destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a wry smile I throw the dark bead into the sea. It sinks deep,
        beyond anyone's reach.
      </p>
      <p>‘Seo Ran will remember you as a good king and grandfather.’</p>
      <p>I think to myself. Not as a villain with a heart of a beast.</p>
      <p>That’s enough.</p>
      <p>
        I glance at the manual of Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation,
        deciding to use it as a token when I meet Seo Ran.
      </p>
      <p>Should I go to Seo Hyung right away?</p>
      <p>
        As I ponder in front of the Black Wind Sea, I know if I went now, Seo
        Ran would urge me to learn Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation, and
        challenge the Nether Crossing Ship again in a few years.
      </p>
      <p>"No, that won't do."</p>
      <p>
        I sigh. Even both of us together couldn’t defeat the Core
        Formation-level ghost spirit in the Nether Crossing Ship. Seo Ran,
        unaware of my situation, will probably wait for years.
      </p>
      <p>I lack the power to change Seo Ran's fated death.</p>
      <p>"So, I'll seek the power to change fate before going to him."</p>
      <p>No matter how long it takes or what effort is needed.</p>
      <p>"I'll enter Qi Building and then go to him."</p>
      <p>
        I make my decision and head to Shattered Heaven Peak in the great
        mountains of Shengzi, where the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect and
        a mountain with good dragon veins are located.
      </p>
      <p>Five years have passed since my return.</p>
      <p>
        With a sigh, the brown clouds swirling around me are sucked into my nose
        and mouth. Through Understanding before Breakthrough and repeated
        insights in each life, my understanding of the Earth Surpassing Path
        increased.
      </p>
      <p>'Five years to reach mastery this time.'</p>
      <p>
        The Water, Fire, and Metal Surpassing Paths, mastered in the past life,
        will take about eight years each to master now. If this pace continues,
        I can master all the methods in the Five Surpassing Paths to Cultivation
        in 40 years.
      </p>
      <p>'It's possible...!'</p>
      <p>In this life, reaching Qi Building is achievable.</p>
      <p>
        I open my eyes and release Gang Spheres. Now I can stably control nine
        Gang Spheres.
      </p>
      <p>"I've consolidated at the extreme of Ultimate Pinnacle..."</p>
      <p>
        It’s time to move beyond, but materializing consciousness is still
        challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gang Spheres can meld into my consciousness, but it can't hold its
        essence, and the energy dissipates.
      </p>
      <p>"How can I materialize this power in my consciousness...?"</p>
      <p>
        Even as I ponder over the Beyond the Path to Heaven Martial Arts, it
        remains complex and subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, I spend my time continuing to practice the martial art and
        mastering the Water Surpassing Path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eight years later, I have mastered the Water Surpassing Path but still
        haven't deciphered the Beyond the Path to Heaven Martial Arts. Despite
        recalling Kim Young-hoon's trials and errors, the martial art remains
        elusive.
      </p>
      <p>It’s around this time.</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon came to Shattered Heaven Peak.</p>
      <p>"What brings you here?"</p>
      <p>I’m speechless at his rapid growth.</p>
      <p>"Have you already reached the end of Ultimate Pinnacle?"</p>
      <p>It makes no sense.</p>
      <p>We are just in the 13th year since my return.</p>
      <p>
        Has he already surpassed the Five Energies Converging to the Origin,
        reached Ultimate Pinnacle, and even its end?
      </p>
      <p>As I ask him in astonishment, Kim Young-hoon gives a wry smile.</p>
      <p>
        "I reached the end of Ultimate Pinnacle and helped the Jin Clan, a
        cultivator clan, in driving out the Makli clan, a devil path clan, from
        Yanguo. I thought I had achieved everything, but only at the extreme of
        Ultimate Pinnacle did I realize that if I settled here, I would gain
        nothing."
      </p>
      <p>He looks serious.</p>
      <p>
        "That's why I left everything, including my external elder position in
        the Jin Clan, to come to you. Together, we need to discuss this Beyond
        the Path to Heaven Martial Arts in our minds and move to the next
        realm."
      </p>
      <p>"..."</p>
      <p>
        "I instinctively know. To reach this realm, I can no longer rely solely
        on innate talent. It's a realm that can only be achieved through decades
        of intense training... I understood the bloodied and painful efforts of
        the creator of the Beyond the Path to Heaven Martial Arts..."
      </p>
      <p>He floats nine Gang Spheres around him.</p>
      <p>
        "I have reached the extreme, but honestly, I have no idea how to move to
        the next realm. Even though the predecessor carved the path forward with
        their blood, I don’t dare to walk it alone."
      </p>
      <p>His eyes fill with a somber look.</p>
      <p>
        "It will take decades of intense practice. Even for someone like me! So,
        walk this path together with me... reach this realm with me."
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, even in his somber state, his eyes tell me he has no thoughts of
        giving up.
      </p>
      <p>'Kim Hyung...'</p>
      <p>
        They say to change one's fate, humans need both the effort to break free
        from fate's attraction and the power to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        But perhaps what truly frees humans from fate is not power, but will.
      </p>
      <p>"...Understood."</p>
      <p>I meet his eyes, reaffirming my resolve for this life.</p>
      <p>"Let's together, surpass fate."</p>
      <p>
        From that day, Kim Young-hoon and I began our simultaneous cultivation
        at Shattered Heaven Peak.
      </p>
      <p>"...Huh!"</p>
      <p>I suddenly wake up.</p>
      <p>'Was it a dream of the past?'</p>
      <p>
        It was a dream about the day Kim Young-hoon and I decided to train
        together at Shattered Heaven Peak.
      </p>
      <p>I shake my head to clear it.</p>
      <p>'I passed out to the point of dreaming.'</p>
      <p>Thud, thud...</p>
      <p>I stand up, dusting off the dirt and stone powder from my body.</p>
      <p>The vicinity of Shattered Heaven Peak is a mess.</p>
      <p>
        There are sword and saber marks everywhere, and craters caused by Gang
        Spheres all around.
      </p>
      <p>Cough, cough!</p>
      <p>I use a palm strike to clear the dust and look for Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>
        If I remember correctly, during our spar, Kim Young-hoon and I had
        struck each other and were thrown in opposite directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had taken a blow from Kim Young-hoon and lost consciousness
        momentarily, ending up dreaming about the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Kim Young-hoon had taken not only my kick but also dozens of
        cultivator spells, so I don't know his condition.
      </p>
      <p>"Kim Hyung! Kim... Huh!"</p>
      <p>
        While searching, I see Kim Young-hoon below in the valley, half-buried.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Damn it, if we had just fought using martial arts from the start, it
        would have been somewhat safer...'
      </p>
      <p>
        If Kim Young-hoon hadn't been stubborn about gaining enlightenment in a
        life-and-death struggle, insisting we use both martial arts and
        cultivation techniques, it wouldn't have come to this.
      </p>
      <p>"Kim Hyung, Kim Hyung!"</p>
      <p>
        I use a light body technique to descend into the valley and pull out Kim
        Young-hoon, who was half-buried.
      </p>
      <p>"Cough, cough..."</p>
      <p>
        It seems he wasn't seriously injured despite being buried headfirst,
        perhaps because he used protective Gang Qi at the moment of impact.
      </p>
      <p>"Cough, chuckle..."</p>
      <p>
        He spits out blood, but at least he isn't dead from the head-first
        crash.
      </p>
      <p>"Please wait, I'll perform first aid first."</p>
      <p>
        I bring the herbs and acupuncture needles I had prepared before the duel
        and start treating Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>Tap, tap, tap, tap...</p>
      <p>
        I insert needles into Kim Young-hoon's body to activate his life force.
      </p>
      <p>Soon after, Kim Young-hoon regains consciousness.</p>
      <p>"Kim Hyung, are you okay? How many fingers am I holding up?"</p>
      <p>"...Two.."</p>
      <p>"...You're in bad shape."</p>
      <p>I clench my fist, tucking in my index finger, and click my tongue.</p>
      <p>
        "I'll do the treatment first and then go to the cultivators' market to
        buy some healing talismans. For now..."
      </p>
      <p>"No, I mean two."</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon, waking up from his dazed state, speaks decisively.</p>
      <p>"I meant I gained two insights this time..."</p>
      <p>Crack...</p>
      <p>Kim Young-hoon stands up.</p>
      <p>Cough, cough...</p>
      <p>He coughs up blood.</p>
      <p>
        "...On the brink of life and death, I found a clue to the next realm.
        I've somewhat succeeded in understanding the enlightenment of the Beyond
        the Path to Heaven Martial Arts."
      </p>
      <p>He wipes the blood from his mouth and grins.</p>
      <p>
        "One thing's for sure. The Beyond the Path to Heaven Martial Arts is a
        martial art steeped in the subjectivity of its creator. The reason is,
        the realm obtained through the Beyond the Path to Heaven Martial Arts is
        different for each person."
      </p>
      <p>"Really...?"</p>
      <p>
        "Beyond the Ultimate Pinnacle, the realm is reached through different
        enlightenments for each individual. Up to this point, it was divided
        only by the type of weapon and martial arts, but beyond this, it differs
        based on the 'person.'"
      </p>
      <p>
        I listen to Kim Young-hoon's insights and my mouth opens in amazement.
      </p>
      <p>35 years into the return.</p>
      <p>
        Kim Young-hoon began to gain insights into the next step through the
        Beyond the Path to Heaven Martial Arts.

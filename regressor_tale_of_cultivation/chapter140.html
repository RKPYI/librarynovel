      <p>Chapter 140: 13th Cycle's First Day</p>
      <p>Blinking, I open my eyes.</p>
      <p>'Damn it, dying right after ascension, what a mess...'</p>
      <p>As I’m rubbing my throbbing head, I pause.</p>
      <p>'Wait.'</p>
      <p>Something is off.</p>
      <p>"...What?"</p>
      <p>I look around. This isn't the familiar forest.</p>
      <p>This place...</p>
      <p>
        "Make your choice. We'll soon scatter according to the guidance of the
        Bright Cold Realm's seniors. Which faction will you join?"
      </p>
      <p>"...What?"</p>
      <p>
        Staring at Seo Hweol in front of me, my eyes widen as I survey my
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>This is atop the Flying Immortal Platform, where I had just died.</p>
      <p>"Wait, wait..."</p>
      <p>Then it became clear.</p>
      <p>My point of return has been fixed to this place.</p>
      <p>"...Look here."</p>
      <p>"Ah!"</p>
      <p>I flinch at Seo Hweol's question.</p>
      <p>
        Cautiously observing the wooden man's reactions, I don't scatter my
        Formless Sword recklessly, instead concealing my energy within my body
        as I look around.
      </p>
      <p>Now that my point of return has unexpectedly moved itself,</p>
      <p>Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect.</p>
      <p>Black Ghost Valley.</p>
      <p>Azure Heaven Creation Sect.</p>
      <p>The demon tribes heading towards the True Dragon Alliance.</p>
      <p>And various others like the Righteous and Devil Path Alliances...</p>
      <p>I have to choose among them.</p>
      <p>On the first day of my 13th return.</p>
      <p>'Choose?'</p>
      <p>I press my temples, looking around.</p>
      <p>Who should I choose?</p>
      <p>'I don't even understand the current situation...'</p>
      <p>The sudden fixation of my return point is overwhelming.</p>
      <p>This fixation means...</p>
      <p>
        'Everything I did during the short time since I started my return... is
        all permanent.'
      </p>
      <p>The norigae I gave to Hyang-hwa.</p>
      <p>The relationship between Song Jin and Seo Ran.</p>
      <p>The Longevity Fruit I prepared for Kim Young-hoon.</p>
      <p>The death of Yuan Li and the disappearance of the Makli Clan...</p>
      <p>Whether good or bad, my actions are permanent.</p>
      <p>This means...</p>
      <p>'Everything I've done so far...'</p>
      <p>A feeling of indescribable emotion wells up in my chest.</p>
      <p>'It wasn't meaningless...'</p>
      <p>
        Even though I may not know when I will die, I have always given my best
        in everything I've done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if the lives were meaningless, the results of my actions, to which
        I've given my all, have now become meaningful as time has become fixed.
      </p>
      <p>I reflect on my actions and accomplishments in the lower realm.</p>
      <p>'Ah, really...'</p>
      <p>What a relief.</p>
      <p>That's what I thought when...</p>
      <p>"Hmm, seems like you're deep in thought."</p>
      <p>Says Seo Hweol, stroking his chin and slowing his pace.</p>
      <p>
        "It looks like we need to leave now. Honestly, I'm quite interested in
        you..."
      </p>
      <p>It isn't just Seo Hweol.</p>
      <p>
        Other demon tribe leaders, the kings of the Holy Peng and Mighty Tiger
        tribes, also look interested, implying that I look to be a useful
        talent.
      </p>
      <p>However, the eyes of the dragon behind them show dissatisfaction.</p>
      <p>
        [What's so important about this left-over trash? It's a long journey
        from the central lands to the Earth Tribe's territory. We must depart
        quickly.]
      </p>
      <p>"It seems the elder is in a hurry. We should go now."</p>
      <p>"...Yes, take care, Sir Dragon King."</p>
      <p>
        "Ha, Dragon King you say. I appreciate the words, but from now on, don't
        call me 'king.' The real Middle Boundary demon kings might get angry."
      </p>
      <p>He chuckles, patting my shoulder, and turns to join Gyu-ryeon.</p>
      <p>
        I courteously see off Seo Hweol, having no intention of joining him at
        the moment.
      </p>
      <p>If I had gathered more information through several lives, maybe...</p>
      <p>
        ‘Of course, if it wasn’t the True Dragon Alliance but the Sea Dragon
        Tribe in the lower realm, I would have refused immediately, now or
        later.’
      </p>
      <p>As Seo Hweol prepares to leave...</p>
      <p>
        [Since you're a human, come with us. Whichever faction you choose, it
        won't be hard to settle in.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The green-armored wooden man speaks, watching the situation with arms
        crossed.
      </p>
      <p>However,</p>
      <p>[You don't want to choose anyone, do you?]</p>
      <p>Mad Lord Jo Yeon, from a distance, speaks up with his eyes glowing.</p>
      <p>Kugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        He absorbs the spiritual energy of the Bright Cold Realm, having already
        reached the Grand Perfection of Heavenly Being, just a step away from
        Four-Axis, demonstrating a presence akin to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        His not immediate advancement to Four-Axis, like the three Heavenly
        Beings and Seo Hweol, due to not using the Heavenly Lightning Banner,
        proved his near Four-Axis strength as he spoke to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        [If you won’t choose anyone, come with me. What are you, really? I’m so
        curious I could die. How can a person have such a heart essence? Ah, so
        interesting. I'll take you as my disciple, so follow me. Follow me.
        Follow me. Follow me. Let's head to the Light Spirit Pond together.]
      </p>
      <p>
        His eyes, brimming with madness, stares at me, and I involuntarily step
        back.
      </p>
      <p>Then, the green-armored wooden man frowns and speaks.</p>
      <p>
        [I recognize your tremendous talent, but first, as you are a human, you
        must go to the Human Territory to receive your identity plaque. Where
        are you even saying you’re planning to go? Both of you, just follow for
        now.]
      </p>
      <p>At that moment, Mad Lord Jo Yeon laughs wildly, shaking his head.</p>
      <p>
        [No, I don’t want to. I need to gather materials to complete
        [Her].That's why I ascended to the upper realm. I need nothing else. I
        will find the Light Spirit Pond in the Bright Cold Realm to circulate
        blood in [Her] body.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [How dare you… Do you not understand? I don't care why you came to the
        upper realm. First, you need to go to the Human Territory and…]
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, Mad Lord Jo Yeon begins shaking his head violently.</p>
      <p>
        [Don’t want to! Don’tWantToDon’tWantToDon’tWantToDon’tWantTo! Don’t
        order me. I’m heading to the Light Spirit Pond right now! I must go
        there to complete [Her]! Don’t stop me! Don’t stop me!]
      </p>
      <p>
        At Mad Lord Jo Yeon's behavior, Seo Hweol, as well as the three newly
        ascended Four-Axis cultivators, begin to look tense.
      </p>
      <p>
        They each protect their factions with a barrier, retreating step by
        step.
      </p>
      <p>I also feel a chill down my spine at his behavior.</p>
      <p>
        ‘That person, he always acts like that before doing something crazy…’
      </p>
      <p>
        -Whyrunningwhyrunningwhyrunningwhyrunningwhyrunning?
        -I'mofferingtoevolveyouintosomethinggreater? -Youyouyouyouyuyouyouyou
      </p>
      <p>Recalling that horrific memory, I feel a chill enveloping my body.</p>
      <p>
        The green-armored wooden man’s face distorts, angered by Mad Lord Jo
        Yeon's attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Have you ever seen such a madman? In the lower realm, you may have been
        indulged as a Heavenly Being, but this is the Bright Cold Realm. How
        dare this bastard cause a scene here?]
      </p>
      <p>Rumble!</p>
      <p>
        Spiritual energy of heaven and earth gathers in the wooden man's hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'll properly teach you a lesson. Come, try acting crazy. I'll get rid
        of you.]
      </p>
      <p>And then...</p>
      <p>Snap.</p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord Jo Yeon suddenly stops and stares at the wooden man with
        glittering eyes.
      </p>
      <p>"Get rid... of me?"</p>
      <p>Mad Lord Jo Yeon brings his hands to his mouth.</p>
      <p>Crunch, crunch, snap!</p>
      <p>
        [Get rid of me? GetRidGetRidGetRidGetRidGetRidGetRid? Nononononononono….
        Ahhh. [She] said something! Everyone quiet! Quiet! Ahh, that’s right!
        Did you hear? [She] gave me her opinion!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord Jo Yeon, his eyes filled with insanity, continues talking while
        chewing his fingers till they bleed.
      </p>
      <p>
        [As a celebration of my ascension to the Bright Cold Realm, let's see
        how effective Four-Axis materials are!]
      </p>
      <p>[You... lunatic!]</p>
      <p>The wooden man makes his move.</p>
      <p>
        Seo Hweol, along with the elder from the True Dragon Alliance, hurriedly
        flee.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three newly ascended Four-Axis cultivators protect their factions
        with barriers.
      </p>
      <p>Having not chosen any faction, no one particularly helps me.</p>
      <p>Then, Mad Lord Jo Yeon clashes with the Four-Axis cultivator.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Zzzing!</p>
      <p>
        Their collision causes the spiritual energy to surge, shaking the nearby
        space.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugu</p>
      <p>"Krghhh!"</p>
      <p>
        'Damn it! If it wasn't for the Blood Body Skin Armor, I would have
        died!'
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the regenerative power of the Blood Body Skin Armor, I barely
        survived.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pinned down by their pressure, I can barely lift my head to watch their
        battle in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>And then...</p>
      <p>
        That day, I witnessed the full [power] of Mad Lord Jo Yeon for the first
        time.
      </p>
      <p>Koooooooogh!</p>
      <p>Mad Lord Jo Yeon opens a box.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>From inside the box, a massive fortress emerges.</p>
      <p>The fortress resembles three Serving Command Palaces combined.</p>
      <p>
        A cylindrical pillar trio formed a triangle in Mad Lord Jo Yeon's
        fortress.
      </p>
      <p>From atop the fortress, Mad Lord Jo Yeon's voice thunders.</p>
      <p>[Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, open your gates!]</p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        The gates of Mad Lord Jo Yeon's fortress opens, and the sky begins to be
        enveloped.
      </p>
      <p>'That..that is..?'</p>
      <p>
        I gape in astonishment, and so do the other Four-Axis cultivators of the
        Bright Cold Realm, their eyes wide with shock as they stare at Mad Lord
        Jo Yeon.
      </p>
      <p>Whoom!</p>
      <p>
        Bee puppets, spider puppets, mantis puppets... animal puppets… human
        puppets…
      </p>
      <p>They all fill the sky.</p>
      <p>Mad Lord Jo Yeon's voice resounds from beyond them.</p>
      <p>
        [Qi Building puppets, 190 million. Core Formation puppets, 165,600.
        Nascent Soul puppets, 4203. Heavenly Being puppets, 63. Four-Axis stage,
        2.]
      </p>
      <p>The collective power of two authentic Four-Axis beings.</p>
      <p>And the combined strength of all other puppets filling the sky...</p>
      <p>The total combined power is...</p>
      <p>'Four, Four-Axis...'</p>
      <p>The power equivalent to four Four-Axis cultivators!</p>
      <p>
        My mouth falls open in awe, and I look below at the three Heavenly
        Beings, now Four-Axis cultivators, calmly deploying barriers below.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Mad Lord Jo Yeon skillfully manipulates his puppets, aggressively
        pushing against the green-armored wooden man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other Four-Axis cultivators, who have been stunned, fly up to help the
        green-armored wooden man.
      </p>
      <p>I look below at the Black Ghost Valley with a stunned expression.</p>
      <p>
        Only today do I realize how astonishing and incredible the Black Ghost
        Valley is.
      </p>
      <p>
        To wage war against such a monstrous entity and survive by sacrificing
        only a third of their forces is truly a testament to their immense
        power.
      </p>
      <p>Kuguang Kuguang Guang Guang!</p>
      <p>
        For several moments, the Four-Axis cultivators dazzlingly engage in
        battle amidst numerous Qi Building puppets.
      </p>
      <p>And then.</p>
      <p>Kwoooong!</p>
      <p>
        The puppets are suddenly blasted away in a circle, creating a gap among
        the sea of puppets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through that gap, the wooden man in green armor is seen falling,
        blood-like liquid flowing from its body.
      </p>
      <p>Simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Poof!</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord's Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress descends from the sky,
        capturing the green-armored wooden man.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, the Mad Lord's puppets are instantly sucked back into his
        fortress, which in turn is drawn back into his box.
      </p>
      <p>Paaaat!</p>
      <p>Behind the Mad Lord, something brilliantly white is embracing him.</p>
      <p>'Is that, [Her]…!?'</p>
      <p>I’m astonished while I look at [something].</p>
      <p>
        It seems to resemble a human form, but the radiance emanating from [Her]
        and the eye-watering difficulty in focusing on [Her] makes it hard to
        observe.
      </p>
      <p>Just then.</p>
      <p>[You brat!]</p>
      <p>The Mad Lord, along with [Her], flies towards me.</p>
      <p>Paaat!</p>
      <p>No, 'flies' isn't the right word.</p>
      <p>They simply transcended space and instantly reached in front of me.</p>
      <p>Kwaaaak!</p>
      <p>
        [Her] grasp of the void causes the heaven and earth spiritual energy to
        seize me up.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Kim Yeon, who has been foaming at the mouth and
        unconscious, is also lifted into the air.
      </p>
      <p>[Let's go! We've got a Four-Axis material now!]</p>
      <p>'Damn it!'</p>
      <p>Vrooooom!</p>
      <p>
        I draw my Formless Sword, frantically resisting, but I’m unable to move
        against the strength of [Her], a Four-Axis level being.
      </p>
      <p>
        [This is exciting! Hehe! Two worthy disciples and one Four-Axis level
        material, and a successful ascension into the Bright Cold Realm. The day
        we dance together isn't far off! Aaaaaah!]
      </p>
      <p>Paaaatt!</p>
      <p>
        The Mad Lord, with [Her], flies away, and I, captured by [Her], am
        dragged along.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind me, the distance quickly grows, and I can hear the Four-Axis
        cultivators screaming in rage as if they had gone mad.
      </p>
      <p>Kugugugugu!</p>
      <p>
        Their angry roars cause the earth to shake and tremble like an
        earthquake.
      </p>
      <p>
        These entities, whose mere existences surpassed natural disasters and
        became celestial phenomenons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such Four-Axis cultivators were toyed with and are now trembling in rage
        by a single Mad Lord.
      </p>
      <p>[Chase that madman...!]</p>
      <p>[Put a bounty on that scum in the entire Bright Cold Realm!]</p>
      <p>[You lunatic! The entire Heaven Tribe will hunt you down!]</p>
      <p>
        In this chaotic situation, being captured by the Mad Lord, I clench my
        teeth.
      </p>
      <p>'Damn it!'</p>
      <p>
        Because I didn't choose a faction in time, I ended up being captured by
        the Mad Lord!
      </p>
      <p>Paaaatt!</p>
      <p>
        I, along with the Mad Lord, [Her], and Team Leader Kim, swiftly fly to
        an unknown destination!

      <p>Chapter 35: 6th Cycle's First Day</p>
      <p>Blink</p>
      <p>"Heugh!"</p>
      <p>I gasped for breath as I opened my eyes.</p>
      <p>I'm alive.</p>
      <p>It was still the familiar smell of plants and trees.</p>
      <p>I had returned again.</p>
      <p>"Deputy Manager Seo."</p>
      <p>"Hmm, be quiet for a moment."</p>
      <p>Thump!</p>
      <p>
        Before Jeon Myeong-hoon could say anything, I moved quickly and pressed
        his sleep acupoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I quickly pressed the sleep acupoints of Kim Young-hoon, Oh
        Hyun-seok, Kang Min-hee, Oh Hye-seo, and Kim Yeon.
      </p>
      <p>Thud, thud, thud!</p>
      <p>
        All six, excluding me, fell asleep on the spot, and I quickly dug up
        some sleeping grass around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        After extracting the juice skillfully, I administered it into their
        mouths.
      </p>
      <p>They won't be able to wake up for at least three to four hours.</p>
      <p>"...A bit stiff."</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps due to forcibly drawing internal energy through a body devoid of
        any internal energy, my arms and legs felt a bit stiff.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wandered around, quickly digging up a yellow bamboo root, and popped
        into my mouth.
      </p>
      <p>Crunch, crunch-</p>
      <p>I chewed on a bit of dirt, but that was bearable.</p>
      <p>
        After chewing on the yellow bamboo root for a while, I felt a warm
        energy surging in my stomach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sat down and started to meditate, first anchoring the Dragon Vein Qi
        Method in my meridians.
      </p>
      <p>How many times did I perform internal cultivation while sitting?</p>
      <p>"Hoo..."</p>
      <p>I could feel all the fatigue in my body being relieved.</p>
      <p>"Now that the framework is set, let's give it a proper try..."</p>
      <p>The last moments of my past life.</p>
      <p>
        During the fight with Makli Wangshin, a new realm was drawn by the souls
        of my disciples.
      </p>
      <p>"Hooo..."</p>
      <p>
        Taking a deep breath, I got up and recalled the final moments' memory.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I took the stance of the Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.</p>
      <p>
        While Kim Young-hoon achieved enlightenment sitting in a lotus position,
        I found holding the riding stance a bit more comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh- Boong-</p>
      <p>
        With empty hands, I revived the memories and sensations from that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joy (喜), anger (怒), sorrow (哀), pleasure (樂), love (愛), hatred
        (惡), desire (欲).
      </p>
      <p>The seven basic emotions and intents.</p>
      <p>
        Based on these basic intents, a multitude of colors fill the space
        between heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>All these immense intent were emanating from me alone.</p>
      <p>'Integrate them.'</p>
      <p>As numerous as they seem, the subject is ultimately one.</p>
      <p>All originated from one color spectrum.</p>
      <p>The myriad of colors intertwined and integrated.</p>
      <p>Then, they became colorless and merged into the void.</p>
      <p>
        As the infinite colors reached their limit, they transformed into the
        nothingness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, my intent evolved into divine consciousness , encroaching the
        surrounding space.
      </p>
      <p>'Entering.'</p>
      <p>
        Even with my eyes completely closed, all the information from the
        surrounding space entered my mind.
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't just reading intent.</p>
      <p>Integrating all intents, I sensed the world itself!</p>
      <p>My six sleeping colleagues, rustling in their sleep.</p>
      <p>The smell of grass.</p>
      <p>Small insects crawling under the ground.</p>
      <p>The warm sunshine.</p>
      <p>Small leaves swaying in the wind.</p>
      <p>All information seemed graspable in the palm of my hand.</p>
      <p>I awakened a new sensation I had never felt before.</p>
      <p>Not just the flow of intent, but the flow of the world.</p>
      <p>The flow of heaven and earth that operates the world!</p>
      <p>The Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth!</p>
      <p>'This is... Spiritual Energy...'</p>
      <p>Everything in the universe has Spiritual Energy.</p>
      <p>Even if not like human intent, each has its unique energy (Qi).</p>
      <p>
        This energy naturally flowed, aligned with each object's movement and
        operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sensed the flow of energy from a small ant crawling under the ground,
        solving one of the mysteries I had always wondered about.
      </p>
      <p>Intent is something only the living possess.</p>
      <p>That's why Jiangshi cannot use sword energy.</p>
      <p>But why did I sense intent even from the Jiangshi?</p>
      <p>'It wasn't human intent.'</p>
      <p>I merely read the natural flow of energy in Jiangshi.</p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>
        While sensing the flow of thousands of strands of heaven and earth's
        spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>I realized something was wrong.</p>
      <p>'My head, it hurts.'</p>
      <p>It felt like it was about to burst.</p>
      <p>This wasn't just a metaphor.</p>
      <p>Right now, my head was literally swelling up in real-time.</p>
      <p>I had felt this sensation a long time ago.</p>
      <p>When I was transitioning from first-rate to peak.</p>
      <p>All day long, imitating the vision of peak masters!</p>
      <p>
        When my brain was overloaded back then, I felt a similar sensation for a
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>'My brain is overloading!'</p>
      <p>
        It was on the verge of explosion from the overwhelming volume of
        information
      </p>
      <p>
        Not metaphorically, but in reality, the upper dantian was absorbing the
        surrounding energy, causing my head to actually swell.
      </p>
      <p>'Right, it was like that then too.'</p>
      <p>
        Even in the final moments of my past life, it wasn't much different.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that I hadn't paid attention to it due to the wailing in my
        brain and the pain throughout my body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, this is what happens when one acquires a consciousness like that
        of a cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>'Back then...'</p>
      <p>
        Recalling the enlightenment from my past life, I began to take the same
        actions as I did at that time.
      </p>
      <p>I slowly observed my body.</p>
      <p>
        The balance of the upper, middle, and lower dantians were twisted and
        discordant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The upper dantian had become excessively large and was still growing in
        real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If left as it is, my head would eventually not withstand the growth of
        the upper dantian and would explode.
      </p>
      <p>'I shall evolve my physical body!'</p>
      <p>
        The Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth inherently seeks to harmonize
        all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, naturally, the Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth began to
        seep into me, responding to my severe disharmony.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Five Elements Spiritual Energy, the most fundamental of the Energy
        of Heaven and Earth, the origin of all Qi movements in the universe and
        nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five strands of energy gathered towards my upper dantian and converged
        above it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, the Five Elements Spiritual Energy crumbled into one and
        started seeping into my body through my nose and mouth.
      </p>
      <p>'Hooo...'</p>
      <p>
        Inside my body, the fundamental five energies, which establish the
        balance of all things under heaven, began to flow.
      </p>
      <p>Instinctively, I realized what I needed to do.</p>
      <p>'I must evolve my physical body!'</p>
      <p>
        Based on these five streams of energy, I must completely remodel my body
        to withstand the growth of the upper dantian!
      </p>
      <p>I finally understood what rejuvenation truly meant.</p>
      <p>
        Previously, I thought that the Spiritual Energy seeping into the body
        would naturally evolve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was mistaken. Energy doesn't evolve the body; it's just the material
        used for remodeling.
      </p>
      <p>The actual agent of rejuvenation was always myself.</p>
      <p>'I, personally!'</p>
      <p>Crack, crackle!</p>
      <p>'I must balance my body!'</p>
      <p>With intent, I rearranged my bones and muscles.</p>
      <p>
        I pulled and optimized the meridians, making them flow through the most
        efficient paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Five Elements Spiritual Energy did not directly help but showed me
        the 'right' way to reconfigure my bones and muscles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding my medical knowledge from being a doctor, I was able to easily
        remodel my body.
      </p>
      <p>Bones rearranged, skin shed.</p>
      <p>
        Useless fat pushed out, and toxins like nicotine and cholesterol in the
        blood vessels expelled.
      </p>
      <p>
        My entire body's bones and muscles were remodeled into a form optimized
        for accepting the flow of Energy from heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>The best physique for martial arts.</p>
      <p>
        The meridians widened, the bones and muscles strengthened, and the
        dantian expanded significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, all the minute blood vessels in my body opened wide,
        absorbing the Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth little by little.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could live by just breathing through the skin without needing to
        breathe through my nose.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, I was more of an evolved human than a regular human.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>As I opened my eyes, it seemed as if pure light flowed from within.</p>
      <p>"Hoo..."</p>
      <p>
        With empty hands, I performed the primary stance and unfolded the
        Severing Mountain Swordsmanship’s Transcending Peaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tiny dewdrops at the tips of the grass under my feet were flung up by my
        stance.
      </p>
      <p>
        With my movements, the dewdrops flew higher into the air, and in my
        eyes, I could clearly see the trajectory of each droplet.
      </p>
      <p>Within those droplets, I could see a reflection.</p>
      <p>
        Flawlessly clear skin, a face not particularly handsome but without
        superfluity.
      </p>
      <p>Though not much, a considerably younger face.</p>
      <p>
        Through rebirth and rejuvenation, my own reflection was seen in those
        dewdrops.
      </p>
      <p>Shush!</p>
      <p>
        I sliced through the air with my hand, and the sharp intent split the
        dewdrop in mid-air.
      </p>
      <p>Continuously unfolding sword techniques.</p>
      <p>The flow of energy floating between heaven and earth.</p>
      <p>I infused my intent into that flow, injecting my internal energy.</p>
      <p>Whoosh-</p>
      <p>Gang Qi began to form in the empty space.</p>
      <p>Now, I could use the 'flow' of the void itself as a weapon!</p>
      <p>Crash!</p>
      <p>
        Grasping the Gang Qi formed in the air, I used the first to the
        twenty-second moves of Severing Mountain Swordsmanship.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I decided to do something I had always wanted to try.</p>
      <p>Whish!</p>
      <p>
        I performed the Mountain Lord’s Soaring Flight and leaped towards the
        highest tree nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an instant, I reached the top of the tree and kicked off a branch
        from there.
      </p>
      <p>I could see.</p>
      <p>Into the newly acquired consciousness.</p>
      <p>Into the sensations of my newly acquired physical body.</p>
      <p>The countless wind patterns flowing through the sky.</p>
      <p>
        And the flow of the Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth between the
        winds.
      </p>
      <p>'Is this how it's done?'</p>
      <p>Naturally, in my mind, I figured out where I could 'step.'</p>
      <p>
        With optimized movements and without any waste, I 'stepped' on the
        breezing wind and the flow of Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>My foot struck the void.</p>
      <p>Stepping in the Void (虛空踏步)!</p>
      <p>
        Although it wasn't familiar yet and consumed a lot of my internal
        energy, I felt a tingling pleasure coursing through my body as I
        continued to step in the void.
      </p>
      <p>Boom, boom, boom!</p>
      <p>Stepping on the void, I continuously soared higher into the sky.</p>
      <p>Higher and higher!</p>
      <p>The ground gradually became distant, and the sky drew closer.</p>
      <p>
        I moved my feet faster, stepping on the flow of the void and surging
        towards the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Then, suddenly.</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>I broke through the clouds and found myself above them.</p>
      <p>"Ha, hahaha... hahahaha..."</p>
      <p>
        Shaking off the water droplets that clung to my entire body, with the
        white sea of clouds beneath my feet, I laughed out loud.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, I have reached it.</p>
      <p>The realm I had longed for and aspired to.</p>
      <p>The minimum requirement I aimed for.</p>
      <p>Unknowingly, I felt tears welling up.</p>
      <p>
        The tears, mixed with the droplets from the clouds, began to fall to the
        sky below.
      </p>
      <p>"...Thank you."</p>
      <p>
        I spoke to my disciples from my past life, to those across the timeline
        whom I could never see again.
      </p>
      <p>"It was thanks to you that I could reach this point."</p>
      <p>I nurtured you with my heart.</p>
      <p>But now, I will never be able to see you again.</p>
      <p>The you in this returned time won't be the disciples I raised.</p>
      <p>
        Since I can never see you again, all I can do is wholeheartedly thank
        you.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you, my disciples.</p>
      <p>And I'm sorry, my disciples.</p>
      <p>
        I was able to reach this realm by taking care of you, listening to your
        wishes, acting foolishly on my stubbornness... and cutting through that
        stubbornness.
      </p>
      <p>The realm I endlessly aspired to reach.</p>
      <p>"The Five Energies Converging to the Origin."</p>
      <p>
        Not maintaining Stepping in the Void, I fell back down, facing the
        patterns of the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        I embraced the refreshing breeze from the expansive sky, while
        simultaneously cherishing the memories of my disciples deep within my
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Holding onto these past memories, I came to understand that I had truly
        arrived at the starting point.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>'From now on, it's the real beginning...'</p>
      <p>Buried in the clouds, I thought so.</p>
      <p>Yes, from now on, it's the real starting line.</p>

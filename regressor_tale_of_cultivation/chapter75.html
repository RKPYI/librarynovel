      <p>Chapter 75: 9th Cycle's First Day</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>I open my eyes again to the sensation I’m feeling.</p>
      <p>A new cycle.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I feel an enormous pain!</p>
      <p>"Grrrr!"</p>
      <p>
        Without even a moment to properly reflect on my past life, my head began
        to swell.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I form a water spell and use a sleeping spell to put the people
        around me back to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>"Urghh!"</p>
      <p>"Damn, this is dangerous."</p>
      <p>
        I try to use the Hidden Consciousness Technique to suppress the size of
        my consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>But the pain only intensifies.</p>
      <p>
        The technique isn't for eliminating consciousness, but rather for
        'compressing' it within the upper dantian, making the upper dantian
        endure even more stress.
      </p>
      <p>Qi Refining 14th Star.</p>
      <p>
        I even reached the pinnacle of Qi Refining by mastering four elemental
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although not much, my consciousness is certainly larger than in my past
        life, and it feels like my head is going to explode at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>'I need to get to spiritual plants quickly...'</p>
      <p>Foam forms in my mouth.</p>
      <p>Trembling, I almost crawl to where the yellow bamboo roots are.</p>
      <p>Drip, drip...</p>
      <p>Blood begins to flow from my eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>
      <p>My upper dantian is swelling</p>
      <p>'I must do something!'</p>
      <p>Gritting my teeth, I perform acupoint sealing all over my body.</p>
      <p>
        The acupoints I learned to amplify the body's internal energy during my
        medical studies.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>The internal energy inside my body surges suddenly.</p>
      <p>
        I start to infuse my consciousness into the internal energy, pushing it
        outward.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>As my consciousness splits, a Gang Sphere is formed.</p>
      <p>This slightly reduces the mental strain.</p>
      <p>
        'Even though I've amplified the internal energy in my body to create a
        Gang Sphere, it won't last long because there's too little internal
        energy. My consciousness will return soon, so I must find yellow bamboo
        roots quickly!'
      </p>
      <p>
        I hurriedly run to where a yellow bamboo root is, suppressing my
        throbbing head.
      </p>
      <p>I dig up the earth and put the herb directly into my mouth.</p>
      <p>Crunch, crunch...</p>
      <p>The yellow bamboo root, soil and all, enter my mouth.</p>
      <p>But I quickly chew and swallow, guiding its energy to my dantian.</p>
      <p>Boom, boom!</p>
      <p>The internal energy in my body makes a complete cycle.</p>
      <p>I try to undergo rejuvenation right away.</p>
      <p>Boom, boom!</p>
      <p>Crack, crack, crack!</p>
      <p>
        My entire body starts evolving according to the Five Energies Converging
        to the Origin, achieving perfect harmony in the upper, middle, and lower
        dantians.
      </p>
      <p>
        The swelling in the upper dantian is soon relieved by harmonizing with
        the middle and lower dantians.
      </p>
      <p>"Phew..."</p>
      <p>I finally let out a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p>'I almost died from my head exploding.'</p>
      <p>
        I absorb the Gang Sphere I had previously created back into my body and
        reform my Inner Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Inner Core takes its place and helps regulate the flow of internal
        energy throughout my body.
      </p>
      <p>I feel completely relaxed.</p>
      <p>
        I continue to eat more yellow bamboo roots around me to fill my Inner
        Core completely and stabilize the overflowing internal energy.
      </p>
      <p>‘... I really need to find a way to handle this consciousness.'</p>
      <p>
        Even at the level of Qi Refining, such incidents are happening. If I
        advance to Qi Building, each cycle might start with my head exploding.
      </p>
      <p>It would be an endless cycle of explosions.</p>
      <p>Shivering, I shake my head.</p>
      <p>'I really need to find a solution.'</p>
      <p>
        I became deeply aware of the consciousness issue and finally have time
        to think about what I gained from my past life.
      </p>
      <p>'At the end, I realized the essence of Ultimate Pinnacle.'</p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>A Gang Sphere emerges from the Inner Core.</p>
      <p>"One becomes three."</p>
      <p>The Gang Sphere splits into three.</p>
      <p>
        "If the three influence each other and circulate, focusing on that
        circulation..."
      </p>
      <p>Everything in the world influences each other.</p>
      <p>Each of the three Gang Spheres project onto the others.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>The three Gang Spheres split into three again.</p>
      <p>'Ah...'</p>
      <p>I smile faintly.</p>
      <p>
        Seven of the nine are stable, but the two newly acquired ones are still
        a bit unstable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stabilization is a matter of familiarity, and it's a problem that can be
        solved in a few years of training.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, I have truly reached the extreme of Ultimate Pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>I open and close my eyes, entering the world of intent.</p>
      <p>Around me stands nine versions of myself.</p>
      <p>"Come in."</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>The nine versions of me overlap with me again.</p>
      <p>I feel the speed of my thoughts accelerate tremendously.</p>
      <p>"10 times acceleration."</p>
      <p>Instantly, the world slows down.</p>
      <p>Bang!</p>
      <p>I kick off the air and jump up.</p>
      <p>
        Unlike the time of Five Energies Converging to the Origin, I don't need
        to sense the flow of air or energy to step on the optimal spot.
      </p>
      <p>Anywhere I step feels slow, and I can hop around easily.</p>
      <p>It feels like I am truly soaring through the sky.</p>
      <p>'Good.'</p>
      <p>
        I float in the slowed-down world, organizing my thoughts high up in the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Path Beyond the Heavens Martial Arts that Kim Young-hoon left
        behind.
      </p>
      <p>I feel I am close to grasping the essence of that martial art.</p>
      <p>
        'The realm beyond Ultimate Pinnacle involves integrating Gang Spheres
        with consciousness, materializing it.'
      </p>
      <p>
        But the 'how' of this integration, even when I recall the Path Beyond
        the Heavens Martial Arts, remains elusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It isn't a matter of being a genius or a dullard, experienced or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is simply that the martial art is too subjective to Kim Young-hoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Too much of Kim Young-hoon's subjectivity. Perhaps I should ask him
        after pulling him up to the Ultimate Pinnacle...'
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, in this life, I have to fully develop the Five Surpassing
        Paths to Cultivation, so I could wait for him to reach the Ultimate
        Pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Hmm, okay. Then for the Path Beyond the Heavens Martial Arts, I'll
        remove Kim Young-hoon's personal touch and pass it on to him again
        without making it too obvious...'
      </p>
      <p>As I float in the air with these thoughts...</p>
      <p>Zap!</p>
      <p>"Huh?"</p>
      <p>In the realm of intent.</p>
      <p>A strand of hostile intent reaches out to me.</p>
      <p>I follow the thread of intent.</p>
      <p>Below in the forest.</p>
      <p>A white massive figure is staring right at me.</p>
      <p>Shiver!</p>
      <p>'A fox!'</p>
      <p>
        Almost instinctively, I cover myself with protective Gang Qi, and in the
        next moment...
      </p>
      <p>
        The fox appears before me, spinning in the air and slamming its tail
        down.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        The sound of air breaking resounds, and I am slammed deep into the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You, who dares invade my territory! Don't you know I am the master of
        this forest? How dare you enter without my permission?]
      </p>
      <p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
      <p>
        I naturally reply in the language of the demon race, which I had learned
        from Seo Ran, and the fox's eyes narrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        "...Speaking the demon race's language, you must be a demon as well. To
        enter my territory uninvited as a fellow demon beast, you must be ready
        to die!"
      </p>
      <p>'Damn it.'</p>
      <p>
        "Lord of the forest, this is all a misunderstanding. I was just caught
        in a spatial rift in the Ascension Path and fell here!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, what a convenient excuse. But how do you explain that the space
        around here, except for the center of the Ascension Path, is stable? Are
        you saying you entered my territory uninvited despite detecting my
        presence?"
      </p>
      <p>'Is it recognizing me as a demon?'</p>
      <p>
        It seems different for a demon like me to invade its territory compared
        to a mere human snack.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Please understand that as a fellow demon, I was not aware of the traces
        of the forest's owner."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Carrying a spirit nature close to the peak of Qi Building in your demon
        core and you dare to mock me with such lies?"
      </p>
      <p>The fox begins to shine brilliantly as it treads the air.</p>
      <p>"Die, intruder!"</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>The demon fox, now a blazing white light, plummets towards me.</p>
      <p>'Damn it. What a mess.'</p>
      <p>
        I grit my teeth and dodge the fox's attack, starting to move away from
        where my companions are.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't want them to be dragged into the fight with the fox, especially
        since they are still mere mortals.
      </p>
      <p>Whoosh!</p>
      <p>The fox spreads its domain of consciousness.</p>
      <p>
        Even from a distance, its massive field of consciousness is palpable.
      </p>
      <p>The fox begins to gather strength.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the fox's field of consciousness condenses, taking on
        the same form as the fox. The overlapping of the consciousness and the
        fox causes it to blaze even brighter.
      </p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>It seems to turn into white light itself.</p>
      <p>
        The fox accelerates tenfold and rapidly approaches and stikes down with
        its front paw.
      </p>
      <p>'So fast!'</p>
      <p>I hastily dodge the paw and leap over a small hill.</p>
      <p>But in the next moment...</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>A white light explodes, and the small hill is obliterated.</p>
      <p>
        Beyond that, white luminescent figures in the shape of the fox fly
        towards me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power to obliterate a small mountain and still target its opponent!
      </p>
      <p>'A Core Formation fox... I can't face it head-on.'</p>
      <p>I continue to dodge and flee from the fox's attacks.</p>
      <p>Flash!</p>
      <p>
        The fox transforms into a streak of white light again, chasing after me.
      </p>
      <p>'Wait for the right moment!'</p>
      <p>The air explodes as the fox reaches me.</p>
      <p>Its mouth opens wide.</p>
      <p>I take a stance and shoot a Gang Sphere from my Inner Core.</p>
      <p>
        Although my acceleration rate drops, I don't care and swing the Gang
        Sphere connected to Gang Qi.
      </p>
      <p>Clang!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>Light explodes, and the fox is momentarily pushed back.</p>
      <p>But I frown.</p>
      <p>Only a slight mark is left.</p>
      <p>The fox isn't significantly harmed.</p>
      <p>
        A surprise attack with a Gang Sphere could injure an unprepared human
        Core Formation cultivator, but...
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s ineffective against a Core Formation demon fox, especially one
        charged with energy and boosted to the max.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engulfed in rage, the Core Formation demon fox, overwhelmed by my Sword
        Gang attack, grows even more infuriated. It gathers more energy, and
        roars.
      </p>
      <p>"You! I will kill you!"</p>
      <p>
        With a burst of white brilliance, several clones of the fox, resembling
        itself, appear around it. These massive clones turn into beams of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a loud bang, the rivers and lakes in Ascension Path explode, and
        mountains and hills crumble. The sound of the explosions echoe
        everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        I flee frantically towards the edge of Ascension Path, dodging the fox's
        relentless attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Damn, it's more resilient than a human cultivator and is prepared
        against my Gang Sphere. There's nothing I can do."
      </p>
      <p>
        At least my speed, enhanced beyond the Qi Refining stage, allows me to
        dodge the Core Formation demon fox's attacks.
      </p>
      <p>"Nothing works except for speed."</p>
      <p>
        Even then, my best strategy is to flee. Occasionally, the fox almost
        catches me using its strange magic.
      </p>
      <p>"I'll throw you out of Ascension Path, intruder!"</p>
      <p>"Wait, this is a misunderstanding..."</p>
      <p>
        As the fox opens its mouth, a white beam shoots out, narrowly missing
        me. Swallowing hard, I clench my teeth.
      </p>
      <p>"Damn that fox..."</p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, I am now far enough away from my colleagues. Even if the fox
        rampages in its frenzy, they should be safe.
      </p>
      <p>"Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts."</p>
      <p>
        My consciousness enters a blind spot in the fox's perception. To the
        fox, it must have looked like I vanished into thin air. The "Record of
        Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts" allows me to sever
        my consciousness and hide. The "Record of Surpassing Cultivation and
        Martial Arts" details how to channel one's consciousness into sword
        control, creating a phantom with one's intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        These techniques, along with others in the "Record of Surpassing Path
        and Martial Arts," are invaluable regardless of one's cultivation level.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Kim Hyung's martial arts are always useful, regardless of cultivation
        level.’
      </p>
      <p>Whenever I think about it, I find it amazing.</p>
      <p>"'Intruder! Show yourself, or face the consequences!"</p>
      <p>
        The fox's voice vibrates with spiritual power, searching for me in its
        blind spot.
      </p>
      <p>‘As long as I don't dig too deep, it won't notice.’</p>
      <p>
        With my current strength, I can stay hidden for days using the "Record
        of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial Arts," as long as I
        don't walk right in front of the fox.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I didn't expect to be running from the fox right at the start of this
        life…’
      </p>
      <p>
        I was too reckless, especially after reaching the peak of Ultimate
        Pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I should have just made the Inner Core and stayed quiet... The others
        should be able to last about three days, right? Or I could hide and
        return with the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting
        Martial Arts...’
      </p>
      <p>Then, the fox begins another spell.</p>
      <p>
        It glows intensely, and thousands of sharp, white thorns, each as
        powerful as my Gang Shere appear around it. These thorns cover the sky
        and the surrounding area, randomly plunging towards the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creatures and birds, sensing the ominous flow of energy, flee in all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>‘Damn that fox!’</p>
      <p>
        If all attacks are aimed at me, just like the ghost hands and insects, I
        could fend them off, but this random assault is hard to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>The white thorns begin to fall.</p>
      <p>
        Amidst the chaos, I accelerate my thoughts and dodge the thorns,
        stepping on the void. The nearby forest is instantly devastated.
      </p>
      <p>‘Good thing I'm away from my allies…’</p>
      <p>I reappear before the rampaging fox, sweating and exhausted.</p>
      <p>
        Even though I am far from my colleagues, I feel I need to go even
        further
      </p>
      <p>Three days have passed.</p>
      <p>
        I have been running from the fox non-stop. Despite its relentless
        pursuit, the Core Formation demon showed no signs of fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>"You should be tired by now. Why don't you show yourself?"</p>
      <p>
        Hidden by the Record of Transcending Cultivation and Exhausting Martial
        Arts, I catch my breath. My Inner Core is nearly depleted after three
        days of non-stop evasion.
      </p>
      <p>‘Damn this monster…’</p>
      <p>I frown and curse the fox in my mind.</p>
      <p>The fox's intent is shimmering gold.</p>
      <p>
        Initially full of vigilance and anger towards me, the intruder, it seems
        to have figured out the Record of Transcending Cultivation and
        Exhausting Martial Arts over the past few days. Now, it looks to be
        toying with me, probably planning to deliver a final blow once it gets
        bored.
      </p>
      <p>But I smirk, catching my breath.</p>
      <p>‘It's about time.’</p>
      <p>
        "Come out now, you unidentified demon beast. If you come out now, I will
        overlook your rudeness for brazenly invading my territory by just
        tearing off your limbs."
      </p>
      <p>
        With a sly smile, I deactivate the Record of Transcending Cultivation
        and Exhausting Martial Arts and stand in front of the fox.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, finally given up, have you?"</p>
      <p>
        "No, watch the flow of Yin and Yang carefully. Isn't the celestial
        energy around us trembling?"
      </p>
      <p>"What is this guy talking about..."</p>
      <p>
        The fox, who’s about to growl at me, pauses and widens its eyes in
        shock.
      </p>
      <p>The celestial energy is indeed trembling chaotically.</p>
      <p>Koogoo, koogoo!</p>
      <p>
        I hadn't noticed when I was weaker, but now that I've grown stronger, it
        became more apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The celestial energy and the flow of Yin and Yang are quivering and
        warping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without doing anything, just by emitting an aura, the mountains and
        rivers, the grass and trees, are trembling.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, aaaah..."</p>
      <p>The fox drools and looks up at the sky.</p>
      <p>Heavenly Being cultivators are approaching.</p>
      <p>"Hee, heek!"</p>
      <p>
        The fox, trembling with fear, tries to flee, but a person clad in black
        robe flicks their finger.
      </p>
      <p>"Kaaak!"</p>
      <p>
        The fox's soul is sucked into the sleeve of the person in the black
        robe.
      </p>
      <p>Kururung!</p>
      <p>
        A golden lightning bolt strikes from the sky, incinerating the fox's
        body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only the fox's bones and a radiant orb, seemingly a Demon Core, remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        A man in a golden robe makes a gesture, and the fox's Demon Core is
        sucked into his hand.
      </p>
      <p>"Ah, I'm too late. Then I'll take this."</p>
      <p>Woong!</p>
      <p>
        A giant in blue armor opens his storage device at his waist, and the
        fox's bones are absorbed into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What is this... I saw it from afar earlier. It was running away from
        the fox."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, I don't feel any spiritual energy... Perhaps it's a creature that
        mastered some special technique with Qi Building level consciousness?"
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, but can you give me that Demon Core?"</p>
      <p>It’s Jin Byuk-ho, White Bone Ghost Devil, and Sir Chang-ho.</p>
      <p>
        Jin Byuk-ho and White Bone Ghost Devil are murmuring to each other, and
        Sir Chang-ho asks Jin Byuk-ho for the Demon Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You're noisy, Cultivator Cheongmun. Anyway, I feel something like a
        Demon Core in that guy's dantian. Is he a human or a demon?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "If it's a hybrid, some demon traits should be visible, but that's not
        the case. At Nascent Soul level, he could be a demon disguised
        completely as a human, but he was being chased by a Core Formation level
        fox... What is this, really?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hey, Daoist Jin. Are we really doing this? That Demon Core has an
        energy that would be perfect for one of my disciples."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ignoring me, Sir Chang-ho keeps pestering Jin Byuk-ho, who eventually
        shouts in irritation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Didn't I say you're noisy! Behave like the renowned Chang-ho you are!"
      </p>
      <p>Kwarung!</p>
      <p>
        Just his anger causes lightning to strike from the sky, hitting Sir
        Chang-ho.
      </p>
      <p>"This guy, suddenly making a scene..!"</p>
      <p>Kwagwang!</p>
      <p>
        Sir Chang-ho, not one to back down, punches back at Jin Byuk-ho, and
        White Bone Ghost Devil, trying to intervene, gets caught in the fight,
        making it a three-way battle.
      </p>
      <p>Koogoo, koogoo!</p>
      <p>The celestial energy twists wildly, seeming to bring a storm.</p>
      <p>'Damn it..!'</p>
      <p>I’m caught in the storm of the fight and thrown into the air.</p>
      <p>"Ah, wait a minute. There was that guy."</p>
      <p>
        As if remembering me, Sir Chang-ho stretches his hand towards me,
        floating in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, the celestial energy around me moves and naturally brings me
        before him.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's stop the fight. What a disgrace in front of a young junior?"</p>
      <p>
        Sir Chang-ho, with a calm face, grabs the back of my neck and laughs
        heartily. Soon after, White Bone Ghost Devil and Jin Byuk-ho stopped
        fighting with irritated looks.
      </p>
      <p>"You're the one who started it...!"</p>
      <p>
        "What are you talking about? You suddenly lost your mind and struck me
        with lightning!"
      </p>
      <p>The three seemed to be fighting but didn't show any real animosity.</p>
      <p>'Were they close from the start?'</p>
      <p>
        [Anyway, what are you? Are you a human or a demon? How and why did you
        come to the Ascension Path?]
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Chang-ho asks me through consciousness, and I reply in Byeokra
        language.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm a human with a slightly unique constitution, not a hybrid. I got
        caught in a spatial rift while traveling with my companions and ended up
        in the Ascension Path."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, you speak the language of Byeokra. Indeed, you have a unique
        constitution. Upon closer inspection, your energy slightly differs from
        that of a Demon Core. Additionally, the spirit nature of a Qi Building
        level demon beast seems to be settled in you, but not to the extent of a
        real Qi Building level concentration."
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, that's correct."</p>
      <p>
        "A human possessing a Demon Core and not being a hybrid... what kind of
        constitution is this..."
      </p>
      <p>As Sir Chang-ho is examining me:</p>
      <p>Startled!</p>
      <p>
        Sir Chang-ho, Jin Byuk-ho, and White Bone Ghost Devil simultaneously
        look in one direction.
      </p>
      <p>"...This, this energy!"</p>
      <p>"It's not a mistaken feeling, is it!?"</p>
      <p>"Let's talk with you later. Let's go!"</p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>
        The three Heavenly Being cultivators take me and swiftly moves to one
        side.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a flash, it seemed as if there was a burst of light, and I found
        myself where I first woke up.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, my colleagues are being drained of blood and dying by a
        two-headed snake.
      </p>
      <p>[Huh, huh..!]</p>
      <p>
        The two-headed red snake shiveres and looks up, and at that moment,
        lightning strikes and erases the red snake from existence.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, these guys. I felt that energy from them..!"</p>
      <p>Sir Chang-ho grabs the back of my neck and descends.</p>
      <p>Blue energy radiates from his body, seeping into my colleagues.</p>
      <p>
        Then, my colleagues who were dying from the snake's blood draining are
        completely healed, their wounds disappearing.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, the selection process began.</p>
      <p>
        As before, Section Chief Jeon Myeong-hoon, Deputy Manager Kang Min-hee,
        and Chief Oh Hyun-seok were each seized by Jin Byuk-ho, White Bone Ghost
        Devil, and Sir Chang-ho.
      </p>
      <p>Then, I seized the opportunity and knelt before them.</p>
      <p>'I can't trust Mad Lord or Seo Hweol.'</p>
      <p>Of course, they could be no different.</p>
      <p>
        'But when I read the records of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect,
        they cherished their disciples. The soul fragment of the Nascent Soul
        left in the Black Ghost Valley's Nether Crossing Ship also tried to
        protect its sect before becoming a remnant soul. Sir Chang-ho is a man
        of good character...'
      </p>
      <p>I can't let Seo Hweol and Mad Lord take the others.</p>
      <p>
        "Seniors, please listen to what this junior has to say. I have always
        admired the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect..."
      </p>
      <p>I speak in the language of Shengzi to Jin Byuk-ho.</p>
      <p>"And I have respected the Azure Ghost Valley for its reputation."</p>
      <p>
        I say to White Bone Ghost Devil in the language of the islands of the
        Black Wind Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        I referred to the Black Ghost Valley as Azure Ghost Valley, remembering
        how the Heavenly Being’s fragment had called it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Also, the Cheongmun Clan, the descendants of Sir Chang-ho, is one of
        the great clans that venerates the Dao of Combat, as far as I know.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three Heavenly Being cultivators saw me and my colleagues possessing
        unique constitutions like the Heavenly Golden Thunder Body, Ghostly Yin
        Transformation Immortal Root, and Unique Holy Body.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are my originally separated companions, and the rest here also have
        quite good qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lack the qualifications, and I do not expect to be chosen by the
        seniors, but please show mercy and consider the qualities of the other
        two!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing my words, the three cultivators look at each other and seem
        to ponder for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, you're a polite one, so I'll forgive your forwardness. But
        qualifications or not, the others you call your companions have no
        spiritual qualities at all?"
      </p>
      <p>Jin Byuk-ho scoffs.</p>
      <p>
        "Rather than testing them, it would be better to test your
        qualifications, the one who fled from a Core Formation fox."
      </p>
      <p>Woosh!</p>
      <p>Celestial energy moves, pulling me in front of Jin Byuk-ho.</p>
      <p>
        Shortly after, under Jin Byuk-ho's will, the celestial energy rummages
        through my body, and he clicks his tongue.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What, you have Five Elements Spiritual Roots? While your unique ability
        seems useful, your training speed is too slow... Unfortunately, you're
        not needed."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing the term Five Elements Spiritual Roots, White Bone Ghost Devil
        and Sir Chang-ho also look a bit less interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Still, your escape from the Core Formation fox is impressive, so I'll
        give you a recommendation to join the Cheongmun Clan anytime. With your
        skills, you could even receive the position of an elder in one of my
        remaining branch families."
      </p>
      <p>
        White Bone Ghost Devil loses interest in me, and Sir Chang-ho draws a
        blue mark on the back of my hand, making the same offer as before.
      </p>
      <p>But I bite my lip and kneel before them again.</p>
      <p>
        'No, I can't let my remaining colleagues fall into the hands of Seo
        Hweol and Mad Lord.'
      </p>
      <p>
        "To the noble three Heavenly Being cultivators, I want to explain the
        qualities possessed by my colleagues."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Stop talking nonsense. Didn't I say your colleagues have no spiritual
        qualities whatsoever?"
      </p>
      <p>Jin Byuk-ho speaks with an irritated voice.</p>
      <p>
        However, I explain with desperation in my voice the qualities of Manager
        Kim Yeon and Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo to the three cultivator..
      </p>
      <p>
        After hearing my explanation, the eyes of the three Heavenly Beings
        change again.
      </p>
      <p>"Huh, is that really true? It's not some extravagant lie?"</p>
      <p>"You, what a novel-like story..."</p>
      <p>"It's too fanciful... but fine."</p>
      <p>Sir Chang-ho laughs heartily.</p>
      <p>
        "I've met a pure-blooded human with a Demon Core in his dantian, and now
        I've met three people with mythical qualities. Let's believe it for now.
        Hey, Heo Gwak"
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Chang-ho gestures to White Bone Ghost Devil to start with Oh Hye-seo
        and Kim Yeon.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The most proficient in consciousness techniques among us is you, so you
        go check that woman first."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmph, ridiculous. A consciousness that covers heaven and earth? If such
        a thing existed, that mortal's head would have exploded long ago."
      </p>
      <p>
        White Bone Ghost Devil approaches Kim Yeon with skeptical eyes, and she
        tries to step back, but they flick their finger, and dark shadows grab
        and immobilize her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Yeon, not seeing the black shadows, thinks her body just wouldn't
        move and screams. White Bone Ghost Devil placed their hand on her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, suddenly, ghostly energy from their fingertips enters her head.
      </p>
      <p>'That flow is...'</p>
      <p>It’s similar to the secret techniques of the Jin Clan.</p>
      <p>
        It seems that the Jin Clan's secret techniques are influenced by the
        Black Ghost Valley.
      </p>
      <p>The next moment.</p>
      <p>"Aaaah!"</p>
      <p>Blood drips from Kim Yeon's eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>
      <p>At the same time.</p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Weak spiritual energy bursts from her upper dantian, and consciousness
        like threads extends in all four directions, covering the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stunned by the sight, White Bone Ghost Devil, Jin Byuk-ho, and Sir
        Chang-ho suddenly rush to her side and shake her vigorously.
      </p>
      <p>
        [If you join the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, I'll give you the
        position of my previous disciple!]
      </p>
      <p>
        [The same goes for my sect! Become my disciple, and you'll have the same
        share as the current sect leader!]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Forget them! I'll feed you as much spirit-enhancing elixir as you want
        if you join the Heaven Creation Sect! I'll even hand over the position
        of sect leader to you!]
      </p>
      <p>Whooosh!</p>
      <p>
        As White Bone Ghost Devil manipulates the ghostly energy, Kim Yeong’s
        swelling upper dantian begins to stabilize.
      </p>
      <p>'Yes, this should do it.'</p>
      <p>
        Now that Kim Yeon's qualities have been confirmed, they will definitely
        check Deputy Manager Oh’s qualities.
      </p>
      <p>If so, they will not fall into the hands of Seo Hweol and Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>
        'The Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, Black Ghost Valley, and Heaven
        Creation Sect...'
      </p>
      <p>They are sects that at least take care of their own.</p>
      <p>Not cunning and ruthless like Seoh Hweol, nor insane like Mad Lord.</p>
      <p>
        'Since Seo Hweol and Mad Lord will appear tomorrow, if they take
        them...'
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly,</p>
      <p>Whisk, whisk, whisk!</p>
      <p>
        The three Heavenly Beings, arguing over Kim Yeon, look in the direction
        of the Ascension Gate.
      </p>
      <p>There, something small is flying towards us.</p>
      <p>"What..."</p>
      <p>I recognize the identity of the dot and lose my composure.</p>
      <p>'Not appearing tomorrow?'</p>
      <p>[Mad Lord!]</p>
      <p>Jin Byuk-ho shouts as if screaming his name.</p>
      <p>Koooung!</p>
      <p>
        In an instant, a giant puppet arrives at our location. The hunchback old
        man with silver hair sitting on it looks down at us, smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Oh, I thought a cultivator from the Upper Realms had descended. Turns
        out it’s just a small mortal. What unbelievable talent. I must take her
        as my disciple.]

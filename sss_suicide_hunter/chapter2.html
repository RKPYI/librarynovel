      <p>Skill.</p>
      <p>A word that reduced many Hunters to tears.</p>
      <p>Conditions for awakening a skill vary from person to person:</p>
      <p>
        I struck a scarecrow 10,000 times in the training room. Then, it
        naturally appeared.
      </p>
      <p>One day, I suddenly heard a voice from God!</p>
      <p>Magic? I was able to use it soon after entering the Tower.</p>
      <p>
        Hunters with good personalities and strong willpower struggled to climb
        to higher heights because they lacked skills. In contrast, there were
        Hunters with dog shit personalities living good lives thanks to their
        skills. The Flame Emperor, who represented Rank 1, was the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we compared life to a game, wouldn’t the Flame Emperor be playing a
        game where luck was a skill? He could get anything he wanted with his
        luck skill.
      </p>
      <p>In contrast… my life was comparable to a typical shitty RNG game.</p>
      <p>
        I grumbled and heaved as I stumbled along who knew where. I’d left the
        bar after getting shit-wasted, but I couldn’t remember when that was. I
        entered an alley and more sludge spewed from my mouth. I swayed, my eyes
        focusing on my vomit: I recognized some of the food I’d eaten before.
      </p>
      <p>“You are unlucky” is what my vomit seemed to be telling me.</p>
      <p>
        “Shit…” I slurred. “If I am supposed to be unlucky, then don’t give me
        any luck at all. This false hope has killed me.”
      </p>
      <p>When you play a game, when do you feel despair?</p>
      <p>
        Those who have played gacha games on their phones would understand. It
        is not when you can’t get a single 5-Star unit after multiple pulls—It’s
        when you get that 5-Star that just happens to be utter garbage. A 5-Star
        that’s worse than a 3-Star.
      </p>
      <p>Hell, my 5-Star was worse than a 1-Star.</p>
      <p>I hurled again but nothing came out except a sob. “Fuck!”</p>
      <p>Yeah. My life was truly a shitty RNG game.</p>
      <p>
        Normally after awakening a skill, you had to report it to the Hunter
        Bureau. But I didn’t report it. Like hell I would. This shit was too
        depressing. Too embarrassing. Why the hell should I show them such a
        trash skill? Like, what would I say or how would it go:
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hello, Hunter-nim,” they would say. “ How did you awaken your skill?”
      </p>
      <p>What could I say? “Uh—I was envious of the Rank 1.”</p>
      <p>“Excuse me?” Their faces would distort in confusion.</p>
      <p>
        So, just to make it all better, I’d expound further. “I thought I would
        go insane because of my envy and jealousy. Then the Tower
        <em>tossed</em> me a skill like it was telling me to eat this and get
        lost.” Here was where I’d flourish my hand as if I was discussing a fine
        reward I casually got. “It even told me that I’m an ugly person with the
        greatest envy,” I’d say with a laugh. Haha. Right.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not like I could say that! As if there was any way to tell anyone
        about this. I alone would laugh and be miserable at my unlucky, shitty
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I drank to my heart’s content and ended up wobbling around in a
        remote alley.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though, nothing had changed—I was still failing. I couldn’t even wobble
        properly. Without realizing, I’d staggered into an unknown alley. I
        couldn’t remember how or when I got here. Where the fuck I was, that was
        anyone’s guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could I just fall asleep on the floor like this? ‘<em
          >Ah. This is sad.</em
        >’ So unlucky. I held back my tears.
      </p>
      <p>
        A faint scream rose on the night’s air. It came from the other side of
        the alley.
      </p>
      <p>The pained voice begged, “…please, ugh! Why are you…”</p>
      <p>Instantly, my drowsiness disappeared.</p>
      <p>
        That voice was too real to be mistaken as a drunken hallucination. While
        I could not know who it was, I understood that what was happening was
        life threatening.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘<em>What’s going on?</em>’ I wondered, treading silently.
        Instinctively, I held my breath. One step at a time, I quietly stepped
        towards the alley where the scream originated.
      </p>
      <p>As I approached, the voices became clearer.</p>
      <p>This was—</p>
      <p>“F-Flame Emperor-nim. Why are you suddenly—” a female voice said.</p>
      <p>“—No use. No one is nearby to—” a male voice said.</p>
      <p>—This was—the second stupid mistake I made today.</p>
      <p>
        The first mistake—drinking until my mind fuse broke. Throughout my
        entire life, I never got dead drunk. However, today was an exception. I
        was extremely furious to find out that my first S-Rank skill was shit,
        so I ended up drinking makgeolli like water. [1]
      </p>
      <p>My second mistake—not running away as soon as I heard the scream.</p>
      <p>
        “I’ve poisoned your drinking cup in advance,” the male voice said. I
        couldn’t figure out why he sounded so familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        “P-poison? Flame Emperor-nim, I can’t understand what you are saying.”
        Even the woman’s voice. She sounded altruistic.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hey, your acting is pretty good. If someone else saw you, they would be
        fooled.”
      </p>
      <p>A dead end.</p>
      <p>
        In the dark alley without any street lights, there was indeed a man and
        a woman. Perhaps it was weird to describe them as <em>simply</em> being
        <em>there</em>. The man was threatening the woman and the woman was
        being threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Basilisk’s stomach acid,” the man said. “Originally, you would have
        poisoned my drinking cup with this. Wow. If it wasn’t for my skill, I
        would have been in deep trouble. Hm? What’s wrong? You look pale, Miss
        Saintess.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Is it the Ten Thousand Poison Immunity (萬毒不侵)…? I-impossible! You
        shouldn’t have such a skill.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Of course not.” The man laughed, the up and down of it echoing softly.
        “But I have a skill that’s slightly better than the Ten Thousand Poison
        Immunity.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I realized who this man was. No matter how dark the alley was,
        I could see the man’s back—I couldn’t possibly miss that ponytail. I’d
        seen him and his feats surround me in my room every single day for the
        last ten years. And I’d seen him from TV just last night. I’d always
        wished to be just like him.
      </p>
      <p>‘<em>It is actually the real Flame Emperor!</em>’ I goggled.</p>
      <p>
        The Rank 1 Hunter. The protagonist of this era. An idol who tens of
        thousands of people looked up to. And because of that, he was the hero
        who received all the attention and envy… especially my envy.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, ‘<em>Isn’t she the Saintess!?</em>’</p>
      <p>
        I covered my mouth to hold my breath. The Saintess. A Rank 9 Hunter who
        was selected by the Bureau. She is rumored to be dating the Flame
        Emperor. It was her recent behavior that sparked the entire scandal. The
        greatest beauty, who I’ve only seen from Internet photos and videos, was
        right there.
      </p>
      <p>
        “But playtime is over,” the Flame Emperor said. “It’s time to pay the
        price for going against me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        And she wasn’t just standing <em>there</em>. She was being threatened.
        “W-wait a moment, Flame Emperor-nim,” she begged. “You must have
        misunderstood… I only wish to clear the Tower with you as a team!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I thought so too, but that wasn’t the case,” the Flame Emperor said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Please wait a moment! Think about it. If we team up, we can easily
        clear up to the 40th floor! We might even clear up to the 50th floor in
        a year! That’s right! It’s the place that humanity has not reached yet,
        but if it’s the two of us—”
      </p>
      <p>“I thought so too, but that wasn’t the case,” he said again.</p>
      <p>
        Dumbfounded, I thought, ‘<em>Weren’t those two… dating?</em>’ The
        Internet said so. Even broadcasters discussed the two heroes’ passionate
        love. But the scene in front of me had no elements of romance
        whatsoever. It was difficult to even joke about it being a lover’s
        quarrel.
      </p>
      <p>Murderous intent (殺意).</p>
      <p>
        I only saw a man who wanted to murder and a woman who clung on for dear
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Please! Let’s just talk to clear up the misunderstanding,” she cried.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Talk? Ah, talk. Alright. It’s the courteous thing to do.” The Flame
        Emperor seized the Saintess’ neck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her voice let out a loud choking noise before her air was completely cut
        off. After that, only small groans sounded.
      </p>
      <p>“But, I’ll decide the rules and who gets to talk,” he growled.</p>
      <p>
        The Saintess struggled as she suffocated. I watched her struggle and I
        also felt like suffocating. Unbelievable. Oh my God. Something that
        shouldn’t be happening was happening in front of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’ll ask the questions. Just answer me. Ah, you don’t need to talk.
        Simply nod your head to answer. Okay?”
      </p>
      <p>She strove to nod, whimpering. I gulped in fear and sympathy.</p>
      <p>
        “If you answer sincerely, I’ll let you live. I’ll even give you the
        antidote. But if you ignore my personal consideration… Well, do I need
        to explain further? I heard you graduated from Oxford. Use your smart
        head.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Saintess desperately attacked the Flame Emperor’s arm latched onto
        her neck.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sound of her scrambling made its way to my ears but nothing
        happened. It was impossible for the the Saintess, who was well known as
        one of the best healers, to physically win against the Flame Emperor.
      </p>
      <p>“Truthfully speaking, I only have one question for you.”</p>
      <p>The Saintess fought for air.</p>
      <p>
        “Who commanded you to kill me. Just answer me that. Was it the Black
        Dragon’s Witch?”
      </p>
      <p>The Saintess flinched and stopped struggling.</p>
      <p>
        “Think carefully before you answer,” the Flame Emperor said. “I might
        not have Ten Thousand Poison Immunity, but I do have a Lie Detection
        skill. If you lie to me and I find it out, I’ll burn even your bones
        into ashes.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Saintess didn’t answer right away. In the dark alley, it was
        difficult to see her face. However, you could feel her silence. While
        the Flame Emperor was watching, the Saintess slowly nodded her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I knew it.” His small laughter rose in the air between them. “Goodbye,
        Saintess Isabelle.”
      </p>
      <p>Flames erupted.</p>
      <p>
        The fire swallowed the entire alley. It spread from the Flame Emperor’s
        grasp to the Saintess’ neck and then her entire body was engulfed in
        flames. She started to desperately struggle. It was her last resort to
        live. But no matter how hard she floundered against him, she could not
        escape the Flame Emperor’s grasp.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Flame Emperor merely gazed at the burning Saintess. Untouched by his
        own affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of the scorching flames, the Flame Emperor was calm. Being
        perfectly calm, he held onto the Saintess’ neck until the very end. The
        Saintess swung both of her arms. She dug her nails into the Flame
        Emperor’s arm and tried to scratch it. In the end, she reached towards
        the sky… and stopped soon after.
      </p>
      <p>She went limp.</p>
      <p>And she did not move anymore.</p>
      <p>
        Emotions roiled in my stomach and smashed into my chest. ‘<em
          >That crazy bastard!</em
        >’
      </p>
      <p>
        A hero of humanity died <em>right</em> in front of me. It was wrong to
        even say she simply <em>died.</em> That’s right-—her death was not
        normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was murdered. Murdered by another hero of humanity, the Flame
        Emperor.
      </p>
      <p>‘A <em>madman.</em>’</p>
      <p>
        The Saintess was now just a burnt corpse. Even so, the flames did not
        stop. The Flame Emperor did not stop there. He burned everything until
        her flesh and bones melted. He did so with an emotionless face from
        beginning to end.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘<em>He is not sane.</em>’ I took a step back. ‘<em
          >I need to leave immediately.</em
        >’
      </p>
      <p>And thus, I made the third mistake of today. My final mistake—</p>
      <p>Crunch—</p>
      <p>
        It was a small sound. I didn’t step on a can. Instead, it was a small
        glass shard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it was a glass shard from a shattered soju bottle. [2] Maybe it
        was carried by the wind from another place… I didn’t fucking know how it
        got there. Rather, there was no need to know.
      </p>
      <p>Instead, there two things I really needed to understand:</p>
      <p>First, I’d made a retarded mistake.</p>
      <p>
        “…Hoh,” the Flame Emperor’s voice turned towards where I was hiding.
      </p>
      <p>
        And second, the Flame Emperor was not a predator who would miss out on
        another person’s mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I thought I took care of all the rats nearby. I guess one slipped.” His
        eyes found mine.
      </p>
      <p>I ran.</p>
      <p>
        I ran without looking back. Those were the eyes of a murderer. Not
        someone who killed one or two but someone who killed tens. Perhaps even
        more. His eyes were like a fucking demon.
      </p>
      <p>And that demon was trying to kill me.</p>
      <p>
        “Ha? How cute.” As soon as the Flame Emperor sneered, a hot sensation
        pierced near my ankle, and in the next moment, I rolled along the
        ground. At first, I couldn’t understand how I tripped.
      </p>
      <p>At least not until I saw my legs on the floor.</p>
      <p>“H-hiik…!?” A screech escaped my lips.</p>
      <p>
        My legs were severed. My legs. Both of them were chopped. Left and
        right. They were still wearing shoes, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could even see the famous brand logo drawn on the side of the
        sneakers.
      </p>
      <p>“P-please let me live! Please!” I begged. Just like the Saintess.</p>
      <p>
        “Then why did you run? You fucking scared me,” the Flame Emperor said,
        bending over. He picked up one of my legs. Then he started playing catch
        with it like it was a baseball. “Hey. Did you see?” he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        My eyes followed the up and down of my leg in the air. To his hands. And
        then back in the air. “I d-didn’t see anything!”
      </p>
      <p>The Flame Emperor approached closer. “What did you not see?”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know anything! Ugh. Please. I don’t know…”</p>
      <p>“What do you not know?”</p>
      <p>
        “Please… Flame Emperor-nim. Please… let me live. I won’t say anything. I
        won’t tell anyone.”
      </p>
      <p>I felt his presence above my head.</p>
      <p>
        He was bending his knees to look down on me. “Wow. So you’re telling me
        that you saw me and even recognized me? You might as well have seen it
        all. You probably know everything, too.”
      </p>
      <p>“Please…”</p>
      <p>
        “Hyung-ssi, you’re disappointing me. [3] Why are you acting like you
        know nothing?” The Flame Emperor probed my leg. “Tell me. Who sent you?
        Is it the Black Dragon again?”
      </p>
      <p>“I… really don’t know… anything…”</p>
      <p>
        “You’re still telling me that you don’t know anything but happened to
        watch over me and the Saintess from there? Silently, like a fucking rat?
        Hey, now. Hyung-ssi, your story is so reliable. If I was a bit more
        retarded, I would have probably believed you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Flame Emperor grinned. “But you see, I’m not a retard. Are you
        fucking mocking me?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Sparks of fire erupted in front of me. Flames erupted from the Flame
        Emperor’s palm and it spread onto my legs. The burst of fire eating my
        legs sounded like a barbecue, the wafting smell of roasting meat reached
        my overwhelmed senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        He burned everything, leaving nothing behind. Not even the famous brand
        logo. Not even the shoes I’d worn for so long. Not even my legs, which
        were part of me for even longer.
      </p>
      <p>All of it disappeared.</p>
      <p>“Next will be your head. Answer me straight.”</p>
      <p>My mind became all white.</p>
      <p>This demon… was insane.</p>
      <p>
        He was a madman. There was no point in talking to a madman. He didn’t
        care about what others thought, and he firmly believed he was always
        right. He was a fucking psychopath who would kill innocent people for no
        reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who represented Rank 1. As a person, how could he do this?
      </p>
      <p>You’re telling me that I was obsessed over someone like him?</p>
      <p>
        Many people—including me—believed he was a hero. We liked him for being
        upfront and honest. We praised him as someone with a refreshing
        personality. This fucking lunatic?
      </p>
      <p>“L-lie…” I stumbled.</p>
      <p>“What?” he asked.</p>
      <p>
        “Lie Detection skill… I heard you have a Lie Detection skill.” I
        desperately continued talking. “You told the Saintess that you can tell
        when someone lies. And that she should answer sincerely.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Flame Emperor didn’t react, I continued, “So test me with that
        skill. Test me to see if my words are a lie or not. Flame Emperor-nim… I
        just happen to, really coincidentally, pass by. Please believe in me!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Flame Emperor’s expression became strange. “I made that up,” he
        said.

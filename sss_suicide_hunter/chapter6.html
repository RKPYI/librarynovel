        <p>(T/N: Hi guys, I’m just making this little note to say a few things before we start. This novel is really
            interesting and the previous translation group did a really good job with it. Especially with their skill
            cards and forum comments and stuff. But I won’t do that(read can’t) and so I will just put it the way I
            know-how(i.e. using just punctuation marks). Maybe if I encounter someone who is able to/willing to do it I
            will try, but no promises. So please excuse the differences. Alright that’s enough of me, hope you enjoy
            this novel.)</p>
        <p>“Kuk…uk…ugh!”</p>
        <p>People always believed that there was a higher chance of awakening while in a life and death situation. In
            fact such a myth had been passed down in the hunter industry since its inception.</p>
        <p>But maybe it wasn’t a myth, maybe it was real. Even I had awakened a skill simply for having an excessive
            amount of jealousy.</p>
        <p>Therefore I remained vigilant and shook my knife.</p>
        <p>“Hik!”</p>
        <p>I wouldn’t give this psychopath a chance.</p>
        <p>“Kuk!”</p>
        <p>He would die.</p>
        <p>“Uh…”</p>
        <p>But what angered me the most, rather than the fact that this psychopath burned me to death so casually, it
            was something which caused anger to burn in me more intensely than even the pain and the desperation.</p>
        <p>‘He told me his name.’</p>
        <p>Before returning me to the past, before holding onto my head and lighting it on fire. The Flame Emperor told
            me something with a smile.</p>
        <p>‘But you know who I am, and you saw me kill the Saintess so you have to die. My name is Yoo Soo-ha. Goodbye.’
        </p>
        <p>The thing that crazy guy had said last. One weird part that I just couldn’t stand. It was extremely
            disgusting.</p>
        <p>‘He told me his name.’</p>
        <p>Why did he tell me his name before he killed me. Did he think that I didn’t know what the name of the Flame
            Emperor was?</p>
        <p>‘He must’ve thought it was cool.’</p>
        <p>The Flame Emperor.</p>
        <p>That bastard probably thought that the scene looked cool. As if in a sacred duel where the warriors learned
            their opponents name. This is what the Flame Emperor must have thought as he killed me.</p>
        <p>‘Whoever I kill, I do it in fairness. So at least I’m not being too imposing.’</p>
        <p>How dare-.</p>
        <p>“Like that-.”</p>
        <p>How dare a psychopath like you.</p>
        <p>“Think something like that.”</p>
        <p>A man who killed a witness just because he stumbled across the scene. A person who pretended to be blameless
            as he came back to inspect the fire he created. A person like that could no longer be called human. He was a
            beast. A devil, even worse than a beast. Who acted cool as if it made him more noble.</p>
        <p>“Don’t mess with me!”</p>
        <p>Puk!</p>
        <p>My knife stabbed into Yoo Soo-ha’s neck again.</p>
        <p>“…”</p>
        <p>There was no sound. No scream, no moan. The hunting ground was hidden, far away from where anyone would be
            active.</p>
        <p>I looked up to the sky, but my eyes weren’t in focus and my body was swaying like a weed in the breeze.</p>
        <p>He was dead.</p>
        <p>“Haha…”</p>
        <p>Maybe it wasn’t appropriate to say ‘dead’. Yoo Soo-ha was more than just an ordinary hunter, and it wasn’t
            simply that he was dead.</p>
        <p>The man who would’ve become the Flame Emperor someday. A legend who had reached the top of the world’s
            rankings. The one who managed to single-handedly defeat 10 floors in the tower that no one had been able to
            reach even after trying for years. He was killed by me</p>
        <p>“Hooo…”</p>
        <p>I sighed.</p>
        <p>“Now I can be a little sane again.”</p>
        <p>As I turned to head back, I heard something arrive, probably drawn by the smell of blood.</p>
        <p>A pack of wolves were crouched among the trees.</p>
        <p>Great…</p>
        <p>These weren’t ordinary wolves. They were engraved by what appeared to be tattoos which could be seen even
            through their thick hair. These were Meadow Wolves and the more complex the patterns on their bodies, the
            stronger they were.</p>
        <p>Though these Meadow Wolves only had the simplest patterns on their bodies, an F-class hunter like me couldn’t
            possibly fight them.</p>
        <p>“…”</p>
        <p>First I carefully retrieved the wallet that was stolen by Yoo Soo-ha and stepped back.</p>
        <p>“You guys want to eat this guy right?”</p>
        <p>I pointed at the body.</p>
        <p>“I don’t need it. You can have it.”</p>
        <p>I took another step back.</p>
        <p>‘Come on.’</p>
        <p>The wolves cautiously approached the body.</p>
        <p>Crack!</p>
        <p>One of the wolves took a bite, and that seemed to be a signal for the rest of them.</p>
        <p>Crack! Crack!</p>
        <p>Soon the body couldn’t be seen as it was completely covered by wolves.</p>
        <p>“Eat well.”</p>
        <p>I hurried away.</p>
        <p>‘Is it over now?’</p>
        <p>I buried the clothes that had been splattered with Yoo Soo-ha’s blood in a deep pit I’d prepared before the
            fight. As I washed my whole body with water from a plastic bottle and changed into a new set of clothes from
            my backpack, it still hadn’t sunk in yet.</p>
        <p>‘Is it really over?’</p>
        <p>If my clothes were too clean, people might be suspicious of me. So I deliberately rolled on the ground for a
            bit before heading back to Babylon, the city on the first floor of the tower.</p>
        <p>As I walked up to the gates, a guard watched me closely for a moment before yawning and turning away.</p>
        <p>‘Ah.’</p>
        <p>No one had realised.</p>
        <p>‘It’s over.’</p>
        <p>Even when I went to a bar and ordered a beer. Even when I emptied the beer and ordered another one, no one
            cared about me. No one knew what I’d done.</p>
        <p>Old news played on the tavern’s television.</p>
        <p>-Today, the strategy which was guaranteed to clear the 10th floor failed.</p>
        <p>-Hunters ranked 2nd and 7th in the world intend to challenge and defeat the 10th floor together…</p>
        <p>-Voices of protest against the world’s number one hunter continually grow stronger. This is due to the fact
            that the Sword Saint still refuses to work with anyone else.</p>
        <p>No matter how long I waited, there was no breaking news like, ‘A hunter has disappeared on the second Floor
            of the tower.’ But I should’ve expected that.</p>
        <p>Novice hunters lost their lives every day. No one really cared about the disappearance of a lone novice, no
            one cared about me.</p>
        <p>In other words.</p>
        <p>‘It’s over!’</p>
        <p>“Hey.”</p>
        <p>I lifted my empty glass high.</p>
        <p>“Pour another draft for me!”</p>
        <p>“You sure are drinking a lot. Was your hunt good today?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah it was good. Very good!”</p>
        <p>Even as I said this, my heart wasn’t settled.</p>
        <p>I took two or three hours calming my heart with beer.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t until sunset that I gradually began to accept the reality.</p>
        <p>‘What should I do now?’</p>
        <p>There was a lot to do.</p>
        <p>‘I could win the lottery. I would get the money and no one would suspect a thing. Hey, my life is about to
            get better!’</p>
        <p>I opened my status window which could only be viewed by myself.</p>
        <p>[Name: Kim Gongja]</p>
        <p> Rank: F-Class</p>
        <p> Skills (2/4) :</p>
        <p> I want to Become Just Like You (S+) : Passive</p>
        <p> Returner’s Clockwork Watch (EX) : Passive</p>
        <p> None</p>
        <p> None</p>
        <p>“Kya. Now I’m not even hungry anymore.”</p>
        <p>My status window was like the most delicious meal in the world. One S+ class skill and an EX class skill that
            I’d never even heard about. When it came to meals, this was like having caviar on top of my steak.</p>
        <p>‘If there is someone with better skills than this then they are truly broken.’</p>
        <p>But I couldn’t stop the warm smile from spreading across my face.</p>
        <p>‘…But i have no combat skill.’</p>
        <p>Ah…</p>
        <p>Why was the human mind like this? The thing I didn’t have was the thing that I noticed the most.</p>
        <p>“No matter how easy it is to make money, a hunter must be a hunter… even with all the money in the world,
            without power then it would eventually be robbed .”</p>
        <p>The society in the tower was much more bloody than the outside world. To put it nicely, the strong ate well,
            and the weak were the meat. It didn’t matter even if you wanted to escape the tower and live lavishly in the
            outside world.</p>
        <p>‘Those who stepped foot in the tower could never leave.’</p>
        <p>Those were the rules. Not even a hunter with an S class teleportation ability could go out of the tower. It
            was simply impossible.</p>
        <p>Only one being in all of Babylon could interact with the outside world. The Guildmaster of the Shanglian
            Guild. The only hunter with the title ‘Count.’</p>
        <p>‘Even then, they could only send and receive things from the outside world, they couldn’t directly leave.’
        </p>
        <p>Anyone could enter, but no one could exit.</p>
        <p>This meant that those who had entered had abandoned their wealth, their relationships, their nationality,
            their identity. Maybe…even their humanity.</p>
        <p>“Indeed.”</p>
        <p>Of course, I was one of those people.</p>
        <p>“Eat or be eaten, that was the law in the tower.”</p>
        <p>The alcohol made me a little drunk and I couldn’t help but mutter. I wanted to succeed so badly it drove me
            crazy. There was a reason why I idolized the Flame Emperor so much. Was it because of his personality? Did
            that guy even have something that could be called a personality?</p>
        <p>No, the reason was much simpler. I was envious of his success. His achievements had been dazzling,
            awe-inspiring.</p>
        <p>“Let’s succeed Kim Gong-ja. Okay? What can’t a man who died 4090 times do? It’s time to be successful…”</p>
        <p>Then.</p>
        <p>Jallang!</p>
        <p>The bell on the tavern’s front door rang.</p>

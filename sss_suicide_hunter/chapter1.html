        <p>I envied him.</p>
        <p>While blankly staring at the TV, I thought to myself: <i>‘I envy him. I envy him so much—it’s driving me
                crazy.’</i></p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hello Flame Emperor-nim!</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The Flame Emperor furrowed his eyebrows. For some reason, even his scrunched brows looked handsome.</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have set a new record once again! You are the only person who can single-handedly subjugate
                        a boss monster. May I ask you to share your impressions?</li>

            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>First of all, I would like you to change that shitty title.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I’m talking about the Flame Emperor. Call me by my name instead of using that shitty title.
                        Like, what is the Flame Emperor supposed to mean? It’s embarrassing. I would rather be called
                        the Plague than the Flame Emperor. [1] Someday, I’ll definitely find the bastard who gave me
                        this title and beat the living shit out of him.</li>

        <p>The surprised reporter stuttered. He could only stammer, unable to respond. Because the formidable man in
            front of him was widely known as the protagonist of this era. The subject of countless legends being
            written.</p>
        <p>In comparison, I was just an extra who couldn’t even take on a minor role.</p>
        <p>“Aaah,” I mumbled. “I really envy him.” How nice would it be to live a life like him? A life where you can
            say anything in front of a camera. I touched my smartphone and entered a random Internet community bulletin
            board for Hunters. I wanted to see how others reacted to the interview.</p>

            Hunters in Korea. As a fellow Korean, I feel embarrassed whenever the interview gets transloted and
            distributed across the globe…</p>

        <p>Along with the Flame Emperor, the Saintess was one of the most popular Hunters. In one post, someone even
            kindly left an attachment file called, “Best Photo of the Saintess.” She was famous for her exceptional
            beauty that matched her stellar personality. And he is dating her?</p>

        <p>were all written by me. I wrote those posts as I surfed across a whole bunch of conversations. I would
            normally leave this comment on <i>every</i> post I visited. Why have I posted the same remark over and over?
        </p>
        <p>Because: “I envy him! I really envy him! I want to be successful, too!”</p>
        <p>Because I’m envious. This is how I truly feel. Since I live alone in a single room apartment, I can honestly
            admit how envious I am. Because I live alone. Because it’s my space.</p>
        <p>So, of course, if anyone were to enter <i>my space, </i>they would be shocked. To say the least. Every wall
            held countless magazine and newspaper scraps accounting the adventures of the World’s Rank 1 Hunter, the
            Flame Emperor. Every day, I’m surrounded on all sides by his great legacy.</p>
        <p>『The Flame Emperor single-handedly subjugates the 39th floor!』</p>
        <p> 『The Flame Emperor solo clears the 38th floor! Another legendary feat!』</p>
        <p> 『Hunter Yoo Sooha crowned as the World’s Rank 1. The first Korean to achieve it!』</p>

        <p> 『Disappearance of the Sword Saint & the empty Rank 1. Who will take the throne? Expert foreigners believe
            “Yoo Sooha from Korea is the best candidate.”』</p>
        <p> 『The impregnable 10th floor cleared! Who is the mysterious hero?』</p>
        <p> 『22 days since the Sword Saint’s disappearance. Will the Hunter Association face its worst crisis?』</p>
        <p>The oldest articles dated back to 10 years ago, their yellow and curling edges proof of the time I’ve
            followed his feats. Of course, the newest articles of him held firmly to the wall, pristine and flawless.
            This was history. The Flame Emperor’s history. No. This was Hunter Yoo Sooha’s history that was recorded
            long before he received the title, and it surrounded me in all its glory. In this room. With me.</p>
        <p>Ahhh. I clutched my head, staring at his accomplishments all around me.</p>
        <p><i>‘I want to be successful too! Just like the Flame Emperor!’</i></p>
        <p>I want to be <i>so</i> successful that others would become envious of me. By becoming successful, I would
            make an example out of everyone who looked down on me or failed to respect me. After making an example of
            them, I would tell them to “Live properly from now on.” Afterward, I’d kindly forgive them. I would forgive
            them<i>—</i>then everyone would praise me as a man with a big heart.</p>
        <p>A <i>hero </i>with a big heart.</p>

        <p>The Flame Emperor scratched the back of his head. His front hair was pulled back and tied with a rubber band.
            Was that hairstyle called a ponytail? His black hair, which was long like a horse tail, shook a bit.</p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>But, don’t get in my way even if you succeed. Or I’ll kill you.</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>And it really ended with that. The Flame Emperor left the camera and walked away, alone. The reporter
            shouted, “Flame Emperor-nim! Flame Emperor-nim! What do you mean by that?” But he was completely ignored.

            bottom of my heart, I was boiling mad.</p>
        <p>“If I just had one decent skill,” I said out loud to myself. Yearning was clear in my voice, but I didn’t
            care. To wish and to reach for something better was human nature.</p>
        <p>In reality, I was the lowest F-Class Hunter. I didn’t have such things like making the Internet heated up—in
            real time—from an interview. Or having people interested in trivial matters of my private life. Or most
            importantly, succeeding with my own skills… and becoming rich. My life was far from such a successful life.
            Light-years away, if I was being honest.</p>
        <p>But I didn’t care about petty semantics right now. What I wanted in this moment wasn’t to highlight how
            unattractive my life was. It was my yearning. “I want to succeed,” I said to the walls all around me. “I
            want to have an S-Rank skill too.” I considered the Flame Emperor’s bold face and all of the exclamations
            telling of his prestige. “And it’s not about the money,” I said. “I just want to succeed. How great would it
            be if the Flame Emperor’s skill was mine!”</p>
        <p>If someone saw my current state, they would probably think I was insane. Obsessive. A freak. Annoying. After
            all, I was talking to myself and being quite explicit about my desires. But I’ll say this again. As many
            times as it takes. This is <i>my </i>single room apartment—my space. And in my room, I will say it out loud
            as many times as it takes.</p>
        <p>“I want to succeed!”</p>
        <p>And I’ll continue saying this because venting out my frustration in an empty area is my unique stress
            relieving method. It’s really unsightly to see, but who cares? It’s better than going outside and disturbing
            others.</p>
        <p>It’s not like anyone was listening to me.</p>
        <p>“… Huh?”</p>
        <p>But it seemed like I was wrong.</p>
        <p> As if someone heard me, a golden light flashed in front of me!</p>
        <p>“I-Is this…?”</p>
        <p>A scene that I’ve only seen from videos. A scene that I’ve rewatched hundreds of times—no, thousands of
            times. A scene that fueled my envy every morning because it’s never happened to me.</p>
        <p>The light that appeared when a Hunter awakened their skill!</p>
        <p>And—“It’s a golden light!”</p>
        <p>Hovering before me. The light I’ve been wanting, needing, and coveting over. It was mine! And it was a golden
            light! A GOLDEN LIGHT.</p>
        <p>At least an S-Rank skill! The golden light only appeared if the skill was <i>at least </i>an S-Rank skill!
        </p>
        <p>My heart pounded like crazy, loud in my ears, as if it wanted to leap out of my chest.</p>
        <p>The golden light concentrated in one spot and shaped into a card.</p>
        <p><strong>|</strong> An unsightly envy that is yet to be found in History!</p>
        <p> <strong>|</strong> The Tower, astonished by your unsightly envy, throws you a skill.</p>
        <p>Wait… The skill awakening sound was different compared to what I was told.</p>
        <p>Normally, you would hear something cool like, “The Tower is <i>moved </i>by your determination,” or “The
            Tower <i>rewards</i> you for your honest efforts,” or “The Tower <i>praises </i>you for your achievements.”
        </p>
        <p>But it<i> threw </i>me a skill because of my unsightly envy? It’s as if the Tower is treating me like a
            beggar.</p>
        <p><i>‘N-Nah. Why should I care about its tone when I just received an S-Rank skill?’</i></p>
        <p>Unease rose in my chest, but I brushed it aside. How long have I been waiting for this moment? It was not the
            time to be concerned with negative thoughts.</p>
        <p><strong>|</strong> Creating a skill card.</p>
        <p>The light exploded one last time and a golden card waited before me.</p>
        <p>With shaking hands, I grasped the card.</p>
        <p>I blinked.</p>
        <p>For a moment, I thought I misread something.</p>
        <p>So, once again, I slowly read the last sentence written on the bottom.</p>
        <p><strong>However, you die!</strong></p>
        <p>It really said that. Right there, all in red. Exclamation point. As if the system was laughing at me. At my
            ten years of yearning and wishing.</p>
        <p>If I use this S-Rank skill, I’ll die.</p>
        <p>I blankly stared at the card.</p>
        <p>The wind blew from the open window and shook the scraps of paper glued all over the walls. The crinkling of
            the paper tickled my ears. Time passed.</p>
        <p>Then I screamed. Everything in me tore out of my throat. “FUUUCK! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?! HOW AM I SUPPOSED
            TO USE THIS SKILL?!”</p>
        <p>On this day, I obtained the greatest ever S-Rank skill. [3]</p>
        <p>The greatest ever SHIT skill.</p>
        <p>[T/N]</p>

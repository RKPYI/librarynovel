          >All was quiet within the palace. The faraway mountains, surrounded by
          mist, resembled dark eyebrows and looked extremely poetic. Further
          away, a rainbow coloured light shot into the misty sky and illuminated
          it, which made the sight even more beautiful.</span

          >As Gu Qingyi spoke, her eyes seemed to become distant as she recalled
          something. Her body did not materialise in that space. She was an
          unfathomable distance away from Gu Changge. Her features were blurred
          and her clothing moved slightly. Even Gu Changge could not see her
          expression clearly.</span

          human?&#8221; Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t surprised by her words. Walking
          towards the table and taking the white jade teacup to blow at it, he
          smiled as he asked the question in a neutral voice.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No. You aren&#8217;t a normal human at all.&#8221; Gu Qingyi
          turned to look at him, her gaze penetrating through layers of space to
          land on his face. She then shook her head, voice completely
          calm.</span

          >&#8220;&#8230;Seems like you really have high opinions of me.&#8221;
          He smiled. He already knew this was the usual tone she used when she
          spoke, but hearing her speak still felt strange. Her conversation with
          anyone else would have ended awkwardly, but considering that she
          usually cultivated herself in isolation, and did not often meet
          others, he did not take it to heart. How could he trust her to
          communicate properly with others?</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, no one else, not even his parents, knew him as well as she
          did. This was a strange intuition he had, and that was why he had
          allowed her to stay at the family residence instead of following him
          and guarding him. For one, he was worried that the presence of a
          guardian would affect some of his plans. Besides, although she knew
          him far too well, it was still uncomfortable to have her observing him
          from the shadows.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Qingyi had accompanied him ever since he was three years old.
          Although she had never appeared physically but chose to hide in the
          shadows, she knew every movement he made until Gu Changge eventually
          said he did not need her to not guard him anymore. For instance, her
          true body wasn&#8217;t here in this space but was infinitely far away.
          Even so, she could still kill someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm with
          just one thought. Thus, even he wasn&#8217;t certain how strong she
          actually was.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Well, you actually look better now,&#8221; Gu Qingyi
          continued, her figure becoming blurred as she walked away. Her skirts
          fluttered as she walked, bare feet paler than snow and hair as black
          as coal. Soon, she was gone.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge watched her disappear with some surprise. He then shook
          his head, and did not take it to heart. He could not read her true
          feelings, but he did not feel any threat from her at all. She was
          someone he could trust. He then disappeared as well, leaving the
          palace for the prison where Sky King Zhi Yang was currently being
          held. It was time to make preparations for the war against Purple
          Mansion.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It wasn&#8217;t really going to be an Immortal War. Similarly, there
          would not be a neverending disaster. After all, Purple Mansion was not
          worth such attention from the Immortal Gu Family.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sky King Zhi Yang had only been of some use to him. Besides, the
          other forces such as Sky Emperor Mountain, Ancient Ye Family, Endless
          Fire Kingdom, and White Tiger Clan were also discussing how they were
          going to attack Purple Mansion, just as he had expected. He probably
          didn&#8217;t need to exert a lot of effort nor show many of his cards.
          Instead, here most likely just need to rely on the power of the
          Celestial Ancient Continent, which should be more than sufficient.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The power of the other clans such as the Black Hawk Family, Divine
          Crocodile Clan, Ancient Flying Snake Family, Celestial Ancient Dragon
          Race, and so on couldn&#8217;t be underestimated. He had already given
          the order for them to send men to him. Now, all he needed to think
          about was for a way to let Sky Emperor Mountain and the other forces
          lead the charge. Meanwhile he would send his army to Purple Mansion’s
          borders and invade it, just in time to reap the benefits from the
          battle. At the same time, he could also see if Hei Yanyu had followed
          his orders and trained the army.

          in green walked out from the void. She stood at the peak of the
          mountain and looked down at the clouds below. She seemed to be alone
          here. The clouds covered the sea below, which stretched out into the
          horizon to meet the sky. It was like the clouds were reflecting the
          sky, and the view was grand from up there.</span

          from his unconscious state. The sound he made was like that of a
          desperate beast in a helpless situation. The painful tearing sensation
          from his wounds, as well as the pain from his broken bones made Sky
          King Zhi Yang grit his teeth as his face turned pale. His forehead was
          covered with beads of sweat. He couldn&#8217;t even heal such a minor
          injury after losing his Chaos Dao Bone.</span

          fists clenched so hard his knuckles turned white. After noticing where
          he was, his expression darkened and he forced himself to calm down.

          meandered around in the world before seeing the entrance to his Sect,
          which had been destroyed for some reason. He saw Purple Mansion being
          consumed by flames and reduced to ashes. Qin Wuya and Dao Xian looked
          frightened, trying to tell him something while covered in blood. He
          could not discern what they were saying before the flames consumed
          everything else.

          His sect, close friends, and relatives, were all killed by Gu Changge
          without leaving any survivors. He was enraged and filled with hatred,

          him quickly, and carried over a stone bench to place it behind
          him.</span

          One, just someone with great Fortuity. That was why he couldn&#8217;t
          trigger the Zero Fortuity Rule on him. This made Gu Changge feel

          aura of fortune and luck. Thanks to the Chaos Dao Bone, he had been
          undefeated and managed to crush everyone else in his generation. Even
          other ancient monstrosities born in the other eras had all lost
          against him. If he hadn&#8217;t encountered Gu Changge, he

          was far inferior compared to the Absolute Detachment Bone he could
          redeem from the System. The value of the Chaos Dao Bone lay in the
          Chaos Dao it contained. Which allowed the one who possesses it to use
          Chaos Force. Chaos Force could then evolve to become Chaos Evolution,
          Primal Chaos, World Devouring Chaos. However, the innate Dao inside
          this Bone was still incomplete and only contained some rudimentary
          parts.

          time fusing with the seed to be able to use it, and it took many
          failed attempts for him to do so. It wasn&#8217;t a tame item but
          behaved really aggressively. If he hadn&#8217;t possessed the Chaos
          Dao Bone, it would&#8217;ve been hard for him to even approach it,
          much less fuse with it. Even so, thanks to the energy contained within
          the seed, he could utilise the Foreseeing Eye and catch a glimpse of
          the future. All his current success could be attributed to both the
          seed and the bone. Meanwhile, his memories of his past life felt
          unnecessary yet too precious to discard.</span

          >He had fused with the seed for many years and could sense the
          fluctuations of its mood. However, he still faced difficulties fully
          activating it. Fear, shock, fright… these were the feelings the seed
          were now broadcasting to him. In Gu Changge&#8217;s hand, it had
          become extremely tame and scared, like it was facing some terrible
          enemy. This was something no one could imagine. The seed had never
          shown such an attitude even with the Great Elder. Instead, it showed
          great disdain towards the Great Elder. Now, it was shivering in Gu
          Changge’s palm, as tame as a kitten.

          >&#8220;Your Foreseeing Eye has an undeniable link to the Chaos Purple
          Qi Seed, then.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled, observing the change in the
          other man&#8217;s reaction. The purple pattern between Zhi
          Yang&#8217;s eyebrows glowed weakly, sending out waves of energy as if
          it could project anything.</span

          >&#8220;What do you want, Gu Changge?&#8221; the Sky King Zhi Yang
          became stricken, having a broad guess of his intention. He became
          scared and pale, expression turning desperate. Gu Changge not only
          desired his Chaos Dao Bone but now also wanted his Foreseeing Eye
          too.</span

          produce some mysterious treasure, which can help me deduce the
          future,&#8221; Gu Changge narrowed his eyes and said carelessly,
          ignoring the terrified look on the other man&#8217;s face.</span

          >*Buzz!* Thanks to the link from the seed, a mysterious energy soon
          materialised. Fragments of time flew around them while emitting a
          bright light, and a river appeared. Within it, were traces of time,
          scenes of mountains and seas turning into ash, and also fading
          lightning.

          wooden box appear. He placed the faintly glowing Foreseeing Eye into
          it and took it with him. He no longer cared about Sky King Zhi Yang.
          However, he couldn&#8217;t let him die for now, not when those experts
          from the Purple Mansion hadn&#8217;t arrived yet.

          followed the other disciples back to the Immortal Academy after

          Don&#8217;t worry, I know where she is now. He did not hand her over
          to the Successor of Demonic Arts immediately after kidnapping her, so

          had an extremely rare Source. Sky King Zhi Yang could use her in a

          fury. His eyes blazed with intense anger as he tightly balled his
          fists. It took him a long time to finally compose himself and took a
          deep breath.</span

          decline?” An Xi gazed at the invitation letter in her hands with an
          unpleasant look on her face. She had no interest in joining this
          so-called trip to Kun Mountain. After all, who knew what potential
          dangers lay ahead? Besides, the An Clan had no ties to the Ji family,
          and thus, had no obligation to rescue Ji Shengchu. So why would she
          want to be part of this rescue mission?</span

          only give Gu Changge an excuse to attack us, and we cannot let him

          and Niu Tian.</span

          actually already planned to depart, but with the situation being so
          critical, it was unlikely that Gu Changge would let them leave in
          peace.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She remembered how shocked the Young War Immortal looked during the
          Divine Rock Conference. Despite his attempt to brush it off, her
          intuition led her to believe there was more to the situation than met
          the eye.</span

          breathe a word of this to anyone. If we were to alarm Gu Changge, he
          would stop at nothing to find a way to eliminate us all. Not only
          that, his method would definitely be far more extreme than the last
          assassination attempt.” The Young War Immortal’s expression was grave,
          and he even dismissed everyone else from the chamber before confiding
          in the three of them.</span

          >He believed that everyone present harbored a grudge against Gu
          Changge, so they would know about this sooner or later. The Young War
          Immortal’s prudence made An Xi and the others nervous. They paid close
          attention and listened intently, fearful of missing any detail.</span

          >The Young War Immortal took a deep breath and began recounting his
          recent encounter with the Successor of Demonic Arts. He only narrowly
          escaped with his life thanks to the timely intervention of his
          guardian, but not without sustaining severe injuries and nearly
          shattered his Source. During the attack, he managed to use his innate
          eye technique to get a clear look at the true face of the Successor of
          Demonic Arts.</span

          someone close to Gu Changge?” An Xi’s face changed drastically as
          everything suddenly made sense to her. She turned pale as a chill ran
          down her spine, fear filled her heart. Her voice even trembled as she
          spoke. Jiang Chen and Niu Tian were equally stunned by this shocking
          revelation. Their eyes went wide and they felt their scalps
          crawling.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Young War Immortal took a deep breath and tried to speak as
          calmly as he could. “Yes, I am very certain that the Successor of
          Demonic Arts is actually someone close to Gu Changge! In fact, it is
          none other than the maid who has been faithfully by his side all this
          time.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was aware of the magnitude of this matter and the gravity of this
          situation. If it were to become public knowledge, it would undoubtedly
          create chaos in the Upper Realm and lead to unfathomable
          repercussions.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I understand now. It’s no wonder the Successor of the Demonic Arts
          was able to repeatedly escape from Gu Changge. This explains
          everything.” After some time, An Xi managed to compose herself and
          make sense of the various rumors she had heard. Despite this, she
          couldn’t shake the fear that lingered in her heart. Had it not been
          for the Young War Immortal’s explanation, she never dared consider
          such a possibility.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[What exactly is Gu Changge planning? The Successor of the Demonic
          Arts who has been causing a stir in the Upper Realm turns out to be
          his maid?] An Xi suddenly regretted ever crossing an enigmatic and
          unpredictable man like Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“All of you must not speak of this matter to anyone until we have
          gathered sufficient evidence. If Gu Changge knows about this&#8230; we
          will definitely die,” the Young War Immortal emphasized in a grave
          tone again. Sometimes, knowledge could be a double-edged sword. How he
          wished that he had kept his composure and not displayed any suspicious
          behavior during the Divine Rock Conference.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >An Xi understood the gravity of the situation. The slightest leak of
          this information could land them in disastrous situations. Without
          concrete evidence, disclosing this knowledge would hold little
          credibility and be easily dismissed by many.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“We understand.” Jiang Chen and Niu Tian looked at each other before
          falling into a contemplative silence. Jiang Chen’s mind drifted to
          thoughts of Xiao Ruoyin, causing a chill to run down his spine and his
          limbs to grow cold.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The fact that Gu Changge was actually the master of the Successor of
          Demonic Arts came as a complete shock to him. How did he come to get
          the Successor of Demonic Arts to be under him? The mere thought of the
          Black-Robed Elder who bestowed him with the Everchanging Demonic Arts
          filled him with fear.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He couldn’t help but wonder if all the incidents caused by Successor
          of Demonic Arts all these years had taken place without Gu Changge’s
          knowledge, or even worse, with his tacit consent.</span

          you sent someone to retrieve from the ancestral star has been
          intercepted by Lady Yan en route!” One of the servants from the An
          Clan suddenly rushed into the chamber, his face fraught with worry as
          he relayed the news.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What?” An Xi’s eyes widened in shock for the first time because of
          An Yan, as disbelief filled her.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“How dare An Yan do that! How did she do it?” An Xi gritted her teeth
          in anger. She could hardly believe her ears when she heard her younger
          sister, whom she had disregarded for so long, had the nerve to
          intercept her True Blood. Her action only served to exacerbate her
          already dire circumstances.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As per the An Clan’s rules, An Yan was indeed rightfully entitled to
          contend for the True Blood of the Hidden Celestial from the ancestral
          star. But An Xi didn’t expect that An Yan would go as far as to
          intercept her stuff while she was not around! Her anger boiled within,
          wishing so badly that she could rush home immediately to confront her
          younger sister. Unfortunately, the current circumstances prevented her
          from doing so.</span

          >“I’ll make sure that the damn brat regrets her action once I’m done
          here in Dark Kun City,” An Xi seethed with an extremely unpleasant
          look on her face.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Two days passed in just the blink of an eye. The entire Dark Kun City
          was abuzz with excitement as news of Ji Family&#8217;s impending
          invasion into Kun Mountain spread like wildfire.</span

          >Located in the northernmost corner of Dark Kun City, the Starcatcher
          Pavilion derived its name from the idea that anyone could catch a star
          for themselves. The magnificent structure was constructed entirely
          from Immortal Stones. Its antique architecture, glimmering facade and
          the Immortal Mist enveloping it made it a true marvel to behold. It
          resembled an ancient immortal tower amidst the mortal realm.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Starcatcher Pavilion was bustling with life today as Gu Changge
          was hosting a banquet for many young prodigies. At the entrance, many
          cultivators eagerly awaited the arrival of guests, some esteemed
          Elders also graced the occasion with their presence. Although it could
          not be said that all of the cream of the crop from the entire Upper
          Realm was gathered here today, the majority were present.</span

          >Each of them had either a guardian or an entourage accompanying them.
          It was no surprise, as receiving an invitation from Gu Changge meant
          they were the Successors of various Immortal or Formidable Forces, a
          status that was beyond measure. In fact, they were undoubtedly the
          best candidates to lead their respective Forces in the future, and
          their potential was limitless.</span

          filled with exclamations of awe as a divine rainbow appeared in the
          sky, resembling a magnificent phoenix spreading its wings. It was a
          breathtaking sight.</span

          her cool demeanor exuded an air of dignity. She was none other than
          the Phoenix Lady. The moment she arrived, the waiting servants quickly
          led her inside the pavilion.</span

          Chosen Monk Jin Chan, and the Sky Demon Sovereign, each with their own
          entourage, appearing extremely formal and cautious.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Truth be told, not many were eager to attend the banquet of the day.
          Then again, declining the invitation would signify a lack of respect
          toward Gu Changge and disregard for the security of the Upper Realm.
          Being accused of either would no doubt significantly damage their
          reputation.</span

          Sovereign shook his head. Even so, he was relieved to see the majority
          of the young prodigies in Dark Kun City showing up here. It provided
          him a small sense of comfort amidst the current situation.</span

          Daoist, but what about us? We’re probably going to die there. What a
          cunning and despicable man!” The Young Holy King, an extremely burly
          man, strode over from the other side and sneered coldly. His tone was
          filled with defiance and disdain.</span

          them to take responsibility for his rescue, especially since Gu
          Changge had taken the lead in this endeavor. Gu Changge’s actions had

          >Sensing the Sky Demon Sovereign and his companions’ dissatisfaction,
          an old man approached them. With a smile on his wrinkled face, he
          said, “Dear esteemed guests, please rest assured. Young Master is on
          his way here.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As soon as the group laid their eyes on the old man, their eyes
          widened in shock. They quickly kept their attitude in check as they
          knew immediately that the old man was a True Daoist!</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite his butler attire, the old man’s cultivation was
          unfathomable. He had a Nirvana Realm aura, so he was definitely a True
          Daoist. Everyone was shocked. They were unable to identify whether he
          was the esteemed Ancestor of the Gu Family or simply a humble butler
          Gu Changge had hired.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was at this moment, another commotion erupted outside the
          Starcatcher Pavillion. The Young War Immortal, An Xi, Jiang Chen and
          the others were ushered into the banquet hall. The Young War Immortal
          was unusually pale today, as if his injuries had yet to fully
          heal.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Greetings, my friends!” The Young War Immortal forced himself to
          smile and cupped his fist respectfully to the Sky Demon Sovereign and
          the others.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Your injuries don’t seem to be healed yet. The assassin who attacked
          you the other day must have been quite formidable.” The sight of the
          Young War Immortal&#8217;s weakened state stirred feelings of
          compassion among those present. It was only recently that he had
          narrowly escaped death from the Successor of Demonic Arts, and now he
          had been struck down once more by an assassin, leaving him with grave
          injuries.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many were left wondering the identity of the person whom the Young
          War Immortal had managed to upset, ultimately resulting in his
          assassination attempt the day after the Divine Rock Conference and a
          close brush with death. None of the other young prodigies had faced a
          similar situation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Young War Immortal smiled wryly. “Thank you for your concern, my
          friends. My injuries may seem serious, but with some good rest, I will
          recover in no time.”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite his optimistic tone, he felt gloomy on the inside. He gazed
          ahead, but Gu Changge’s presence was nowhere to be found.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Oh, everyone has arrived?” While the young prodigies were conversing
          with each other softly, a pleasant voice interrupted their
          conversation, causing all heads to swivel toward the source.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There stood Gu Changge, clad in a black attire that accentuated his
          statuesque frame. His silky dark hair framed his chiseled features. He
          wore a dazzling smile on his face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing the voice, An Xi was overcome with an inexplicable sense
          of fear and unease, yet she fought to maintain her composure. Standing
          behind Gu Changge were Yin Mei and Su Qingge, both exuding an ethereal
          beauty that seemed almost otherworldly. With their hands clasped and
          their eyes lowered, they looked like statues sculpted from the finest
          jade.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen and Niu Tian gazed at Su Qingge silently and warily. To
          think that the notorious and merciless Successor of Demonic Arts, who
          had caused chaos in the Upper Realm, was actually such a gorgeous
          woman. If they hadn’t seen her with their own eyes, they wouldn’t have
          believed it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge!” The Sky Demon Sovereign, the
          King with Six Crowns, Chosen Monk Jin Chan and everyone else were
          struck with terror in their hearts. None of them sensed Gu Changge’s
          presence until now.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With a smile, Gu Changge graciously waved off any formalities. “I was
          informed that you suffered grave injuries from an assassin two days
          ago. I promptly arranged for someone to deliver you some potent divine
          medicines, but it appears they were not effective in your recovery.”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His eyes quickly settled on the Young War Immortal as he expressed
          his concern for his well-being.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Young War Immortal was taken aback by Gu Changge’s public display
          of concern. Although he felt disheartened, he merely smiled wryly and
          said, “Thank you for your concern, Young Master Changge. The divine
          medicines you sent hadn’t been very effective, but I should be able to
          recover after getting enough rest.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >These were carefully chosen words he had prepared to politely decline
          the invitation to Kun Mountain. He was not naive and understood that
          leaving Dark Kun City and entering the perilous Kun Mountain would
          mean his death. After all, Gu Changge could easily snuff out his life
          in that treacherous place if he wished to.</span

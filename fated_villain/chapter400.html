        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filled with immense murderous intent, the extremely terrorizing aura,
                resembling the dense astral sky, engulfed the heaven and earth, leaving all souls frozen upon the sight
                as everyone was thoroughly dumbfounded right as it emerged. </span><span id="more-29579"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startled, the powerful figures who were combating the assassins too turned to
                the aura in fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sacred Emperor Realm…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who is that?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Such fearsome murderous aura. He’s not an ally, he’s an
                enemy!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Quelling Chaos King and the rest were dazed, but they had no time to tend
                to the new threat as the opponents they were facing, whose strength was equivalent to theirs, were
                powerful as well. Thus, they had no choice despite their desire to rescue their Empress.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a pre-planned assassination. From Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s poisoning
                to the ambush, everything happened in short order. Furthermore, the number of assassins near the Sacred
                Mountain, as well as forces involved were immeasurable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by the situation, many must still be hiding in the dark, observing
                and waiting for the time to make a move. The major Clans of Demon World were obviously their enemies,
                who would never forgo the chance to overthrow the Empress&#8217;s reign.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah… Heaven, please! Protect her Highness. Young Master Changge is by
                her side. He should be able to do something at least.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge possesses the battle strength of at least the
                Sacred King Realm, and he is said to have a guardian in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm, though we don&#8217;t
                know whether the guardian followed him to the Demon World this time.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grand Tutor and the rest were despondent.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that, the fact that their adversaries were so bold as to pull off an
                assassination must mean that they approached with complete preparations, so they must know that Gu
                Changge was by Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s side. After all, how could they not as they certainly carried with
                themselves more unknown methods and plans in mind?</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these years, as the Demon World prospered, it also grew more stable and
                harmonious, and Empress Yao Xi played a crucial role in it. Although it was known that the
                Empress&#8217;s methods were far from soft and that her arrogance would sometimes drive her to disregard
                others&#8217; advice, without her contributions there was no telling how chaotic the Demon World would
                have become after the sudden disappearance of the remaining five Demon Overlords. Such a prosperous
                place was built from peace!</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, all of the higher-ups were upset and concerned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Following the appearance of the formidable expert in the Sacred
                Emperor Realm, it was as though the world was torn apart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Countless mountains exploded and were turned into dust as the ground
                cracked open, revealing innumerable black fissures of fathomless depths.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overwhelming aura repressed all that was exposed to it, instilling panic
                and dread, as if their souls would shatter at any time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uncle Ye, you&#8217;re finally here.&#8221; Jun Fan was internally
                thrilled as his greatest support finally arrived after a long wait.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncle Ye, whose name was simply Ye, was a rare Night Demon. As a Chief
                Commander of the Solar Demon Overlord, he once battled in many Domains and took countless lives.
                Strength-wise, he attained the Sacred King Realm a long time ago, and after his breakthrough in the past
                six thousand years, he eventually reached the Sacred Emperor Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time ago, Jun Fan, with some help left behind by his father, found Uncle
                Ye who was hiding and cultivating in a random location. He pleaded for him to resurface to the world and
                help him regain everything that belonged to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it was Jun Fan who requested this, Uncle Ye agreed without any
                hesitation. After all, he shared a brotherly bond with Jun Bufan&#8217;s father, and treated Jun Fan as
                if he was his own child.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Jun Fan&#8217;s scheme, Uncle Ye played the most important role. In
                addition to his Sacred Emperor Realm might, he also possessed the Nirvana Grade Artifact refined by Jun
                Fan&#8217;s father—the Solar Heavenly Blade. It was an artifact even those in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm
                feared and dared not to fight against. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Empress Yao Xi wouldn&#8217;t be able to resist it in her prime, let
                alone the fact that she was now weakened.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now that’s a big catch. The long wait sure has been worthwhile.] Looking at
                the ambiguous figure approaching from the sky, Gu Changge revealed an enthralled grin as he was frankly
                in need of a Source from someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, he could detect that the approacher&#8217;s strength was more
                daunting than that of ordinary Sacred Emperor Realm experts. As such, the figure must be carrying some
                sort of treasure, and a treasure that evoked fear of those in the Sacred Emperor Realm must be either a
                Quasi-Nirvana Grade or a Nirvana Grade Artifact.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge was now in possession of six of the Seven Tools of World
                Domination, the Eight Barren Demon Halberd, the Great Seal of Mountains and Rivers and more, but adding
                a Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact or Nirvana Grade Artifact to his arsenal would be more than welcomed.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if he had no use for it, he could give it to Yue Mingkong when he headed
                back to the Upper Realm. After all, Yue Mingkong had given him so much, yet he rarely returned any
                favours.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Protect Her Majesty!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, the faces of everyone on the peak of the Sacred Mountain
                dramatically changed, including Qing Ju, Qing Lan, and Qing Mei who were so wary that they could feel
                their spines tingling as they conjured their artifacts. Many young prodigies could feel their heart
                shivering as their souls trembled, and an urge to kneel towards that direction suddenly came over
                them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was the very might of a formidable cultivator in the Sacred Emperor
                Realm, whose divine sense alone was sufficient enough to destroy the world and obliterate the universe.
                Such an individual stood at the top of the world, and they could turn the plane of existence inside
                out.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This aura belongs to the Night Demon who was under the Solar Demon
                Overlord. I&#8217;ve been looking everywhere for him for so many years. I thought he was dead, but for
                him to show himself at this moment… It seems he must be the mastermind behind all this, but still,
                there&#8217;s no telling whether Jun Bufan himself will show up,&#8221; Empress Yao Xi coldly
                stated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she currently couldn&#8217;t use her powers, she was able to detect
                the vast, terrifying pressure. The pressure could make those unable to withstand it suffocate and their
                flesh rip apart</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Empress Yao Xi saw this coming, given the aggressiveness of her
                enemies. Since they planted so many spies and underlings by her side, there was no way they would let
                such a good opportunity to murder her slide.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of you, leave. You are no match for him.&#8221; At that moment,
                Empress Yao Xi commanded the female officers and the rest of the young prodigies with her steady
                voice.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was aware that her people wouldn&#8217;t be able to do anything by
                staying here except dying as they were nothing but ants to someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm. After
                all, the enemy could turn everyone on the Sacred Mountain to ashes at will. Their strengths were
                insignificant before a Sacred Lord Realm expert, and facing someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm meant
                that they were nothing but defenceless ants.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Qing Mei, Qing Lan, and the rest revealed an expression of
                sorrow and agony while the young prodigies gritted their teeth in exasperation and reluctance. As the
                people of Demon World, they were so helpless in this instant that they couldn&#8217;t even protect their
                Empress.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Majesty…&#8221; Qing Zhu never expected that, at that moment, the
                first thing Empress Yao Xi did was asking them to retreat so they wouldn&#8217;t perish right
                now.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, remorse arose in her heart, but as soon as she noticed Jun Fan
                looking at her, she regained her determination. At this point, there was no time to regret as it was
                either success or sacrifice.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Leave now. The Night Demon’s target is me, and none of you have
                anything to do with this. You&#8217;ll only become casualties by staying any longer.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empress Yao Xi stood up and walked out with an ever so serene face, and none
                would doubt her upon seeing the expression on her flawless face. As the wide sleeves of her phoenix
                dress waved, her silky hair gently swayed under the cool breeze. In that instant, she walked to the peak
                of the Sacred Mountain without fear in her eyes, staring as the Night Demon charged at her, and she
                appeared extraordinarily graceful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Majesty, we will not leave! Our lives are yours, so how could we
                ever leave you? If something were to happen to you today, we shall follow you. Even in hell,
                you&#8217;ll need someone by your side.&#8221; In response, Qing Lan, Qing Mei, and the rest shook their
                heads as their tears glistened. They were unwilling to leave as they desired to fight by their
                Empress&#8217;s side.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Empress Yao Xi furrowed her brows. As she felt their resolve,
                she wordlessly shook her head and sighed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rise or fall, we are with you, Your Majesty!&#8221; Accordingly, the
                rest of the young prodigies yelled in unison with determined faces, taking out daunting artifacts as
                they had no intentions of leaving.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the region was illuminated with vibrant lights that shot through the
                sky.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the sight, Jun Fan was visibly vexed. He never expected so many people
                were not willing to abandon Empress Yao Xi at this point, and they were even ready to sacrifice
                themselves for her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was discomforted by this feeling. He believed that Empress Yao Xi rose to
                the throne by brazen means, and during the unification of the Demon World, she was so cruel that seas of
                blood were shed. He truly believed that she had caused turmoil all over Demon World. Yet, she still
                retained so many supporters.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The vast Solar Domain was my Father&#8217;s territory, yet it was now
                controlled by her to this level. Haha… Even at this point, you&#8217;re still winning hearts.
                Applaudable, YAO XI!] Jun Fan clenched his fists. If it weren&#8217;t for the lack of his strength, he
                would have conjured a forbidden weapon and attacked right now instead of allowing Empress Yao Xi to
                speak such words.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, I shall trouble you for this.&#8221; at that
                moment, Empress Yao Xi turned to Gu Changge, who followed her, and said, &#8220;What you mentioned
                earlier, I will give it a thorough thought.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge then chuckled. &#8220;Oh, we are not strangers, are we? I love
                helping people the most, so how could I stand idly while the Empress herself is in such
                danger?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Empress Yao Xi glanced at him with the corner of her eyes as he
                told a different story earlier.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the two stood on the peak of the mountain, the mountain breeze flowed
                through their hair. In others&#8217; eyes, it was as though they were a godly couple.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon that sight, many of her supporters began to grow hopeful. Forget Gu
                Changge&#8217;s influence and strength, now that he was standing by Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s side, the
                enemy must be insane not to fear him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Empress Yao Xi, today is the day where we settle our
                feud!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, the figure of the Night Demon appeared to be standing in the
                sky, covered in Demonic Energy that covered the sun, as if he was made of ebony celestial gold. Like an
                rivalless Immortal of war, spine-chilling Demonic Energy wafted around his muscular body. There was also
                the frightening demonic aura that left all souls trembling, and no one would dare to look straight at it
                as it was simply too terrifying.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just by standing there, the figure bore a might that could destroy mountains
                and seas, as though he could annihilate Black and White Academy with the flick of a finger.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the appearance of such an individual who wished to slaughter
                Empress Yao Xi, many grew hopeless as they sensed a thick gloominess. Things would have been better if
                Empress Yao Xi was in the pink of health, but now that she was poisoned, she could hardly stand still,
                let alone fight the powerful Night Demon in front of her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From afar, Empress Yao Xi gazed at the Night Demon and blandly said,
                &#8220;All these years, the remaining five Demon Overlords have been nothing but a public menace. Look
                at you, only showing up right now.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the Night Demon scoffed, &#8220;If it weren&#8217;t for your
                shameless, vile methods, do you think I would have fallen to such misery? You are the cause of my
                suffering!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really?&#8221; Empress Yao Xi retained her cold face and faintly
                asked, &#8220;So where&#8217;s Jun Bufan? He faked his death back then, and now he&#8217;s too much of a
                wuss to show up, huh?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master is undoubtedly somewhere safe. Once you&#8217;re dead,
                he&#8217;ll naturally show up and succeed you as the new ruler of the Demon World.&#8221; The Demon
                Night coldly replied, &#8220;Instead, I’ll ask you this: where are the five Demon
                Overlords?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, many were plainly startled as they quickly concentrated on the
                conversation, wanting to know the whereabouts of the five Overlords.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intrigued, Jun Fan also paid close attention. All this time, he had been
                searching for his father, the Solar Demon Overlord, only to no avail. Be it his father or the rest of
                the Demon Overlords, it was as though they vanished from the world without leaving a trace, which then
                became a mythical mystery of Demon World.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there were rumours stating that Empress Yao Xi slaughtered the five
                Demon Overlords scattering across the outside world, Jun Fan was certain that given Empress Yao
                Xi&#8217;s current strength and methods, she was not capable of doing that, which was even more
                impossible 6000 years ago.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6000 years ago, the Five Demon Overlords had attained immeasurable
                cultivation level, so even with her mother, the Lunar Demon Overlord&#8217;s discreet assistance,
                Empress Yao Xi wouldn&#8217;t be able to accomplish that. Even now, the five Demon Overlords were still
                nowhere to be found, including Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s mother, the Lunar Demon Overlord.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many years ago, someone claimed that the Lunar Demon Overlord showed herself,
                but recently, upon an investigation, Jun Fan found that the person who spread the rumour was recruited
                by Empress Yao Xi in order to borrow the Lunar Demon Overlord&#8217;s name to scare the people of
                various Domains from doing anything rash.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, other than the five Demon Overlords, the Lunar Demon
                Overlord, too, had disappeared 6000 ago. Nevertheless, after rising to the throne, in order to
                intimidate the various forces of the Demon World, Empress Yao Xi fabricated a lie, which states the
                Lunar Demon Overlords had not disappeared.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, Jun Fan, too, was eager to receive news regarding the whereabouts of
                the Six Demon Overlords of the Demon World from Empress Yao Xi. He had no idea what his father&#8217;s
                words, which were etched in his memory, meant. However, it seemed to be related to the future of the
                Demon World.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How would I know?&#8221; However, Empress Yao Xi blandly replied in
                response without any change in her expression, which left others wondering whether she was actually
                oblivious to the truth or she was unwilling to share it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, many were disappointed as they didn&#8217;t get the answer to the
                question that had been confusing them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Keeping secrets, huh? That&#8217;s fine. I have all the methods to
                force you to surrender the truth about the incidents 6000 years ago.&#8221; The face of the Night Demon
                grew dull as he assumed that Empress Yao Xi was buying time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he had no intentions of prolonging the conversation, a pitch black
                heavenly light surged in his hand, harbouring terrifying power, followed by the manifestation of Dao,
                which resembled a black sun which could destroy the world with its shockwave.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, formidable experts that were fighting far away were stunned as
                they felt a chilly sensation arising all over their body. Under such tremendous energy, even the
                strongest arrays of Black and White Academy could only be cast for a second before being blasted
                off.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* At that moment, a blinding beam surged as an overpowering, vibrant
                Celestial Sword crystallised from many powerful Principles, emitting glaring glows that lit up the
                sky.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge walked over, he was covered in a domineering aura, and upon the
                surge of Principles, even his hair was gleaming. Behind him, a Heavenly Seal appeared amid a light so
                dazzling one could hardly open their eyes. Within, absolute power was flowing, which instantaneously
                erupted as World Principles vapourised.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crash between the Bright Heavenly Seal and the Night Demon almost caused
                the River of Time to crumble and shattered the space-time continuum, as if the creation of the world was
                repeated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anomalies emerged in the sky amid blaring battlecries, projecting visions
                containing the destruction of stunning mountains and rivers, the angry roars of ancient Sky Emperors,
                worlds filled with unlimited blood, and the Nine Heavens being obliterated by a sword-like beam.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such sights were too frightening as though they once happened in Gu
                Changge&#8217;s presence, leaving those of the Demon World dreading as it was their first time
                experiencing his terror. Such an overpowering aura seemed to be on par with that of the Night
                Demon.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a casual expression, Gu Changge even had the time to toy with his sword,
                showing how unaffected he was. &#8220;Now that the chat is over, are we going to fight?&#8221; </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He breezily chuckled. &#8220;What a shame. I was hoping to enjoy the show
                longer.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, who are you, an outsider, to interfere in the matters of
                my Demon World? I have no intentions of fighting against you, but if you think your reliance on the
                Immortal Gu Family allows you to do whatever you want and butt into others&#8217; affairs, don&#8217;t
                blame me for my harshness!&#8221; Dismay arose on the Night Demon&#8217;s dull face as he had to
                recognise Gu Changge’s might.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in the Demon World, he had heard of rumours about Gu Changge, so he was
                somewhat afraid of him. Still, since Gu Changge insisted on interfering, he would have no choice but to
                attack him. Furthermore, he had been waiting 6000 years for this very day, so there was not a chance
                that he would forgo such a timely opportunity. Otherwise, there was no telling how much longer he would
                have to wait until the next assassination attempt on Empress Yao Xi.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Changge seemed somewhat enlightened, after which he smugly
                replied, &#8220;You&#8217;re right, it seems I&#8217;m an outsider, and it&#8217;s quite unreasonable of
                me to intervene in the affairs of the Demon World. But if you plan to murder Yao Xi right in front of
                me, then I can only kill you first. After all, I disallow you to touch my people.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You boastful brat, Gu Changge! What are you insinuating?&#8221; Upon
                those words, the Night Demon&#8217;s face grew even dimmer as he was enraged by Gu Changge&#8217;s
                pompous attitude.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm, he had never been underestimated by
                anyone. And now, with barely anyone in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm in the Demon World, A Sacred Emperor was
                now the most powerful being that trumped all beings. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, as he was icily glaring at Gu Changge, he could feel the
                fiery rage surging in his heart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the Night Demon’s appearance, he resembled a man in his twenties with
                inky hair wearing a divine robe made of black and gold. However, he was a being with a seemingly endless
                lifespan, who lived for uncountable years.</span></p>

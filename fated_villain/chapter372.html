          brought to light someday. He couldn&#8217;t hide it forever. As the
          embodiment of chaos, anybody and everybody wanted him dead, and by
          then, what would she do? She was the Saintess of Mortal Palace, after

          to the core. He had chosen not to kill her when he could&#8217;ve
          easily done so back then. In fact, he even saved her a few more times

          anything, she just wanted him to give her some attention; that was it.
          But it was only after arriving at his chamber that she realised he
          didn&#8217;t care about her in the slightest. In fact, he didn&#8217;t
          know why she would come to him at all, and the revelation hurt Jiang

          understand, Gu Changge, and I know you&#8217;re not all evil… Even
          though you did what you did back then, I know I brought it upon
          myself. I don&#8217;t blame you. Even if you killed the Mortal One, I
          know you didn&#8217;t have a choice in it. After all, you two are

          Jiang Chuchu frowned, thinking the man was purely acting tough and
          quibbling out of his ego. Thus. he couldn&#8217;t even be bothered to
          come up with an excuse.

          her first encounter with him to how he locked her up and many more, as

          he did.</span

          wanted to interject, saying it was all just in her head. But when he
          thought about it, it wouldn&#8217;t affect him even if she thought so
          of him. Thus, he kept his silence.</span

          longer she went on, the weirder his smile became. [Okay, looks like I
          really am a good guy. Who&#8217;d have thought!?]</span

          never would he think the misunderstanding would be so drastic that the
          Saintess was even whitewashing his image! [Well, it is more than I
          expected but, isn’t this exactly what I wanted?!]</span

          to live for the Mortal Palace my whole life,&#8221; she recalled
          gravely while fixing her gaze on him.</span

          >&#8220;I&#8217;ve actually given it a lot of thought. No one but you
          and I know that the Mortal One died in your hands long ago. Even so,
          the Mortal Palace can&#8217;t go a day without the Mortal One, and
          this world can&#8217;t go without a leader to fight against the
          Eternal Overcast…&#8221; Jiang Chuchu sounded exceptionally

          >It was worth noting that she was wholly against Gu Changge&#8217;s
          idea when she first found out about it. She had never even given it a
          thought at all. However, it was she who came to him to discuss the
          existence of the Mortal One now.</span

          >&#8220;Are you suggesting someone pretend to be the Mortal One
          now?&#8221; Gu Changge quirked a brow. Though he had long foreseen her
          agreement to his plan, he was still surprised she would bring it up so
          suddenly.</span

          Jiang Chuchu bore into his eyes only to droop her eyelids in the end
          when she couldn&#8217;t take his penetrative gaze anymore. Even her
          voice softened as a result. &#8220;That way, no one will link you to
          being the Successor of Demonic Arts.&#8221;</span

          Changge reasoned softly, seemingly surprised by her statement.
          &#8220;From now on, you will have pretty much betrayed your kind and
          become my accomplice. Do you really want that?&#8221;</span

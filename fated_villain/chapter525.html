          enormous crevice while blood splashed. Many inscribed runes had been
          erased as the entire underground cave collapsed with a crash that
          spread through the whole of Sky Deer City. Many shivered after sensing

          by Gu Changge with a secret treasure and even contained parts of
          ruined universes. Now, even those universes were broken and expelled

          didn&#8217;t matter to beings like them. They had already captured
          many of the Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s accomplices and decided to
          ask Gu Changge for advice. Many of them were members from the Three
          War God Clans, where the most powerful ones were True Daoists.

          afterwards.&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at the unfortunate group. After
          the death of the Supreme Mountain Elder, they all looked terrified and
          desperate. The man had been undefeatable in their minds and had
          unrivalled abilities, even considering him the last hope of the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains. However, that hope had been extinguished
          with his death.

          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, as well as cultivators of the
          Upper Realm, felt like they were facing a drastic catastrophe and felt
          terrified. Even a single vibration from a battle of that magnitude was
          enough to destroy the world. Even though they didn&#8217;t know what
          had exactly happened, they could already make vague guesses, which

          more frightened. To them, the event in Sky Deer City had to be linked
          with the True Daoists of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. A
          devastating fight just when the two realms were discussing a truce?

          Second Mountain Elder and the others, only to end up being killed by
          Gu Changge&#8217;s experts. The shock resulting from this was like a

          He was an invincible existence. His cultivation level was

          to sign in agreement to the truce so that the war could quickly be
          resolved.&#8221; Several Wasteland Leaders spoke up first, expressions
          reverent. The rest looked at each other, sighing internally since
          someone had taken the lead, and made the same decision.</span

          I&#8217;ve always admired.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and inclined his
          head slightly. He wasn&#8217;t taken aback by their choice. After all,
          anyone with a functional brain knew what to decide in such a
          situation. Unless, they wanted to follow in the Supreme Mountain
          Elder&#8217;s footsteps or be exterminated like the other War God
          Clans.</span

          >Of course, the most important factor was the Supreme Mountain
          Elder&#8217;s death. He was the last hope the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains had and with his death, the place would be unsettled and
          divided to the point they wouldn&#8217;t have the courage to
          fight.</span

          now on, we are willing to submit to the Immortal Gu Family and do
          whatever you request of us.&#8221; Many clan leaders quickly pledged
          their loyalty. It didn&#8217;t matter if they truly meant it since
          they had to show submission.</span

          smiled before letting someone write out the contents of the agreement.
          It had been based on a Heavenly Dao Oath, so no one would dare go back
          on it. Except for him, obviously.</span

          the other Upper Realm Forces weren&#8217;t about to let go of such an
          opportunity and wanted their share of the benefits. Besides, the
          Immortal Gu Family couldn&#8217;t just take the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains for its own, though Gu Changge would get the biggest share
          while the others would decide how they were going to divide the
          remaining part.</span

          >After resolving the Oath, Gu Changge put his attention on the
          Fortuitous Ones &#8211; Luo Feng and Xiao Yang. Luo Feng still had a
          wisp of his Soul left and was comatose, so Gu Changge reaped him first
          without much hesitation. Besides gaining a great amount of Fortuity
          and Fatum, the Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest yielded something that
          amazed him.</span

          exuded an obscure and overpowering aura. It seemed very old and

          Reincarnation, which worked as lifesaving tokens. The Symbol of Epoch
          had a different effect compared to those Symbols but bore similarities
          in terms of its lifesaving effect. It contributed to Luo Feng escaping
          the Heavenly Dao Authority War alive since it was the condensation of
          all traces of a cultivator&#8217;s life including birth, death,
          rebirth, and other experiences. It could be compared to a
          cultivator&#8217;s second life though, Gu Changge knew that this
          wasn&#8217;t the only characteristic it possessed.

          >However, no one knew besides several high-ranking Gu Family members
          that Gu Changge had already acquired a mysterious tree after
          massacring the Blood Dragon War God Clan. The Tree of Epoch was now
          concealed in Gu Changge&#8217;s Inner Universe, as he waited for the
          fruit to ripen.

          >Naturally, they nor Gu Changge were not about to expose its existence
          before they could attempt to make contact with the Immortality Realm.
          Doing so would only bring unwanted trouble.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After that, Gu Changge arranged for Gu Family members to take charge
          of things in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains while he consumed
          and digested the Sources he had gained to improve his cultivation. Sky
          Deer City was currently under the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;s control and
          despite his confidence in her, he did send several family members to
          check on things. No one would dare object to anything since she was
          one of his people.</span

          >Gu Changge also rewarded all his subordinates and family members who
          had done great deeds in the war with many gifts according to their
          contributions. Even Gu Wudi had a unique Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact
          and this gesture somewhat surprised him.

          their identity as a subsidiary clan to the Immortal Gu Family, like in
          ancient times.</span

          the war, with several Elders suggesting that he could try slowly
          taking control of the Immortal Gu Family when he returned home. That
          way, his father, Gu Lintian could concentrate and spend more
          time</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          becoming the head of the family would interfere with Gu
          Changge&#8217;s own cultivation.

          had already proved with his abilities that there would be no issues
          with him taking charge of the family. Instead, many of them were
          concerned that letting him take charge of the family at a young age
          would distract him. They all felt he should spend more time on
          cultivation since many of his brilliant peers were competing with each
          other in order to improve their strength.</span

          status and reputation, it didn&#8217;t make a difference whether or
          not he took charge of the family. Many of the Elders who had been wary
          of him now all respected him and asked his opinions on various issues,
          not to mention all the Immortal Forces.</span

          Celestial Dynasty and is now known as Empress Mingkong, even defeating
          many of her royal uncles in a fight for the throne.&#8221; Gu Changge
          smiled, looking interested as he mentioned it suddenly.</span

          already has most of the power of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty
          within her grasp. Once the two of you officially consummate your
          marriage, the Upper Realm will truly fear you.&#8221; The Elder before
          Gu Changge smiled, extremely satisfied with their family’s future
          daughter-in-law.</span

          be traced back to before the Forbidden Epoch. She&#8217;s not that
          weak if she was able to achieve such things.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded,
          a smile reaching his eyes.</span

          World Domination, six are now with me and Mingkong. The only one left
          is the Sword of World Domination. While I hadn&#8217;t paid attention
          to the Sword, Mingkong would certainly not have forgotten about it.
          She must have already formulated a plan to acquire it.]</span

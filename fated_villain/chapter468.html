          get a glimpse of the truth. After all, many of them wanted to know how
          to resolve the grievances between the Sky Deer Goddess and Chen Suyun,
          since it significantly involved Sky Deer City and the Nine Great

          grievances with her?&#8221; At this time, a young man entered the
          place. He was Xiao Yang, and he had an anxious and worried expression
          on his face. He was shocked by the news he had received.</span

          beasts would have eaten him alive. In short, if there was no Chen
          Suyun, there would be no Xiao Yang. Furthermore, Chen Suyun had been
          nurturing him and teaching him. She treated him like how a sister or a
          mother would.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for the rumours surrounding the Sky Deer Goddess, he had already
          known about it. Many years ago, when the Upper Realm Army attacked Sky
          Deer City, a terrifying True Daoist was killed by the Sky Deer
          Goddess.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >That shocking battle had left the entire world trembling. From that
          point on, there was no denying that the Sky Deer Goddess was
          formidable.</span

          >&#8220;You also heard about it, right?&#8221; As Chen Suyun faced
          Xiao Yang, her gentle expression remained for a long time. She even
          revealed a rare smile.</span

          >&#8220;Eldest Senior Sister, the Sky Deer Goddess is a True Daoist
          whereas you are only in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm. If you want to
          resolve your grievances with her, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re not
          her match.&#8221; Xiao Yang couldn&#8217;t help but mention with worry
          as this matter made him even more concerned than his own battle with
          Gu Wudi in 3 days&#8217; time. After all, he regarded Chen Suyun as
          his Senior Sister and family member.</span

          resolved sooner or later. You don&#8217;t have to worry about
          it,&#8221; Chen Suyun answered gently. &#8220;Plus, she is much more
          gifted than me. I should&#8217;ve figured this out a long time ago.
          After all, she succeeded in achieving the Great Dao and had become a
          True Daoist much earlier than me. She&#8217;s probably even close to
          reaching the advanced stage of the Nirvana Realm whereas I&#8217;ve
          been in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm for close to 6 years without being
          able to make a breakthrough.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The moment she said that, she sighed again as her expression grew
          even more complicated.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This was the first time that Xiao Yang saw guilt on her face, which
          made him gape. He did not know what to say for a while because he did
          not know much about their grievances.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, judging from the current situation, Chen Suyun might have
          done something terrible, which was why she came to the Nine Great
          Mountains. Even if she had done something terrible, she was still his
          Senior Sister. Thus, he won&#8217;t let anyone harm her.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At this thought, Xiao Yang became solemn as he clenched his fist in
          secret.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;My Master was right back then. She was the most suitable
          candidate to be the next Sky Deer Goddess. She is the most talented
          after all. It’s only just that heaven forbids her from reaching the
          next Realm…&#8221; Chen Suyun sighed as she was a little emotional
          because she figured out how to calm herself down.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[That&#8217;s why I regret what happened in the past, but nothing in
          this world can eradicate our regret nor change what I have done.] She
          also could not reverse the River of Time and change what had happened
          in the past.</span

          >&#8220;Eldest Senior Sister, what actually happened? Why would the
          both of you meet on the battleground as enemies now?&#8221; Xiao Yang
          couldn&#8217;t help but ask.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Chen Suyun shook her head with guilt as she answered, &#8220;I have
          wronged her. Back then, I was jealous of her talent. When my Master
          intended to make her the next Sky Deer Goddess, I was not resigned to
          that fact. One fine day when Master was out, I took her away from Sky
          Deer City and tried to steal her Talents with a Secret Technique at
          Boundary Marker Sea. It was such a pity that when I was about to
          succeed, Master saw me and rushed to rescue her from death. In order
          to save her and preserve her Talents, Master did not hesitate to use
          her life to perform a Secret Technique. As a result, Master
          died.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She did not explain why she escaped from Sky Deer City and arrived at
          Nine Great Mountains and begged the Nine Mountain Elders to take her
          in because it no longer mattered.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In fact, she knew that her Junior Sister would hate her. Before their
          Master’s last breath, she had hoped that she could stop the internal
          strife. She even tried to ask her Junior Sister to let go of her
          hatred. On top of that, the Sky Deer Goddess knew that Chen Suyun had
          come to Nine Great Mountains alone, and if the Sky Deer Goddess came
          here alone, she might be killed before she could get her revenge.
          These were the reasons why she had not sought revenge after all these
          years.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang was silent after he listened to Chen Suyun&#8217;s words,
          but he soon raised his head and spoke up in a low voice. &#8220;Nobody
          is perfect. Since you have realised your mistake, I&#8217;ll forgive
          you if I were the Sky Deer Goddess. It&#8217;s been so many years; how
          can there be something that can&#8217;t be discussed in this world? If
          she is magnanimous, she shouldn&#8217;t be holding on to her grudge.
          What&#8217;s more, you are Martial Sisters. There is no one closer
          than you both.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I hope so too, but things are more complicated now because she
          is being accompanied by that young man…&#8221; Chen Suyun smiled when
          she heard those words and understood Xiao Yang&#8217;s insinuation.
          She felt that her Junior Sister would not let her off the hook with
          such ease and given her personality, she should not be that close to
          that young man.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Therefore, the greatest possibility was that the Sky Deer Goddess had
          used that young man&#8217;s power to intimidate the Nine Great
          Mountains into retreating from this matter.</span

          avenge their past.</span

          preparing for your battle with Gu Wudi in 3 days&#8217; time. Second
          Mountain Elder has told me about you, so I believe that you can win
          that bet within these 3 days.&#8221; After she spoke, there was
          exhaustion on Chen Suyun’s face as she waved her hands.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang understood that Chen Suyun wanted him to leave with such a
          gesture. He nodded and clenched his fists as he told himself,

          to hurt you.]</span

          Elder&#8217;s place as he wanted to seek the Elder&#8217;s assistance
          to help his Senior Sister. [I know that for my sake, Second Mountain
          Elder won&#8217;t stand aside and not bother about Eldest Senior

          Mountain, Gu Changge listened to the grievances the Sky Deer Goddess
          and Chen Suyun had without missing a beat.

          you are living well.&#8221; Outside the battlefield, Sky Deer Goddess
          looked at Chen Suyun, who was opposite her, with a faint smile. She
          looked like a Buddha Lotus—elegant, supple, and graceful.</span

          Sky Deer Goddess still smiled and mentioned, as if she reminisced
          about the past with her.</span

          was in the name of revenge. It’s because you were just that proud and
          confident…&#8221; Chen Suyun felt that her current Junior Sister would
          not hesitate to seek the assistance of others if it meant avenging
          her. In addition, her current personality was quite different from the
          Junior Sister she knew. She would not have believed that this person
          was her Junior Sister if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that the Sky
          Deer Goddess still had the same features.</span

          Chen Suyun&#8217;s expression was gloomy as her figure flashed to
          enter the battlefield in front of her. She was ready to fight to the
          death.</span

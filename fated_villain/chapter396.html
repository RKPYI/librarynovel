          following it scattering around it while alertly observing their
          surroundings. They exuded strong auras, and were the elite squad of
          Empress Yao Xi. Having spent years fighting wars, they exuded a
          formidable aura, which resembled an unstoppable tsunami even from far

          mix of reverence, respect, admiration, and fear in their eyes. Empress
          Yao Xi rarely left the imperial palace, so very few in the Demonic
          World had seen her true appearance. All important missions or
          directives came from her were carried out by her female officials.

          her otherworldly beauty. It was said that she was the most beautiful
          woman in the Demonic World for the past 6000 years, as her looks
          surpassed everyone else. Thus, there was an immeasurable amount of
          curiosity to the common people of the Demon World as to what she truly
          looked like.</span

          towards the black jade carriage, which had stopped above the clouds.
          Men and women alike looked on with fear and reverence, but some
          younger men felt some inappropriate feelings stirring inside them. No
          one had heard of any man appearing alongside her all these years, and
          all her closest advisors were women. It was impossible not to have any
          ‘other’ feelings for the all-powerful and gorgeous Empress who ruled
          over the Demonic World. This Banquet was now a chance for them to show
          off before her. At that thought, they became more motivated and
          driven.</span

          happen like this?] Jun Fan was standing in the crowd, his tall figure
          and handsome features giving him a unique charm. His fists were
          clenched as he stared fixedly at the black jade carriage. A sneer then
          appeared on his face before his expression became calm and confident
          again.</span

          clouds, making it resemble a paradise. Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s four
          female officials, Qing Zhu, Qing Mei, Qing Ju, and Qing Lan,
          approached the carriage rapidly. Qing Zhu&#8217;s expression was
          obedient as she opened the curtains to the carriage and soon, the
          beautiful Empress Yao Xi, walked out clad in robes embroidered with a
          phoenix.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had hair as black as ink, a tall and slender figure and a red
          pattern between her eyebrows. While she possessed a regal air, her
          features were indistinct as if blocked by a layer of Chaos Energy.
          Nonetheless, her eyes looked cold, noble, and condescending.</span

          flattered by this warm treatment.&#8221; Another man in black exited
          the carriage while laughing lightly. His movements felt almost
          ethereal and otherworldly, as if everything orbited around him. His
          hair glimmered with light, making him look like a young deity. His
          infinitely powerful aura made many from the Demonic World avert their
          eyes in shock, not daring to look at him directly.</span

          the Empress?&#8221; The important figures in the Demonic World look
          slightly taken aback. The Empress had to deem him important enough to
          let him ride in the carriage.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They knew the carriage held anotherworld within and wasn&#8217;t
          small like its appearance suggested, so the two of them weren&#8217;t
          huddled close together in the carriage. However, even her closest
          female officials didn&#8217;t have the right to ride in the carriage
          with her. So, why could a young man walk out of it in front of the
          important figures and ordinary folk of the Demonic World?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This was something previously unheard of, but considering Gu
          Changge&#8217;s status and abilities, they kept silent and smiled
          forcefully instead. Before this, Her Majesty had always behaved in a
          cold and aloof manner, so suddenly witnessing this astounded them
          immensely.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unlike the others who expressed disbelief and astonishment, Jun
          Fan&#8217;s expression was dark. While he concealed it well, he
          couldn&#8217;t hide the coldness in his eyes. He hadn&#8217;t expected
          to see her walk so close to another man during his first meeting with
          her after 6000 years. There were no intimate interactions between
          them, yet it made him uncomfortable. He might want to kill her for
          revenge, but she had still been his betrothed before. How could she
          journey together with another man like this?
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, he was competent enough that he managed to regain a natural
          expression without showing any signs of change. Song Youwei, who had
          been standing nearby and noticed his expression, looked slightly
          puzzled but did not ask further. Instead, she walked lightly towards
          him, skirts flowing with her movements.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Fan looked back at her with a smile. &#8220;Youwei. I thought you
          would return to the Black and White Academy during this time, but you
          remained at the Grand Tutor&#8217;s Manor and only showed up
          now.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          me, and I couldn&#8217;t get out of it. Did you want to see
          me?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He smiled. &#8221; I was planning to ask you about that famous man
          from the Upper Realm, who came recently, but I see that it&#8217;s no
          longer necessary.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Song Youwei was surprised but replied honestly, &#8220;So you wanted
          to ask about Young Master Changge? I have only met him once, but he
          gave me a good first impression. This is a man too perfect to be
          real.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing Song Youwei&#8217;s words made Jun Fan uncomfortable, but he
          maintained his careless and natural expression. &#8220;Really? I
          rarely see you have such a high opinion of someone.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He had asked her opinion of him before this but while she had praised
          him, it never achieved such heights. Compared to Gu Changge, he
          suddenly felt mediocre.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She smiled and bit her lip. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen such a
          perfect man before. He feels as unreal as the moon&#8217;s reflection
          in the water.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Fan nodded and did not continue pondering such a question. It
          didn&#8217;t matter if Gu Changge was beside Empress Yao Xi; he would
          still choose to assassinate her on this day. This concerned the
          Demonic World, and Gu Changge was just an outsider. If that man
          didn&#8217;t interfere, his job would be easier but he didn&#8217;t
          mind more trouble otherwise. Besides, Empress Yao Xi couldn&#8217;t
          bear the responsibility if something happened to Gu Changge in the
          Demonic World.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, Jun Fan and Song Youwei continued their discussion, where he
          asked indirectly about the men her father had brought with him. They
          could be considered good friends due to their familiarity with one
          another. That was because they had trained together before and it was
          hard to see who was inferior during their fight in the Academy
          tests.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since their backgrounds, looks, and abilities were more compatible
          than most, gossipers assumed there was something else to their
          relationship. However, Jun Fan knew well that she treated everyone the
          same way. Always soft and graceful, yet maintaining an appropriate
          boundary. He may be attracted to her, but he didn&#8217;t know what
          she thought of him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Song Youwei did not suspect anything after hearing his questions,
          telling him everything.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Really? Then I feel more assured.&#8221; Jun Fan nodded,
          pondering how he would make his move later. This was a rare chance for
          him and his subordinates, which they should never miss.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I wonder how inferior you think the young prodigies of the
          Demon World are compared to those in the Upper Realm.&#8221; Empress
          Yao Xi and Gu Changge were seated side by side on top of the Sacred
          Mountain. She pointed to the group gathered at the foot of the
          mountain while asking the question and smiling.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She did not ask how they compared to each other, since she knew the
          young prodigies in the Demonic World were still far inferior to those
          in the Upper Realm in terms of Talent, background, and roots. However,
          she did want to know what the prodigies of the Demonic World were like
          in the eyes of Gu Changge, the number one of the younger generation in
          the Upper Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge smiled back at her before his gaze swept across the sea of
          young figures amassed below. &#8220;To me, the only difference they
          have is their environment. After all, the environment in which one is
          present determines their view of the world and the people one meets.
          In terms of the level of cultivation, the young prodigies of the
          Demonic World may only be ranked in the middle-to-lower rung, or even
          the lower rung of the Upper Realm at most.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Empress Yao Xi nodded thoughtfully. She didn&#8217;t think his words
          were offensive but honest instead. How were the Demon World’s young
          prodigies comparable to those disciples born into Immortal Families
          and Immortal Sects?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s why I want to change the environment of the
          Demonic World. Yet people still oppose me and want everything to
          remain the same.&#8221; She sighed with some sadness.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge looked towards her with a smile. &#8220;Our descendants
          will judge whether it&#8217;s the right step or not. I think you are
          capable of doing that, so you don&#8217;t have to be concerned about
          those opinions.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;Do you really have this much faith in me?&#8221; She looked at

          flawless.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >He smiled and said with some regret, &#8220;Why won&#8217;t you
          believe that everything can be achieved with enough determination? You
          are such a person in my eyes. Your will is great, but I can&#8217;t
          interfere in issues of the Demonic World since I&#8217;m still an

          >She was already tired of hearing compliments and praises just to
          please her, as she had already gotten used to them. Had it been anyone
          else, she would have had him executed at once. When it came from Gu
          Changge though, she couldn&#8217;t help feeling delighted. That was a
          strange feeling as she usually hated to have any man with her, yet
          that didn&#8217;t happen when she was with Gu Changge. She
          wasn&#8217;t irritated by him, be it back at the Immortal Academy, or
          the first time they had met.</span

          >&#8220;If your Majesty thinks I&#8217;m flattering you, then you may
          be right. I rarely say such things to others except when I have
          ulterior motives.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled, looking open and
          honest.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Empress Yao Xi gazed at him, seemingly intrigued by his direct
          attitude. &#8220;Then what ulterior motives do you have towards
          me?&#8221;</span
        >

          >&#8220;There are only two things I desire: power or you. It
          isn&#8217;t a difficult question to answer, no?&#8221; He continued
          smiling.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She panicked internally after hearing that but maintained her usual
          calm demeanor.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The Banquet of Prodigies is starting.&#8221; She changed the
          subject and looked down towards the many young prodigies gathered
          below as if concentrating on watching the event. Gu Changge smiled and
          did not speak any further.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This Banquet was just an elaborate show for him to watch, as he had
          already found Jun Bufan after looking around a bit. It would&#8217;ve
          been better if Jun Bufan had maintained a low profile, but he was too
          conspicuous. Gu Changge would&#8217;ve taken a long time to check
          every young prodigy&#8217;s Fortuity due to the sheer number of them
          present, but Jun Bufan had to show up and deliberately flaunt his
          powerful Talents and strength.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, the main reason was Song Youwei. Gu Changge had been
          paying attention to her movements, and as soon as she walked towards a
          blue-clothed man, he had a hunch. After checking his Fortuity, Jun
          Bufan&#8217;s identity was revealed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Naturally Gu Changge didn&#8217;t expose it as it would cause panic.
          He was planning on enjoying the entire show first.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Demon World was murky, and Empress Yao Xi was just a moveable
          pawn to him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many eyes had been watching her from the shadows while she was
          fighting against Jun Bufan. Although she seemed to have the upper
          hand, that was far from the truth. After all, Jun Bufan had easily
          obtained knowledge of all her movements and locations, much less those
          large fishes hiding within the shadows. The Five Demon Overlords of
          the past had eventually disappeared; but had they really died? Still
          the greater value of Jun Bufan&#8217;s existence in Gu Changge&#8217;s
          eyes lay in luring out the bigger fishes behind him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just as Gu Changge was talking to Empress Yao Xi, the Banquet of
          Prodigies had already started. Many young prodigies began displaying
          their strong abilities and techniques as they climbed towards the
          peak.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The cliffs of the mountain were tall and steep, shimmering with
          arrays and runes which exuded a formidable auras. Anyone with a low
          cultivation level wouldn&#8217;t be able to balance themselves and
          fall off after several steps. This was merely a checkpoint for the
          Sacred Mountain; anyone who wanted to reach the peak had to power
          through the checkpoints and also defend themselves against sneak
          attacks. It was truly difficult. Besides that, 108 jade stairs were
          glowing in different colours and covered with terrifying swirling
          energy.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The young prodigies attempted to reach the top as fast as they could
          by utilising their abilities. Two people who had quarrelled before
          this were fighting, eliciting terrifying quakes which spread
          everywhere and gained attention from the others. Similar scenes
          occurred all over the mountain, too many to count. This often occurred
          in the Banquet of Prodigies which was held every twenty years, and
          each time innumerable members of the younger generation would die.
          None of their families, nor force behind them dared to interfere and
          stop it.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, many began seeing it as a chance at a fair battle so they could
          fight to the death.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge had no interest in all this, naturally. According to the
          usual plotlines, there wouldn&#8217;t be any surprises for events like
          this, which had been designed to let the Fortuitous Ones show off
          their strength.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Bufan had encountered several opponents claiming to be superior
          young prodigies of the Demonic World, and fought with them, causing
          the ground to shake intensely and attracting the attention and shock
          of everyone else.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, Gu Changge knew this wouldn&#8217;t continue for much
          longer. As the reborn son of a Demonic Overlord, Jun Bufan&#8217;s
          abilities and strength could easily surpass other young prodigies in
          the same cultivation level. With his Fortuity to protect him, it was
          expected that he would hide his abilities and feign weakness to
          overpower his enemies. Thus, he lost all interest in watching the
          event after glancing several times at Jun Bufan.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His attention turned to the surrounding area and he made guesses as
          to where any potential riots would begin. The Grand Tutor, the
          Quelling Chaos King, and the commander of the Demon World military had
          their armies hidden nearby. Besides, the major clans from all Nine
          Domains of the Demon World were here as well, which meant they would
          have powerful cultivators accompanying them. He wasn&#8217;t sure if
          those powerful cultivators were allies of the Empress, though. Thus,
          from what he could observe, Empress Yao Xi was truly surrounded by
          danger.</span

          probably here too. I just don&#8217;t know where she&#8217;s hiding.
          Except for Empress Yao Xi, it seems that her side doesn&#8217;t know
          Jun Bufan&#8217;s true identity and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re
          still observing the situation. What is in that brocade bag she&#8217;s
          holding? Why is it so valuable that the Solar Demon Overlord has
          handed it to the Demon Master, Bai Kun, like this?]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge narrowed his eyes as he glanced around. From where he sat,
          there were far too many people crowded near the Sacred Mountain. It
          would be difficult to find Bai Lian&#8217;er here. Besides, she would
          change her appearance since she wouldn&#8217;t show her true face to
          outsiders. As the daughter of the Demon Master Bai Kun, her looks
          wouldn&#8217;t be a mystery to the Demon World.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that thought, Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes flashed and he summoned a
          subordinate. &#8220;Pay attention to the surrounding areas. If you see
          anyone with a suspicious aura approaching, capture them at
          once.&#8221;</span

          >Qing Zhu, who had been standing behind Empress Yao Xi, looked
          slightly awkward but no one noticed. She knew something drastic would
          happen today, which would have an enormous impact on Empress Yao Xi as
          well as the Demon World.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her palms were damp with sweat even now. A few days ago, Jun Fan had
          handed her the pill powder which made her feel frantic and uneasy
          after she returned. However, after considering that this concerned her
          future survival, she calmed down and began carrying out the
          plan.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were all responsible for the resources Empress Yao Xi used in
          her cultivation as well as the spiritual teas and celestial fruits she
          consumed daily, so it was easy enough adding the pill powder to it.
          Empress Yao Xi did not notice anything strange either. Just as Jun Fan
          had said, the ingredients of the pill powder weren&#8217;t poisonous
          so Empress Yao Xi wouldn&#8217;t possibly suspect her if Her Majesty
          became suspicious. Qing Zhu thus relaxed her guard and waited for him
          to carry out the final stage of his plan.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that Gu Changge was with Empress Yao Xi though, things might have
          become more complicated. He had even sent out his subordinates to kill
          anyone suspicious.

          she could discern from the conversation between the two that he would
          not stand by if anything happened. [What is the probability that Jun
          Fan&#8217;s plan would work now?]</span

          >“What happened, Young Master Changge? Did you see anything?&#8221;
          Empress Yao Xi was studying the young prodigies below when she
          suddenly heard Gu Changge&#8217;s order and couldn&#8217;t help but
          raise her eyebrows.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          suddenly.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Empress Yao Xi knew what he meant and felt warm. She smiled and did
          not enquire further, as she would encounter assassination attempts
          either from the remnants of the Five Demon Overlords&#8217; or the
          other major Clans every time the Banquet of Prodigies was held. She
          had already gotten used to it. Under normal circumstances, there would
          be many who couldn&#8217;t wait any longer and find an opportunity to
          attack. Gu Changge sending out his subordinates to find anyone
          suspicious was undeniably his indirect attempt to protect her. This
          made that strange feeling rise in her again.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Over the past 6000 years, she had dealt with every danger herself.
          While the Grand Tutor would sometimes provide ideas and strategies,
          she had to face them herself while relying on her cruel methods and
          abilities to clear up and control everything. It was exhausting and
          taxing, so seeing Gu Changge do this made her feel a certain
          dependence on him. She shook her head quickly to clear that thought.
          After all, she was the Empress ruling over uncountable people in the
          Demonic World and Gu Changge was merely a young Junior.</span

          and his tone one of intrigue.</span

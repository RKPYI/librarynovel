        <h4>Chapter 144: Stand Still; Get Killed!</h4>
        <p> <b>“Long Teng? Who’s that? It’s not every day someone goes to find trouble with Gu Changge.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>[Woosh!]</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er sat upright on a Cultivation Stone under a waterfall falling from the sky like a galaxy, raised
            the hem of her skirt, and soaked her fair, bare, small feet in the water below her. </p>
        <p> She had a leisurely appearance as she kicked her feet in the water now and then. </p>
        <p> From time to time, she would also look at a group of black apes with red eyes not too far away from her, and
            wondered just what was going through their little heads. </p>
        <p> Right then, she wrinkled her delicate brows, and muttered to herself, <b>“I never thought Gu Changge, that
                villain, will have a day like this…”</b> </p>
        <p> Of course, she also received the news. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge, who always caused trouble for others, ended up encountering someone who wanted to trouble him.
        </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er could only express pity for the man named Long Teng in response to the news. </p>
        <p> She didn’t believe that anyone from the younger generation could be Gu Changge’s opponent, after witnessing
            his overwhelming strength that day. </p>
        <p> No one could compete with Gu Changge unless she grew up. </p>
        <p> <b>“A’Hong, is it true that the [Eight Saint Bananas] are about to ripen?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er asked. </p>
        <p> The ‘A’Hong’ in her words was the big red bird with drooping eyelids beside her. </p>
        <p> A’Hong had an extraordinary talent for treasure hunting and had helped her a lot along the way, so Gu
            Xian’er listened to it and waited here for the [Eight Saint Bananas] to ripen. </p>
        <p> It was for this reason that the red-eyed black apes stared at her with vigilance as if they were keeping an
            eye on a well-known thief. </p>
        <p> This angered Gu Xian’er. </p>
        <p> After all, she had only stopped here in the beginning to appreciate the beautiful scenery! Was that a crime?
        </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er didn’t care about the fact that A’Hong ignored her, and kept muttering to herself, <b>“Actually,
                I do want to see that Gu Changge suffer a setback. It’s a pity that this Long Teng is only about to
                reach the True God Realm…judging from the insidiousness of Gu Changge, even if he somehow entered the
                True God Realm, I doubt he would be able to stand a chance in front of him.”</b> </p>
        <p> She reached this conclusion after careful consideration for a long time. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s apparent Cultivation Base was probably just to trick the people. </p>
        <p> Her vision far exceeded the others, and she had also received guidance from several mighty masters, so she
            understood certain secrets that her peers couldn’t come to comprehend. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was already able to crush all of his peers when he was young, so the Cultivation Base he revealed
            right now was most likely just the tip of the iceberg. </p>
        <p> Back then, the Power of the Natural Laws contained in his terrifying sword art shocked her, and afterward,
            Gu Xian’er even suspected that Gu Changge had probably entered the Sacred Realm already. </p>
        <p> ‘It seems that revenge is far away, so let’s go and watch the show for now.’ </p>
        <p> ‘Gu Changge’s always treated his enemies with cruelty, so I wonder how miserable this Long Teng will end
            up…’ </p>
        <p> Thinking of this, Gu Xian’er stood up, grabbed the big red bird, threw it on her shoulder, and then turned
            into a divine ray of light and disappeared from the place. </p>
        <p> Although the [Eight Saint Bananas] were rare, her desire to watch Gu Changge play someone to death exceeded
            her desire for the treasure. </p>
        <p> Over the past few days, the scenes from that day kept playing in her mind from time to time. </p>
        <p> Just like that day, a mighty back would suddenly fall from the sky and block the wind and rain for her. </p>
        <p> The back wasn’t big, but it was solid and unmovable and made her feel at ease as if it could shoulder the
            sky for her even if it fell. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er didn’t want to admit that she merely wanted an excuse to go watch Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> At the same time, she could also witness the fate of that arrogant Long Teng. </p>
        <p> Right then, the big red bird gave Gu Xian’er a sideways glance, as if saying, ‘Oh! Woman.’ </p>
        <p> …… </p>
        <p> Massive waves went through every inch of the Ancient Immortal Continent over this period. </p>
        <p> The leader of the Ancient Immortal Continent’s younger generation, Long Teng, brought along a large number
            of his followers and set off to look for Gu Changge everywhere. </p>
        <p> The ridicule of the cultivators from the outside enraged him to no end, and so many Young Heavenly Geniuses
            from the outside suffered at his poisonous hands. </p>
        <p> These incidents aroused the rage of the younger generation from the outside world, and many of them banded
            together to fight against the creatures of the Continent with a tacit understanding. </p>
        <p> Alas! The cultivators from the outside couldn’t match up to the Ancient Immortal Continent’s creatures in
            terms of tyrannical means. </p>
        <p> This made their side suffer a lot, too. </p>
        <p> Many Young Supremes were injured in the battles! They were ambushed, and many of their followers fell, too.
        </p>
        <p> This result shocked the cultivators from the outside world and made them understand the true meaning of
            their current experience. </p>
        <p> The Ancient Immortal Continent held countless opportunities, but you were most likely to die vying for them.
        </p>
        <p> Among the creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent, the most dangerous were the young prodigies of the
            Ancient Immortal Tribe. Many Young Masters led by Long Teng were tyrannical in their actions, and even the
            Young Supremes of the outside world suffered a lot at their hands. </p>
        <p> But soon, a cultivator noticed that Gu Changge, who hadn’t released a single sound until now, finally made
            his appearance. </p>
        <p> He brought along a large number of his followers and killed swaths of Ancient Immortal Continent’s creatures
            from place to place in his wake. </p>
        <p> For a while, the Ancient Immortal Continent fell into chaos. </p>
        <p> Be it the outsiders or the aboriginals, everyone’s attention was drawn toward the conflict, and many felt
            that the battle will turn into one between dragons and tigers. </p>
        <p> The identity of the two adversaries could be said to be on the same level, and both represented the younger
            generation of their worlds. </p>
        <p> <b>[Atop a mountain.]</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge stood with his hands behind his back and watched the clouds surging in front of him. The mighty
            winds made his crystal-like hair flow around like ink feathers, and his clean robes also fluttered. </p>
        <p> <b>“Master, we have received news that Long Teng is in the East right now. There are seven followers of the
                False God Realm beside him, too. Other than that, there are also followers in the Conferred King Realm,
                but none in the Conferred Lord Realm.”</b> </p>
        <p> A Yasha-like creature reported with respect. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge nodded once he heard the report of his follower and said, <b>“That should be the total strength
                of that Long Teng, no?”</b>
        </p>
        <p> <b>“Spread the news that I will kill him where he stands, so he better stand still for me.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Tell him I have one of his bitches — if he doesn’t want her to die, then he better not run around.”</b>
        </p>
        <p> Gu Changge said with a smile. </p>
        <p> There were countless creatures of the Continent suppressed behind him. Over the last period, all of them
            banded together for Long and killed the cultivators from the outside, but when they heard the news regarding
            him, they all rushed over to his place. </p>
        <p> <b>“It will be as the Master commanded.”</b> </p>
        <p> The Yasha-like follower had a humble appearance and dared not show the slightest doubt towards Gu Changge’s
            command, and then turned into a divine ray of light and left. </p>
        <p> As for the creatures who were suppressed behind Gu Changge? When they heard his words, they cried out in
            unwillingness, <b>“Don’t be so arrogant, Gu b*****d! Lord Long Teng will come to save us.”</b> </p>
        <p> Among them was a dragon-horned girl with a beautiful face and slightly thin lips; as soon as she heard his
            words, her face paled. </p>
        <p> She was the ‘b***h’ Gu Changge just spoke about, and she was a fervent worshiper of Long Teng. </p>
        <p> She was the one who took the initiative to bring a bunch of people to look for Gu Changge’s trail, and even
            boasted that she would bring him back for Long Teng to slaughter him with his hands. </p>
        <p> Moreover, it was well-known by now that she was also the one looking for favored daughters of heaven from
            different races for Long Teng. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong was also selected by her for Long Teng, so right after leaving the Black Sky Eagle Family’s
            territory, Gu Changge gathered a bunch of his followers and blocked her. </p>
        <p> By now, all of her subordinates had died at Gu Changge’s hands. </p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge, Lord Long Teng won’t let you go if you dare to do something to me!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“All of you will die if I lose a single hair! Even if your fiancee is favored by Lord Long Teng, there
                will be no…”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s cruel methods over the past few days frightened the dragon-horned girl, and she couldn’t help
            but tremble with a frightened expression. </p>
        <p> Right now, she just wanted to use Long Teng’s name to calm down Gu Changge, and make sure he wouldn’t
            slaughter her like the others. </p>
        <p> <b>“Cut her tongue out for me.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge frowned when he heard her ravings, and then commanded. </p>
        <p> He wanted to slap this mentally retarded s**t to death who had eyes but couldn’t see Mt. Tai, but then he
            thought of keeping her as a surprise for Long Teng. </p>
        <p> Since Long Teng dared to covet his woman, there was no way he could go easy on him. </p>
        <p> <b>“As you command, Master!”</b> </p>
        <p> Immediately, one of Gu Changge’s followers took out a sword. </p>
        <p> <b>“You dare…”</b> </p>
        <p> In the next moment, under her frightened and resentful gaze, a sword fell with a puff. </p>
        <p> Blood splattered everywhere. </p>
        <p> For a while, the top of the mountain turned pin-drop silent. </p>
        <p> The rest of the creatures from the Continent were so frightened that their faces turned paler. </p>
        <p> Over the last few days, Gu Changge slaughtered their people for various reasons: ‘some were killed on the
            spot because Gu Changge was hungry — they were forced back to their original forms, and then he peeled their
            skins and ripped out their tendons, and barbecued them on the spot.’ </p>
        <p> His cruelty frightened everyone, and no one dared to even breathe now. </p>
        <p> Although the young man in front of them had a handsome appearance, his methods were crueler than the devils.
        </p>
        <p> He even dared to cut the tongue of Long Teng’s woman, and that made them tremble due to extreme fright. </p>
        <p> <b>[Boom!]</b> </p>
        <p> Afterward, divine rays of light soared into the sky and filled the surroundings with brilliance as an
            astonishing aura spread in all directions — Gu Changge took everyone to Long Teng’s location. </p>
        <p> The cultivators who saw the scene were shocked. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m</p>
        <p> After that, they bubbled in excitement. </p>
        <p> Knowing that Gu Changge wanted to take the initiative to slaughter Long Teng, they couldn’t help but follow
            after him without thinking. </p>
        <p> For a time, the sensation going through the Ancient Immortal Continent doubled in intensity. </p>
        <p> The Young Supremes from the outside knew that Gu Changge was strong, but even they never expected him to be
            so ruthless. Not only did he catch many of Long Teng’s followers, but he even told him to stand still and
            die at his hands. </p>
        <p> One had to know that almost all of the Young Supremes had suffered under the poisonous attacks of the
            Continent’s creatures, so they were frustrated and depressed right now! </p>
        <p> <b>“It seems that Brother Gu wants to fight Long Teng! I can’t wait to watch their exchange.”</b> </p>
        <p> Ye Langtian was scaling mountains with his followers when he received the news, and couldn’t help but show a
            smile filled with expectation. </p>
        <p> In another place, Peng Fei, the Young Master of the Golden-Winged Great Peng Family, also turned into a
            streak of golden light and headed in that direction to watch the show. </p>
        <p> The Young Supreme of the Ancient Immortal Wang Family, Wang Wushuang, also made his way to the big show’s
            location. </p>
        <p> There were also countless other Young Supremes from Dao Heritages like the Undead Lake, and whatnot, who
            bubbled in excitement and looked forward to the battle. </p>
        <p> Right now, cultivators from all over the Ancient Immortal Continent were shocked when they heard Gu Changge
            threaten Long Teng. </p>
        <p> ‘Stand still, get killed!’ </p>
        <p> That statement showed Gu Changge’s self-confidence and domineering means and made the blood of everyone from
            the younger generation boil as they looked forward to the excitement. </p>
        <p> After all, they had all suffered at the hands of the creatures from the Continent after those scum ambushed
            them. </p>
        <p> The atmosphere boiled in every direction! </p>
        <p> Even countless creatures from the Continent were shocked and felt that a massive earthquake was about to
            shake everything to its core. </p>
        <p> After all, no one had dared talk to Long Teng like this before, unless they were courting death. </p>
        <p> …… </p>
        <p> <b>[On top of a mountain at this time.]</b> </p>
        <p> A young figure covered in dragon scales, with dragon horns above his head, stood amid endless brilliance and
            runes flowing around him and released a strong aura in all directions. </p>
        <p> One couldn’t see his true body because he was surrounded by a dazzling Dragon Script that exuded deep and
            powerful majesty. </p>
        <p> There seemed to be an endless starry sky around him. </p>
        <p> It was Long Teng, standing there like a young True Dragon. </p>
        <p> Right now, his expression had sunk as low as the bottom of an ocean. </p>
        <p> His terrifying aura oppressed the world around him and made his followers desire to kneel and kowtow before
            him. </p>
        <p> <b>“Our Lord is enraged! That young man named Gu Changge is too arrogant; no one has dared talk to Our Lord
                like that before.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Damn, he even told Our Lord to stand on the spot and die in his hands!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Damn! Damn! Damn! I am seething! Since when could nobodies despise Our Lord like this? What’s more? That
                guy is just a human from the outside world…”</b> </p>
        <p> Long Teng’s followers were furious. </p>
        <p> They had long been searching for Gu Changge’s traces, but Gu Changge suddenly appeared out of thin air and
            said that he was coming to slaughter Long Teng. </p>
        <p> He was even more arrogant than Long Teng! </p>
        <p> <b>“You dare to threaten me?! Very well, I will make you regret every word you uttered.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“He thinks I don’t know how high the sky is? Then I will stand here and wait for him. Do you think he
                will dare come here?”</b> </p>
        <p> Right then, Long Teng also opened his mouth and uttered those words with a frighteningly cold tone. </p>
        <p> His voice held deep gloom and desire for murder. </p>
        <p> He had never felt this much rage before, since no one dared to provoke and despise him like this, EVER! </p>
        <p> Moreover, the other party even threatened him and made it seem like he would run away otherwise! </p>
        <p> How could Long Teng, the most arrogant under Heaven who considered himself to be number one, bear such
            humiliation? </p>
        <p> Though he knew that the other party was probably trying to rile him up, he still couldn’t suppress his rage.
        </p>
        <p> He might have ignored the ravings if they came from a nobody, by thinking of them as an ant trying to prance
            in front of him, but the one who spoke was someone he threatened to murder! </p>
        <p> This made it difficult for Long Teng to calm down, and he wanted to torture Gu Changge to death with his
            hands while riding his woman right in front of him! </p>
        <p> <b>“Good, come here to die!”</b> </p>
        <p> Soon, Long Teng also spread the news that he was waiting for Gu Changge to come and die in his hands. </p>
        <p> The announcements made by the two shook the Ancient Immortal Continent and it boiled even more! </p>
        <p> Creatures from the Continent and youths from the outside world rushed towards the scene of the soon-to-be
            slaughter-fest. </p>
        <p> Before long, a large number of people gathered on the nearby peaks and created a sea of people… </p>

      <h4>
        Chapter 216-1: Feeling that something big will happen, Gu Changge rushes
        to Heavenly Star Realm (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "Brother, what's the matter with you recently? Many Clan Elders are very
        disappointed with you, thinking that your seclusion has made your head
        stupid."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Palace of the Heavenly Emperor, Ying Shuang was thinking about
        many countermeasures.
      </p>
      <p>At the palace gate.</p>
      <p>
        A beautiful girl with silver hair appeared, with a glow all over her
        body as she looked extremely divine. It was Ying Yu.
      </p>
      <p>
        She frowned, with dissatisfaction and doubt written all over her face.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have my own intentions in this matter, you don't have to worry about
        it."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang heard the words, his face was dull, he turned back and said
        lightly.
      </p>
      <p>In front of Ying Yu, his brother's majesty was still very useful.</p>
      <p>
        This was the only thing that was somewhat gratifying in his current very
        bad situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        His younger sister, Ying Yu, although she seemed to be strong, was still
        very obedient in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he insisted on going back to the mountain, Ying Yu was reluctant in
        every possible way, but she was finally called back by him on the
        grounds that his eldest brother was like his father.
      </p>
      <p>Now, by his side, only Ying Yu could help him.</p>
      <p>
        He had no impression of the followers left by his father at all, and he
        had to think carefully before he dared to order them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since my brother said so, then I won't ask any more questions. Now it
        is rumored that you are afraid of Gu Changge, and you dare not confront
        him face to face, and dare not clear your suspicions…"
      </p>
      <p>
        "After all, Gu Changge really is the root of this matter. If he speaks,
        it will be a lot easier for you to clear your suspicions, brother. I
        don't know what your plan is."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But it is impossible for the Heavenly Emperor Mountain to be framed for
        no reason, especially the title of the inheritor of demonic art, which
        has been detained."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, in Ying Yu's eyes, a trace of disappointment at Ying
        Shuang flashed, and she said lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Ying Shuang's expression changed slightly, and he
        understood what Ying Yu meant.
      </p>
      <p>
        She planned to go to confront Gu Changge herself, to clear the suspicion
        of being the inheritor of demonic art for the Heavenly Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, since Gu Changge has ulterior motives, how can you believe his
        words? You are not allowed to go."
      </p>
      <p>Ying Shuang's face sank, and he felt uneasy in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        He was not sure whether Gu Changge knew his secret, but the key point
        was that Gu Changge was definitely not a good person!
      </p>
      <p>Ying Yu was so simple, who knew if she would go wrong this time?</p>
      <p>"Why not? Brother, are you afraid of Gu Changge?"</p>
      <p>
        "Although his strength is very strong, and his power is even more
        powerful right now, he is someone from the younger generation, and the
        most taboo thing for the younger generation is to compete with him…
        Brother, as the most important son of father, you are now being framed,
        and you don't even have the courage to confront them."
      </p>
      <p>
        "To be honest, I'm very disappointed in you. This is completely
        different from you before."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu frowned, her voice was very crisp and clear, cold, and not
        polite at all as she said everything in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Ying Shuang's face turned pale, and he felt like he was
        being pricked.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        But he still forced himself to calm down, and then showed a bit of a wry
        smile, "Ying Yu, you misunderstood me, I actually have my own
        hardships."
      </p>
      <p>"What's the trouble?"</p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu seemed a little suspicious, but Ying Shuang seemed a little
        convincing while saying this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang looked at her, suddenly took a deep breath, looked outside
        the hall, and then lowered his voice in a suspicious look, "During this
        period of time, during my cultivation, I accidentally cut off some of my
        memories…"
      </p>
      <p>"What?!"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Ying Yu's eyes suddenly widened, she was a little
        unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother, are you telling the truth?"</p>
      <p>She looked back again, trying to make sure it was true or not.</p>
      <p>
        "It's true, I only told you about this because you are my most trusted
        person."
      </p>
      <p>Ying Shuang sighed and said a little helplessly.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, this was already in his plan. After all, no matter how he
        pretended to be, he would always be found to be flawed and different.
      </p>
      <p>
        So he simply confessed and thought of a saying that he accidentally lost
        a part of his memory while cultivating.
      </p>
      <p>
        He believed that Ying Yu would believe it, because his spirit aura had
        not changed, and even the weapons in his spirit had not noticed anything
        abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>"Why didn't you tell me earlier?"</p>
      <p>Ying Yu's eyes became very complicated.</p>
      <p>
        She was relatively simple minded, although she felt strange, but she did
        not worry too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she understood a little bit why Ying Shuang's actions during
        this period were quite different from those in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I've been trying to get that part of my memory back all this time, so I
        didn't tell you."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang replied, with a sigh of relief at the same time, it seemed
        that this statement was temporarily concealed from Ying Yu.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's alright, since there is a problem with your cultivation, brother,
        then you can rest assured to cultivate in the temple first, and see if
        you can retrieve that part of the memory. Let me clear the suspicion of
        the inheritor of demonic arts."
      </p>
      <p>
        After a moment of silence, Ying Yu spoke again, with a firm tone that
        was beyond doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Ying Shuang's expression changed slightly, and he wanted to
        say something to stop her, but found that he couldn't find any
        legitimate reason.
      </p>
      <p>If he stopped her again, it would arouse Ying Yu's suspicion.</p>
      <p>
        "Okay, but you have to beware of Gu Changge. Judging from his actions of
        framing the Heavenly Emperor Mountain, he shouldn't be a good person,
        you have to be careful…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang sighed slightly on the surface, but his heart was tight,
        giving birth to a deep sense of unease.
      </p>
      <p>
        He always felt that something big would happen when Ying Yu went out
        this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        He only hoped that Ying Yu would not easily believe Gu Changge's words.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, there would be a lot of trouble.</p>
      <p>"I know, don't worry, brother."</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Ying Yu replied lightly, then left the hall and began to call many of
        her followers, ready to leave the mountain and confront Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>Outside the mountain gate of Purple Immortal Pill Sect.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stood with his hands behind his back, with only Old Ming
        behind him. Now, with his status and power, he didn't need to bring
        extra people.
      </p>
      <p>No matter where he went, no one would dare to neglect him.</p>
      <p>
        "Compared to the last time I came here, this Purple Pill Sect seems to
        be a little more prosperous. It seems that it should be a relationship
        with someone strong in recent years."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded slightly, and his eyes swept across the vast and
        magnificent mountains in front of him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on
        n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
      </p>
      <p>The scene became more and more meteoric.</p>
      <p>
        In the high sky, the rays of the sun were bright, and the aura of
        Immortal Pills were constantly reflecting various visions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mountains and rivers, the palaces and pavilions, everything was
        magnificent.
      </p>
      <p>Just when all kinds of thoughts passed through Gu Changge's mind.</p>
      <p>
        "Young Master Changge, please wait a moment, Sect Master and the others
        are on their way."
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the disciples who went to report also rushed back, with a sincere
        expression on their faces.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the person standing in front of the mountain gate was Gu
        Changge!
      </p>
      <p>
        The most astonishing and terrifying young man in the Upper Realm today!
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter who saw him, it would probably be difficult to keep their
        calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, hearing that Gu Changge was coming to visit, the entire Purple
        Immortal Pill Sect was sensationalized, and every Elder hurriedly put
        down what they were doing and left to greet him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge nodded slightly, but he was not in a hurry.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's really an honor for my Purple Pill Sect to have Young Master
        Changge."
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>Several divine lights arrived!</p>
      <p>
        With a burst of gentle words, a beautiful woman in a palace dress
        brought many Elders of the Purple Immortal Pill Sect and arrived in a
        mighty manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was Zi Yan, the current sect master of Purple Immortal Pill Sect.
      </p>
      <p>Behind her was Elder Crazy Fire and others.</p>
      <p>
        There was also a woman in a blue dress with a beautiful and impressive
        face, gentle like water, and her eyes were looking at Gu Changge with
        surprise.
      </p>
      <p>It was Lin Qiuhan, whom he hadn't seen for a long time.</p>
      <p>
        Her cultivation had reached the King Realm. Although she was not as good
        as many young supreme beings, she was not sure how much stronger she was
        than when she was in the Lower Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the most important thing was her alchemy cultivation base,
        which could already refine God-level medicinal pills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The so-called God-level medicinal pills corresponded to the needs of the
        cultivators in the Godly Realm. False Gods, True Gods, Heavenly Gods,
        and God Kings were all Gods, but they were just general names.
      </p>
      <p>
        She even had a good chance of refining the elixir for a Quasi-Sacred
        Realm cultivator, with the help of the lders.
      </p>
      <p>From this one could see her powerful alchemy talent.</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 216-2: Feeling that something big will happen, Gu Changge rushes
        to Heavenly Star Realm (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        At her age, the rest of the alchemists were still tinkering with
        medicinal herbs, most of which were refining simple medicinal pills.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took at least thousands of years, or even tens of thousands of years,
        to refine the pills of the Godly level.
      </p>
      <p>"Sect Master Zi Yan! Let me see Qiuhan."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded slightly, with a warm smile on his face. Visitt
        nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, he looked at Lin Qiuhan in the crowd, his smile did not
        change, "Qiuhan, I haven't seen you for a long time, it seems that your
        cultivation has improved a lot."
      </p>
      <p>"Young master."</p>
      <p>
        Lin Qiuhan looked at him tenderly, and was very pleasantly surprised.
        She never expected that Gu Changge would come to the Purple Immortal
        Pill Sect in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made her a little flattered, and it seemed like she thought wrong
        that she had been forgotten by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, she still felt a little self-pity for she couldn't help Gu
        Changge, and was useless to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Gu Changge came to see her in person, he immediately doused all
        these speculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that Gu Changge still hadn't forgotten her, but there were too
        many things, and he was too busy, and couldn't make time to come.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge, please!"</p>
      <p>
        Sect Master Zi Yan smiled and led the way for Gu Changge. The last time
        Gu Changge arrived, it was only one Elder who came to greet him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now it was her who took the lead, and the whole family went
        together, which was enough to show the vast difference between Gu
        Changge's power and status.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, Gu Changge's limelight could be said to
        overshadow the entire Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>However, her smile was a little reluctant.</p>
      <p>
        In the opinion of Sect Master Zi Yan, Lin Qiuhan was sent by Gu Changge,
        and everyone knew what purpose he was holding at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Lin Qiuhan's talent for alchemy was very strong, making it
        difficult for them to refuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally thinking of cultivating Lin Qiuhan for a few years, she would
        develop feelings for the sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Sect Master Zi Yan later found out that their views were very wrong.
        In Lin Qiuhan's heart, Gu Changge had always been the first priority,
        and even her master and the sect were second.
      </p>
      <p>It left them speechless.</p>
      <p>
        No wonder Gu Changge sent Lin Qiuhan over so confidently at that time,
        and dared to say that he had already poured ecstasy soup on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made the Elders of Purple Immortal Pill Sect helpless, and finally
        they could only recognize it by pinching their noses.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also hoped that Gu Changge would forget Lin Qiuhan, so that Lin
        Qiuhan would understand that Gu Changge was not a good person and then
        they would pin her thoughts on the sect.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone was eager for Gu Changge to not come.</p>
      <p>But when he came, they had to make a very welcoming gesture.</p>
      <p>
        This made the Elders of the Purple Pill Sect feel uncomfortable and
        depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "These days, I would like to thank Sect Master Zi Yan and the Elders for
        their concern and care for my Qiuhan."
      </p>
      <p>"This Gu is very grateful."</p>
      <p>
        On the way to the depths of Purple Immortal Pill Sect, Gu Changge
        couldn't help but smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could naturally see the thoughts of many Elders, but he didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside Gu Changge, Lin Qiuhan, who heard the word "my Qiuhan", suddenly
        turned red and her head went dizzy.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of things that she wanted to say to Gu Changge were buzzing and
        turned into a mess.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What can you say, Young Master Changge, Qiuhan is the descendant of my
        Purple Immortal Pill Sect after all, so I should take care of her."
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the Elders had a slightly unnatural expression on his face, and
        he was about to scold Gu Changge for being shameless.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Therefore, Zi Yan deliberately emphasized her tone on the sentence that
        Lin Qiuhan belonged to their Purple Immortal Pill Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if they spent a lot of energy and resources to cultivate Lin
        Qiuhan and Gu Changge took her away in a blink of an eye, wouldn't they
        be depressed to death?
      </p>
      <p>
        The expressions of the other Elders were also very unnatural, unlike the
        beginning, who welcomed Gu Changge very much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled disapprovingly, and looked at Lin Qiuhan who was
        beside him, talking about the past, and asked about her time here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lin Qiuhan, who was now the descendant of Purple Immortal Pill Sect, was
        completely incomparable with her original identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But from Gu Changge's point of view, she still looked the same as
        before, not much different.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few words, she was dizzy and couldn't discern the north from
        south.
      </p>
      <p>Stupid, yet very simple.</p>
      <p>
        This scene fell in the eyes of the Elders of Purple Immortal Pill Sect,
        which made them sigh secretly, but if they were other women, under the
        care and inquiry of Gu Changge it would be difficult for them to control
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Purple Immortal Pill Sect held a Pill banquet for Gu Changge's
        sudden visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was said that it was a pill banquet, but it was actually a simple
        competition of pill refining.
      </p>
      <p>This was a form of hospitality from the Pill Dao lineages.</p>
      <p>
        The outstanding disciples of the younger generation all made
        appearances, showing their own cultivation of alchemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, in the sky, the rays of light were bright, and the Pill
        aura filled the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Lin Qiuhan was not very old, in terms of the cultivation of
        alchemy, she was a well-deserved senior sister of the current
        generation, and was considered unparalleled.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were quite a few admirers of her, but in front of Gu Changge, they
        were all so filthy that they didn't even dare to lift their heads.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, the banquet was over.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was dressed in blue clothes, gentle and elegant. After
        thinking about it, he bestowed the top three with some rather precious
        instruments, which was a lucky draw.
      </p>
      <p>
        This move attracted the envy of the younger generation. With such
        wealth, he was indeed the young master of the rumored Gu family!
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people even thought of following, and then they estimated in their
        hearts whether they were qualified.
      </p>
      <p>Afterwards, they returned to the resting hall.</p>
      <p>
        Lin Qiuhan also had the opportunity to talk to Gu Changge alone and told
        him about her many experiences in this short period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge responded with a smile, showing his concern, and then he
        revealed his purpose this time.
      </p>
      <p>"Purple Extreme Elixir?"</p>
      <p>
        Lin Qiuhan's expression was a little puzzled, and she had never heard of
        the kind of medicine Gu Changge suddenly asked about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from the name, it seemed to be related to the Purple Immortal
        Pill Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she practiced here for a period of time and had never heard of this
        name at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's okay, you are cultivating in Purple immortal Pill Sect, just pay
        attention to this in the future." Gu Changge smiled and didn't explain
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the Purple Extreme Elixir was only a legend, and whether it
        was true or not still remained to be verified.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, he still had something to leave to Lin Qiuhan.</p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge took out a page of simple-looking pill recipes
        from his arms, which recorded many refining methods of a mysterious
        ancient pill.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Didn't you say you've always felt useless? Then I'll find you something
        to do now."
      </p>
      <p>"Lest you always belittle yourself like this."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled and handed the ancient pill recipe to Lin Qiuhan.</p>
      <p>
        "What kind of ancient pill is this? It seems that there is nothing
        surprising except that it is a little troublesome to refine! Even if you
        comfort me, young master, please come up with some challenging pill
        recipes."
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to the field of alchemy, Lin Qiuhan's expression suddenly
        changed.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        She studied the recipes and found that there was nothing very difficult
        except that it would take some time to refine it.
      </p>
      <p>She felt that Gu Changge took it out to comfort her.</p>
      <p>Such ancient pills could be refined by many alchemists.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge didn't need to look for her at all.</p>
      <p>
        This made Lin Qiuhan a little moved, and at the same time she secretly
        blamed herself. During this time, she thought that Gu Changge had
        forgotten her, and she felt a little resentful.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could Gu Changge, such a delicate person, be like what she thought?
      </p>
      <p>She misunderstood Gu Changge!</p>
      <p>
        "It's not easy to refine this ancient pill, otherwise I wouldn't be
        looking for you." Gu Changge smiled casually without explaining
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, a secret control technique like the treasure bottle needed
        such an ancient pill as a medium, and only then he could plant a rune to
        refine it successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was why Lin Qiuhan needed to refine these ancient pills for him.
      </p>
      <p>She was of great use.</p>
      <p>
        In the Purple Immortal Pill Sect, it could also save him the troublesome
        process of finding materials.
      </p>
      <p>"Don't worry, young master."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge trusting him so much, Lin Qiuhan immediately assured
        him with a serious look on her face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge stayed in the Purple Immortal Pill Sect for a few
        days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only after he left did Sect Master Zi Yan and a group of Elders sighed
        with relief, and Lin Qiuhan left with her many followers with a
        reluctant gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        His purpose this time was the Heavenly Star Realm that Yue Mingkong had
        already rushed to.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after all, it involved the reincarnation of Human Ancestor, Gu
        Changge didn't intend to be too ostentatious, so as not to cause
        unnecessary trouble.
      </p>
      <p>So Gu Changge planned to go alone.</p>
      <p>
        The news to the outside world was that he was in seclusion and
        cultivation in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and while he was
        cultivating, he wouldn’t see any outsiders.
      </p>
      <p>
        So much so that Ying Yu, who came from Heavenly Emperor Mountain with a
        lot of powerful ancient clansmen, planning to confront Gu Changge, also
        had to return from the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was stopped in front of Ancient Immortal Gu Family's mountain gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu was also stubborn, so she led a group of people and waited at
        the gate of the mountain for more than half a month, but Gu Changge did
        not appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Ying Yu unwilling. As the daughter of Emperor Ying, her status
        was extremely noble in the entire Upper Realm, and it was inhuman.
      </p>
      <p>But in the end, she couldn't even see Gu Changge once.</p>
      <p>
        In front of Ancient Immortal Gu Family's mountain gate, she did not dare
        to be presumptuous, and in the end she could only leave with
        unwillingness.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, it was the Heavenly Emperor Mountain behind
        her, which was increasingly considered to be closely related to the
        inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of rumors, another person who appeared, the descendant of the
        Human Ancestor Hall, stopped outside the Heavenly Emperor Mountain,
        stood for a long time, and finally chose to go back.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the reason, there were all kinds of guesses, but what was finally
        agreed was that there was a problem with Heavenly Emperor Mountain, and
        the descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall had sensed the danger in
        advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement made the faces of many high-level officials of Heavenly
        Emperor Mountain turn green.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, they didn't know why the descendant of Human Ancestor Hall
        would finally leave silently outside the mountain gate without saying a
        word after revealing Human Ancestor Hall's token.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many kinds of things had caused the Upper Realm to become more and more
        restless.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the Sky Family, who were good at deduction, even released news
        during this period, saying that the Absolute Heavenly Extermination
        would reappear soon!
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, the senior leaders of the Dao Lineages all changed their
        expressions and began to discuss the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, many Supreme cultivators, Immortal Great Teachers, and
        Ancient Immortal Families unanimously decided to build True Immortal
        Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as this news came out, it immediately set off stormy waves, and
        all of the forces were sensational.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, the Lower Realm was an endless distance from the Inner
        Realm of the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>A certain domain in the Heavenly Star Realm, in the sky.</p>
      <p>
        A ray of divine light suddenly passed through, as if tearing apart the
        sky.

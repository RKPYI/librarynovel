        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, not only the Ji Siblings, everyone wanted to know what happened in the underground palace. </span><span id="more-32767"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they stared at Gu Changge, their minds couldn’t resist speculating various scenes. Afterall, everyone only focused on fleeing. So, no one knew whether or not the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family was trapped down there. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While on the run, they had long forgotten their purpose in entering Kun Mountain. Furthermore, all Forces that had entered Kun Mountain had suffered heavy losses, even a few Sect Masters were lost. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time like this, staying alive was a problem. So, who would care about what happened to the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was not surprised to see these many pairs of eyes staring in his direction, he had long prepared his script. Thus, he gently shook his head and explained, “After I entered the cave, I chased after Jiang Chen, but before I could do anything, I encountered a thick fog that came out of nowhere. I was trapped in there for months. Even after I got out, I could hear the sound of people battling. However, the energy fluctuations I felt were too strong. Even I could not go against those fighting. Without a choice, I could not even approach them. So, I never came close to that battlefield. It is just my guess, but I believe it was the sound of the Prime Ancestor and the Daoist Sage fighting…These days, I haven’t encountered the Daoist Sage. So maybe, the Prime Ancestor sealed him in Kun Mountain once again. Regardless, I just feel sorry for the others who had served through this whole ordeal…” Remorse appeared on Gu Changge’s face, as though he was regretful that he did not save the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Yaoxing’s and Ji Chuyue’s expressions also darkened. Although they had expected this to happen, they still felt sorrowful when they heard it from Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a possibility that their Prime Ancestor was still trapped within Kun Mountain, but there was also the possibility that he had died with the Daoist Sage. The culprit who caused all of this was Jiang Chen, whom Ji Chuyue had deeply trusted. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That hateful Jiang Chen! He caused the deaths of so many people, there will be no place for him in the Upper Realm from now on.” As many heard this, they were extremely shocked and filled with righteous indignation. Not only did Jiang Chen hinder their escape route, he even released the Daoist Sage, who had been sealed away. It had caused the death of many, from different Forces. Even True Daoists were not spared from this event. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen wouldn’t be able to pay for his heinous crime even if he was ripped into shreds and his bones were pulled out of his body. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re not to blame for this, sister. Jiang Chen is a scheming man who also kept you in the dark. I told you, he isn&#8217;t a good person. Do be careful if you meet him in the future.” As he saw the guilt-ridden expression on his sister’s face, Ji Yaoxing couldn’t help but sighed. He speculated that Jiang Chen had long left Kun Mountain and fled far far away. After all, even the arrays within Kun Mountain couldn’t stop him from escaping.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was I who killed our Elders and our people…” Ji Chuyue said in a melancholic tone. She had always thought that Jiang Chen was a good person as he was courageous, easygoing and confident. However, it turned out that she was wrong, utterly wrong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen was the Successor of Demonic Arts, who had perfectly hidden himself. Countless young prodigies have also died in his hands. Who knows, maybe Jiang Chen was after her Source as well? Maybe he wanted to kill her once he got close enough to her? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t blame yourself, Lady Chuyue. I also didn’t know that Jiang Chen was the Successor of Demonic Arts before today. It is normal for you to have been deceived by him. But Lady Chuyue, I hope you have learnt a valuable lesson from this.” Gu Changge smiled and comforted her, “For so long, Jiang Chen had taken advantage of your kindness and had been deceiving you.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue was a little stunned as she didn’t expect Gu Changge to comfort her. When she thought of his actions back then, she blushed. In her memory, Gu Changge had always been a cold and indifferent man. It was rare for him to comfort someone like this. This caused a strange stirring in her heart as she nodded in response to Gu Changghime. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days later, everyone headed out of Kun Mountain together. During their journey, they met quite a few lost cultivators, who they inquired about the current situation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone’s experience was generally the same, except for a specific unlucky group of people. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During their journey, they were attacked by the Cold Lake Water Dragon that seemed to be comparable to a True Daoist. They were the lucky few to have lived. Some even witnessed the Sky Demon Sovereign get devoured by the Cold Lake Water Dragon, who knows if he was still alive? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news shocked many. The Sky Demon Sovereign was one of the top cultivators in the younger generation. He was at the pinnacle with limitless achievements in the future. Yet, even his life and death was unknown? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This silenced the people who had barely survived. Their hearts were heavy. They had already expected that the news of what happened would cause huge waves. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it was the An Clan and the cultivators of the War Immortal Manor who got killed. Then, Jiang Chen’s identity was exposed and he let out the Daoist Sage, who killed many Sect Masters and True Daoists. Now, even the Sky Demon Sovereign got devoured by the Cold Lake Water Dragon? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such news would definitely shake the entire Upper Realm. The An Clan, War Immortal Manor, Sky Demon Tower and other Forces would definitely not let this matter rest. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half a month later, the group of cultivators finally escaped Kun Mountain. Without the terrifying oppressive aura of Kun Mountain, the sky outside was bright and clear, without a single cloud in the ten thousand radius. Occasionally, there would be a divine rainbow that excited everyone. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finally! We finally got out! I’m never going back to Kun Mountain ever again…” Some spoke incoherently as they were too excited. The Ji Siblings were also in awe, as they felt that all of this was only thanks to Gu Changge. Without him, they would probably still be trapped in Kun Mountain. Without him. maybe they would have ended up like their Ancestors, trapped in Kun Mountain for their whole life. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope that father and the Prime Ancestor managed to escape,” the two siblings looked back at Kun Mountain with regret. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwards, everyone thanked Gu Ghangge and said their goodbyes. As they expressed their gratitude, they transformed into divine rainbows to return to their respective Force, to report everything that had happened. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My sister and I will never forget Young Master Gu’s great kindness. In the future, if Young Master Gu needs our help, we will do anything to be there.” Afterwhich, Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue calmed down, said their goodbyes and returned to the Ji Family. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their mission to rescue their Primal Ancestor, they had suffered heavy losses and their few remaining Ancestors also died tragically in Kun Mountain. As for the rest who were missing, no one knew whether they were alive or not. After today, even if the Ji Family could rescue their Ancestors, they were already reduced to a second or third rate Force. It was impossible for them to regain their former glory. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good bye, Brother Yaoxing and Lady Chuyue.” With a smile, Gu Changge silently watched them leave. The main reason why he saved the cultivators in Kun Mountain was because he wanted them to spread the news of what happened in Kun Mountain. Although Jiang Chen died, Gu Changge wanted to create the false illusion that the Successor of Demonic Arts wasn’t dead, but had escaped. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he returned to Dark Kun City, he ordered Ah Da to bring An Yan to him. When he went after Jiang Chen in the underground palace, he had ordered Ah Da to bring An Yan away from Kun Mountain. Afterall, this chess piece could be used to control the An Clan. An Xi’s death would also make the An Clan fall into An Yan’s hand. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those few drops of Hidden Celestial True Blood he got still had some use to him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, it was a good deal. He got the True Blood and the An Clan without doing much to reign over it. It had to be noted that the An Clan was quite powerful in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You should return to Skyward Schloss. Since I said that I will forget about whatever happened in the past, I will not blame you.” When he sensed Xiao Ruoyin’s aura, Gu Changge raised his eyebrow and smiled as he gently spoke to the void behind him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After they left Kun Mountain, Xiao Ruoyin was always behind him. It was just that she did not reveal herself. With her Nihility Destiny Physique, if Xiao Ruoyin really wanted to hide herself, even a True Daoist would sense nothing. In fact, she planned to hide herself and quietly follow behind. Yet, Gu Changge still easily noticed her trail. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once she heard Gu Changge, Xiao Ruoyin appeared from the void and nodded in silence. After she recovered her memories from her past life, there was actually no need for her to return to Skyward Schloss. Still, she could make use of this opportunity to reorganise her own memories and make plans for her next step. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after Xiao Ruoyin left, Ah Da rushed forth with An Yan. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Greetings, Young Master Gu.” An Yan greeted. After she left Kun Mountain, she had been in Dark Kun City, awaiting Gu Changge’s return. After she witnessed the Young War Immortal, An Yi and the others get killed by Gu Changge, she understood something. That was to never ever oppose Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I trust that you know what to do with the An Clan and I hope you won’t disappoint me.” Gu Changge looked at her and said in a casual tone. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Yan nodded and replied full of respect, “Rest assured Young Master Gu, I will not let you down.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The An Clan was enraged when they found out what happened in Kun Mountain. They even sent out large numbers to investigate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss of an Ancestor who was a True Daoist, An Xi and many experts was a big blow to the An Clan. However, this was an opportunity for An Yan to reorganise An Xi’s followers and take control of the An Clan. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, her ambition was no smaller than her older sister’s, it was just that she had hidden her abilities and done her older sister’s bidding this entire time.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following days were what Gu Changge had expected. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of the tragic loss suffered by the Forces who had invaded Kun Mountain spread through the lands. It was like a meteor had fallen into the deep sea, setting off unimaginable turbulent waves. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Primal Ancestor of the Ji Family couldn’t be saved. Instead, someone called Daoist Sage, who was initially sealed off, was let out and went on a killing spree. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, that terrifying being didn’t manage to leave Kun Mountain. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many speculated that he was killed by the Primal Ancestor of the Ji Family. Maybe they even perished together. Nevertheless, these were just speculation that sent waves throughout the land. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they found out that the Daoist sage was let out, almost every Force was enraged. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The identity of the culprit, Jiang Chen, was the topic of heavy discussion once again. From the Successor of Demonic Arts, Successor of a Divine Source Master, killer of Sect Master…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which one, everything he did was so enraging that others wanted to stab him with tens of thousands of daggers. Immediately, all Forces sent out men to search far and wide for Jiang Chen. Between the various ancient cities, there were bounty notices that offered sky-high rewards for his head. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivators who wanted justice also gathered together in hopes of capturing Jiang Chen. Many believed that he didn’t die in Kun mountain. Instead, he took advantage of the chaos and escaped to somewhere no one knew. As a result, Jiang Chen’s background was also investigated. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many were shocked to discover that Jiang Chen’s history of twenty plus years had disappeared into thin air. No one knew where he was born, where he came from, who his Master was, which Force he belonged to. Everything just disappeared without a trace. It was like the record of his existence was as blank as a piece of white paper. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a strange occurrence sparked heavy discussion. Many speculated there was someone powerful backing him. His background was hidden way too deep. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, all of this was within Gu Changge’s plan. After all, Jiang Chen had to continue being the scapegoat even after his death. And during this period of time, the mission to clean up this disaster and deal with the Successor of the Dark Arts became the top priority of the various Daoist sects. The turbulence at Kun Mountain also gradually settled down. It became a forbidden area, where no living being could enter. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge didn’t stay at Dark Kun City for long. After he ordered An Yan to deal with the An Clan, he returned back to the Gu Family. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could be said that he benefited immensely from ‘saving’ the Prime Ancestor of the JI Family. Besides the massive gain in his reputation, the Sources of the Primal Ancestor and the Daoist Sage was enough for his body to digest for a long time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the drop of Hidden Celestial True Blood, it contained the An Clan’s Hidden Celestial’s Principle fragments and understanding of the Great Dao. Thus, it helped Gu Changge stabilise his </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirvana Realm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">foundation, which he had just reached. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not announce to the world that he had become a True Daoist. To him, there was no need to. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Upper Realm had been jealous of him for a long time. If he announced that he had become a True Daoist, the sensation of the news would be no smaller than that of the news of what happened in Kun Mountain. That was why, Gu Changge decided to wait a little longer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the top of the mountain, the wind blew, clouds floated around and mist enveloped the peak. It was like the Celestial Realm had descended on earth. There was no end in sight as a sea of clouds floated about. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world was like a boundless expanse, with only the tallest mountain peaks being seen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you become a True Daoist?” With a cool and calm voice that was void of emotions, Gu Qingyi gently asked. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She sat cross-legged on a piece of green stone. Her crystal-clear eyes gazed in the direction in which Gu Changge was walking towards her. As always, she was in plain green robes. She had a slender figure, snow-white skin, black hair that flowed over her shoulders, willow-like brows  and a small nose. All of which showed her flawless beauty that couldn’t be described in words. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was just lucky. Seems like you noticed.” Gu Changge smiled, walked over and sat down on the same green stone. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Qingyi shifted to the side and gently shook her head, “The term lucky is unsuitable to describe you.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You overestimate me, Qingyi. However, until now, I still can’t see through your cultivation level clearly. Oh, I found something by coincidence, maybe you recognise it.” Gu Changge smiled indifferently as an object suddenly appeared in his hand. It was a pristine yet ancient palm-sized boat that was surrounded in the Vicissitudes of Life. It was as if it floated in some mysterious river. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Celestial Boat of Creation?” Gu Qingyi’s gaze landed on his hand. Her gaze seemed to change slightly, but quickly regained composure. She also didn’t ask much about where Gu Changge had gotten the object because she had already had her own guesses. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like you do recognise it.” Gu Changge smiled, then kept the Celestial Boat of Creation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This time, I brought you some things from the mortal realm that I think you may like…” As he said so, he waved and there was a flash. Suddenly, many objects from the mortal realm appeared on the green stone, such as rouge, sachets, hairpins, jade pendants and wooden combs, all of which were objects that women liked. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Qingyi looked at Gu Changge’s expression, she looked a little dazed. She picked up a sachet with mandarin ducks embroidered in it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember you gifted me something similar before. Back then, you said these were mandarin ducks, not wild ducks.” As she spoke, the corners of her mouth curled slightly, as if she had remembered something before she quickly regained her composure. </span></p>

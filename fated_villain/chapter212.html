      <h4>
        Chapter 212-1: He is actually a gentle person, About Gu Changges true
        strength (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Lintian, Gu Changge's father, who was protecting Gu
        Changge from outside the Ancestral Hall, suddenly felt that the
        atmosphere in the hall was a bit strange.
      </p>
      <p>He blocked the fluctuations here.</p>
      <p>
        Whether it was him or the others, it was difficult for someone to notice
        what happened in the Nirvana Pool of the Ancestral Hall.
      </p>
      <p>But at this moment a sense of uneasiness rose in his heart.</p>
      <p>
        For a strong man like him, this kind of deep feeling was the most
        accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, without any hesitation, Gu Lintian waved his sleeves and
        immediately opened the door of the Ancestral Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he hadn't entered yet and a surging demonic aura rushed towards his
        face, sensing that his expression could not help but change.
      </p>
      <p>"Not good!"</p>
      <p>
        The thing he was most worried about really happened. There were many
        things in the Nirvana Pond, which made Gu Changge's demonic heart
        transform again, thereby enhancing his demonic nature.
      </p>
      <p>But it was clear that he was still half a step too late.</p>
      <p>
        Judging from the strong demonic aura in it, this transformation would
        probably be a curse rather than a blessing for Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"Xian'er, are you alright?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Lintian quickly arrived at the depths of the Ancestral Hall, and saw
        Gu Xian'er with tears on her face beside the Nirvana Pool as he asked
        worriedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        What he was most worried about was that Gu Changge would do something to
        Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>It would be just like ten years ago.</p>
      <p>
        Now, once Gu Changge couldn't suppress his demonic nature, what would
        happen? It just made him shiver.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing that Gu Xian'er was fine now, he couldn't help but breathe a sigh
        of relief.
      </p>
      <p>"Uncle, I'm fine."</p>
      <p>
        Seeing Gu Lintian coming in, Gu Xian'er also reacted, and then said
        eagerly, "Uncle, look at Gu Changge, his state is not fine, and‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>As she spoke, her voice began to tremble again.</p>
      <p>"And he broke his arm so as not to hurt me‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Xian'er didn't need to say more, Gu Lintian also saw Gu
        Changge sitting down with his eyes closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's arm was empty, with colorful blood stains on the joints,
        astonishing divinity was intertwined, and vitality was surging.
      </p>
      <p>His injuries were already starting to heal.</p>
      <p>
        In the realm of Gu Changge, as long as his True Spirit was unhurt he was
        immortal, the rebirth of a severed limb was only a matter of thought.
        n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé
      </p>
      <p>This injury meant nothing to him.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Lintian was not surprised, in his opinion, Gu Changge's aura was very
        calm now, no different from usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he couldn't tell whether the current Gu Changge was the same as the
        previous Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        He couldn't help Gu Changge even if he suppressed his demonic nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Changge is fine, you don't have to worry about him, he‚Äôll be fine." Gu
        Lintian sighed and said to Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>
        He saw the other three geniuses of the Gu family who had passed out in
        the corner. They were fine, and just passed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, to be on the safe side, Gu Lintian still took action to erase
        their memory of this incident.
      </p>
      <p>"Uncle‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Seeing this scene, Gu Xian'er didn't know what to say, and now her mind
        was in a mess.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were many doubts and puzzles. Although Gu Lintian didn't worry
        about Gu Changge, how could she not worry about him?
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for Gu Changge giving up his arm at the critical moment,
        she would be dead now, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        For so many years, Gu Changge had been fighting against his heart demon?
      </p>
      <p>
        On the surface, Gu Changge seemed to have a lot of beauty, and was
        considered unparalleled in the younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>But who knew what kind of torture he suffered in secret.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er still clearly remembered that Gu Changge's violent expression
        just now seemed to be like slaughtering the heavens and the world!
      </p>
      <p>To be able to stay awake and rational in that mood.</p>
      <p>
        Especially just now, in order to protect her, how could Gu Changge not
        feel it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Gu Xian'er looked at Gu Changge's expression, which
        was extremely complicated, guilty, in a trance‚Ä¶ all kinds of emotions
        emerged into her mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, although Gu Changge was very bad and annoying, his attitude was
        still not that cold, everytime.
      </p>
      <p>But he was actually kind and gentle with herself.</p>
      <p>
        For a moment, Gu Xian'er felt that the truth she was searching for was
        right in front of her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Uncle, why did Gu Changge suddenly do this? You seem to have known all
        this all along."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er asked, Gu Changge seemed to be listening to everything now,
        sitting there cross-legged, and the wound on his arm was healing
        quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't know what kind of face he would make when he opened his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Lintian first glanced at Gu Changge, then looked at Gu
        Xian'er, shook his head and sighed, "As you have seen with your own
        eyes, but I‚Äôll let Changge tell you about all this."
      </p>
      <p>"I won't get involved in this kind of thing."</p>
      <p>
        The demonic heart was very important, and even if he wanted to say it,
        it had to be decided by Gu Changge himself.
      </p>
      <p>As a father, he would not go beyond meddling.</p>
      <p>
        And even if she didn't say it, with Gu Xian'er's character, she could
        probably guess all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Lintian waved his sleeves and left this place with Gu
        Changge. Some things would only be clear if she asked Gu Changge in
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Maybe this is the secret that Gu Changge has been hiding for a long
        time." Seeing Gu Lintian, Gu Xian'er was not surprised.
      </p>
      <p>She had also been very clear.</p>
      <p>
        This might have something to do with Gu Changge's talent when he was
        born, which led to his deep-rooted demonic nature, which affected his
        daily consciousness and behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was why when she was young, he did something like digging her Dao
        bone, Gu Changge's cultivation became stronger and stronger, and he was
        able to gradually suppress this demonic nature without being affected by
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Perhaps Gu Changge dug my Dao bone in order to suppress his demonic
        nature, but over the years, he felt guilty and made up for it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And he seems to know that one day he may not be able to suppress his
        demonic nature, so let me cultivate hard so as not to let me be killed
        by him in the future‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "He is obviously a very gentle person, but he has to disguise himself
        with indifference, how can you be so stupid, Gu Changge."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was whispering, thinking that she had talked back to Gu
        Changge because of all kinds of trivial matters, and she didn't
        understand his good intentions.
      </p>
      <p>She couldn't help feeling a little guilty.</p>
      <p>
        It was for these reasons that Gu Changge was so disappointed in her.
      </p>
      <p>As smart as she was, she quickly figured out the ins and outs.</p>
      <p>
        And today's incident was obviously Gu Changge's uncontrollable
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it weren't for the critical moment, Gu Changge suppressed his demonic
        nature with amazing willpower.
      </p>

            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "Could it be that my Dao bone can help Gu Changge suppress his demonic
        nature‚Ä¶ But after today, with his character, he probably won't care
        about me any more‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"I'm a piece of shit and can't help him‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er suddenly felt a little distressed and confused.</p>
      <p>
        Although she found the clue, Gu Changge was born with a deep-rooted
        demonic nature, but she had no idea how it caused all this..
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, she only got the general idea. If she wanted to know
        more about Gu Changge, she had to personally ask him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But based on what she knew about Gu Changge, it was absolutely
        impossible for Gu Changge to tell her.
      </p>
      <p>Even if she already knew his deepest secret.</p>
      <p>
        "Although the process will be difficult, I will definitely help you
        solve this problem."
      </p>
      <p>"I won't give up on you, Gu Changge!"</p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Gu Xian'er said with determination in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        Because she thought that the masters behind her, who had far more
        knowledge than her, might have a solution.
      </p>
      <p>And there was also the mysterious Peach Sister from ancient times.</p>
      <p>
        Even Gu Lintian was hiding this for Gu Changge, so it was definitely not
        a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>For Gu Changge's consideration, she couldn't easily say it.</p>
      <p>But telling her masters, there was absolutely no problem.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>"Father."</p>
      <p>In the Grand Ancient Hall.</p>
      <p>The injured Gu Changge and Gu Lintian stood face to face.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said with a respectful expression, and his expression was no
        longer different from when he was in the Ancestral Hall.
      </p>
      <p>His arm recovered without any impact.</p>
      <p>"How did the Nirvana Pool affect you this time?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Lintian asked, looking at Gu Changge carefully, from his appearance,
        it was indeed difficult to see any changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also didn't know how this demonic outburst would affect Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, he was isolated from outside the Ancestral Hall at that
        time.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge replied calmly, "It's fine now, I
        underestimated the influence of the demonic heart on me, but now it has
        been suppressed by me."
      </p>
      <p>Although he said so, he was actually smiling slightly in his heart.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, he would definitely not tell the truth, and even fool Gu
        Lintian.
      </p>
      <p>How could something magical affect him?</p>
      <p>
        In order to make Gu Xian'er fully trust him, Gu Changge made such a
        move, a routine that had won people's hearts since ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>As for his acting skills, he did not have any flaws.</p>
      <p>
        At that time, all the actions seemed crazy, but in fact they had a lot
        of meaning. Even the breaking of his arm at the critical moment was also
        in his calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge knew that if he did it again, the powerhouse behind Gu
        Xian'er would definitely show up.
      </p>
      <p>He was convinced of this.</p>
      <p>That was why Gu Changge chose this method.</p>
      <p>
        A bitter plan and a tragic drama, not to mention Gu Xian'er, even Gu
        Lintian was saddened and had a sigh on his face at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't feel any guilt. If he didn't do this, he would leave a
        lot of hidden dangers.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 212-2: He is actually a gentle person, About Gu Changges true
        strength (1)
      </h4>
      <p>And now it seemed that the role and effect was very obvious.</p>
      <p>
        Judging from the system's prompts, the Luck points from Gu Xian'er were
        about 10,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Xian'er is probably going to ask you some things. You can think about
        how to talk about the demonic heart. As an elder, I don't want to get
        involved."
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, Gu Lintian nodded.</p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry, father, next time, the demon will not affect me again." Gu
        Changge said again.
      </p>
      <p>"As for Xian'er, I know how to deal with it."</p>
      <p>
        "If you say that, then I'm relieved, but I‚Äôm just embarrassing you, all
        these years‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Lintian sighed slightly, after all, these things were not Gu
        Changge's original intention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise he wouldn't have made the move of destroying his arm while
        trying to stop himself.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er was smart and clever, so Gu Changge must not be wrong.</p>
      <p>
        He also didn't want to see Gu Changge being misunderstood. It was not
        easy for him to suffer unprovoked hatred from Gu Xian'er all these
        years.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If the hidden danger of the demonic heart is not eliminated, one day,
        it is going to be a big problem." Gu Lintian remembered a lot of secrets
        about the demonic heart.
      </p>
      <p>This was an ominous sign.</p>
      <p>
        No matter where you were in any Dao Lineage, it would bring unimaginable
        and terrible consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        One shouldn‚Äôt look at Gu Changge's current status, but once the matter
        of the demonic heart was exposed, although it was not like the inheritor
        of the demonic art, it would make him enemies all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>Afterwards, Gu Changge left the hall and returned to his residence.</p>
      <p>
        Along the way, many clansmen looked at him with puzzled and strange
        expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Lintian took the initiative to solve the matter in the
        Nirvana Pool of the Ancestral Hall, it was impossible to hide all of it.
        The stake was very important, and many Clan Elders were paying
        attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that Gu Changge gave birth to the heart demon also spread in
        private.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made many clansmen strange. They did not expect that Gu Changge,
        who had the talent of a true immortal, would actually have a heart
        demon, and even erupt in the Nirvana Pool.
      </p>
      <p>This caused quite a stir.</p>
      <p>
        It was not surprising for people who cultivate Dao to have heart demons,
        but they would usually appear when they were old and had been practicing
        for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was only in his twenties when he had a heart demon, what did
        this mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        Many clansmen sighed, and they felt that it was very likely that about
        the time when Gu Changge dugout Gu Xian'er's Dao bone back then, and he
        still felt guilty and it was difficult to get rid of this feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if he had already dug out his bone to repay his sister, this was
        still the case, so when he was in the Nirvana Pool and saw Gu Xian'er's
        newly born Dao bone, with distracting thoughts, he fell into the heart
        demon.
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement had been recognized by many people, and it was spread
        privately in the Gu family for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many high-level officials also understood this, and felt that the truth
        was likely to be like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        But on the other hand, this was normal, which made them a little
        relieved‚Ä¶ If Gu Changge had no guilt about that matter, then there would
        be a problem.
      </p>
      <p>Heart demon was also easy to resolve.</p>
      <p>A few days passed in a blink of an eye.</p>

        The Nirvana Pool incident was like a small incident, and it did not
        continue to cause much movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, Gu Xian'er took the opportunity to break through to the
        False God realm, her strength soared, and she surpassed many of her
        peers in one fell swoop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the entire Ancient Immortal Gu Family, in terms of
        cultivation, there were only a few people in this generation who could
        compare with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        In private, there was also news that Gu Changge's true cultivation had
        actually reached the level of a God King, or even the Quasi-Sacred
        Realm, but he had been hiding it from the world and never exposed it.
      </p>
      <p>This kind of statement left a lot of people in shock.</p>
      <p>
        The cultivation of the younger generation was the most concerning matter
        for any force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge acted in a high-profile manner, not many people
        actually knew about his true realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength he showed on the surface was only slightly higher than some
        young supreme beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        But recently, they learned from the mouth of the heir of the Human
        Ancestor Hall, Zijin, that even she couldn't see through Gu Changge, and
        if they fought, the outcome would be hard to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Sacred Realm assassin who appeared during this time was
        obviously associated with the inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin's Quasi-Sacred Realm cultivation also caused a sensation in
        the world. Countless young cultivators were all shocked and deeply
        affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before, the young taboo Gu Changge, who was vaguely called the strongest
        person of his generation, was enough to make them despair.
      </p>
      <p>He was like a big mountain, pressing on top of their heads.</p>
      <p>
        But now, the descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall had appeared, and the
        Quasi-Sacred Realm cultivation base was shocking and unspeakable.
      </p>
      <p>The so-called golden age, the stars were bright, but that was it.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words from her mouth caused even more of an uproar, and
        the world became sensational.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's true strength had become a topic of discussion among all
        Daoists for a while.
      </p>
      <p>Many people felt that something might have been missed before.</p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling, the last inheritor of demonic art who appeared in the world,
        since he dared to blatantly infiltrate the Ancient Immortal Continent
        and attack the young supreme beings, it must show that he had something
        to rely on behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the end, Gu Changge was hit hard and he escaped. Now it seemed
        that Ye Ling was no longer arrogant.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Gu Changge he met was too strong, and his cultivation at that
        time had obviously reached an unfathomable level.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, all the great sects of the Dao Lineages began to study Gu
        Changge in depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people even said that when Gu Changge was in the Ancient Immortal
        Continent at that time, the means displayed by Gu Changge seemed to be
        the laws and order that only the cultivators in the Sacred Realm could
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various speculations appeared one after another, pushing Gu Changge to
        the forefront again.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the initiator of all this, Wang Zijin, didn't seem to think that
        there was anything wrong, and felt that she was helping Gu Changge to
        become second in name.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>"Is this Wang Zijin really stupid, or being stupid on purpose‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>In the hall, Gu Changge frowned slightly when he heard the news.</p>
      <p>
        Although his real cultivation base had reached the middle stage of the
        Sacred Realm, his superficial cultivation base had only reached the God
        King Realm, which was still far from the Quasi-Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge originally wanted to grow up in a wretched manner, but Wang
        Zijin made a name for him by being affectionate.
      </p>
      <p>But for Gu Changge, what he wanted least right now was fame.</p>

        If there was too much attention, and someone discovered the flaws in his
        plans, it would be bad.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, Gu Changge had another purpose.</p>
      <p>
        If at this time, one or two ancient freaks appeared, looked down on his
        cultivation, and came to slap his face and make a name, it would be even
        better.
      </p>
      <p>
        It just so happened that he still lacked an opportunity to break
        through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those ancient freaks, Ancient Emperors and so on, since they had the
        guts to call themselves that, they must have something special.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin like this was equivalent to telling those ancient freaks who
        were about to appear that Gu Changge was not easy to provoke.
      </p>
      <p>"It's a bad thing for me, I'll settle with you first."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge couldn't help squinting his eyes. He knew these routines very
        well and was planning to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Wang Zijin also knew them, so she made her own decisions, thinking
        that she could make Gu Changge‚Äôs life less troublesome.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe Gu Changge would have some good feelings for her.</p>
      <p>
        But she didn't know that Gu Changge planned to let these troubles arrive
        at his door.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the competition of the younger generation, life and death
        were in his hands‚Ä¶ That source of talent wasn‚Äôt what he wanted? Follow

      <p>
        "Young Master, what you ordered has already come to an end. Over the
        years, Miss Xian'er's parents have indeed been trapped in a dimension."
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Yan Ji, who had been instructed by Gu Changge to
        investigate secretly about Gu Xian'er's parents, also returned with
        information.
      </p>
      <p>"Very good." Gu Changge nodded.</p>
      <p>
        "According to the young master's instructions, I sent a lot of people to
        protect them in secret, but Miss Xian'er's parents are very strong, and
        they discovered them‚Ä¶" Yan Ji continued.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's fine. I just want them to notice and make them feel that I have
        spent a lot of time secretly searching for their traces over the years."
        Gu Changge couldn't help but smile.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't like to perform good deeds without leaving his name.</p>
      <p>
        This kind of thing, he couldn't wait to let the whole Gu family know and
        let them understand his good intentions as the young master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yan Ji understood a little, and nodded her beautiful face.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's just that why didn't the young master show up in person? And you
        told us to be secretive, so the Gu family doesn't notice?"
      </p>
      <p>
        She was a little confused, ‚Äòwouldn't it be better for Gu Changge to go
        there by himself?‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>"After all, it is designed by people."</p>
      <p>
        "If I go there in person, it won't work. Instead, it will have the
        opposite effect, making people feel like I have other plans. That's why
        I have to do it in secret, do you understand?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled casually and said something that Yan Ji didn't
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, her red-colored glass eyes revealed a sense of dizziness
        and confusion, and she looked a little dumbfounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, she didn't know much about the situation of the Ancient
        Immortal Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's words made her even more at a loss.</p>
      <p>But this time, she still nodded, "Understood."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge looked at her and burst into laughter, "When
        did you even learn to talk nonsense in front of me, Yan Ji?"
      </p>
      <p>"Sir‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Being pierced by Gu Changge like this, Yan Ji's face couldn't help but
        turn a little red.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, outside the gate of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        A figure whose face was shrouded in mist, dressed in a moon-white robe,
        had arrived a long time ago. During this period, she first went to the
        Ancient Ye Clan, and finally came here.
      </p>
      <p>
        She looked at the splendid and vast mountain gate in front of her, and
        said to the guards in front of the mountain gate, "Heir from the Human
        Ancestor Hall is here to visit young master Changge."

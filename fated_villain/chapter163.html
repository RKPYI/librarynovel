          mist.]</b

      </p>
      <p>
        As far as the eye could see, there were undulating waves of magnificent
        mountains.
      </p>
      <p>However, Gu Xian’er wasn’t here to appreciate the view.</p>
      <p>
        Currently, she was curled up like a ball with her small, delicate, and
        flawless face like white porcelain. Her brows curved to a frown as she
        faced a dilemma.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately for her, this was quite a complicated matter.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Ah Hong, tell me… is it true that Gu Changge was seriously injured
          when he fought against the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts. If
          it’s true, do you think I should go take a look at him?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er hugged her legs, propped her head on them, and asked the big
        red bird on her shoulder with an eager voice.
      </p>
      <p>Ah Hong rolled its eyes with a look of “Why are you asking me?”</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er already knew; there was no reason for her to ask Ah Hong.
      </p>
      <p>But she just didn’t know what to do.</p>
      <p>
        She’d heard the news about Gu Changge’s pursuit of the Inheritor of the
        Forbidden Demonic Arts and the subsequent fight against him.
      </p>
      <p>At first, she didn't believe the news about Gu Changge's injuries.</p>
      <p>She knew how terrifying Gu Changge's strength was.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Apart from me, is there anyone in the younger generation who can
        compete with Gu Changge?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, she was referring to her future self. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on
        nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        In Gu Xian'er's eyes, at least in the current younger generation, no one
        would be Gu Changge's opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge’s opponent at the time was none other than the
        rumoured mysterious and terrifying Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        She hadn't really seen the terrible Forbidden Demonic Arts' Inheritor,
        but she heard many things about him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the pursuit of all the major powers and forces, he managed to
        safely flee before disappearing without a trace.
      </p>
      <p>No one knows the strength of such a powerful existence.</p>
      <p>
        It was not impossible for Gu Changge to be injured by the hands of the
        Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts.
      </p>
      <p>She thought of Gu Changge as invincible…</p>
      <p>
        However, just like ordinary people, Gu Changge can be injured or even
        killed.
      </p>
      <p>This worried her a bit.</p>
      <p>
        According to the rumours, Gu Changge was seriously injured and even lost
        some of his Origin Essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked so weak that it seemed the very breeze could blow him away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, Gu Xian'er was stunned. At first, she just laughed it
        off. Even after Gu Changge was injured by the sword strike, he showed no
        weakness, showing not even the slightest reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could he be so badly injured just by facing the Inheritor of the
        Forbidden Demonic Arts?
      </p>
      <p>
        But the more she thought about it, the more she felt that something was
        not right.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘With Gu Changge's character and ability, will he let him run away if he
        can really kill the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts?'
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘That means that neither Gu Changge nor the Inheritor of the Forbidden
        Demonic Arts could land the finishing blow.'
      </p>
      <p>‘And ultimately, both of them gave up.'</p>
      <p>‘I'm afraid that the rumours may indeed be true.'</p>
      <p>
        As she thought of this, Gu Xian’er found herself drained of the
        motivation to find more opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, her cultivation broke through by leaps and bounds. Not
        only did she go back to pick the Eight Sacred Bananas, but she also
        encountered a Nirvana Fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, she’d fought and killed many Young Supremes of the Ancient
        Immortal Races.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her Cultivation Base had successfully broken through to the late stage
        of the Conferred King Realm, which was several times greater than when
        she entered the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was absolutely sure that if she met Gu Changge next time, she would
        definitely be able to hold one of his palms.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Humpf! It’s not like I’m worried about his injury or anything! It’s
        just that, if he dies, my revenge will never be completed!’
      </p>
      <p>It was at that moment that Gu Xian’er finally came to a decision.</p>
      <p>She’d also managed to give herself a good reason.</p>
      <p>
        This good reason would come in handy in the case that Gu Changge
        dismisses her and was unwilling to accept her visit.
      </p>
      <p>Such an excuse would help her avoid losing face.</p>
      <p>Now, she can go to see if Gu Changge was really injured or not.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Is the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts really as scary as the
        rumours?'
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I got a miraculous healing medicine a few days ago, which I think
          he’ll like. Of course, this doesn’t mean that the grudge between us is
          settled. This is just the result of my generosity! Yeah… just my
          generosity.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        As she spoke to herself, Gu Xian'er turned into a divine rainbow,
        harnessed her divine weapon, and shot up into the sky as she quickly
        left.
      </p>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p>
        While all the major groups in the Ancient Immortal Continent and the
        outside world were busy making a lot of noise due to the Forbidden
        Demonic Arts’ Inheritor…
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge led a group of followers and casually found an ancient set of
        ruins known for helping in cultivation and rejuvenation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secretly, however, he was using various means to incite the hatred of
        the various outside cultivators and natives of the Ancient Immortal
        Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        When their hate reaches its peak, it would be the best time for the big
        figures from both sides to interfere.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge doesn't mind thoroughly muddying the water.</p>
      <p>And during this time, he gradually faded out of everyone's vision.</p>
      <p>
        Only some Young Creatures, who wanted to inquire about him, approached
        this area before suddenly disappearing without a trace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge took advantage of this moment in time and fiddled with many
        treasures he obtained from the system’s shop function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, he’d bought 3 more pieces of Transcendent Bone, granting him
        the bones of a hand, a foot, and a phalanx[1] on the right side of his
        body.
      </p>
      <p>[1. bones which make up the fingers of the hand and toes.]</p>
      <p>
        It was within this phalanx that Gu Changge refined the rules of Gengjin
        and the Endless Immortal Judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individually, these two held extreme attacking capabilities, but –
        joined together – they would naturally achieve a greater effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bones of the phalanx were refined into a peerless sword by Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>His idea was very simple.</p>
      <p>And he would look very dashing while he was at it too.</p>
      <p>
        In combat, he would be able to generate peerless sword intent with a
        mere flick, as he instantly slaughters his enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, he managed to smoothly raise the Heavenly Immortal Dao
        Codex to the next level as his surface-level cultivation now reached the
        middle stage of the False God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in secret, he became even more unscrupulous, using the Immortal
        Devouring Demonic Arts to frantically hunt down a few powerhouses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, traces of the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts
        reappeared and caused panic everywhere. Many creatures and cultivators
        felt that they were in grave danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, Gu Changge believed that this train of thought could only
        come from people who overestimated themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if a group of Young Creatures appeared in front of him and offered
        their Origin Essence, he might not care at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now, devouring existences in both the Heavenly God Realm and the
        God King Realm have shown negligible improvements to Gu Changge's true
        Cultivation Base.
      </p>
      <p>The more his cultivation rises, the more essence he needs.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, it was different for those with strong physiques and
        bloodlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        That aside, Gu Changge was currently considering collecting the fish
        caught in his net.
      </p>
      <p>
        He used the Immortal Binding Technique to lay a large net specifically
        for the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan. He had caught a lot of fish by now.
      </p>
      <p>
        From his point of view, the entirety of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan
        was caught in a large spider’s web, allowing for their annihilation at
        any moment he pleased.
      </p>
      <p>This was far more terrifying than any slave seal.</p>
      <p>In a blink of an eye, time passed.</p>
      <p>A few days later…</p>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p><b>[In a magnificent Ancient Temple]</b></p>
      <p><b>“It turns out you were just an Old Turtle…”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“All this time, I had been thinking it was some sort of Godly
          Tortoise..”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        [Note: He is mocking him by saying Tortoise is better than Turtle. Worth
        noting that every Tortoise is a Turtle but not every Turtle is a
        Tortoise.]
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge spoke casually but did so with a hint of disdain.</p>
      <p>
        He carried a white jade pendant in his hand from which a brilliant light
        came as the Old Turtle appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Turtle was white, and – like jade – was crystal clear and
        translucent. It even emitted a strange fragrance.
      </p>
      <p>This was a kind of fragrance that can't be smelled by others.</p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge, the Inheritor of Immortal Devouring Demonic Arts, could
        easily perceive it, for this breath… was the fragrance of Divine Souls.
      </p>
      <p>‘Perhaps this Old Turtle’s soul is some kind of immortal medicine.'</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, don't humiliate this Old Turtle. Just kill me if you
          want to!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If you try anything, this Old Turtle will break his true spirit!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>The Old Turtle that appeared on the pendant held a stiff look.</p>
      <p>It witnessed Gu Changge's secret.</p>
      <p>
        With Gu Changge's temperament, it was absolutely impossible to let the
        Old Turtle go.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, 9 out of 10 people would use threats, intimidation, and
        other means to force it to tell some of the Ancient Deity of
        Reincarnation’s secrets. Then, they would try to make it surrender.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Turtle thought through these things very thoroughly. It had seen
        things it wasn’t supposed to, and yet Gu Changge’s methods remain a
        mystery
      </p>
      <p>As such, the Old Turtle acted tough.</p>
      <p>
        There was a look of righteousness in its pair of green bean-like eyes,
        shining with the will to persevere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Ye Ling had many flaws in his character, he was a kind person.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were also wicked people like Gu Changge. With such a demonic aura
        about him, how could he allow himself to surrender? To help him, to
        confess everything to survive would simply be unrighteous.
      </p>
      <p>This contradicted its way of the Dao.</p>
      <p>
        Who would guard this world if even someone such as the Old Turtle only
        thought of their own survival in the face of a villain as monstrous as
        Gu Changge?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Since when did I humiliate you? Is calling you ‘Old Turtle’
          considered a humiliation?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        When he heard the Old Turtle, Gu Changge slightly smiled with the look
        of finding it idiotic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Or perhaps you’ve lived for so long that you’ve forgotten what you
          are.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had full confidence in his ability to draw out the hatred of
        others, and he was sure that the Old Turtle felt the same.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, you deceitful b*****d…”</b></p>
      <p>
        As expected, Gu Changge's words made the Old Turtle's face turn blue as
        it couldn't help but retort.
      </p>
      <p>Although it was called as such, it wasn’t really an Old Turtle.</p>
      <p>
        That was merely the name bestowed upon it by the Ancient Deity of
        Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>‘Just a Turtle?!’</p>
      <p>
        The statement hit a sore spot, for though Ye Ling referred to him as
        such, he had never prodded on the hows and whys…
      </p>
      <p>But as of this moment, Gu Changge mercilessly prodded at it.</p>
      <p>
        If for its complete inability to put up any resistance, the Old Turtle
        would’ve fought Gu Changge however desperate such an endeavour may be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“A deceitful b*****d? Can’t you at least change it to something
          else?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge shook his head as he casually replied.</p>
      <p>
        In his eyes, one could almost see the flow of black and white colours as
        the faint echoes of time rippled in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“The Rules of Reincarnation…” </b> The Old Turtle couldn’t help but
        be astonished at this development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Turtle’s divine soul gradually blurred, as if it was about to
        evaporate under the light emitted by the black and white lights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unexpectedly, in just a few short days, Gu Changge’s control over the
        Samsara Talent had far surpassed Ye Ling's.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This guy is simply too terrifying… no, I’m afraid the word doesn’t come
        close to describing how it feels to face Gu Changge.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Where did you come from? If I'm interested, you might just
          survive.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>It was then that Gu Changge came up with an offer.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Fortunately, I’ve got nothing better to do, and that leaves me with
        enough time to deal with this Old Turtle.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Turtle was one of those ‘portable grandparent’ figures that
        Favoured Sons of Heaven usually have. Unfortunately for the Old Turtle,
        he was far weaker than other similar figures.
      </p>
      <p>At most, it was a mere guide for the Favoured Son of Heaven.</p>
      <p>
        <b

          you and help you in your wicked goals, Gu Changge…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that the Old Turtle had already anticipated Gu Changge’s
        offer, sneering in response.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Turtle had already decided that Gu Changge had other plans in
        store for it, plans that required him to be kept alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it was a creature that had followed the Ancient Deity of
        Reincarnation, and it knew many secrets of the Ancient True Immortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless Gu Changge was stupid, he would know that the Old Turtle had far
        more value alive than dead.

      </p>
      <p>When he heard this, Gu Changge sneered as well.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Does this Old Turtle really think all that? It’s in for a treat if it
        thinks I’ll play my cards in line with the usual idiotic tropes.’

      <p>
        At that moment, it let out a miserable cry, struggling to resist as the
        Black Dao Bottle buried itself deep into his soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had no interest at all in knowing the many secrets of the
        Ancient Deity of Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was only interested in the alluring divine fragrance that the Old
        Turtle emitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The long-awaited and excellent sensation of devouring a divine soul…
      </p>
      <p>
        Lin Tian, the trash leek who was actually a God King reborn, also
        possessed a unique fragrance. Perhaps it was due to the Old Turtle's
        proximity to Ye Ling that he became contaminated with the fortune that
        Favoured Sons of Heaven usually had.
      </p>
      <p>Whether the Old Turtle recognized it or not was a trivial matter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Gu Changge, do you really want to kill me?!”</b> The Old Turtle
        screamed, unable to believe that Gu Changge truly wished for its death.
      </p>
      <p><b>“I wouldn’t shed a tear without seeing the coffin first.”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
      <p>
        Without mercy, the terrible power of the Immortal Devouring Demonic Arts
        surged from the Black Dao Bottle. Much to the despair of the Old Turtle,
        the power manifested into a large black rune as it drowned.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It really was an immortal medicine. Unfortunately, it was a mere one
        third of the genuine immortal medicine.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The vast medicinal essence seeped into his limbs and bones, like a
        raging galaxy of light that flowed through his body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immortal intent surged, giving the temple a divine and heavenly
        appearance for a brief moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if miniature Black Dao Bottles had appeared in all 60 trillion cells
        of his body as they trembled, trying to absorb the seemingly infinite
        medicinal power.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, bits and pieces of information appeared in his mind,
        giving Gu Changge a slight surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coincidentally, he’d also broken through to the peak of the God King
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>And now, he was but a step away from the Sacred Realm…</p>

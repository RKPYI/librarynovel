      <h4>
        Chapter 246-1: The plan is successful, Gu Changge also had a day when he
        was calculated by her (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Watching Jiang Chuchu leave the territory of the Ancient Immortal Gu
        Family, Gu Changge then withdrew his gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, one problem had been solved. Jiang Chuchu was known as the
        reincarnation of Ancient Immortal, and the mysterious palace in her sea
        of consciousness clearly had an inexplicable and powerful force.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was much more difficult to deal with than the Reincarnation Seal of
        the Human Ancestor. Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on
        n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the Reincarnation Seal of the Human Ancestor resided in the
        flesh, Jiang Chuchu's mysterious power could trigger an outbreak at any
        time, which was extremely difficult to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge really planned to kill Jiang Chuchu, he would inevitably
        touch the mysterious force.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, it was very likely that the Human Ancestor Hall would
        become aware of Jiang Chuchu's situation and cause him unnecessary
        trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the best way was to let her go. As for what Jiang Chuchu said about
        hating him, Gu Changge didn't care at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since he could make Jiang Chuchu hate him, he could easily make her
        change her attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since she chose to betray the Human Ancestor Hall, it meant that she
        would stand on the same side as Gu Changge in the future, whether she
        wanted it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Gu Changge got up and left, intending to see how this girl
        Yaoyao was doing these days.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, his master, after taking Yaoyao back to Gu family, hadn't
        gone to see her yet.
      </p>
      <p>He was more or less incompetent.</p>
      <p>
        "Maybe I can meet Gu Xian'er by the way, which would be appropriate."
      </p>
      <p>"Calculating the time, she should return to the Peach Village‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Thinking like this, Gu Changge couldn't help but smile a little, with
        some deep meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past few days, he had heard a lot of things about Gu Xian'er
        often running to Yaoyao's place. The relationship between the two seemed
        to be pretty good. Obviously, she should have noticed something special
        about Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mysterious Peach Tree behind her had a deep connection with Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the normal routine, the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor
        should have a kinship with Yaoyao, and even the mysterious Peach Tree
        would have a lot to do with the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thereby contributing to its power after returning to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>At that time, it would be difficult to do it again.</p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, Yue Mingkong knew in advance where the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor was in the Lower Realm, and brought Gu Changge to find
        the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, and solved this trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, on the other hand, Yaoyao was his apprentice, and he had a blood
        relation with Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>
        That mysterious Peach Tree would inevitably be involved in a lot of
        cause and effect with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was said to be cause and effect, but Gu Changge had the means to turn
        it into human affection.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the end, it was a simple matter to make that mysterious Peach Tree
        work for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this thought in mind, Gu Changge soon arrived at the palace where
        Yaoyao was.
      </p>
      <p>
        He waved his hand to signal to the maid at the entrance of the palace
        not to make a sound and looked at the scene with some interest.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er was indeed also here.</p>
      <p>
        He hadn't seen her for a while, her cultivation had improved a lot, and
        Gu Changge was not disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she lacked a good temper, she had two sets of destiny
        templates, which was enough for her to catch up with many younger
        generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the palace, Yaoyao was talking to Gu Xian'er, with a smile on her
        face, looking very happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, as if thinking of something, her expression suddenly became a
        little unhappy.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Senior Sister, do you think Master is very busy? He didn't even have
        time to see Yaoyao. Earlier, Master clearly said that he has time."
      </p>
      <p>She pinched the corner of her skirt and asked in a low voice.</p>
      <p>In the past few days, she had become very familiar with Gu Xian'er.</p>
      <p>
        And because of an inexplicable feeling, in Gu Xian'er, she felt a kind
        of natural kindness.
      </p>
      <p>She even told her some things very frankly.</p>
      <p>
        "Your master has a lot of things to deal with, but I think he should
        come to see you soon."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Xian'er was slightly startled, then smiled and said
        comfortingly.
      </p>
      <p>She could also see that Yaoyao had a deep dependence on Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        But she didn't know why Gu Changge accepted her as a disciple and
        brought her to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, she was a little worried that Gu Changge would ignore her
        because she hadn't seen Gu Changge come over these days, she seemed to
        overestimate the weight of Yaoyao in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>"So, you thought Master had forgotten about Yaoyao‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's big eyes, which were as flawless as black gems flickered, and
        when she heard Gu Xian'er's words, she seemed to relax a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, she said that as a question, wanting to know what her Master
        was doing from Gu Xian'er's mouth.
      </p>
      <p>Master was not the kind of person who would just forget her.</p>
      <p>
        But if she asked directly, Gu Xian'er would inevitably feel that she was
        a little girl, how could she think about such things?
      </p>
      <p>
        She could feel that Gu Xian'er seemed to care a little bit about her
        Master, and she kept asking about what happened in the Lower Realm, what
        the Master did, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was very precocious and smart, and she was not good at talking
        about these things, so she was still a little worried.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, your Master had a lot of things to deal with these days so I
        had to focus on that for now."
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        At this moment, Yaoyao suddenly heard a familiar warm voice with a
        little surprise on her face.
      </p>
      <p>"Master‚Ä¶" She looked outside the hall with a happy smile.</p>
      <p>A tall and handsome man was standing there.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge walked over with a smile on his face, "It seems that you are
        quite used to this place, and I was worried that you might not get used
        to it as your Master."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, I'm very used to it, and Senior Sister Xian'er is also very
        kind to me."
      </p>
      <p>Yaoyao said happily.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded, "That's good, I was afraid that you might have
        something you're not used to."
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Gu Xian'er who looked a little embarrassed beside Yaoyao, Gu
        Changge didn't even look at her, as if she came to see Yaoyao on purpose
        and didn't care about her existence.
      </p>
      <p>This scene made Gu Xian'er a little sad.</p>
      <p>
        Why was Gu Changge so gentle towards Yaoyao, yet so cold towards her?
      </p>
      <p>Wasn't she as cute as Yaoyao?</p>
      <p>
        It was clear that Gu Changge treated her very well before, although he
        was cold on the surface, he didn‚Äôt ignore her when he saw her, because
        it was difficult for him to pull down his face after he noticed that it
        was unspeakable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking like this, Gu Xian'er stared at Gu Changge, but she was the
        first to speak, her voice was cold, but mixed with anger, "Gu Changge,
        why are you turning a blind eye to me?"
      </p>
      <p>"How do I say this?"</p>
      <p>Only then did Gu Changge glance at her in surprise.</p>
      <p>"Why don't you greet me when you see me?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was in a hurry and stared at him, with faint indignation in
        her crystal clear eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Isn't it too late?" Gu Changge shook his head with a calm expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Liar, if I hadn't taken the initiative to speak up, you would have
        ignored me again. As a man, why are you so petty and keep memorizing
        small things for so long, I despise you Gu Changge!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er finally seized the opportunity to talk to Gu Changge, and she
        suddenly became unrepentant, so she could not wait to grab his robe and
        ask why he was so indifferent to her now.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't need you to look down on me. Gu Xian'er, I think you don't have
        a good memory anymore?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge replied casually, this attitude of not adding oil and salt
        made Gu Xian'er's teeth itchy.
      </p>
      <p>But she remembered the scene in the Nirvana Pool before.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's body was full of demonic energy, and his will was
        indifferent and cold, but he would rather break his own arm than hurt
        her.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, her eyes softened suddenly, and she hummed slightly.</p>
      <p>
        "You are a knife-mouthed and tofu-hearted person. If I really care about
        you, I'm afraid I will be mad at you."
      </p>
      <p>She was telling the truth.</p>
      <p>
        Now that she knew Gu Changge's hardships over the years, she also
        understood why he made the act of digging bones in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, at that time, Gu Changge was occupied by his demonic nature,
        and he couldn't help himself.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 246-2: The plan is successful, Gu Changge also had a day when he
        was calculated by her (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        So later, he gradually suppressed his demonic nature and felt guilty
        about what happened back then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only then did he secretly find the traces of her parents, and also stood
        up for her in the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace, helped her to worship
        the Great Elder, let her stab him abruptly, killed the Princess from the
        Sea King Palace in the Ancient Immortal Continent, and stood in front of
        Heavenly Dao Ancient City.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the face of the world, admitted her identity as a family member,
        confessed what happened in the past, dug out his bone to pay her back‚Ä¶
        Many things happened later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er felt that she had a deep understanding of Gu Changge's
        character, and it wasn't that she didn't know what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge made a disapproving voice and didn't bother to
        pay attention to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "During this period of time, I have consulted a lot of classics, and I
        have also asked a lot of Clan Elders. They actually don't understand
        your situation."
      </p>
      <p>
        He then looked at Yaoyao and apologized slightly, "However, there should
        be a solution."
      </p>
      <p>
        He did find a lot of books about Dao fruit, but it had to be similar to
        his guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that Gu Changge didn't plan to tell Yaoyao about these
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, telling her that she actually possessed a Dao Fruit that was
        from a certain Supreme Being, was a bit cruel to Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, according to the normal routine, it was impossible for that
        mysterious Peach Tree to merge with Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge had no doubts about this.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao, who was watching the quarrel between Master and Senior Sister,
        thought it was very interesting, when she heard Gu Changge say this, she
        was suddenly a little stunned.
      </p>
      <p>"Was Master searching for my problem these days?"</p>
      <p>
        She was very moved. Before that, she was curious about what Gu Changge
        was busy with, but she didn't expect that Master was busy with her
        business.
      </p>
      <p>"Is there anything special about Yaoyao?"</p>
      <p>Hearing this, Gu Xian'er was also a little surprised.</p>
      <p>
        Although she felt that Yaoyao was very special, she couldn't actually
        tell where she was special.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's expression was calm and he didn't answer.</p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, Yaoyao said brittlely, "Senior Sister, Yaoyao can't
        actually cultivate. Master has been helping me find a solution."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was stunned, she thought that Yaoyao didn't cultivate, so she
        didn't have any spiritual energy fluctuations.
      </p>
      <p>She really didn't expect this to be the reason.</p>
      <p>
        Since she couldn't cultivate, why did Gu Changge accept her as a
        disciple and took her back to the Upper Realm?
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er became more and more confused.</p>
      <p>
        But at this time, she glanced at Gu Changge, and suddenly thought of
        what she had been thinking about before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wasn't Gu Changge inherently demonic and had difficulty suppressing it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er always thought that her Dao bone could suppress Gu Changge's
        demonic nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was why Gu Changge did bone digging before, and it was precisely
        because after he exchanged the Dao bone for her, it was no longer
        possible for him to suppress his demonic nature, so he was occupied by
        demonic nature just like in Nirvana Pool that day.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe someday it would break out again?</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er felt that it was necessary for her to help Gu Changge solve
        this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the origin of Taoyao's Sister in Peach Village was so
        mysterious, and her Masters were very powerful and knowledgeable.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe they really had a solution.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was not stupid, she understood that this matter was Gu
        Changge's unspeakable secret, and it was impossible to ask all of the
        Ancestors of the Gu family.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was estimated that not many people knew about this except his father.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the only ones who could think of a way now were her Masters.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er believed that her Masters would not expose this matter.</p>
      <p>
        After all, since it was also a good thing for Gu Changge to solve the
        demonic thing, then why not do it?
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        If she took the initiative to bring this up in the past, Gu Changge
        would definitely have dismissed it, and it would have been impossible
        for her to agree.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, with Yaoyao as an excuse, she didn't believe that Gu Changge
        would not agree.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Actually, I think you can take Yaoyao with you, Gu Changge. Let's go
        back to Peach Village together. Maybe my Masters will have a solution!"
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Xian'er thought for a while, sorted out her tone, and then spoke,
        making herself look natural. V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

        Gu Changge frowned slightly when he heard this, but he couldn't help but
        smile, he was waiting for Gu Xian'er to take the bait and take him to
        Peach Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before coming, he still thought about how to get Gu Xian'er to speak.
      </p>
      <p>Now, things were much simpler.</p>
      <p>"Yes, before, I grew up in Peach Village‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er thought that Gu Changge didn't know about this matter, and
        planned to explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge waved his hand to interrupt her, and said lightly,
        "I know the Peach Village in the abandoned land, where you have several
        mysterious Masters, and there is a mysterious Peach Tree there."
      </p>
      <p>"You know?" Gu Xian'er was suspicious.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I know." Gu Changge said.</p>
      <p>
        "Even though this investigation is so clear, you still say you don't
        care about me?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er showed a faint smile and murmured softly, and was still very
        happy in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge didn't care about her, why would he investigate everything
        about her so clearly?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Naturally you have to investigate clearly, lest the Master behind you
        come to seek revenge on me." Gu Changge replied casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, do you know that chatting like this will bring disaster to
        yourself!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was very happy at first, but when she heard Gu Changge's
        words, she suddenly became a little indignant.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge calmly said, "I didn't plan to chat with you."</p>
      <p>"I‚Äôll fight with you!"</p>
      <p>Hearing this, Gu Xian'er raised her eyebrows.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she really couldn‚Äôt bear it anymore. She was so angry at
        Gu Changge that her liver started hurting, but she still felt so sorry
        for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at her with interest, and then said to Yaoyao whose
        face was full of surprise,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao is optimistic, if you are not obedient in the future, your
        Master will beat you like this."
      </p>
      <p>"Master‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yaoyao was very surprised, unexpectedly this was the
        relationship between her master and her senior sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'd like to see how much you have improved during this period of time.
        After the scar heals, the pain is forgotten."
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at Gu Xian'er who attacked him in front of her, Gu Changge
        couldn't help but let out a contemptuous sneer.
      </p>
      <p>The courage of this exclusive airbag seemed to be fat again.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>He took the lead in attacking Gu Xian'er.</p>
      <p>It was still a palm!</p>
      <p>And that was incredibly contemptuous and casual.</p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, you shouldn‚Äôt look down on others!"</p>
      <p>"If you have the ability, just use one palm!"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er's brows were full of high-spiritedness, and a fighting spirit
        emerged.

      </div>
      <p>
        As if to vent all the grievances suppressed by Gu Changge these days!
      </p>
      <p>
        She was still very satisfied with the results of her cultivation since
        this time, and she didn't believe that she couldn't even compete with Gu
        Changge's palm.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Her long skirt danced and the flowers fell like rain, covering the void
        in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was in the middle and shot at Gu Changge, out of the dust and cold,
        like a secluded orchid in the deep mountains, she stroked with her
        hands, and a large piece of immortal flower bloomed.
      </p>
      <p>This was the great technique contained in her Dao bone.</p>
      <p>
        In a flower, there was a world, and it could even be seen that the
        chaotic mist was rolling in it, thick and surging, terrifying and
        amazing.
      </p>
      <p>But in the next moment, something incredible happened.</p>
      <p>"It‚Äôs gorgeous."</p>
      <p>"But my one palm is enough to crush you."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's hand reached out, covering the void in the hall, and a
        clear light emerged, like the first ray of light in the world.
      </p>
      <p>With rumble!</p>
      <p>
        As if there was an explosion of unparalleled power, it pressed down
        toward the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>One flower, one world, one palm, all worlds collapse!</p>
      <p>"You bully too much!"</p>
      <p>"This palm doesn't count!"</p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er cried out, not accepting it, and was very dissatisfied.</p>
      <p>
        She didn't expect Gu Changge's strength to increase to a much more
        terrifying level than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        With just one palm, her Immortal Bone Treasure Technique was destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>She wanted to step back.</p>
      <p>But it was too late.</p>
      <p>
        With a snapping sound, she was slapped to the ground and received a
        solid blow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was stunned, she didn't expect the senior sister to be cleaned up
        so quickly, she thought it was really possible.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"You're too much! Don't you know how to hold back?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er whimpered, gnashing her teeth, feeling that her majesty was
        lost in front of Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>"Leaving you alone will only make you get more beaten."</p>
      <p>
        "See, if you don't listen to your Master's words in the future, you will
        end up like your Senior Sister."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge shook his head and turned to Yaoyao with a smile.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao hurriedly nodded like a chicken pecking at the rice, but why did
        she feel that it was not bad to be taught by a Master like this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, no matter how unconvinced she was, this farce of Gu Xian'er
        ended quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she didn't dare to provoke Gu Changge again. In the
        Ancient Immortal Gu family, no one dared to help her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er just recorded this account again. When she beat Gu Changge in
        the future, she had to find a way to get back. She couldn't make him so
        proud every time.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, after being taught such a lesson by Gu Changge, Gu Xian'er
        found that she was in a better mood than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        This discovery made her a little worried. Did she have a problem with
        her brain? After being bullied for a long time, did she really get used
        to it?
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge didn't bully her, she would feel really uncomfortable, was
        she not used to it?
      </p>
      <p>
        With this kind of thought in mind, Gu Xian'er looked a little resentful
        all day.
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, under her plan, an old sly, and cunning man like Gu Changge
        finally took the bait and promised to accompany her back to Peach
        Village.
      </p>
      <p>This somewhat comforted Gu Xian'er that her plan went through.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge also had a day when he was calculated by her!</p>

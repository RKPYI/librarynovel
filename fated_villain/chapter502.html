          battle chariots that had various terrifying weapon scratches and arrow
          holes. Their presence alone was intimidating, and everyone
          involuntarily knelt before the incredibly powerful supreme

          feet, choosing death over succumbing to their enemies. They glared
          daggers at the Upper Realm Amy, who had entered the city, looking like

          couldn&#8217;t even lift their heads up. In fact, their bones cracked

          cultivator roared, activated all his Qi, and charged ahead with a glow

          Goddess had a very close relationship with Gu Changge, and no doubt
          they had some kind of pact since she was willing to stay by Gu
          Changge&#8217;s side.</span

          Goddess!? After all, to them, the entire point of invading Sky Deer
          City was to get to the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. It was just a
          gateway. There was no need to overdo it and risk offending someone
          like Gu Changge.

          themselves at this moment. Though they had just awoken, they had
          learned of every crucial thing that had happened in Sky Deer City
          lately using secret techniques. Hence, they knew the young man before
          their eyes was the leading figure of his generation in the Upper
          Realm, and he possessed absolute voice and authority. Even the Upper
          Realm True Daoists present behaved as though Gu Changge was their

          her plain gaze across those of Sky Deer City and softly said,

          have thought she would accept the circumstances so impassively as
          though she wasn&#8217;t surprised at all? It made many livid, wanting

          the only way out was to listen to the Sky Deer Goddess. But were they

          Sky Deer City, which my Master had left behind for me,&#8221; the Sky

          than the people living in it. This was the place she grew up in and

          best plan was to surrender if they didn&#8217;t want more casualties.
          Hence, they took the lead to yield without a fight.</span

          loathing. They had a irreconcilable feud with the Upper Realm. Thus,
          they chose to stay when everyone else ran away from Sky Deer City. But
          now, they were told to yield to the Upper Realm. Of course, they

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Gu Changge left with Hei Yanyu, Xiao Ruoyin brought Jiang Chen, Niu
                Tian, Wang Ning, and the rest to a rather spacious area. Although guards were all over the place, having
                received Gu Changge&#8217;s order, they simply disregarded Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s group as though they did
                not exist at all.</span><span id="more-28953"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ruoyin, What&#8217;s happening? Why did the man in white suddenly
                release us?&#8221; Arriving here, Jiang Chen finally asked the question out of impatience with sternness
                in his voice,as if he was interrogating Xiao Ruoyin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Niu Tian and the rest were also curiously waiting for an
                answer and explanation from Xiao Ruoyin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nothing much. After Young Master Gu took me away, instead of doing
                anything to me, he merely asked about my background, to which I honestly answered, and he decided not to
                trouble us any further. It&#8217;s all a misunderstanding. Young Master Gu is a good man and he bears no
                ill intentions towards us.&#8221; After taking a deep breath, Xiao Ruoyin explained and recounted
                everything that happened.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, Niu Tian and the rest heaved a sigh of relief. All of them
                didn&#8217;t doubt her words, especially the young women, Wang Ning included.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, on their first encounter, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t seem like a
                bad person to them, not because handsome men couldn&#8217;t be bad people, but because his qualities
                weren&#8217;t exactly hatred-evoking, unlike the that of the Immortals who preferred to stay away from
                the mortal world and sit above the Nine Heavens observing everything.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Jiang Chen, unsatisfied with the answer, furrowed his brows. He
                could still remember the excruciating pain of his entire body and organs being crushed, and now that
                Xiao Ruoyin simply claimed that to be a misunderstanding as well as how Gu Changge was no evil man,
                Jiang Chen couldn&#8217;t bring himself to accept what he just heard.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jiang Chen, listen to me. Just let this slide. You&#8217;re fine now,
                aren&#8217;t you? Plus, if you were to upset Young Master Gu, I won&#8217;t be able to protect
                you.&#8221; Seeing Jiang Chen&#8217;s expression, Xiao Ruoyin could already tell what he was thinking,
                after which she helplessly warned him, as there was no way Gu Changge would apologise to an unimportant
                individual like Jiang Chen.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right. What happened afterwards, Ruoyin? Why did you change your
                clothes?&#8221; Jiang Chen then asked, only to find himself nervous after expressing his bafflement as
                he was worried about receiving bad news from Xiao Ruoyin. [If it was as Ruoyin said, why did she change
                her clothes? And she seemed happier than before, having so much fun talking to him.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Xiao Ruoyin recalled the agonising situation and felt somewhat
                flustered but she quickly recovered from it, after which she clarified, &#8220;Young Master Gu saw that
                my clothes were torn after a long time of confinement, so he instructed his servants to clean me up.
                It&#8217;s not as complicated as you think…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s expression, Jiang Chen couldn&#8217;t shake off
                the discomfort in his heart, but if he were to continue doubting her after she made things this clear,
                he would only be ruining their relationship, so he decided not to pursue the matter any further.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niu Tian and the rest weren&#8217;t sceptical either.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Told you you should&#8217;ve trusted Goddess Xiao…&#8221; Niu Tian
                whispered to Jiang Chen and heaved a sigh of relief for his sake.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, what are your next plans, Ruoyin? None of us understand the
                languages of this world.&#8221; Jiang Chen stared at Xiao Ruoyin and edgily inquired as cold sweat
                surged in his palms. He was hinting at her to return with the rest of the group.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, the group turned to Xiao Ruoyin with eager faces, hoping that she
                could take care of them. Since they were all fellow students, having come to this unfamiliar world whose
                languages they couldn&#8217;t comprehend, they couldn&#8217;t imagine living on after leaving
                here.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Xiao Ruoyin revealed a scowl, obviously perturbed and at a loss
                for words. Nonetheless, she would have to come clean to Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, and the rest eventually.
                Slowly, she muttered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be staying by Young Master Gu&#8217;s side from now on, so I
                don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be leaving with you…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before she could finish, Jiang Chen&#8217;s face drastically changed as he
                couldn&#8217;t believe what he just heard; the rest also widened their eyes in daze as they didn&#8217;t
                expect her to choose to stay.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ruoyin, did that man force you into staying? He must be planning
                something against you.&#8221; Visibly annoyed, Jiang Chen took a deep breath and forced himself to calm
                down as he couldn&#8217;t find a single reason as to why Xiao Ruoyin would choose to stay behind. As it
                was the first time she and Gu Changge met, coercion was the only possibility Jiang Chen could come up
                with.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I chose it on my own accord. Young Master Gu is a good man and our
                saviour. What plans can he have against me? Right, you haven&#8217;t met his servants. Each of them is a
                goddess of beauty, so why would he ever bear ill will against me? You shouldn’t slander him.&#8221; Xiao
                Ruoyin was apparently offended, but considering that Jiang Chen was questioning her out of concern, she
                replied in a serene tone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jiang Chen subconsciously widened his eyes and dropped his jaw
                before letting out a bitter snicker and shut his mouth, while the rest sighed and tactfully kept
                quiet.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That Young Master Gu must have drugged you to have you defend him
                after your first encounter.&#8221; There was bitterness on Jiang Chen&#8217;s lips, and his voice was
                rather hoarse. It was as if his heart was being ripped apart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ll never understand. I have only gratitude. Gratitude only
                for Young Master Gu.&#8221; Regaining her composure, Xiao Ruoyin coolly replied, carrying the
                resemblance of a distant, icy queen.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For what reason?&#8221; Jiang Chen questioned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I… I am going to take on the Path of Cultivation…&#8221; After a
                moment of hesitation, Xiao Ruoyin fessed up.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Path of Cultivation…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the group was dumbstruck, only to find themselves drowning in envy
                when they recovered their senses. Before they came to this world, they never believed that Immortals
                existed, and now, everything before them opened their eyes. Immortals indeed lived in this world. Riding
                clouds, picking stars—nothing was out of their capabilities. With that in mind, they grew even more
                envious of Xiao Ruoyin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah! Soon, we will be worlds apart…] Saddened, Jiang Chen figured things out.
                It wouldn&#8217;t take long before Xiao Ruoyin would become an otherworldly noble Immortal just like the
                man in white, who perceived them as mere ants.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, when he remembered the mysterious bronze flying boat, he
                wondered if he, too, could cultivate, and a glimmer of hope arose in his heart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Goddess Xiao, if you are able to cultivate, can we do that too? We,
                too, want to take on the Path of Cultivation.&#8221; Niu Tian and the rest turned to Xiao Ruoyinand
                hopefully asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The requirements of cultivation are stringent. If it weren&#8217;t
                Young Master Gu&#8217;s assistance, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to tread the Path of
                Cultivation…&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin answered, feeling obliged to disclose the requisites of cultivation to
                her peers.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing her out, Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, Wang Ning, and the rest were
                thoroughly stunned, falling into hopelessness, as she did back when she first heard about it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Talents aptitude, technique cultivation, cultivation resources…&#8221;
                Jiang Chen muttered to himself, as if there was raging fire in his heart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Xiao, the Young Master has prepared a banquet, and he cordially
                invites you and your peers to attend it.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of nowhere, a mysterious, scary-looking person with green scales all over
                his body spoke to Xiao Ruoyin. The group was startled and suffocated by the enormous man’s presence as
                his aura was too daunting for them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understood. We&#8217;ll be there right away.&#8221; Retaining her
                composure, Xiao Ruoyin responded with a smile.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the man chortled aloud. &#8220;Then, I shall await your arrival,
                Lady Xiao.&#8221; Having said that, he immediately vanished and none knew whether he intimidated Jiang
                Chen, Niu Tian and the rest on purpose.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ruoyin, what did he say?&#8221; Jiang Chen curiously asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He told me that Young Master Gu prepared a banquet for us and asked me
                to bring you over,&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin answered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu even prepared a banquet for us? Splendid! We
                didn&#8217;t steal Goddess Xiao&#8217;s spotlight, did we?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu is such a fine man! He must be trying to compensate
                for the misunderstanding earlier.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the group immediately grew thrilled. Since they never
                experienced a banquet of this world, they could take this opportunity to.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, Jiang Chen, for some reason, grew quiet.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, Xiao Ruoyin led the rest to the venue of the banquet, and they
                were astounded by the stunning sceneries, especially the palaces that shone blindingly like a heavenly
                palace, trembling their hearts. After all, such magnificent wonders must require an immeasurable amount
                of power to be constructed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu said that we&#8217;re only on an ancient battleship,
                and not on the ground…&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin exclaimed with astonishment.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they were en route to the banquet venue, many of them attempted to gratify
                Xiao Ruoyin, licking her boots.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Goddess Xiao, can you perhaps commend us to Young Master
                Gu?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, for the sake of us fellow students, why don&#8217;t you help us
                out, please?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uhh…&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin hesitated with a frown, concerned that those
                requests would irritate Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to.&#8221; Nevertheless, she couldn&#8217;t bring
                herself to reject her peers.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after, the group arrived at the palace, wherein spirit fruits were
                neatly organised while the alluring aroma of wine wafted in the room, only to find themselves drooling.
                The delicate fruits emitted a misty gleam, appearing highly mysterious.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re here?&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly said as he sat on the
                primary seat.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, Young Master Gu, for setting this up.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin
                seemed rather awkward.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. It&#8217;s a gesture of apology,&#8221; Gu
                Changge claimed with a smile.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since your peers are mere mortals without any experience of
                cultivating, they&#8217;ll probably burst into death if they were to consume foods with spiritual
                energy, so I prepared another table just for them,&#8221; Gu Changge added as he pointed to the side. On
                the tables not far away from his, the cuisine were notably simpler in comparison as they were foods of
                the mortal world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm, thank you, Young Master Gu.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing nothing wrong with that, Xiao Ruoyin then explained that to Jiang
                Chen, Niu Tian, and the rest. Certainly, she was moved by Gu Changge&#8217;s meticulousness given how he
                even took such trivial details into consideration. Although it was a pity that Niu Tian and the rest
                wouldn&#8217;t be able to consume the fruits with spiritual energy, she was aware that the decision was
                made out of concern for their health. As such, she grew even more fond of Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the group found nothing wrong with Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s words, they agreed
                that Gu Changge bore no malice towards them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the banquet commenced as guests returned to their seats. Besides Hei
                Yanyu, Ji Qingxuan also appeared by Gu Changge&#8217;s side, and they would serve him food and pour him
                wine.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Niu Tian and the rest of the male students were extremely
                envious as such impeccable, outworldly beauties were not to be found in their homeworld. [Even Goddess
                Xiao&#8217;s charm is nothing compared to the two beside Young Master Gu. They possess such incomparable
                elegance yet they are only befitting of becoming his servants. Damn it! I&#8217;m jealous! No wonder! So
                that&#8217;s why Goddess Xiao said that Young Master Gu wouldn&#8217;t scheme against her.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah’chen, some things are to be kept in the heart as it&#8217;s not
                quite appropriate to express them…&#8221; Looking at the wordless Jiang Chen who was frustratedly
                chugging down wine, Niu Tian knew what he was thinking, after which he sympathetically stated.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Jiang Chen raised his head and gritted his teeth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the banquet seats in front of him, Xiao Ruoyin was sitting beside Gu
                Changge with a blushed smile, as though they were discussing something. On the other hand, Gu Changge
                was carrying a breezy smile, unaffected by his surroundings, and never once did he take a glance at
                Jiang Chen and the rest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen was clueless about what Xiao Ruoyin and Gu Changge might be
                discussing, but all he knew was that Xiao Ruoyin rarely revealed such a smile, and seeing that felt like
                a dagger pierced his heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, Jiang Chen felt a mysterious sensation within his body, as
                if something, constantly pulsating, was about to burst.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The bronze flying ship!] In that instant, Jiang Chen saw a bronze flying
                ship before him. Rusty and ancient, the bronze flying ship seemed to be traversing across a river while
                the world around it collapsed as fragments of space drifted in the air. He even witnessed the creation
                of the world, including the formation of sky and land, as well as the primaeval evolution of the ever so
                heavenly, Great Dao. All at once, information about an inheritance gushed into his brain.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely dumbfounded by the sight, Jiang Chen almost sprung up from his
                seat, but thanks to his potent willpower, he managed to control his physical instincts, and he simply
                appeared as though he was trembling due to his inability to adapt to the atmosphere.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, Niu Tian and the rest, not knowing what was happening, merely
                peered at him, assuming that he was trying to repress the frustration in his heart after seeing the
                woman he admired sharing a laugh with another man.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are you? Why are you in my mind?] Quickly, Jiang Chen composed himself,
                though he failed to notice Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze that fell upon him earlier. At that moment, he was
                communicating with the voice in his mind as a weakly glowing, miniature form of the bronze flying ship
                popped up in his mind.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;I am an Artifact Spirit, and you are the artifact’s vessel. We both
                comprise the Celestial Boat of Creation.&gt; A child-like voice was heard.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Celestial Boat of Creation? What is that?] Jiang Chen was dazed before
                questioning further. Since he was communicating with the voice in his mind, he wasn&#8217;t afraid of
                being caught.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Celestial Boat of Creation is the first celestial artifact that created
                existence. It allows one to withdraw from reincarnation, reverse time, peek into the Heavenly Path,
                perceive all lives, and predict the future. It is omnipotent.&gt; the child-like voice boastfully
                stated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, can you make me stronger?] Jiang Chen grew excited after listening to
                the voice&#8217;s great description of its almightiness and omnipotence. [Does that mean I&#8217;ll be
                able to grow stronger and continue to live in this world and attain whatever I want?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Naturally, as we are one.&gt; the voice answered, retaining its
                smugness.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, since it just reawakened, it swiftly sensed that something was off.
                &lt;Your current state is strange. Why are you this weak, even your physique? Nevermind, I&#8217;ll make
                your body transfigure into the Sacred Physique of Creation, and you&#8217;ll become overpowered and
                peerless!&gt; The voice exclaimed with confidence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jiang Chen grew even more ecstatic as his heart palpitated.
                [Sacred Physique of Creation? That sounds formidable!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Jiang Chen suddenly noticed that he could understand the
                conversation of those from this world, who were around him, and was thrilled upon the discovery. Yet, he
                had to control his urges so as not to draw any suspicion upon himself.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now I can listen to what Ruoyin and that Young Master Gu are talking about…]
                Jiang Chen took a deep breath and calmed himself down, concentrating all his focus to his ears.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, on the primary seat, Gu Changge, retaining his leisurely smile,
                seemed to notice something and fascination flashed across his eyes. He then turned to Xiao Ruoyin and
                inquired, &#8220;Who is that young man to you? Why does he keep staring at you?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the questions, Xiao Ruoyin was dazed. She then turned to where Gu
                Changge was looking and saw Jiang Chen, who was bitterly drinking his wine with his head lowered.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is Jiang Chen. He was an admirer of mine,&#8221; she answered.
                For some reason, she didn&#8217;t want Gu Changge to take things the wrong way, so her answer was rather
                direct.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, Xiao Ruoyin wasn&#8217;t lying either. To others, she was a
                perfect match to Jiang Chen, but that was all there was to it. She was also aware of Jiang Chen&#8217;s
                feelings for her, but all she wanted was searching for ruined sites and pursuing the truth. In her eyes,
                Jiang Chen was merely an admirer. Or simply, a friend, who she happened to be close with.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, I see.&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly added, &#8220;No wonder he
                keeps on looking at you.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Jiang Chen, who directed all his concentration to the
                conversation, overheard the exchange. Instantly, his face turned a few shades whiter as bitterness
                surged. Yet, he was unable to refute it, given that he was indeed nothing but an admirer.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;That woman… She looks like Mistress! Impossible…&gt; Right when Jiang
                Chen was drowning in agony, the child-like voice in his mind sounded once again. This time,
                nevertheless, it was filled with restlessness and fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;That man beside Mistress is extremely dangerous…&gt;</span></p>

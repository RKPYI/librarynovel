        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the palace, divine light shone brightly, illuminating the surroundings like a flowing cluster of stars weaving and converging in the void as inexplicable Principles and Dao Energy surged.</span><span id="more-34835"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One by one, the Tools of World Domination emerged, emitting distinct halos and Dao that floated in the air, harbouring unimaginable indescribable power that could collapse the void and obliterate all things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were the Tools of World Domination that had been passed down since ancient times, said to possess the power to dominate the world. However, their method of forging was unknown. Some even claim that the Tools of World Domination were innate items, birth by the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, such claims were rare, and whether they were true or false was impossible to know.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By collecting all Seven Tools of World Domination, one could condense a Key of World Domination, which could be used to open up the Immortal Palace Treasury. It was a subject of rumours that had been spreading for countless years, about the Immortal Palace of the Forbidden Epoch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, the Immortal Domain had yet to part with the Upper Realm and the world was ruled over by the Immortal Palace. The territories were boundless and beyond imagination. Every living being were deemed people of the Immortal Palace, enjoying its protection and living without worry for countless years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, an abysmal catastrophe hit the world as the sudden disaster swept across the entire universe, causing the Immortal Palace to collapse and the River of Time to break apart while everything else shattered into chaos.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even heaven and earth were destroyed and buried. Hence, that period became the Forbidden Epoch, which no one dared to mention again. It could only be referred to as &#8216;the Forbidden Epoch&#8217; by later generations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Immortal Palace Treasury contained countless treasures accumulated by the Immortal Palace over the years. Among them were precious Artifacts that surpassed the imagination of all cultivators in this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it bluntly, if news of the Immortal Palace Treasury were to leak out, it would indubitably result in an endless bloodbath, where even the Immortal Domain might get alarmed and make a move.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only by gathering all Seven Tools of World Domination could one locate the position of the Immortal Palace Treasury. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, lately, Yue Mingkong had resorted to numerous arduous means and was only able to condense four of the Tools of World Domination. In order to thoroughly condense all seven of them, thereby forging the Key of World Domination, much more time and effort were still required.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s fine. Leave the Sword of World Domination, Flask of World Domination, and Tower of World Domination to me. I have underestimated the difficulty of this task, but there&#8217;s no rush. After all, the Immortal Palace Treasury might not even be in the Upper Realm…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge shook his head as he spoke, gazing at the halos in the air. As he reached out and waved his arm, he instantly withdrew all of them. Since Yue Mingkong was unable to forge the Key of World Domination, he could only wait until the next opportunity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Changge, do you think the Immortal Palace Treasury is actually real? Why would the Immortal Palace, the previous ruler of the world, crumble? Even the Immortals of the Immortal Palace had perished in the River of Time,&#8221; Yue Mingkong said with a frown.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, in terms of fate, one of the branches of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty bore a significant connection to the fallen Immortal Palace. When Yue Mingkong was a child, she had looked through ancient records and was able to find incomplete information regarding the fall of the Master of Immortal Palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, she was deeply shocked to find out that the Master of the Immortal Palace, the conqueror of worlds, didn&#8217;t die of old age. Instead, the Master was inflicted with fathomless injuries, after which was buried in the River of Time by the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine Heavenly God Coffin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal Palace was extremely mysterious, unable to be seen in most circumstances. Even the leader of Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty back then was unable to enter it. It was said that the Immortal Palace was connected to a mysterious river, and by travelling along that river, one could enter the deepest part of the universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Perhaps the Immortal Palace had encountered some powerful enemies. That has always been the speculation, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly answered in response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, he was quite knowledgeable about the Forbidden Epoch, given that he was the Demon Lord in the past. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as for why the Demon Lord would destroy the epoch and annihilate the world, he currently bore no memories of it. Thus, he had no clue about the cause. But of course, in his opinion, it was only a matter of time until his memories returned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even the Master of the Immortal Palace had such an unfathomable foe? Hmm, there is still so much about the world for us to uncover and learn.&#8221; Yue Mingkong seemed somewhat dazed as she recalled the images from her past.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If that is the case, does an invisible being exist in this world, manipulating all things, including my regression? If not, what in the world is causing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remembrance Immortal Technique to constantly pop up in my mind out of nowhere?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rather than stressing about this, why don&#8217;t you plan for our wedding that is to take place in half a year&#8217;s time?&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled as he held her delicate hand, pressing it to pull her back from her daze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yue Mingkong shot him a glare, despite subconsciously revealing a smile. Genuinely, she was very eager for what was to come half a year later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the capital, Gu Changge, along with Ah Da, tore space apart and directly headed to the Sky Domain, where Mortal Palace was located. Be it the appearance of Dark Heaven or to meet with Jiang Chuchu, he inevitably had to visit Mortal Palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the entire world was aware of his marriage with Yue Mingkong, Jiang Chuchu, who was cultivating in Mortal Palace, must have been informed of it. Judging by her personality, if Gu Changge didn&#8217;t give her an explanation, she would certainly hate him out of jealousy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Yue Mingkong who openly loved and hated him openly in front of his face, Jiang Chuchu tended to keep all her troubles in her mind instead of venting them. Therefore, occasionally, she would commit reckless actions without considering the consequences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, the Golden Fortuity Cauldron that was placed in Mortal Palace was now full after absorbing a great amount of Fortuity and Power of Faith, so Gu Changge planned to proceed to the second Dark Heaven announcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, he could feel traces of Will gathering in the world. Those Will came from the living beings who had heard his -Dark Heaven’s- declaration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Will was still faint, insufficient to touch upon the Heavenly Court in his Inner Universe, let alone let anyone’s soul reach it, this was a good sign of progress. It signified the powerful potential in the future, belonged to his -Dark Heaven’s- future believers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a blink of an eye, half a month had passed. In the centre of Mortal Palace, Jiang Chuchu was dressed in white, her long hair was as thick as a waterfall. Her gaze was cool and serene, yet she appeared slight and haggard as she sat in the palace. A hazy figure of a female Immortal appeared around her as a terrifying aura surged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the palace, incomparably vast silver traces of Power of Faith gathered from the Upper Realm, forming a silver sun floating in the air. Recently, it had helped to quell the Eternal Overcast Scourge in many places, elevating the prestige of Mortal Palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Argh&#8230;&#8221; Suddenly, Jiang Chuchu, who was meditating with her eyes closed, let out a groan. Her face instantaneously turned pale as a bright red blood stain appeared and spread on her white clothes, looking incredibly piercing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly, she opened her eyes. Her pure and clear eyes were now filled with fatigue and blood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Have I gone mad again?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu whispered with a glower, seemingly talking to herself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quickly, she pulled out a clean handkerchief and attempted to wipe off the blood stain at the corner of her lips, as though she was very much used to such an action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately, she found it difficult to calm herself down. Even when she finally managed to calm herself down, she would soon be disturbed by all kinds of distracting thoughts in her mind. In her entire life of cultivation, she had never expected to experience such disorder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She possessed the Talent to see through the truths and lies of the world. The Nine Immortal Souls Talent. Even evil karma was nothing to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for the past few days, she had been growing insane, her mind distraught and her heart perturbed. She could even feel that her Dao Heart was breaking as it wasn&#8217;t as intact as before, given that numerous fractures occurred on it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;ll be marrying his fianc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">é</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e in half a year&#8217;s time. But he promised to marry me&#8230;&#8221; As Jiang Chuchu thought about this, her eyes suddenly became unfocused and her gaze grew dim. Grasping her chest, she could feel the discomfort throbbing in her heart.</span></p>

          On the one hand, even if there was another Mortal One, it would be
          impossible for him to overshadow Gu Changge&#8217;s glory. Thus, it

          advantage of Mortal Palace&#8217;s transcendental position. In other

          knew Gu Changge was far from decent, and it was inevitable for peers

          titled the best of his generation.</span

          similarly to The King with Six Crowns, and the Elders of Mortal
          Palace, too, came to the Immortal Academy with skepticism to validate
          the news.</span

          without hesitation. At that time, a majestic and mighty life force
          burst out of him like rays of sunlight. Amidst the brilliant light was

          wasn&#8217;t the real Mortal One but someone who could take up the
          identity. Thus, even if they had other ideas, they would chuck them
          aside.</span

          most was resources and funds to spare.</span

          time, his Inner World’s Dao was also moving towards perfection,

          caravans fell grave victim to their treachery. But this time, a
          horrific force hunted them down and obliterated them gruesomely within
          half a month, shocking many.</span

          annihilation. It turned out that a secret treasure Gu Changge had sent
          to the Heavenly Arms Domain for forging had emerged some time ago.
          Because of how shocking it looked, it caught the eyes of Bandit
          Thirteen, and they sent their men to loot it, hence crossing Gu
          Changge and walking to their impending doom.</span

          were fortunate people with unique physiques or the Fortuitous One

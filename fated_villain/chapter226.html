      <h4>
        Chapter 226: Learn to give in and admit cowardice, really smart but
        mistaken by smartness
      </h4>
      <p>There was dead silence in the hall.</p>
      <p>
        The remaining fluctuations were like a towering mountain, falling on the
        top of everyone's heads.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, no one dared to speak, or even to take a breath.</p>
      <p>
        At the moment when Gu Changge made his move, the aura of terror swept
        through them, and they felt like they had become tiny dust particles
        under the galaxy, ready to be wiped out at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength of this Immortal was so terrifying that it made all of them
        tremble with fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The elders, including Holy Master Xian Lun, turned pale, their backs
        were covered in cold sweat as they were completely frightened.
      </p>
      <p>And this time, they reacted.</p>
      <p>
        Everyone looked at Jiang Yang, who was slapped on the ground and vomited
        blood. His eyes were filled with anger and coldness, as if they were
        looking at a fool or a lunatic!
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless Jiang Yang was crazy, how dare he say such arrogant words just
        now?
      </p>
      <p>
        If it weren't for the fact that he was Yaoyao's older brother, he
        probably would have been shot to death by Mr. Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>It was the only thought in everyone's mind.</p>
      <p>
        "Did I really misunderstand? Everything about Jiang Yang before was just
        a pretense.."
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Zhao Yi, the Supreme Elder of Immortal Lun Sect, who had great
        expectations for Jiang Yang, now looked at Jiang Yang with doubts in her
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from what she knew about Jiang Yang during this Jiang Yang was
        calm exuding the confidence that everything was under control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although his words were sometimes arrogant, they were not without reason
        and basis.
      </p>
      <p>Now, in front of everyone, he wanted to provoke this Immortal?</p>
      <p>What the hell was this?</p>
      <p>What kind of reliance does he have?</p>
      <p>"Elder brother......"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao had a complicated expression on her little face, she should be
        sad when she saw that her brother was injured.
      </p>
      <p>But she wasn't.</p>
      <p>Rather she was disappointed.</p>
      <p>Jiang Yang's actions had already utterly disappointed her.</p>
      <p>
        And just now, it was obviously her Master who stood up for her, so he
        took action to teach Jiang Yang a lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was very sensible and knew that Gu Changge was angry because of
        Jiang Yang's indifferent attitude towards her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, don't be angry, it's all Yaoyao's fault, I made you accompany
        me here, otherwise it won't be like this..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing Yaoyao say this to himself, the indifference on Gu Changge's
        face faded, returning to his previous calm and gentle expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This matter has nothing to do with you. This guy is ignorant of the sky
        and the earth, and his words are rude. It is also necessary to teach him
        a lesson as your teacher."
      </p>
      <p>
        He smiled and said, without the attitude of taking Jiang Yang seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the sound of the system's prompt at this time, he didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang failed to pretend in public.</p>
      <p>This face was hit so badly that he lost a lot of Luck points.</p>
      <p>
        However, in terms of his character, this humiliation and shame would be
        difficult to swallow for a while.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, Gu Changge didn't care.</p>
      <p>
        In his eyes, Jiang Yang was just a leek waiting to be harvested, or the
        kind that was fat and tasty. Gu Changge actually knew Jiang Yang's path
        and confidence. He could do nothing more than take advantage of the
        terrain here, according to the illusory fortune, he would use the Luck
        of the Heavenly Star Realm, and other things, to compete with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he was the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor. Although he
        only integrated some memories, he would definitely use some of the
        backhands and methods arranged by the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, it seemed that Jiang Yang's strength was only in the Divine
        Power Realm, which was very weak.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if it was a general powerhouse from the Upper Realm, it was very
        likely that the table would overturn at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, Jiang Yang had the means to arouse the phantom of the
        Ancestor of the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>Supreme beings phantom.</p>
      <p>Although he didn't know how much of his Divine Power was left.</p>
      <p>
        But under this kind of power, ordinary people were really not his
        opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was a little suspicious that the Ancestor of Immortal Lun
        Sect had something to do with the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, a good-looking Supreme would go to a remote place like
        Heavenly Star Realm to leave a legacy of Taoism?
      </p>
      <p>What the hell was he planning?</p>
      <p>
        It was nothing more than knowing that the Human Ancestor was likely to
        be born from this world in the future, leaving a legacy of Taoism and
        escorting the Human Ancestor in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under all these circumstances, Jiang Yang had the courage to speak to
        him like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had anticipated this for a long time, so his method of
        dealing with it was more direct and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the eyes of everyone, Jiang Yang was pretending to be forced, because
        they didn't know that he actually had the strength and confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Gu Changge slapped him in the face and stepped on his head,
        wouldn't that be enough?
      </p>
      <p>
        After all it took a little time to provoke these things to the general
        trend of the world, like Luck and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The speed of Gu Changge's shot was said to be too fast, so fast that
        Jiang Yang didn't have time to react. It contained the rules of space
        and time, and instantly surpassed everything and slapped him to the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have to say, the Luck gained by slapping the Human Ancestor in the
        face is really a lot..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's mind flashed with many thoughts, and his expression was
        somewhat inexplicable.
      </p>
      <p>And at this time, Gu Changge stopped.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang also slowly stood up from the ground, but he looked very
        embarrassed, his body was stained with blood. and his bones were broken
        a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        His pig's liver-colored face slowly returned to calm, and there was no
        sign of anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the eyes of everyone, it seemed that after being taught by Gu
        Changge, he calmed down, and was not as arrogant as before.
      </p>

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        It was just that Gu Changge was clear that Jiang Yang's eyes were still
        full of coldness when he looked at him.
      </p>
      <p>The coldness quickly dissipated and became dull.</p>
      <p>
        "Today's matter, was reckless, and I also hope that Mr. Immortal will
        forgive me for Yaoyao's sake."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang opened his mouth, his voice was very calm, and he even took
        the initiative to salute Gu Changge, but the angry look just now was no
        longer there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, seeing the shocked expressions of everyone, he explained again,
      </p>
      <p>
        "The reason I made provocative words just now was because of jealousy.
        It was the first time I saw Yaoyao being so close to a strange man. So
        this brother was so jealous that he was unqualified...."
      </p>
      <p>"Now I understand, I was calmed down by the palm of Immortal."</p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao has a good life, I should be happy that besides me, there are
        other people who treat her so well."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao is not my sister alone, and now she still has a Master who
        treats her so well."
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, Jiang Yang looked at Yaoyao again, showing the smile
        that Yaoyao had always been familiar with, a little apologetic.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm sorry Yaoyao, this brother was too indifferent to you just now,
        because I thought that after you had a Master, you won't want this
        brother.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother is apologizing to you now, will you forgive me?"</p>
      <p>The more he said, the deeper the guilt on his face became.</p>
      <p>Seriously.</p>
      <p>Even his eyes were a little red.</p>
      <p>
        These sincere words of apology changed the expressions of many elders in
        the hall, and they were a little moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from Jiang Yang's age, it was completely understandable that he
        would do such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        These explanations were also reasonable. And there was nothing wrong
        with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Jiang Yang's description of himself, he had a deep sister obsession
        because after seeing his sister with such a Master, he was unwilling and
        extremely jealous.
      </p>
      <p>But now, he was so calm.</p>
      <p>
        This made a lot of people who thought he was stupid and had a broken
        brain just now, admire his courage and dared to say such humiliating
        words in front of everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Jiang Yang finished speaking, he stood still in the hall, looking
        at Yaoyao with an apologetic expression, wanting to be forgiven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge's palm showed a lot of affection on Yaoyao's face,
        the injury it caused to him was still terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>His internal organs and bones were trembling a lot.</p>
      <p>
        If it was not supported by a strong physique, it would probably leave a
        dark injury.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this also made Jiang Yang understand that Gu Changge was different
        from the cultivators he had met before.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked very decent, but his methods were also righteous and demonic,
        on the surface it seemed to be saving face for Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>But he did tricks in secret and wanted to abolish him!!</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the strength displayed by Gu Changge could completely hurt
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The method of instantly crossing the space and attacking was too fast.
        Before Jiang Yang wanted to take advantage of the general situation
        here, he was suppressed.
      </p>
      <p>This was completely beyond Jiang Yang's expectations.</p>
      <p>
        Before, he always thought that he could use the luck and Dragon Veins of
        Immortal Lun Sect to compete with Gu Changge, and let Gu Changge
        understand that he was not simple, so he was not afraid of him. Fôll0w
        current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)
      </p>
      <p>
        But it turned out that he was wrong this time... Just with this thought
        in mind, he was slapped in the face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, he would not suffer such a big loss and lose so much face in
        front of everyone.
      </p>
      <p>However, thanks to Gu Changge, Jang Yang recalled a lot of things.</p>
      <p>The origin of her sister was probably not simple!</p>
      <p>No wonder Gu Changge treated her so well, and it really was a plot.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment Jiang Yang decided to change the way and start with his
        sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't know the origin and purpose of Gu Changge for the time being,
        but he had written down this hatred, and he would have the opportunity
        to take revenge in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that he has learned to be smart, and I plan to accept the
        softness first." Gu Changge smiled lightly, looking at Jiang Yang's
        expression a bit intriguing.
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Yang... "</p>
      <p>"This kid is really."</p>
      <p>
        At this time, hearing these words, the always soft-hearted silver haired
        granny couldn't help but sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        With her understanding of Jiang Yang's character, it was unlikely that
        he would do something like that just now.
      </p>
      <p>Such an explanation made her sigh.</p>
      <p>
        But how to make a decision was not something she could decide, but
        depends on Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>"Eldor brother...</p>
      <p>"Are you saying this is true?"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was stunned when she heard the words, and confusion appeared on
        her little face.
      </p>
      <p>She didn't expect Jiang Yang to suddenly say this.</p>
      <p>And that sincere look didn't look like a fake.</p>
      <p>
        But brother, was it really because of this reason, because he was afraid
        of losing her, that he treated her indifferently?
      </p>
      <p>
        If it was any normal time, when Yaoyao heard this, she would feel very
        happy.
      </p>
      <p>But now...</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was also a little tangled for a while, she was not someone who
        would be fooled by a word or two.
      </p>
      <p>Especially when Jiang Yang's change of attitude was too fast.</p>
      <p>
        But if it wasn't for this reason, how could he explain his act of
        provoking Gu Changge Just now?
      </p>
      <p>
        So she looked at Gu Changge subconsciously, wanting to see what her
        Master thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge noticed her expression and couldn't help but
        smile and said.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "Since your brother has already apologized like this, how about Yaoyao
        forgiving him? Who doesn't make mistakes at a young age? I think his
        words are sincere, so it makes sense to explain it like this."
      </p>
      <p>"After all, he's your brother!"</p>
      <p>
        As he said that, he glanced at Jiang Yang with a somewhat intriguing
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that Jiang Yang had learned to be smart this time, and planned
        to start with Yaoyao, but he was not too stupid, and continued to act as
        a coercive offender.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge also wanted to know what Jiang Yang planned to do next.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the current Jiang Yang was no longer the older brother of
        Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was true that he was the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, but so
        far, there were not many people who could recognize his identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was still thinking about how to expose Jiang Yang's "true
        face", so that Yaoyao could break up with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that he took the initiative to do so, it gave Gu Changge more
        opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the deeper the deception, the greater the cracks and hatred
        it would bring at the moment of exposure.
      </p>
      <p>This was exactly what he wanted.</p>
      <p>"Mmmm, Yaoyao will listen to Master."</p>
      <p>
        After Gu Changge said so, Yaoyao naturally didn't say anything more at
        this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that the way she looked at Jiang Yang was no longer the
        closeness that she used to have.
      </p>
      <p>It was like she was looking at a very ordinary person.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression also calmed down, but there was still a wry
        smile on the corner of his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>As if he was still regretting what happened just now.</p>
      <p>
        He didn't intend to just make Yaoyao believe him, to change her
        disappointing attitude towards him before.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, it's not that this brother didn't want to go back to see you
        and my grandma, but it was because I had difficulties, I can't get away
        from it at all, and only now can I be a little free."
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Jiang Yang spoke again and threw out such a sentence.</p>
      <p>
        As soon as these words came out, the expressions of many people in the
        hall changed, including the Holy Master Xian Lun, who turned pale, and
        cold sweat dripped from his forehead!
      </p>
      <p>He already knew what Jiang Yang was going to say!</p>
      <p>
        This was something he absolutely did not want Gu Changge and others to
        know, because it was related to the secret of Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also involved the fact that they treated Jiang Yang as a slave and
        threw him to Flying Immortal Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Jiang Yang said that if they made Yaoyao angry wouldn't
        their Immortal Lun Sect suffer?
      </p>
      <p>
        In their eyes, although Yaoyao was just Gu Changge's disciple, she was
        actually no different from a little princess.
      </p>
      <p>"Is there a reason?"</p>
      <p>
        When Yaoyao heard this, she was also slightly startled, Jiang Yang took
        the initiative to mention this matter, which made her feel like it was
        really like this.
      </p>
      <p>What was wrong?</p>
      <p>That my brother couldn't go back to see me and grandma?</p>
      <p>This matter had actually become a thorn in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        But at this time Yaoyao's little face did not change much, she even
        sighed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Suddenly saying this at this time, it doesn't matter whether your hard
        work is true or not, it is useless, Smart people are mistaken by their
        smartness.."
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the helpless Jiang Yang below his eyes, Gu Changge actually
        guessed what he was going to say next.
      </p>
      <p>He smiled slightly.</p>
      <p>What was the use of saying it?</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's opinion of him had been deeply ingrained. On the way, she told
        Gu Changge that Jiang Yang was a simple, honest and kind person in the
        past. If he was misunderstood, he would not defend himself, and would
        only bear it silently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Jiang Yang impatiently threw out this hardship on his own
        initiative?
      </p>
      <p>This purpose was too obvious.</p>
      <p>
        "You don't need to say anything about your troubles, brother, Yaoyao
        belleves in you"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment. Yaoyao shook her head and did not let Jiang Yang
        explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was small she had an invisible majesty at this time, which
        made Jiang Yang swallow what he wanted to say.
      </p>
      <p>He frowned involuntarily.</p>
      <p>
        To be honest, the consciousness that was born before this body was not
        integrated, and the impact on him was not small.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like now, he didn't even know why Yaoyao said that? She didn't even
        want to listen to my hardships?
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Jiang Yang still showed a relieved expression on his face, and
        then returned to his previous calm and indifference.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao and her grandma come from so far away from the Northern Mountain
        Village. They must be exhausted. Why don't you take some rest first."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Tomorrow, I'll take you two and walk around the immortal Lun Sect. I
        haven't seen you for more than a year. I actually miss you very much."
      </p>
      <p>
        He said with a smile, he didn't look like he was slapped to the ground
        by Gu Changge Just now, and vomited blood.
      </p>
      <p>As if that person was not him.</p>
      <p>Now it seemed that the host mainly welcomed relatives from afar.</p>
      <p>
        This scene made many elders frown, and it was not easy for them to
        decide their attitude towards Jiang Yang. After all, Jiang Yang was the
        first person who attracted the shadow of the ancestor after so long.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't even blame Jiang Yang, so how could they dare to go
        beyond it?
      </p>
      <p>"What the hell is Jiang Yang doing?"</p>
      <p>
        Holy Master Xian Lun frowned, unable to understand the purpose of Jiang
        Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I hope Jiang Yang doesn't act stupid again." Elder Zhao Yi's gaze was a
        little worried.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's expression also became interested.</p>
      <p>Interesting.</p>
      <p>
        Next, Jiang Yang would probably have to find a way to reduce Yaoyao's
        sense of resistance. As a reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, his
        vision was not bad, and he could see that Yaoyao was different.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that Jiang Yang could not have imagined that the person
        Yaoyao trusted most now was not him, but her Master Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"This is an opportunity for me."</p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Gu Changge squinted his eyes and made a plan.</p>

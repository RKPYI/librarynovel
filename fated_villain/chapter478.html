          could get close to this drop of Forbidden True Blood, given his

          meant that he trusted her to some degree. However, she had witnessed
          the scene, and it made her second guess. Alas, some things were better

          the update on the battle when she was the guardian of Sky Deer City.
          No doubt the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains would burst into a dire
          uproar if they found out. That said, Gu Changge still hadn&#8217;t
          ordered his men to spread the word about her even at this point but
          instead kept it with him as a trump card.</span

          do about it either. And now, the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains was
          already showing signs of defeat before the Upper Realm Army had even
          come charging. In fact, she had already anticipated the bleakness that

          it?&#8221; Gu Changge suddenly chuckled, not surprised by the state of
          the battle. In his eyes, it was already a certainty that the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains would lose ground in Aether Abyss.</span

          >Even without the Sky Deer Goddess, the forces of the Upper Realm
          could still open up a stable passage through the Aether Abyss, and it
          was also why the army of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains wanted
          to fend off the Upper Realm here. In other words, they were making a
          last-ditch effort.</span

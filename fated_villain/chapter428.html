          was also known as the Sky Domain. In the heart of the most ancient and
          thriving terrain, nestled a magnificent and sacred palace. It was an
          exceptionally grand palace with flawless jade for roof tiles,

          main hall floated following the passing of time as runes above
          intertwined, illuminating the sky &#8211; day and night, looking like
          a throne for god himself, while also displaying the palace&#8217;s

          out all over the world. These threads each represented the worship and
          prayer of the Mortal One&#8217;s merits by someone from around the
          world. They were flooding towards the palace, looking pure and sacred,

          indestructible body using it. As long as the faith remained and people
          still worshipped, then the body would not die. It was a mysterious

          that&#8217;s going on right now. Still, the great demons from
          who-knows-where have already spread chaos across the tens of millions

          there seemed to be unstable lately. Even the Floating Buddhist Temple
          that had been guarding it had suffered great loss, and a few powerful
          cultivators who had obtained the titles of Arhats and Buddhas were
          severely injured.</span

          responsibility from. After all, Mortal Palace was a leading figure of
          the righteous path. Thus, they couldn&#8217;t just turn a blind eye to

          didn&#8217;t you, Saintess? Why don&#8217;t you bring the issue up
          with him? No doubt things will be easier if he steps in. What do you

          couldn&#8217;t bring herself to request his help again and again.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The tall young man, too, smiled in return. He was dressed in a black
          wide-sleeved robe and had a noble and enigmatic aura. Even if he just
          stood there, the whole world would inadvertently direct their
          attention to him.</span

          looking entirely calm as she appeared to be focused on her inner self
          while sitting cross-legged.</span

          Abyss, Young Master Changge. That&#8217;s reassuring. In that case, we
          shall take our leave.&#8221; With that, the Elders left the main hall
          at once, not daring to disturb Gu Changge and Jiang Chuchu.</span

          &#8220;Are you going to keep your head lowered like this the whole
          time?&#8221;</span

          obsidians. She hummed a response and then clarified, &#8220;I
          don&#8217;t want to see you unless you&#8217;re going to treat me
          better.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A chuckle escaped Gu Changge as he grabbed a zafu and sat next to
          her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come rushing over after knowing you need help
          dealing with the Demon-Burying Abyss, haven&#8217;t I? What more do
          you want from me?&#8221;</span

          still delighted to hear him personally say so. But at the thought that
          the man would likely use it to make demands, she grew alert and bore
          into him. In fact, if this was a comic strip, there would be a speech
          bubble above her that said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you get any funny
          ideas!&#8217;</span

          she knew she shouldn&#8217;t be submissive towards him. Otherwise, he
          would use every trick in his book to bully her.</span

          I bother myself if you can sort it out yourself?&#8221;At that, he
          asked helplessly, &#8220;Am I supposed to sit by and watch you deliver
          yourself to death at the Demon-Burying Abyss instead?&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;I…&#8221; Jiang Chuchu felt somewhat flattered, surprised and
          unaccustomed that Gu Changge would say something like that, for he had
          always behaved rudely towards her. [Is it because he promised to treat
          me better?]</span

          &#8220;How are you going to thank me now? Shouldn&#8217;t you give me
          a little something when I&#8217;ve come all the way here to deal with
          the Demon-Burying Abyss issue for you?&#8221;</span

          >[I knew it!] Jiang Chuchu blushed and couldn&#8217;t help retorting,
          &#8220;We&#8217;re in the same boat here, and you promised me
          you&#8217;d treat me better. You&#8217;re dishonouring your words

          woman felt aggrieved. But because she couldn&#8217;t stand Gu
          Changge&#8217;s threatening gaze, she gritted her teeth and
          negotiated, &#8220;Then… I&#8217;ll let you kiss me once.&#8221;</span

          worried that Gu Changge would revert to his old ways, and given her

          took him seriously?!</span

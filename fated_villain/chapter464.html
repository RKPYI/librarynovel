          Great Mountains. Among the first to the ninth, the Mountain Elder of
          the First Mountain is the most powerful, but having entered retreat,
          he has not shown himself for countless years, so even I have never
          been to the First Mountain. Truth be told, Nine Great Mountains are
          now currently led by their Second Mountain Elder,&#8221; the Sky Deer

          >Although Nine Great Mountains were untraceable, the Sky Deer Goddess
          had her own means to locate their exact location. It was by taking the
          Blue Cloud Flying Boat to the Deep Cloud Graveyard. Conveniently, she
          happened to possess the Blue Cloud Flying Boat, which she had obtained
          back then.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Accordingly, Gu Changge passed down his instructions, amassing a
          large number of formidable cultivators. The weakest among them was in
          the Sacred Realm and possessed the ability to dispel arrays and cast
          buff others. Other than that, there were also a number of experts
          ranging from the Sacred Emperor Realm to the Quasi-Nirvana Realm.
          These formidable cultivators were unrivalled elites that survived
          through hundreds of wars whose strength would shock the world.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Three days later, upon a surge of sunlight, an enormous Blue Cloud
          Flying Boat speedily enlarged from the Sky Deer Goddess’s hand. It
          resembled a gigantic mountain with a tip that could pierce the sky.
          Upon receiving their order, the formidable experts turned into divine
          rainbows.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the air was ripped apart, a golden path was revealed, and the Blue
          Cloud Flying Boat that harboured all the cultivators entering the
          rift. This was a method of tearing apart part of the universe, which
          allowed the boat to vanish and reappear somewhere a great distance
          away.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Magnificent and ancient, the Blue Cloud Flying Boat was constructed
          with priceless materials—its deck was built with Blooming Astral
          Clouds; its beams were forged with Celestial Gold Ancient Wood; its
          vessel was formed with Purest Immortal Gold.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >&#8220;I obtained this ship by coincidence back then, but I never
          expected to use it in my lifetime.&#8221; Standing atop the Blue Cloud
          Flying Boat, the Sky Deer Goddess gently shook her head, and she
          seemed to be talking to Gu Changge.</span

          wasn&#8217;t entertained by her leisurely conversation as he sat down
          on the stone bench by the stone table, after which he immediately
          commanded.</span

          some sort of maid, huh?&#8221; As the Sky Deer donned a snowy robe,
          her figure was dazzling with unparalleled beauty, and as she was
          speaking, her eyes were blinking, seemingly containing an
          unconcealable demonic nature.</span

      <p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Sky Deer Goddess nodded as she retained her smile without
          refusing his order. Upon a wave of her hand, a tea set made of jade
          emerged and she began to boil some tea. Her hair was silky and radiant
          as she carried a unique allure.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Watching their interaction from afar, the formidable cultivators had
          their hearts racing. [Despite being such a noble figure, the Sky Deer

          Master Changge…]</span

          >A few days later, the Blue Cloud Flying Boat tore space apart and
          arrived at a mysterious region as they seemed to have reached the
          border of the world. There, the astral sky was immeasurably vast. The
          ancient trees stood as tall as the sky, absorbing the essence of the
          universe as each of its branches and leaves seemed to be able to lift
          the world up.</span

          Mountains lay.&#8221; Gu Changge raised his head and looked at the
          waterfall before him, as if he could see a continent hiding above
          it.</span

          Domains. To be more precise, it neighboured the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains, but due to its geographical formation, the place appeared
          much more mysterious, making it hard to find.</span

          Nine Great Mountains was equivalent to a fatty piece of steak that was
          sadly undiscovered by the Upper Realm for many years.</span

          of Nine Great Mountains are all here.&#8221; Arriving at this
          location, the Sky Deer Goddess experienced a drastic emotional change
          as beams of divine mists swirled in her eyes.</span

          entire flying boat for it to successfully cruise. In that instant, the
          ancient Blue Cloud Flying Boat was covered in layers of Immortal
          Mists, which separated itself from everything else. It started to
          steadily travel against the current of the waterfall, as though it was
          an aged monolith.</span

          >Noticing her movements, Gu Changge sensed a dense and enormous aura
          coming from the top of the waterfall. He ordered those behind him to
          prepare for a potential bloody battle. Though, he wasn&#8217;t certain
          whether the Nine Great Mountains would grant him the surprise.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the meantime, there was an extravagant, spectacular continent
          floating above the waterfall. Within, uncountable ancient beasts dwelt
          the lands while wild birds flew in the sky. The primaeval forest was
          thick, the mountains were glorious, and the palaces were
          archaic.</span

          out-of-the-world sacred land—heaven amid the mortal world. The living

          &#8220;No next time. And I better not hear any more bad-mouthing about
          Master.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;Y–Yes. Thank you very much, Eldest Senior Sister!&#8221;
          Hurriedly replying, the cultivators were highly respectful—yet
          fearful—towards the stunning woman. Quickly, they left the area, not
          daring to tarry any longer.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The stunning woman then watched as they left before withdrawing her
          gaze, after which she tensed her brows and muttered, &#8220;All the
          other branches are growing more and more hostile towards Master
          lately. They are very expressive of their disagreement.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;Indeed, the Upper Realm&#8217;s invasion against the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains is a fine opportunity for the disciples of
          Nine Great Mountains to shine and gather some people, yet Master
          decides to seal the mountains right at this moment. Quite baffling,
          isn&#8217;t it? As you said, Eldest Senior Sister, Second Mountain
          Elder&#8217;s decision is quite the puzzling one.&#8221;</span

          >Out of nowhere, a man&#8217;s voice could be heard. He was a tall,
          muscular man in golden battle armour; his hair was gleaming with
          golden light. It was as if there was a halo above his head. His pupils
          of faint gold were vertically straight, as though he was an omnipotent
          young god.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Behind the man in golden battle armour, there were a few cultivators,
          composed of men and women, following his lead.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Greetings, Chosen One.&#8221; Seeing the man in golden battle
          armour, Chen Suyun took a bow without a change in her eyes.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Please drop the formalities, Eldest Senior Sister. We are both
          disciples of the Nine Great Mountains. There&#8217;s no need to be so
          courteous, is there?&#8221; In response, the man in golden battle
          armour smilingly said, seemingly amicable and polite.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unlike other forces, except for the Mountain Elders, there were no
          other ranks in the Nine Great Mountains. Seniority among members was
          solely determined by the time they spent cultivating since they
          entered the Nine Great Mountains.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >For instance, since Chen Suyun entered the Nine Great Mountains
          longer than anyone else, she thereby earned the title of &#8216;Eldest
          Senior Sister.&#8217;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, the man in golden battle armour before her was Gu Wudi,
          who was the Chosen One, otherwise known as the Successor of Nine Great
          Mountains. From his name, one could discern his will, and he bore the
          ambitious goal of being an undefeatable, most domineering being in the
          world.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although he entered Nine Great Mountains later than Chen Suyun and
          the rest, due to his impressive Talent, his cultivation level swiftly
          caught up with the others and even surpassed them. Hence, he became
          the Chosen One of Nine Great Mountains, whose popularity was
          unrivalled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the Nine Great Mountains, his distinguished identity was second
          only to the Mountain Elders, and even the Direct Disciples of each
          Mountain Elders would have to greet him with respect. Therefore, when
          he encountered Chen Suyun, instead of being nervously deferential as
          the others, he was rather casual.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Right. Eldest Senior Sister, since you&#8217;re here, where
          are Youngest Junior Brother and the others? I remember that he could
          never leave your side and he&#8217;s always wherever you are. But he
          doesn&#8217;t appear to be here today.&#8221; Gu Wudi looked behind
          Chen Suyun, seemingly surprised, and asked as though he didn&#8217;t
          know the answer.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Youngest Junior Brother is currently with Master. Perhaps
          Master is assigning some tasks to him.&#8221; Hearing that, Chen Suyun
          shook her head and calmly answered.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Is that so? I&#8217;ve got something to discuss with Youngest
          Junior Brother, but since he&#8217;s not here, maybe next time
          then.&#8221; Gu Wudi then chuckled as gloominess zoomed across his
          eyes and quickly retained his calmness.</span

      <h4>
        Chapter 215-1: The assassination list prepared by Mingkong? A secret
        push (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        With the Human Ancestor Hall‚Äôs token, things became even simpler for Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji pretended to be Jiang Chuchu, the descendant of the Human
        Ancestor Hall, and walked around the world. She could take the
        opportunity to publicize his various achievements against the inheritor
        of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, there were no idiots who would dare to jump out and
        suspect anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Wang Ziji, another descendant of the Human Ancestor
        Hall, never doubted Gu Changge's identity at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, under the promotion of the two descendants of the Human
        Ancestor Hall, Gu Changge would be able to develop steadily for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        What did it mean when the descendants of the Human Ancestor Hall spoke?
      </p>
      <p>It meant authority!</p>
      <p>
        As the oldest Dao Lineage to contend against the inheritor of demonic
        art, there was no other force that knew as much about the inheritor of
        demonic art as the Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as Yan Ji didn't meet an old friend or teacher who knew Jiang
        Chuchu well, it was impossible for her to be found abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was trapped in the inner world by Gu Changge, so he didn't
        need to care about her at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless she suddenly burst with some forbidden power, it would be
        impossible for her to break the shackles of the inner world and escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Gu Changge didn't need to care about her for a short period
        of time, and could concentrate on the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have Emperor Ying Shuang to take the blame for me. During this period
        of time, it is not easy for him to clear his suspicions. It is estimated
        that he appeared for a brief moment before retreating back to Heavenly
        Emperor Mountain."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Compared to other Children of Luck, this guy is actually quite
        vigilant‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "But in front of me, what's the use of such vigilance? Even the shell of
        the turtle has to be broken for me."
      </p>
      <p>Inside the palace, Gu Changge couldn't help laughing.</p>
      <p>A jade slip appeared in front of him.</p>
      <p>It clearly listed the names of the Emperor.</p>
      <p>
        In addition, there was a lot of information about Princes of Ancient
        Emperors, Heirs of True Immortals, Ancient Freaks, and even a lot of
        Young Emperors who had been crowned in many eras.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This girl, Yue Mingkong, even prepared an assassination list for me? It
        seems that she knows my plan."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But it is exactly what I want, and it saves me a lot of trouble from
        investigation."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge scanned these names, this jade slip was specially reserved
        for him by Yue Mingkong when she left Ancient Immortal Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't bother at that time.</p>
      <p>
        Looking at it now, he found that those ancient and peerless monsters who
        were about to appear were really his best cultivation resources.

      </p>
      <p>
        "I probably had such a list in my last life, so it was written down by
        Yue Mingkong."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge whispered and began to plan his next whereabouts.</p>
      <p>
        Either follow the direction of Yue Mingkong and cut off the
        reincarnation of Human Ancestor, or go to find the place where the
        Absolute Heavenly Extermination appears.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I can send someone to look for it on a cloudy day. This matter can't be
        rushed, so the top priority now is to find the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Soon, Gu Changge decided what to do next.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Human Ancestor was reincarnated with a huge fortune, and he doubted that
        Yue Mingkong had good foresight.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was very likely that the bamboo basket would be empty, and it
        would end up being fishy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like the last time she let Ye Ling escape, the tyranny of the Child
        of Luck was not something that Yue Mingkong could have expected,
        especially an old monster like Human Ancestor who had reincarnated many
        times.
      </p>
      <p>"Let me do this kind of thing."</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Gu Changge showed a deep smile and planned to leave,
        but before that, he decided to go to the Purple Immortal Pill Sect
        first.
      </p>
      <p>"Old Ming."</p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge summoned the old confidant Ming, who had been with him
        in the Lower Realm.
      </p>
      <p>"Greetings, young master!"</p>
      <p>An old man dressed in black arrived respectfully.</p>
      <p>
        Now that Gu Changge was highly regarded, his identity had undergone
        earth-shaking changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if he was a retainer with a foreign surname, many Gu family members
        paid attention to him and did not dare to despise him.
      </p>
      <p>And he knew very well who gave him all of this.</p>
      <p>"How is Qiuhan doing during this time?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stood with his hands behind his back, and asked casually,
        saying that he threw Lin Qiuhan in the Purple Immortal Pill Sect for a
        long time, and it was time to pay her a visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Qiuhan had a very good life in Purple Immortal Pill Sect and was
        trained as a future sect master. Her current alchemy skills are
        unmatched by her peers in Purple Immortal Pill Sect."
      </p>
      <p>"She also misses the young master very much."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Old Ming's face couldn't help but show a touch of relief,
        and he spoke excitedly and happily.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Gu Changge took the initiative to ask about her, which meant
        that Gu Changge did not forget Lin Qiuhan.
      </p>
      <p>
        A person of Gu Changge's identity, as long as he said a word in the
        Upper Realm, countless girls from the heavens would take the initiative
        to come to his door, breaking the threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the final analysis, Lin Qiuhan only came from the Lower Realm. No
        matter how outstanding her alchemy talent was, she was not as good as
        those genius girls in terms of background.
      </p>
      <p>It was normal for Gu Changge to forget about her.</p>
      <p>Now, Gu Changge said this, obviously it was him who thought wrong!</p>
      <p>
        How could this not make Old Ming excited? He also hoped that his younger
        generation would be valued by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, Qiuhan didn't disappoint me."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled slightly, which was not surprising. After all, she was
        a person with great luck. After she came to the Upper Realm, she began
        to show her alchemy talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have time recently, I'll go to Purple Immortal Pill Sect to see her."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge continued.</p>
      <p>
        The main thing was that he let Purple Immortal Pill Sect train Lin
        Qiuhan for him for so long, it was time for her to play her role.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you, Young Master. If Qiu Han heard that the Young Master would
        visit her, she would definitely be very pleasantly surprised."
      </p>
      <p>Old Ming said excitedly.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"What? Where are my parents and grandpa?"</p>
      <p>On the other side, under Gu Changge's intentional arrangement.</p>
      <p>
        After many twists and turns, a piece of news also reached Gu Xian'er's
        ears.
      </p>
      <p>Inside a palace.</p>
      <p>She looked at the clansman in front of her who reported the news.</p>
      <p>
        Emotions such as joy and excitement appeared uncontrollably on her face,
        and she couldn't hide it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the second thing that made her happiest in this period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the first thing, of course, was to figure out what Gu Changge had
        been hiding all along.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the Nirvana Pool incident, Gu Xian'er had never seen Gu Changge
        again, and she didn't know what Gu Changge was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er already understood everything that day when she witnessed the
        scene where Gu Changge couldn't suppress his demonic nature and was
        controlled by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did Gu Changge dig her Dao bone back then, wasn't it because of
        being controlled by the demon?
      </p>
      <p>But now, Gu Changge would rather give up his arms than hurt her.</p>
      <p>This made Gu Xian'er extremely moved and warm.</p>
      <p>
        Especially when Gu Changge said "Don't touch her", it seemed like he was
        yelling at the other guy, and that low roar still echoed in her ears
        from time to time, making her heart tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Xian'er could understand what Gu Changge had done over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that he was deliberately avoiding her, maybe it was just that he
        couldn't keep his face down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Gu Xian'er didn't care about Gu Changge's actions at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Miss, the news should be correct. At that time, some cultivators
        noticed the whereabouts of the Patriarch and their whereabouts, and they
        seemed to be in a Lower Realm‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Judging from the news, it seems that the situation of the homeowners
        and theirs is not a problem."
      </p>
      <p>
        The clansman who reported the news replied with a determined expression
        on his face.
      </p>
      <p>"Who told you this news?"</p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er was a little puzzled and curious.</p>
      <p>
        "This is not clear, because the source of the news has gone through many
        twists and turns, and it is impossible to determine." The person replied
        respectfully.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er was slightly startled.</p>
      <p>
        After reacting, she nodded, glanced in the direction of Gu Changge's
        place, and then said, "Okay, I'll set off today to find my parents and
        others."
      </p>
      <p>
        She had just returned to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family and she heard
        about the whereabouts of her parents?
      </p>
      <p>Was it really a coincidence? Or was she just lucky?</p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er was not stupid.</p>
      <p>
        Over the years, someone must be secretly helping her investigate this.
      </p>
      <p>And who would this person be?</p>
      <p>Soon, Gu Xian'er guessed who did it.</p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge is really proud as always, he clearly cares about me in his
        heart, but he still looks indifferent, hum‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>With this thought.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er led many strong men of her lineage and started to set off to
        the place where her parents were.
      </p>
      <h4>

        push (2)
      </h4>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>"Holy Maiden."</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, in the mountains outside the Ancient Immortal Gu
        Family's territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji, with a veil on her face and a layer of mist covering her face,
        was standing here. From the perspective of appearance, she was
        completely no different from the previous Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, even if Wang Ziji, who was cultivating with her, was here,
        it would be difficult for her to see the abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Lord of Reincarnation was also a notorious person when he
        was young, so he researched such a secret technique to change his face,
        and even his origin could be disguised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps even the Heavenly Lord of Reincarnation himself did not think
        that one day his secret technique would be used by Gu Changge in such a
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, in the void, an old woman wearing gray clothes appeared,
        and with her Great Sacred Realm cultivation base, she respectfully said.
      </p>
      <p>She also didn't notice anything unusual about Yan Ji.</p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji nodded slightly, her expression indifferent as if there was no
        trace of emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following Gu Changge's instructions, after she left the Ancient Immortal
        Gu Family, she rushed here as a descendant of the Ancient Immortal Hall.
      </p>
      <p>The target was the territory where the Ancient Clans lived.</p>
      <p>
        "Holy maiden, is this investigation fruitful?" The old woman in gray
        couldn't help but ask curiously. Before that, Jiang Chuchu insisted on
        going to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family to ask Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>This seemed really unnecessary.</p>
      <p>
        Now the biggest suspect of the inheritor of demonic art was the emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, shouldn't it be to investigate the Emperor Ying Shuan?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yan Ji's face showed a hint of apology, and she shook her
        head and said, "I was overthinking, young master Changge has the world
        in his heart, and he is kind to the people. He has sacrificed a lot to
        fight against the inheritor of the demonic art. I shouldn't have doubted
        him."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the old woman was a little stunned, and she was worried
        that the Holy Maiden was still obsessed and would get to the horns.
      </p>
      <p>It was not too late to wake up now.</p>
      <p>
        "Holy maiden, are we heading to Heavenly Emperor Mountain now? It's
        probably the Tiger's Den there now, so it won't be stable." The
        gray-clothed old woman said worriedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was very worried that the Heavenly Emperor Mountain would take the
        opportunity to take action against Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji shook her head and said, "The inheritor of demonic art is very
        important, and Heavenly Emperor Mountain does not dare to risk the
        consequences of being enemies of the entire world, so don't worry."
      </p>
      <p>
        As she said that, she couldn't help but display a bit of a trance in her
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she first returned to the Upper Realm with Gu Changge, she actually
        didn't know the identity of Gu Changge as the inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't until recently that Yan Ji understood all this.</p>
      <p>
        Was she following more than just a hero? This was simply an unparalleled
        demon who used the world as a chessboard and planned for the common
        people.
      </p>
      <p>She had no objection to that.</p>
      <p>After all, she was following Gu Changge, not his identity.</p>
      <p>
        Under such a life-and-death secret, Gu Changge didn't do anything to
        her. Instead, he trusted her a lot and entrusted her with many important
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The grace of knowing the encounter, the grace of reshaping the body‚Ä¶
        There was so much kindness that Yan Ji couldn't repay.

        "Knowing the Holy Maiden, let's go to the Emperor Mountain now. Are we
        still looking for the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor?"
      </p>
      <p>
        When the old woman in gray heard the words, she also looked solemn,
        swept away her previous worries, and then asked about another matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was something Jiang Chuchu had always cared about before, and it
        was the top priority just like the pursuit of the inheritor of demonic
        art.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she were to go to Emperor Mountain, then the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor would definitely be put on hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The reincarnation of the Human Ancestor will appear sooner or later. We
        don't have to interfere too much, let nature take its course. Too much
        interference may even hinder the Human Ancestor."
      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji remembered Gu Changge's explanation, and couldn't help shaking
        her head slightly, explaining this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, even if she didn't go looking for the Human Ancestor's
        reincarnation, the rest of the people in the Human Ancestor Hall would
        not be able to help but leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the first step to find the reincarnation of a Human Ancestor
        was supreme honor, but were there rewards or something?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Our top priority now is to determine the identity of the inheritor of
        demonic art‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Yan Ji spoke again and said lightly.</p>
      <p>
        After all, Emperor Ying Shuang was the one who was now taking the blame
        for Gu Changge. Naturally, her purpose was to find a way to make Emperor
        Ying Shuang take the blame firmly.
      </p>
      <p>"Understood."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the gray-clothed old woman nodded, not suspecting her at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, a master and a servant, two people turned into divine lights and
        rose into the sky, heading towards the Heavenly Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>At the same time, in the Heavenly Emperor Mountain.</p>
      <p>
        With a gloomy and unwilling face, Ying Shuang was walking back and forth
        in the palace, and he seemed to be in a bad mood.
      </p>
      <p>"Hateful!"</p>
      <p>"Gu Changge framed me like this! I must avenge this disgrace!"</p>
      <p>
        His fists were clenched tightly, and his face was very unwilling, but
        there was a deep fear, panic, and worry hidden in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>During this time, as Gu Changge had guessed.</p>
      <p>
        Just two days after he appeared, he planned to show off his majesty. Not
        long after Ying Shuang left Heavenly Emperor Mountain, he was attacked
        by many cultivators and creatures, causing a mess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wearing a hat associated with the inheritor of demonic art, no matter
        where he went, it was impossible to be welcomed, but rather aroused
        hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for the fear of the Emperor Mountain's background forces
        behind him, many cultivators and great sects would be ready to make a
        move against him.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were various indications that the Emperor and the inheritor of
        demonic art had an inseparable relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how Heavenly Emperor Mountain explained this, it would have no
        effect. Instead, he accidentally killed many cultivators and creatures
        who attacked them, making this matter more and more dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        This incident made Ying Shuang look ugly and angry to the extreme.
        Although he had never inherited the memory of his original body, he also
        knew that he had nothing to do with the so-called inheritor of demonic
        art at all.
      </p>
      <p>There was no demonic power in his body at all.</p>
      <p>
        All of this was framed by Gu Changge and the descendants of that Human
        Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Distorted facts, despicable and shameless, and poured dirty water
        directly on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he still had no way to deal with it, nor did he have many
        strategies and means of the original body to deal with it.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        There was no other way, Ying Shuang had to turn back halfway and go
        home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, he sent someone to investigate the little servant next to Yin
        Mei, who was the original him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turned out that the little servant disappeared in the end, and the
        place where he disappeared was the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>This made Ying Shunag feel creepy.</p>
      <p>
        It was estimated that other than him, no one would pay attention to such
        a nameless servant.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the disappearance of this little servant would not cause any waves,
        and no one would care about anyone like him who had no relatives or
        friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I suddenly disappeared, Yin Mei may be sad, and no one will feed her
        horses in the future."
      </p>
      <p>"This Gu Changge actually made Yin Mei sad, he deserves to die!"</p>
      <p>
        But at that time, Ying Shuang still had this idea, thinking that no one
        except Yin Mei would care about his disappearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his opinion, Yin Mei was the light when he was most desperate and
        helpless.
      </p>
      <p>If Yin Mei didn't care about him, why would she help him so much?</p>
      <p>
        And Ying Shuang naturally put all the grievances on Gu Changge's head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge might have discovered something, otherwise why would he
        suddenly attack a servant.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Ying Shuang feel cold all over, and it felt like Gu Changge
        suddenly had the upper hand.
      </p>
      <p>His previous body was likely to be occupied by the former emperor.</p>
      <p>
        And Gu Changge had the means to learn the whole story from the Emperor's
        mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Ying Shuang was terrified and planned to return to Emperor
        Mountain to hide from the limelight for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he was just a little servant who had never even seen the
        world before, but suddenly he became the most envious and aloof bigshot
        from his daily life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The change of identity did not mean that the mentality could be changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, before he could enjoy it, he took the blame of the inheritor
        of demonic art and became the devil that everyone cursed.
      </p>
      <p>This made Ying Shuang feel uneasy, and he almost yelled out!</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, it was not good for him to continue to stay in the outside
        world. With his current ability, it was not enough to cope with such a
        situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Ying Shuang's sudden change of mind and his return to
        Heavenly Emperor Mountain shortly after he appeared, attracted ridicule
        from many neutral clans of the Royal Sword clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        They felt that the Emperor who appeared this time was very embarrassing
        and disgraceful to his father.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even many high-level and old antiques of Emperor Mountain were also
        frowning now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Ying Shuang was determined to appear before, but now he ran
        to Emperor Mountain after encountering some difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>What the hell was this? Even their faces felt dull.</p>
      <p>
        This move was quite different from Ying Shuang in the past, making them
        guess that he had made a mistake in his cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>But they didn't think deeply.</p>
      <p>
        Because Ying Shuang, as the heir of Emperor Ying, was protected by the
        imprint of his own imperial way, his soul was very firm, and it could
        not be easily taken away by any existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone really dared to take over, it would be amazing and attract
        their attention. T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, Ying Shuang's prestige in the Heavenly Emperor Mountain was
        swept away, but Gu Changge gained a lot of Luck points and Destiny value
        for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge's view, all of this was also expected, and he had also
        contributed to the flames.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the current Ying Shuang was just wearing the skin of a big
        shot, and he was just a horse feeder inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the face of this situation, it was not bad to be frightened and
        paralyzed.

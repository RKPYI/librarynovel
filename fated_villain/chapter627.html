        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shu Sect was considered a holy land to cultivate the Sword Dao in the Profound Sword World. The phrase ‘All Sword Immortals are born from the Shu Sect&#8217; didn&#8217;t exist without reason.</span><span id="more-33877"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a Sword-Forging Pool, which covered an area of thousands of square kilometres in a Forbidden Area behind the Shu Sect. It was rumoured to have been built by the first Elder of the Shu Sect. He had taken a meteor and forged it into ten thousand pieces before making the pool. It had to be noted that more than thirty thousand divine swords were also used in its construction. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the full moon or when the sun shone overhead, the sounds of sword cries would ring out, which held mysterious Sword Qi. Countless sword silhouettes would circle around the space as Sword Qi wove around the place. Many disciples and Elders from the Shu Sect would come here to meditate upon the Sword Dao, and drastically improve their cultivation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was one of the Forbidden Areas of the Shu Sect. Many Sword Techniques and Cultivation Techniques, collected by multiple generations of Elders and disciples of the Sect, were stored within a Sword Pavilion, which rose into the clouds and was situated on one side of the pool. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every single record inside the Pavilion was unique and extraordinary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two places were the two most Forbidden Areas of the Shu Sect and thus had Elders in the Ninth Realm guarding them specifically. Even a fly could not trespass into those places. However, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, an alien visitor, stepped openly into the entrance of the Sword Pavilion and walked inside with a calm expression. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was clad in the outfit of a Shu Sect disciple and had the faint Sword aura circling his body. Even the limping Elder, who had been in charge of guarding the entrance, looked approving since Tuo Ba Xiao Yao held the pure aura of a Shu Sect disciple. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had already cultivated such strong mastery over the sword at such a young age, so he would definitely be the pillar of the Sect within just a few years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Time moves so quickly. There&#8217;s no sign of what he used to look like.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elder at the entrance did not know what Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was currently thinking as the young man looked among the neatly arranged bookshelves to search for the familiar jade scrolls. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s gaze became distant. A long time ago, he had been here browsing for scriptures and techniques like the other disciples, yet now he couldn&#8217;t see the familiar techniques. Even the limping Elder at the entrance had been unfamiliar to him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he died from the Heavenly Tribulation caused when the Prime Ancestor was trying to breakthrough, many events had occurred within Shu Sect. It had caused many classic scriptures inside the Sword Pavilion to have been lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I hope I can find it. My sister&#8217;s life is still in Gu Changge&#8217;s hand.] Tuo Ba Xiao Yao came back to himself quickly and disappeared among the shelves of jade scrolls. He began browsing through them, starting from the first shelf right to the eighth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He ignored the strange looks many Shu Sect disciples shot him. He knew that the Shu Sect would garner Gu Changge&#8217;s attention soon, which would expose his secret of being a Shu Sect disciple in the past. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that happens, there would be no place for him in the Upper Realm or Profound Sword World. He also had to quickly rescue his sister from Gu Changge before the great army from the Upper Realm Forces paid attention to the Shu Sect. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the presence of the Primordial Foetal Sword of World Domination, Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t make a move on him for now. However, things would become uncertain once the Sword of World Domination fell into Gu Changge&#8217;s possession. He had to quickly find ways to improve his strength, and find a way to counter Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Mmmmmm—*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, billions of swords were vibrating slightly within the Sword-Forging Pool while emanating humming sounds. The divine swords located within the cliffs, stones, and gaps within each mountain seemed to resonate in celebration, like they were worshipping the king among swords.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slender figure sat cross-legged in the depths of the pool with his eyes closed, exuding a serene yet ancient aura while many sword silhouettes circled him and hovered like the sun. His eyes opened abruptly, reflecting an overwhelming number of sword silhouettes, which could split the void and the river of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He is a serious threat. He&#8217;s not only an enemy of the Shu Sect but also an enemy of the whole Profound Sword World.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This figure was Lin En, the Little Master of the Shu Sect. Unlike his incarnation back at Ancient Mulberry City, this was his true form, which had already reached the Earth Sword Immortal Realm. Even the Old Sword Immortal who had taught him had lost to him several years ago, so he could undeniably be considered the strongest in the Profound Sword World!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Lin En emerged from the Sword-Forging Pool, the surrounding divine swords all quieted down and expressed reverence towards him. His brow was furrowed as he looked towards the direction of Ancient Mulberry City. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since his incarnation and true form had a deep connection, he knew what was happening inside the city. The deaths of the four Sword Immortals were truly shocking and the Thirteen States were still in a state of frightened unrest. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The astounding strength Gu Changge exhibited made everyone feel a deep helplessness and desperation. It was peerless and absolutely dominant, without any other possibility of winning against him.  Even if Lin En&#8217;s true body went there and exhausted all its strength, he would never win against Gu Changge. Right now, that terrifying enemy had set his sights on Shu Sect and the Old Sword Immortal because the Sword Immortal Order had come from the Old Sword Immortal!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Master is far inferior to Gu Changge, and even the Prime Ancestor would be useless against him as well. What a disaster for the Shu Sect. I may have to make the journey to Boundless Valley. Otherwise, the Shu Sect will be razed to the ground before the Profound Sword World could be destroyed.] Lin En sighed and stepped forward, making the void blurry before he disappeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boundless Valley was a strange place in the Profound Sword World. This place wasn&#8217;t bound by any techniques, heavens nor earth, or any limitations. The sky arched overhead and the land was rectangular; it seemed infinitely large and any cultivator would get trapped and die if they set foot in it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Lin En had only paused in the outermost part of the valley and didn&#8217;t continue his journey after sensing immense danger within. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, disaster and fortune were often interwoven and a divining sword technique Lin En had cultivated by chance informed him that there was a hint of life inside. Thus, he decided to take the challenge and go in before Gu Changge could attack the Shu Sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge will never let the Shu Sect off easily. Right now, our only chance at survival is to cooperate with other Forces including Sword Cliff and Kong Mountain. Snow Sword Immortal has betrayed Sword Cliff and didn&#8217;t even realise that Gu Changge does not hold any good intentions towards our world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Elders were gathered within the Shu Sect Palace, with the current Sect Master, as well as the Old Sword Immortal, present as well. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Old Sword Immortal was the one who had spoken. He stroked his beard, gaze heavy yet filled with hints of anger due to his futile fury towards Snow Sword Immortal. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he saw it, Gu Changge could crush Profound Sword World with his current strength, so he wouldn&#8217;t come all the way here for no reason and tell them how to fight against the Otherworldly Sky Demons. It was just irrational. Yet, the Snow Sword Immortal had chosen to believe Gu Changge, which greatly angered the Old Sword Immortal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Old Sword Immortal&#8217;s words faded away though, the entire palace fell silent. Many Elders, including the Sect Master, the Abundance Sword Immortal, did not say anything. After all, the Old Sword Immortal’s act of sending the Sword Immortal Order by himself was already against the rules of the Sect, but his status and strength meant that no one dared to speak up against it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, to be fair, the Old Sword Immortal could not have predicted this outcome. But now, the original neutral position of the Shu Sect had turned hostile in Gu Changge’s eyes. It was obvious that this was not the time to bicker or point fingers.</span></p>

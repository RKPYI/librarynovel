        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The re-emergence of the Successor of Demonic Arts in the Immortal Academy had
                affected all its disciples. Be it Elders, Ranked Disciples, Unranked Disciples, Inner Disciples, or
                Outer Disciples, everyone fell into a state of panic as the strange disappearance of the young prodigy
                with a unique physique in his own cultivation cave left many terrified and frantic with
                fear.</span><span id="more-27920"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Successor of Demonic Arts was hiding among them, none could tell
                which disciple would be the next target. Even the Phoenix Lady and the rest of Ranked Disciples grew
                alert of the Successor of Demonic Arts in hiding. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the Successor of Demonic Arts had the capability to escape from Gu
                Changge&#8217;s grasp, possessing daunting abilities and a Sacred Emperor Grade Weapon. Thus, no one
                could guarantee their own safety if they were to face the true Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ying Shuang was once the Successor of Sky Emperor Mountain. Yet, he
                cultivates Forbidden Demonic Arts hence betraying Sky Emperor Mountain. And now I, the Heir of Sky
                Emperor Shen, as the current Successor of Sky Emperor Mountain, must search for him and restore peace to
                the world.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his Four-Spirit Battle Chariot, Prince Ying soared through the high sky
                with an illuminating aura surrounding him, blinding and eye-catching, as if he was a young god, sternly
                speaking his intention to subdue the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late, the young prodigies of Sky Emperor Mountain, including Ying
                Shuang&#8217;s younger sister, Ying Yu, had been scouring the entire Immortal Academy for any traces of
                Ying Shuang, who was allegedly hiding in the academy. However, even with the Elders of Immortal Academy
                helping, nothing came out of their search.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ying Shuang has walked down the path of Demonic Arts. In his eyes,
                you, his sister, no longer exists. Do you think he&#8217;ll show mercy to you when he comes for
                you?&#8221; Sensing the perturbation in Ying Yu&#8217;s eyes, Prince Shen spoke in a chilling voice, not
                allowing her any space for optimism.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Ying Yu grew visibly more dejected. &#8220;I know. I
                won&#8217;t show mercy to him if I see him.&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She nodded, aware that Prince Shen was warning her out of concern that
                emotions might overtake her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Glad that you understand. I hope there won&#8217;t be any betrayal
                when the time comes.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince Shen&#8217;s bloodline was not inferior to that of Ying Shuang, and
                might even be superior to it. If it weren&#8217;t for Ying Shuang&#8217;s treachery against Sky Emperor
                Mountain, he wouldn&#8217;t have gone out of his state of being sealed. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, his father was a being even more ancient than Sky Emperor Ying,
                possessing a higher position than the latter in the eyes of the Ancient Immortal Races. Thus, young
                prodigies were reassured by Prince Shen&#8217;s speech and involvement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, Gu Changge, as the recognised champion among all young
                prodigies, naturally stood out and made a declaration. &#8220;The Successor of Demonic Arts is the most
                atrocious being in existence. I shall work with all the Elders to pursue him and bring justice to the
                fallen youths.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon his speech, young prodigies were relieved as if his words were calming
                pills. After all, now that Gu Changge was dragged into it, the Successor of Demonic Arts in hiding
                should know to limit himself. Moreover, many perceived the Successor of Demonic Arts&#8217; action as a
                challenge to the people, so that made Gu Changge&#8217;s response an open acceptance to that
                challenge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This brat is stealing my spotlight. I was the one who said it first,
                though…&#8221; Prince Shen subconsciously frowned. Unfortunately, he came to the outside world rather
                late, so he wasn&#8217;t as prestigious as Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, lately, he would overhear young prodigies comparing
                him and Gu Changge, and he would always be the runner-up. Despite acknowledging Gu Changge&#8217;s
                strength, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel irritated being treated as second place to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at his face, Ying Yu and the rest immediately grew concerned. Ever
                since Prince Shen came out, every method of his was proven ruthless. Due to Ying Shuang&#8217;s actions,
                Sky Emperor Ying’s side got greatly oppressed. Thus, currently, Ying Yu could only obey Prince
                Shen&#8217;s orders and refrain from making decisions on her own.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the entire Immortal Academy gradually grew agitated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, the Elders had expected such an outcome. Thanks to the uncanny
                methods Ying Shuang possessed as the Successor of Demonic Arts, he needed only to disguise himself to
                infiltrate the Immortal Academy. Therefore, it would be difficult to uncover the identity of the
                Successor of Demonic Arts. After all, Successors of Demonic Arts would even give the Mortal Palace, who
                often combated against them a major headache.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a flash, numerous days passed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Dong!*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Dong!*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Dong!*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following three strikes of the bell, white mists and vibrant rays occurred on
                the stage as a white-haired old man sat on it with his ambiguous body covered in Chaos Qi.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was an Elder with unparalleled wisdom, giving the disciples below him a
                lecture about the Great Dao.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, wondrous sounds occurred throughout the sky as golden lotuses and
                heavenly flowers brightly bloomed in the air. It was an occurrence of wonders. Meanwhile, on the nearby
                mountains filled with merriness, packed silhouettes gleamed. The disciples were intoxicated as they were
                astounded by the sensation upon feeling the might of Immortal Academy and its many Elders.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lectures alone harboured immense Principles of the Great Dao. Just by
                listening to it, young prodigies were greatly enlightened, undergoing epiphanies and had a drastic boost
                in their cultivation level.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before entering Immortal Academy, they never had the opportunity to encounter
                any cultivators in the Sacred Emperor Realm. Yet, now, they had one giving them lectures everyday. Such
                a distinctive treatment could only be provided by the Immortal Academy, which was why every young
                prodigy was fighting with their lives to get in.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Changge, why is the Successor of the Mortal Palace staring at you? Did
                something happen between the two of you?&#8221; Standing on a giant boulder, Gu Changge, who possessed a
                slender figure and stunning face, was fascinated as he listened to the lecture of the Elder on the stage
                with his hands resting behind his back.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the disciples that were new to the Immortal Academy, these daily lectures
                were certainly good cultivation contents. Although Gu Changge didn&#8217;t quite care about the
                lectures, he figured it was a good time to look for some preys since there were so many disciples
                attending the lecture.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, he heard Yue Mingkong&#8217;s bland question, to which he
                leisurely replied, &#8220;Perhaps she knows who I really am and is trying to figure out how to expose
                me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing right beside him, Yue Mingkong doubtfully asked, &#8220;Really? I
                wouldn&#8217;t have come to that judging from her expression.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two Successors of Mortal Palace, Wang Zijin, the Gifted Lady of the Wang
                Family, and Jiang Chuchu. In her past life, Yue Mingkong had never met Wang Zijin. Nonetheless, she knew
                that Wang Zijin was only a pawn to Gu Changge, hence wasn&#8217;t bothered by her presence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, for the other Successor, in her previous life, had almost
                succeeded in exposing Gu Changge&#8217;s identity. Currently, the way that Successor was staring at Gu
                Changge seemed to suggest that she discovered something. Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s expression was complicated
                and evasive, as though she didn&#8217;t want to be noticed by Gu Changge, and that drew Yue
                Mingkong&#8217;s confusion and suspicion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But since the Mortal One is now gone, the Successors of Mortal Palace are no
                longer an issue.] Arriving at that idea, Yue Mingkong was finally at ease.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Are you worried that I have done something to
                her?&#8221; Gu Changge turned to Yue Mingkong with a look of intrigue and asked. Although Jiang Chuchu
                and Wang Zijin were in the Immortal Academy, he had no intentions of approaching them since they were of
                no use to him now.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from their uselessness, their Fortuity was also in no way more
                important than that of Sky King Zhi Yang. Be it Wang Zijin or Jiang Chuchu, there was no need for Gu
                Changge to spend too much time on them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Definitely possible.&#8221; Yue Mingkong did not deny the possibility
                of what Gu Changge mentioned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Gu Changge chuckled. &#8220;She&#8217;s the Successor of the
                Mortal Palace. Do I even have the capabilities to do anything to her?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, Yue Mingkong wouldn&#8217;t believe his nonsense. In fact,
                the way he answered must mean that something indeed had happened between him and Jiang Chuchu. Still,
                even if she knew that, Yue Mingkong did not pursue the matter any further.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, she finished investigating the siblings, Qing Xiaoyi and Qingfeng,
                and discovered their cultivation habits as well as the fact that they received guidance from the many
                Elders by their side. Thus, she would need to wait for a more timely opportunity to seize the Flask of
                World Domination in Qing Feng&#8217;s possession. Besides, she wasn&#8217;t quite informed of Gu
                Changge&#8217;s scheme, though Gu Changge seemingly was still focused on making Ying Shuang his
                scapegoat without any other plans in his mind.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time later, the lecture of the Elder on the stage ended while young
                prodigies were still drowned in astonishment.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Half a month later, Immortal Academy shall hold its first trial since
                enrollment, which shall determine the resources delivered for each disciple. Simultaneously, Elders will
                also pick their disciples based on the trial.&#8221; The Elder made an announcement instead of leaving
                right away.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since most of the young prodigies just entered the Immortal Academy, they
                were grouped by their cultivation levels, but their cultivation levels were by no means equivalent to
                their actual combat abilities, hence the trial was created.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the news, many were dazed before getting exhilarated about it. As young
                cultivators, competition was absolutely essential since making a name was their very goal. In fact,
                prior to that, they had been frustrated as they had no means to display their abiltiies. At last, the
                trial, the very opportunity for them to flaunt their skills, came.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the commencement of the first trial in half a month, words speedily
                spread, causing major turmoil all over the world. Thereupon, young prodigies began their preparations,
                wishing to drop the jaw of their audience during the trial in fifteen days. Even the Ranked Disciples
                were inclusive in making preparations for the sake of the trial.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although they haven&#8217;t disclosed how the trial will proceed, it
                sure is another timely opportunity for me.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze fell upon a mountain far away,
                where purple steam vaporised. There, a man in purple stood, resembling a purple miniature sun, seemingly
                extraordinary and nobly heroic. That man was none other than Sky King Zhi Yang himself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long ago, Gu Changge sent his men to look into his origin. His original
                name was Zhi Yang and he was born in Purple Mansion, an Immortal Sect. Furthermore, he wasn&#8217;t an
                individual of the current era, but a young prodigy of an even older generation. He once triumphed over
                his peers and became the champion of the world, and since then, he sealed himself, only it was not until
                recently that he returned to the outside world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theoretically, Sky King Zhi Yang shouldn&#8217;t bear any connection with Gu
                Xianer, but upon the investigation of his origins, Gu Changge found out that on the day Sky King Zhi
                Yang was born, dense purple energy surged thirty thousand kilometres around him. Moreover, he was born
                with a mysterious Dao Bone and terrifying Talents. He was also far more mature than his peers.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Born with wisdom and a mysterious Dao Bone, huh? Gu Xianer was born with a
                Dao bone as well…] Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes grew strange as various thoughts flashed across his mind.
                Although such an event was rare, it wasn&#8217;t unfamiliar to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s previous life, he might have something to do
                with Gu Xianer. In this life, if I had not seized Gu Xianer&#8217;s Dao Bone, she might have experienced
                some kind of awakening, and regain some of her past life’s memories.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, here&#8217;s another weird side to Gu Xianer. Just what is she? Some
                kind of boss in her previous life?] Gu Changge&#8217;s grin grew enthralling. With all sorts of
                adversities coming at him, it was as though the gods loved opposing him, treating him with deep malice.
                Though, since his prey presented itself, he could only accept it with a smile.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[System, Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s characteristics fit those of a Fortuitous
                One, and his Fortuity is high enough as well, but why hasn&#8217;t a relevant mission been triggered?]
                Gu Changge asked the System in him, as he was rather concerned and curious about the matter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By right, a being like Sky King Zhi Yang is supposedly considered as a
                regressor and a Fortuitous One. Nonetheless, he&#8217;s certainly a rare one, compared to the
                unremarkable, insignificant Fortuitous Ones I have met. Is that the reason?] Gu Changge
                pondered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatically, the System replied, &lt;Fortuity of Sky King Zhi Yang was
                insufficient to trigger a System mission. As of late, Fortuity levels have been fluctuating, thus the
                number of individuals with high Fortuity rose. The Fortuitous One to trigger the mission is someone
                else.&gt;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Someone else?] Gu Changge contemplated with a scowl. [Now that the System
                gave such an obvious hint, it must mean that the so-called Fortuitous One must be nearby. In other
                words, in the Immortal Academy?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Wondrous Stone from Nine Realms?] Swiftly, Gu Changge locked in on his
                target. After all, other than the Wondrous Stone, the Fortuity of other young prodigies were nowhere
                close to that of a Fortuitous Ones. Even Prince Shen, Jin Chan the Chosen Monk, and the Phoenix Lady
                merely possessed high Fortuity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Perhaps he&#8217;s a formidable being that came from Nine Realms?]
                Gu Changge slightly shook his head. Essentially, a person playing the role of a pig eating the tiger. An
                act he was too familiar with.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The man that came out of the Wondrous Stone must not be merely in the
                Enlightened Noble Realm, but most likely a terrifyingly daunting expert. He makes himself seem ordinary,
                to the point he would draw in mockery and condescension.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If this follows the usual cliches, he should be someone of this world, and
                due to some accident, he fell into Nine Realms and was stuck in it for years before sealing himself
                within the Wondrous Stone, only to resurface now…] Gu Changge&#8217;s grin grew intriguing as he
                assiduously analysed the situation and quickly identified Qin Wuya&#8217;s origin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And now, things have become much simpler. Return of a formidable expert,
                huh? This typically happens to a returning immortal emperor, who finds his daughter living in a shithole
                and then summons out millions of divine soldiers to crush and&#8230;] </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Gu Changge knew he was not going to meet this co-called ‘immortal
                emperor&#8217; like the one in that novel. Nonetheless, the key point which he kept in mind, was that
                the strength of this mysterious man should not be underestimated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;*Ding!* &#8216;The Returning One,&#8217; Fortuitous One triggered. The
                great senior that returned from Nine Realms.&gt; At that moment, after Gu Changge sorted his thoughts
                out, the System, as he expected, notified him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A great senior from Nine Realms?] Gu Changge tensed his brows. He then
                questioned, [Is that all the System is going to give me as a hint?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* Right when Gu Changge was finished, a familiar sensation occurred
                as a vision popped up before his eyes. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the grand gates, an ancient writing of &#8216;Borderless Sect&#8217; was
                written, seemingly magical and ancient. Although the ancient writing wasn&#8217;t of this era, Gu
                Changge could immediately discern it, after which he grew baffled as he was reminded of
                something.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, Senior Wuya has disappeared for so long. There won&#8217;t be
                any good news. Please… just grieve with us…&#8221; In front of the gates, a young disciple in a purple
                robe bitterly stated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Impossible! Wuya&#8217;s Soul Lamp has yet to extinguish. There is no
                way he&#8217;s dead. He must be trapped somewhere. He will return, and I shall wait here until he comes
                back!&#8221; A steady, unaffected Elder shook his head in response. His eyes were full of determination
                as he wouldn&#8217;t believe what the disciple said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Qin Wuya was his favourite disciple, and he was also his foster
                parent. Qin Wuya was calm and mature, shouldering the responsibility of restoring the Borderless Sect,
                so there was no way he would vanish without reason.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father, if Senior Wuya is unharmed, he will return for sure. Please do
                not worry,&#8221; a gentle woman with perfect features advised the Elder. However, when Qin Wuya&#8217;s
                name was mentioned, she couldn&#8217;t help but feel sorrowful and depressed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even without Senior Wuya, we still have Junior Sister Dao Xian. Master
                and Senior Sister should not be so dejected. I believe that Senior Wuya&#8217;s good heart will be
                recognised by the gods. He will be fine,&#8221; the young disciple in purple robe hastily added,
                amending his statement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, the Elder shook his head and heaved a sigh as he turned his gaze to
                somewhere far away. There, a woman in green covered in celestial energy, was sitting on a boulder. Her
                face was calm; no traces of emotions to be seen as she was focused on cultivating.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dao Xian certainly never disappoints me…&#8221; Relief and
                satisfaction surged in the Elder&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* All of a sudden, a deafening explosion thundered from a universe far
                away, leaving the three at the gates stunned. Quickly, the sky was torn apart, followed by a gargantuan
                rift, as if it was melting snow slowly dissolving. From the rift, a scenery of a war between Immortals
                occurred, and it was terrorizing to tremble the sky. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Immortal Palace, which stood in the centre of the borderless universe,
                instantly collapsed, turning into dust, an ancient being with an intimidating aura donning a golden
                crown was seen being hacked by a halberd and his blood uncontrollably splashed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is this… Immortals drenched in blood, an Immortal Palace brought
                to ruin, and an great Immortal dead…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, everyone was dumbfounded as their hopelessness, dread, and shock
                were written on their faces. In the vision, an absolutely frightening giant hand surrounded by
                unimaginably dense demonic energy was visible, as if it came from a universe infinitely far away,
                wreaking havoc, obliterating all worlds. Even the legendary River of Time was shredded into
                pieces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innumerable factions and races were disintegrated at the blow of the giant
                palm, as million lives were instantaneously lost. The palm of annihilation destroyed all lives of every
                single realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vision then ended.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having seen that, Gu Changge remained unaffected.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Borderless Sect? No wonder I could understand the ancient writing. So
                it was from the epoch that sank in the River of Time…&#8221; He muttered to himself upon realisation
                thanks to the System&#8217;s hint.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman that was concentrating on cultivation on the green boulder must be
                Gu Xianer in her previous life, while the young disciple in purple was obviously Sky King Zhi Yang. And
                as for the missing Senior Wuya, he must be the man who fell into Nine Realms and reappeared from the
                Wondrous Stone. In that instant, everything became connected.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I believe the System&#8217;s hints are actually dug out from my subconscious
                memories. Hell, the System&#8217;s origin might even be related to it.] Gu Changge quickly arrived at
                another inference.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Judging from my memories, the Demon Lord&#8217;s devastation of worlds was
                inescapable. Still, his motives for doing so aren’t really that important. The more pressing issue is
                those clones of his that had come to this current era. Troublesome. No wonder Lao Shi, who holds a
                grudge against him, is still so frightened of him.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pretty sure the final boss of the Forbidden Epoch was the Demon Lord
                himself. Yet, as the River of Time flows, none dared to speak of his name. Meanwhile, Borderless
                Sect&#8217;s destruction was only collateral damage. After all, who&#8217;d ever care about a stepped-on
                bug?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the vision, Gu Changge sensed a tremble deep within his soul, as if
                something within his memories was about to awaken. Even the Eight Barren Demon Halberd grew lively and
                excited, shivering in his storage space.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is to come will eventually come. For I am the Demon Lord,&#8221;
                Gu Changge softly stated as he felt his Demonic Heart palpitating before slowly calming down.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, as his body flickered, he transformed into a divine rainbow and
                left to prepare for his next plan. The harvesting of the Fortuitous One was a must. However, since this
                was the ‘The Returning One’ archetype, it would be more troublesome.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Dealing with Sky King Zhi Yang should be easy, but unfortunately, he is no
                fool and is patient enough to refrain from starting any conflict with me. So, it is impossible for me to
                engage him without any good reason. Even if I can defeat him, the Elders of the Immortal Academy and the
                Purple Mansion behind Sky King Zhi Yang, wouldn&#8217;t allow me to go any further than that.]</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As usual, I still need to approach the matter with righteousness. I can
                carry the flag of justice and disclose his intentions to the public in the name of justice so none would
                be able to stop me. And of course, I can dirty his name by dragging him to have some kind of
                relationship with the Successor of Demonic Arts. This would strip Purple Mansion&#8217;s protection from
                him.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After listening to the lecture, Gu Xianer hurried back to her cultivation
                cave while still carrying a face of epiphany. Only when she saw Gu Changge was leaving in the opposite
                direction to where she was headed, did she leave the cave.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late, she had been avoiding Gu Changge, not wanting to meet him, while
                Gu Changge was even more straightforward as he had no intentions of entertaining her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, despite feeling relieved, Gu Xianer couldn&#8217;t help but feel
                disaffected and somewhat angry at Gu Changge. She clearly got what she wanted, but for some reason, she
                felt as though she was at a loss.</span></p>

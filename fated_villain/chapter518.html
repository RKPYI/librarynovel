        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Mountain Elder thought of a lot in that instant. The clans of the
                Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were now as scattered as a lump of sand, and there was no way they
                could rebel against Gu Changge and the Upper Realm.</span><span id="more-31323"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of Gu Changge&#8217;s true purpose, the Supreme Mountain Elder
                could easily take advantage of it as well as the people&#8217;s hearts in order to amass an even greater
                force. Or else, rescuing Luo Feng would be an unattainable dream.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In this case, we shall adapt to his scheme. No harm in attending a banquet
                with my strength, after all] Thinking that, the Supreme Mountain Elder came up with a strategy of his
                own.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that many powerful figures were currently gathered in Colossal Palace
                City, it was a fine opportunity for him to reveal himself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Supreme Mountain Elder, do you plan to attend Gu Changge&#8217;s
                conference banquet?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clueless to the Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s thoughts, Xiao Yang was rather
                concerned. Essentially, Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t specifically call out for the Supreme Mountain Elder
                without a good reason. Even a blind man could see something was off about it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, the matter wasn&#8217;t necessarily related to the Supreme
                Mountain Elder as he could withdraw himself any time. After all, there wasn&#8217;t a solid bond between
                the Second Mountain Elder and the Supreme Mountain Elder, which his mentor disclosed to him early
                on.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fret not. This old one knows his limit.&#8221; The Supreme Mountain
                Elder didn&#8217;t reveal much. Without an explanation, he then walked out from the corner towards the
                influential figures that were having a discussion nearby.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Xiao Yang grew joyous to know what the Supreme Mountain
                Elder&#8217;s choice was. As such, astoundment arose in his heart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Gu Changge&#8217;s evil intent and the fact that the banquet he
                invited the leaders of Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains to might be a trap he set up, the Supreme
                Mountain Elder wasn&#8217;t bothered in the slightest, charging into the lion&#8217;s den in spite of
                the lion&#8217;s presence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y—You are…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The influential figures were discussing about the invitation to Sky Deer City
                for the banquet half a month later. They were visibly troubled as they couldn&#8217;t come to a solution
                for this ‘trap’. That was until the Supreme Mountain Elder walked towards them, stunning all of them at
                once. They didn&#8217;t even detect that someone else was hiding among them in their vicinity.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were in the Sacred Emperor Realm, yet they couldn&#8217;t sense the
                presence of this old man.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shocked, they grew wary as they peered at the approaching Supreme Mountain
                Elder.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A blind old man. Perhaps… Perhaps…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them noticed the Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s face and furrowed his
                brows as though he remembered something. There were not a lot of blind men who possessed such a
                fathomless cultivation level.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, lightning zoomed across his mind as he recalled something.
                His face immediately paled as he couldn&#8217;t contain his stupefaction. He stuttered with his
                trembling voice, &#8220;Y—You are…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Mountain Elder retained his serene expression and gently nodded
                without saying a word.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the other influential figures suddenly remembered him and
                their faces instantaneously reddened as they were extremely thrilled. Despite their cultivation levels,
                they couldn&#8217;t help but tremble, and that clearly showed how immense their excitement was.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Great! I&#8217;ve always assumed that your resurgence was fake news.
                No wonder Gu Changge would say such a thing. To think you have really returned!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They instantly spoke to the Supreme Mountain Elder with utmost sternness and
                deference. After all, he was the person who established Nine Great Mountains. No words could describe
                his current extraordinary position in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. In their eyes, he was no
                different from an actual Immortal.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This old one knows of the current situation in Eight Wastelands and
                Ten Domains. Since Gu Changge bears no good intent and set up the trap banquet, this old one shall tend
                to it.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Mountain Elder appeared absolutely extraordinary and energetic in
                his white robe. Although he was blind, his aura forbade anyone from belittling him. As he calmly spoke,
                his tone indicated his indifference towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, everyone grew exhilarated at once as their emotions and
                excitement grew overwhelmingly out of control. Now that the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were
                haunted by such dark times, the Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s standing up for them became
                indispensable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We gladly serve Supreme Mountain Elder!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, they were no longer hesitant nor worried, chanting with
                their reverent faces. After all, if the Supreme Mountain Elder himself was helpless, then the Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains would be unsalvageable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very well. In that case, when Sky Deer City turns into the
                lion&#8217;s den half a month later, we shall charge towards it and see what Gu Changge is
                hiding.&#8221; Satisfied by the attitude of the crowd, the Supreme Mountain Elder subconsciously
                nodded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that time, he contacted various forces, and also united the remaining
                three of the original four War God Clans. Thus, the Vermilion Bird War God Clan, the White Tiger War God
                Clan, and the Black Tortoise War God Clan finally gather their power.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, he would have an escape route even if Gu Changge were to plot
                against him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, news about the Supreme Mountain Elder of Nine Great
                Mountain&#8217;s appearance was spread from Colossal Palace City to numerous clans at lightning speed,
                It caused major commotions as the supreme expert of various clans quickly gathered to discuss the
                matter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their opinion, Gu Changge&#8217;s invitation to the leaders of various
                clans to Sky Deer City for a truce in half a month was definitely suspicious and not worth trusting.
                Hence, they were discussing whether or not to attend it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, now that the Supreme Mountain Elder appeared and planned to accept
                the invitation, they grew excited and without much hesitation, they expressed their willingness to offer
                their lives to aid him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge&#8217;s words were genuine, then it would naturally be a good
                cause to restore precious peace to Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains; if Gu Changge&#8217;s words were
                lies, they would be insured with the Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s presence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, in the eyes of innumerable people from the Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains, the Supreme Mountain Elder was no different from an Immortal.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it had been countless years since he last showed himself, now that
                Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains was in trouble, on the verge of perishing, he voluntarily came to fight
                the odds. Therefore, to many, he was their very last hope.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, those Domains and Wastelands that had yet to fall grew excited.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Upper Realm Army ceased their offencive solely to cooperate with Gu
                Changge&#8217;s commandment.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in Sky Deer City, many Ancestors from Immortal Forces or Supreme
                Forces gathered with slight disaffection on their faces. Naturally, they were informed of Gu
                Changge&#8217;s commandment and invitation to the various clans across Eight Wastelands and Ten
                Domains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since that was Gu Changge&#8217;s personal matter, they remained neutral
                about it, but now that he demanded them to cooperate with him and put their troops on hold, they grew
                somewhat dissatisfied. After all, it was a crucial moment for them to take over the Great Domains, so it
                was unreasonable for them to stop their conquest now.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were waiting to thoroughly invade the territories of the Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains in order to look for the answer as to why there hadn&#8217;t been anyone who
                could step into the Immortal Realm. It was of top priority to them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it weren&#8217;t for the fact that Gu Changge&#8217;s power was at least
                on par with them as well as his great contributions to the war that turned out unquestionably helpful,
                they wouldn&#8217;t be so amiable as they were now.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sipping on his tea, Gu Changge calmly stated, &#8220;The clans of the Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains will gather here half a month later. Is that not the perfect opportunity to
                take them down in one fell swoop? Why do you upset yourself with such trivial delays?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind him, a number of people stood, including the True Daoists of the
                Immortal Gu Family, as well as the Sky Deer Goddess, Ni Shang, and the Bone Ancestor.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Ni Shang and the Bone Ancestor did not reveal their faces, but
                their auras alone were enough to intimidate the other forces, preventing them from speaking
                disrespectfully.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, you are indeed right, but how can you ensure
                that all of the leaders of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains will surely come half a month
                later?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Ancestor from Sky Emperor Mountain asked. Judging by his face, he seemed
                to be of the Dragon Race, but there was a phoenix feather on his forehead, and he was much stronger than
                the average True Daoists.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, his words received the agreement from the rest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s plan was quite simple, but the clans of the Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains could not be foolish enough to all attend the banquet, knowing it was a
                trap.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the rest couldn&#8217;t see Gu Changge&#8217;s plan
                succeeding.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, they will all come.&#8221; Gu Changge briefly answered without an
                explanation. There was not a change in his expression. &#8220;Moreover, if you think your extensive
                search will lead you to what you are looking for, then you may have been wasting your
                time.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, do you perhaps know something that we
                don&#8217;t?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancestor of the Immortal Wang Family uncontrollably asked out of
                curiosity, knowing that Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t say such words without a good reason, so the latter
                obviously knew of something else.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the other Ancestors of the different Forces revealed faces of
                bafflement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nothing like that. However, since the Second Mountain Elder of Nine
                Great Mountains and an individual from the Family of Protectors are in my hands, they will surely come
                for their rescue.&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled and turned to the outside of the palace before giving an
                instruction to the servant behind him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, blaring sounds thundered as a number of prisoner wagons—covered in
                daunting, blinding runes amid surging World Principles—were being dragged over. Within, there were the
                Second Mountain Elder, Luo Feng, and Luo Ying.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except for the Second Mountain Elder, who was sitting with his eyes shut as
                though he was a boulder, unbothered by the situation of the outside world, Luo Feng and Luo Ying were
                visibly distressed, unable to unshackle themselves from the cuffs binding their hands and legs.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one were to exert a little force, the power of the runes in the wagon
                would seep into them and torment them with unbearable pain.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, the Ancestors seemed somewhat weirded out. Some of them even
                once shared a moment with the Second Mountain Elder, but they never expected that he would be subdued
                and imprisoned by Gu Changge after the destruction of the Nine Great Mountains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Luo Feng and Luo Ying, they didn&#8217;t know of them nor could they
                recognise them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, judging by Gu Changge&#8217;s tone, one of them must be the
                descendant of the Family of Protectors.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My important guests, of course.&#8221; Gu Changge faintly grinned and
                uncuffed the three prisoners in the wagons before releasing them right in front of the crowd.
                Nevertheless, since their cultivation power was sealed, they had no chance of escaping from the group of
                True Daoists before them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It appears Young Master Changge has everything under his control. We
                have certainly been anxious for nothing.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, the True Daoists, being no idiots, understood Gu Changge&#8217;s
                purpose and heaved a sigh of relief as their fear towards Gu Changge&#8217;s methods deepened.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, what are you playing at now?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being a prisoner now, Luo Feng, the former Ancestor of Wind, remained
                a prideful man. He knew that the reason Gu Changge didn&#8217;t kill him was because he wanted to know
                about his secrets. Therefore, as long as his secrets were unexposed, he would be safe and his life
                wouldn&#8217;t be endangered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Luo Ying, who was beside him, bore unconcealable fear
                towards Gu Changge. In spite of her unwavering resentment, she was merely a young woman at the end of
                the day. Besides, in the room, everyone other than Gu Changge were also ancient monsters that had lived
                for millenia.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hurry not. You will get to meet your old friends very soon.&#8221; Gu
                Changge gently blew the steam on his tea and serenely spoke with a subtle grin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Old friend? What are you talking about?&#8221; Luo Feng&#8217;s heart
                skipped a beat. The only old friends he had were those of his generation and nobody else. As such, he
                grew somewhat restless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ll get to see that little brother of yours very soon as
                well.&#8221; Gu Changge turned to Luo Ying without an explanation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My brother…&#8221; Luo Ying&#8217;s face blanched as her body shivered
                in fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was safe to say that the person she was most reluctant to see at this
                moment was her young brother, whom she had never met.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, half a month passed by in the blink of an eye. Divine rainbows
                penetrated the land and sky, quaking the world as they rose from various regions across the Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains towards Sky Deer City.</span></p>

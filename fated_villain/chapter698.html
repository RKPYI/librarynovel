        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It looks like the Ruler of Neraka has no plans to show up even now.&#8221; Gu Changge let his divine sense scan the ancient world below, filled with brutality. </span><span id="more-36161"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides a few who had died or been captured, the other Palace Lords had all become loyal to him without much hindrance. Naturally, several True Daoists had been too proud and refused to yield, so their consciousnesses were wiped by Gu Changge and they became True Daoist Puppets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had gained a lot during the extermination of Neraka. The number of True Daoists serving him had increased by several times. Ah Da was also on the verge of a major breakthrough to the Nirvana Realm after consuming so many remnant Sources. Gu Changge had even given him a drop of True Blood, which would allow him to break through his bottleneck.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Gu Changge, the most important thing right now was to remove the obstacle known as Neraka. As for Pagoda? It wasn&#8217;t within his consideration since the extinction of Neraka meant that Pagoda wasn&#8217;t worth his attention.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This will be Neraka&#8217;s final stand. We will eliminate Neraka today!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ancient battleships rumbled across the sky, flags from different Forces waving in the air and spreading out with an intimidating air. Everyone was screaming as they charged forwards, transforming into an unstoppable army, which shook the world and swept the land. The terrifying force resembled a river which had overrun its banks and its might was unimaginable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone agreed that Neraka was destined for extinction since nine out of its ten Palaces had been destroyed. Only the Third Palace stubbornly held up on its own. Of course, the remaining experts of Neraka were all gathered there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even if you can exterminate us, you will have to pay a heavy price.&#8221; Many Sacred Emperors Realm experts stood in front of the ruined ancient world and coldly watched the arriving ancient battleships. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were the remaining core force in Neraka and were also the strongest experts aside from True Daoists and Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts. They rushed towards the beams of divine light and countless experts with angry roars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their bodies exuded powerful beams of light. Even if they were assassins, they maintained their humanity and would never surrender easily. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billions of divine light beams shone and wove together like brilliant fireworks, which made those smaller worlds to collapse without making any noise. Deep within the sky, Nirvana Grade Artifacts hovered like the sun, emanating countless wisps of Chaos Qi which made everything collapse. It was an extremely gory battle, with blood and bone exploding and transforming into a sea of blood. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heavy scent was enough to make anyone faint.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The calls shook the universe as great armies invaded the innermost area of the world. No assassin managed to escape since it was a battle to the death. The Upper Realm Forces were all determined to get rid of this evil organization. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">War torches illuminated the sky and blood dyed the ground red as the world began to collapse. Its barriers began to break and cracks appeared on it. While the world was ancient, it couldn&#8217;t stand the shockwaves from so many experts and was on the verge of collapse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rest in peace, my Ancestors. We shall eliminate Neraka today and get back your corpses so you can finally rest.&#8221; Many invaders had eyes filled with rage as they screamed, trying to express the hatred they had always felt for Neraka. After all, even their relatives had been killed by Neraka aside from their Ancestors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neraka did not care for morals and loyalty. They would kill their brothers or fathers for the right price. The infighting among many Forces all secretly involved Neraka, so the Upper Realm considered assassin guilds like Neraka and Pagoda tumours which should have been eliminated way earlier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people deeply hated the other party. Battle shouts shook the sky while shockwaves spread across the battlefield, causing many islands, mountains, and ancient palaces to fall apart and disintegrate. How could Neraka defend itself against such a formidable army?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world was quaking as billions of soldiers moved across the sky like an army, which could not be stopped. The assassins of Neraka screamed as they fought back but they were eventually killed in droves as if they were mere weed, trampled on by the overwhelming army.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who is this person from Neraka?&#8221; Gu Changge suddenly spotted a tall figure emerging from the depths of the world and became intrigued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, that is the Third Palace Lord.&#8221; explained a Palace Lord who had surrendered to him respectfully from behind him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Third Palace Lord? So, there’s only one left?&#8221; Gu Changge was already curious as to what the Third Palace Lord was holding out for. Were there any other tactics which Neraka hadn&#8217;t shown yet? Was he hoping for the Ruler of Neraka to finally take action. Though, it was likely he was hiding something?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant the Third Lord of Neraka appeared, blinding light suddenly expelled from his palm. A powerful aura emanated like an eternal cloud which penetrated the skies and went into the depths of the universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rays of light splashed out as traces of the Great Dao appeared. The aura was all-encompassing and overwhelming. It was like a small world had exploded, and the energy was extremely powerful and blinding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Palm of True World… So, a Small Godly Spirit World has been refined.] Gu Changge raised his eyebrows, completely not expecting evidence of its existence here. After all, Godly Spirits weren&#8217;t those that achieved their god status from cultivating. Rather, they were born with such a status. Naturally, their strength surpassed even True Daoists. Such were Innate Godly Spirits, born naturally from the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a certain viewpoint, a Small Godly Spirit World was unfathomable. If given time, it could evolve into a divine land such that as long as the Godly Spirit isn’t dead, the world would be Immortal and continue to live on. It was somewhat similar to Gu Changge&#8217;s Inner Universe. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Third Palace Lord displayed his Palm of True World, the collapsing ancient world seemed to become much more stable. It was as if mysterious forces were slowly soaking through it and repairing the cracks on it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An obscure yet sacred aura was now making its appearance, with rays of light raining down and blooming within the void. They spread out to form blood-coloured vines, which absorbed the blood and Sources littered everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The aura of the world has changed. Is this the remaining card Neraka can play? To attract everyone here and trap them before killing them all?] Gu Changge frowned after he noticed this. A strange feeling was rising within him. He felt as if something had gone wrong. He felt like he had somewhat underestimated how cruel Neraka could be. In some ways, their methods matched his thinking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why do I sense that the aura of this world is changing and its Principles are no longer as distinct as before?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several True Daoists from various Forces, who were standing in the sky, and hadn&#8217;t wielded their abilities yet, also began to feel suspicious. Their expressions shifted before they expanded their divine sense to scan the surrounding area in search of the source of the obscure aura. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many soldiers who were engaged in battle were forced to pause as well, feeling as if they had fallen into quicksand and could not move at all. It was as if the space surrounding them had become a thick pool of blood, which emanate an oppressive aura and a gory scent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha ha ha. You overconfident trash. Do you think having so many people will be effective against us? All of you shall accompany Neraka to the grave. Did you think we hadn&#8217;t prepared for this eventuality during our years in hiding? Laughable! Even if you eliminate Neraka, a second or third one will emerge. We shall never be exterminated. You are all merely tools to Gu Changge. Did you think Nephrite Breeze Pavilion has no connection to him at all? After our extinction, Nephrite Breeze Pavilion will follow in our footsteps. Foolish bastards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cold laugh came from the tallest palace, in the deepest part of Neraka, sweeping through the entire land. The remaining True Daoists aside from the Third Palace Lord all showed themselves. While they were few in number, they all bore an astounding savage auras. They resembled cold and terrifying evil gods which had already killed billions. They glanced at the attacking forces from the Upper Realm with unconcealed mocking. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neraka’s foundation, in essence, was no different from a common ancient world. It was just that after fresh blood and brave soul had fallen within the void, the ancient runes inscribed in the world could be used. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Third Palace Lord&#8217;s Palm of True World hadn&#8217;t belonged to anyone else but the mysterious Ruler of Neraka. When it completely melded with the ancient world, the survival of all the beings who had set foot within it would be determined by the Ruler of Neraka. This was why Neraka had dared to let the cults and factions pay a heavy price. After all, the Ruler of Neraka was actually an Ancient Godly Spirit, who had lived since time in memorial.</span></p>

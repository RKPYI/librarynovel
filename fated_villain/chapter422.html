          eventually arrived at a tranquil courtyard. Surrounded by basic

          beating. Her face subtly changed as her eyes twitched; even her body
          was slightly trembling out of her overwhelming emotions. Nonetheless,
          to prevent others from detecting her unusualness, she swiftly
          recovered from her daze.</span

          Although she couldn&#8217;t feel anything off about him, her intuition
          could discern that he was more than meets the eye. Essentially, an
          individual with a fractured Spiritual Sea wouldn&#8217;t be this

          possibly be, she would always stand by Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s

          hope you don&#8217;t regret it in the future,&#8221; Li Xiu casually

          attitude, and how she was willing to limit her future despite carrying
          the will to achieve the Great Dao.</span

          turning around to observe Saintess Yao Yue. Upon a moment of
          contemplation, he came to a realisation. &#8220;You were looking for
          me? Odd, you seem familiar… Ah, so it is you.&#8221;</span

          >Hearing that, Saintess Yao Yue began to lose control of her
          excitement. Unable to compose herself as she did before, she spoke
          with a shivering voice, &#8220;Yao Yue of Blazing Moon Holy Land

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Some time ago, the ancestor of Blazing Moon Holy Land suddenly
          reawakened and summoned a number of heirs who carried his bloodline to
          have them locate a certain being after showing them a portrait of this
          person.</span

          questioning, was enlightened by the identity of this person, after
          which she found herself stupefied and awestruck at the same time.
          Never once had she expected Blazing Moon Holy Land to possess a
          background of such depth.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Coincidentally, she overheard the Shen Family members&#8217;
          description of Li Xiu&#8217;s physical characteristics, which felt
          quite similar to the features of the one in the portrait, which led
          her to visit the Shen Family Residence today.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had now discovered that the ‘useless in-law of the Shen Family’
          turned out to be the same individual in the portrait. As such, she
          grew extremely thrilled, unable to contain her excitement.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that, Shen Xian&#8217;er revealed a scowl as she was unable to
          comprehend Saintess Yao Yue&#8217;s actions. Judging by the
          latter&#8217;s identity in Heavenly Tide Realm, she shouldn&#8217;t
          have to be so polite to Li Xiu. Thus, Shen Xian&#8217;er
          couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether Li Xiu had been hiding an alter
          ego from them, though despite knowing that, she didn&#8217;t feel the
          slightest remorse.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Instead, she felt rather liberated, following the voided marriage
          arrangement. Be it Li Xiu or any other man, she was no longer bound to
          anyone else from now on, and it didn&#8217;t matter to her who Li Xiu
          truly was.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, Gu Xianer had been observing the exchange wordlessly with
          her stone cold eyes. She knew something was up with how Saintess Yao
          Yue came all the way to look for Li Xiu out of nowhere, and
          apparently, she came with an ulterior motive.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[So Li Xiu carries with him such an identity, not that it matters how
          mysterious his alter ego may be. As long as the marriage agreement is
          terminated, Xian’er no longer has to be constricted by it.] And so, Gu
          Xianer felt remarkably relieved as nothing else was worth her
          concern.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          occurrence before them, he instinctively furrowed his brows as he
          snickered. &#8220;A surprise, indeed. Never have I expected to be
          belittled to such an extent in my life. How fascinating.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          which she had been keeping on her all this time, and was about to tear
          it apart. Nevertheless, upon Li Xiu&#8217;s words, she and Gu Xianer
          intuitively tensed their brows, revolted by how Li Xiu was so full of
          himself.

          truly are. They are undeserving of you. They shall regret it one day.
          Instead, why don&#8217;t you return to Blazing Moon Holy Land with me?
          It was my Ancestor who asked for your search and he is looking forward
          to meeting with you.&#8221;</span

          >With that, Saintess Yao Yue hastily spoke as the nobleness of a
          Saintess she feigned earlier vanished. Now, she was nothing but
          obsequious as, to Li Xiu, every word of hers was expressed with
          extreme deference.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Shen Xian&#8217;er, if I were you, I&#8217;d apologise to
          Master Zhan right away. Otherwise, you&#8217;d be sorry for what your
          Elders are about to blame you for. Master Zhan&#8217;s identity
          exceeds whatever you are capable of imagining. The Shen Family should
          be honoured for his three-year stay. Not only did you fail to
          appreciate the marriage arrangement between you and Master Zhan, but
          now you intend to destroy it. I feel nothing but pity for you. In
          fact, Master Zhan wouldn&#8217;t have batted an eye had someone else
          offered him everything in their position. Yet, you chose to forgo the
          privilege bequeathed upon you.&#8221;</span

          >Simultaneously, Saintess Yao Yue glanced at the marriage contract in
          Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s hands. She was no longer as courteous as
          she was back at the gates, and was even carrying scorn in her tone.
          After all, now that the mighty &#8216;Master Zhan&#8217; was by her
          side, all she had to do was please him and gain his favour and her
          future would be limitless.</span

          wordless. Although his mind wasn&#8217;t affected by the matter,
          thanks to the Shen Family, his frustration certainly accumulated over
          the years. Regardless, he inevitably experienced mortals&#8217;
          emotions as he was unable to thoroughly detach from them.</span

          by external stimuli, in that instant, she couldn&#8217;t help but be
          infuriated by Saintess Yao Yue&#8217;s words. Grasping the marriage
          contract in her delicate hands, she couldn&#8217;t decide whether to
          tear it apart.</span

          intervention, but Saintess Yao Yue&#8217;s condescending remarks

          extraordinary-looking Elder, whose hair and beard was as white as a

          behind his back as his face was concealed. He resembles a young god.
          Unstained, his garment was paler than snow. His hair glistened amid

          extremely enigmatic. Although he lost his Spiritual Sea and powers,
          his perception remained decently intact.</span

          about her. After all, she left the Gu Family Residence without telling
          a soul. She naturally had not expected Gu Changge to come to her
          personally, which she certainly found joyous about.</span

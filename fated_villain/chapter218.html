      <h4>
        Chapter 218-1: Taking the initiative to use it for yourself is
        equivalent to condoning the evil (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        When the whole Xuan Domain was in a commotion because of the arrival of
        the Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, in Taixu sect.</p>
      <p>
        Among the layers of pavilions, in the middle of the magnificent and tall
        hall.
      </p>
      <p>The atmosphere was serious and solemn.</p>
      <p>
        The current Sect Master and many Elders were gathered here, with a
        respectful expression on their faces, with a bit of curiosity and doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above them were several Old monsters who had emerged from seclusion
        after hearing the news.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, they were the incomparably powerful existences of
        Taixu Sect over the years, and they would not easily show up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, they were awakened by the shocked Sect Master and rushed to the
        main hall, wanting to preside over the entire situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the news was so shocking that they had to take it seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the main hall, there were outstanding disciples of the Taixu
        Sec’s current generation, young geniuses and other figures.
      </p>
      <p>They were equally curious and shocked.</p>
      <p>
        Looking at it, Gu Changge, who was closing his eyes and resting, had an
        unusually calm and indifferent expression as he didn't care about the
        outside world at all.
      </p>
      <p>With awe and wonder.</p>
      <p>"Is this the one who was rumored to be the Immortal?"</p>
      <p>
        "Aloof like he’s located in another world, and we are not on the same
        level."
      </p>
      <p>"It's terrifying. It's the first time I've seen such a character."</p>
      <p>A proud woman said with shock and yearning in her eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "This kind of existence is simply unfathomable, but just an inadvertent
        wisp of aura can make people unable to help but tremble. It is much more
        terrifying than when facing someone from the Sacred Realm at the
        beginning."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I am afraid that the Immortal has already heard about us and it was
        because of our Ancestors!"
      </p>
      <p>
        They were talking in a low voice, and when they heard the rumors, they
        were extremely shocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        A person who had friendship with the Ancestors from 800,000 years ago
        actually arrived at the Lower Realm in person and said that he would
        repay the favor.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was so amazing, they wouldn't even dare to imagine it if they hadn't
        seen it with their own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't pay any attention to these words of admiration,
        flattery.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, he kind of hoped that someone would jump up and question
        him at this time, so as not to make this boring and uninteresting.
      </p>
      <p>"Reporting to the Sect Master, this is the way things happened."</p>
      <p>
        In the hall, Zhao Wu looked excited, his voice trembled, as he reported
        everything that happened.
      </p>
      <p>He led the way for Gu Changge to Taixu Sect.</p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge didn't say anything on the way, he could feel that
        Gu Changge still appreciated him a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Zhao Wu spared no effort to tell and restore the scene when
        Gu Changge descended to the Lower Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one suspected that this was false, but, like Zhao Wu, they were
        equally excited.
      </p>
      <p>"I wonder what the name of the senior is?"</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the Sect Master of Taixu Sect also reacted quickly, and
        his voice trembled slightly.
      </p>
      <p>There was no doubt that Zhao Wu's words were true.</p>
      <p>
        The Ancestor of Taixu Sect was also a legendary figure, who left a
        splendid name in Xuan domain and even in the Heavenly Star Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        It must be a normal thing to be able to get to know someone like Gu
        Changge after flying up to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, even the old antiques behind him couldn't notice the depth of
        Gu Changge's cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>It could be seen that Gu Changge was powerful!</p>
      <p>This convinced him of his guess.</p>
      <p>"No need to talk about the title."</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge finally opened his eyes, his expression was
        flat with a hint of impatience.
      </p>
      <p>Between the words, he seemed very lonely and indifferent.</p>
      <p>
        He swept over everyone in the hall, and his gaze made the old antiques
        in the Sacred Realm feel heartbroken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their souls were trembling, and they couldn't help but take a few steps
        back, unable to bear this look.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention the rest of the people, who almost collapsed under this
        aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I will return the favor of Chu Taixu today. This is the cultivation
        method of Taixu's creation. It is the method that your Ancestors deduced
        with me that day. It was difficult for him to descend on the Lower
        Realm. Today, I will teach you this method for his sake."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said lightly with a calm expression on his face.</p>
      <p>
        The name Chu Taixu was what he saw when he entered the Taixu Sect and
        casually glanced at the magnificent statue on the square.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the routine, if there was no accident, this was the name of
        the Ancestor of Taixu Sect.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's nonsense was not without basis.</p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Then, with a wave of his hand, ancient golden runes suddenly appeared in
        the void in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that the vast and deep galaxy was constantly evolving and
        deducing.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing this scene, everyone in the hall held their breath.</p>
      <p>
        The young disciples outside the hall also widened their eyes and
        breathed faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        They really did not expect that this High Immortal would be so direct.
      </p>
      <p>
        An extremely precious scripture was directly displayed in front of
        everyone as it manifested in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, everyone stared at those ancient runes without blinking,
        trying to gain insight into its true meaning.
      </p>
      <p>"It's not as simple as… the Holy Scriptures…"</p>
      <p>
        "Contains the true meaning and mystery of transcending the Sacred
        Realm…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, an old antique of the Sacred Realm noticed the mystery, opened his
        eyes wide, and exclaimed in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>He was extremely excited.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, the rest of the people stared at it for a moment, for fear
        of something falling.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        They never doubted whether Gu Changge's words were true or not. After
        all, who would go through so much to come here, just to give this
        scripture.
      </p>
      <p>Unless there was a problem with their brain.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's attitude gave them a feeling of belief, but this was what
        they thought a superior person should have.
      </p>
      <p>
        And after giving this scripture, Gu Changge quietly closed his eyes
        again, no matter what, he didn't say much.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the eyes of everyone, this was the image of an Immortal, aloof,
        withdrawn and indifferent.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge's mind was filled with various thoughts, and he was very
        interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sentence was right, there was no free lunch in the world, and there
        was no big pie that would fall from the sky.
      </p>
      <p>The Taixu Creation Method was naturally something he named.</p>
      <p>The purpose was to deceive these idiots to practice it.</p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge's plan looked rough and simple, in fact, no flaws
        could be found in every step, even in the exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if it was a cultivator in the Quasi-Supreme Realm, at this time,
        they had to be recruited and practice this method obediently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, at this time, ordinary people would definitely not doubt
        anything as they would hold the attitude of benefiting and wanting it
        for nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in terms of control, this cultivation technique bestowed by Gu
        Changge was even more effective than slave seals.
      </p>
      <p>It was exactly the same as the Immortal Binding technique.</p>
      <p>
        The Taixu Sect had been passed down for hundreds of thousands of years,
        and it was deeply rooted. If Gu Changge wanted to occupy it directly, it
        would take a lot of effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he directly oppressed it by his own cultivation, it would inevitably
        arouse strong resistance, and it might even attract the attention of
        other forces at that time.
      </p>
      <p>That would be contrary to Gu Changge's original intention.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the purpose of his visit to the Lower Realm this time was
        mainly for the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, and before that, he
        had to keep a low profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was why he used this method to let Taixu Sect take the initiative
        to cultivate and use it for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, under Gu Changge's plan, everyone in the hall more or less noted
        down this scripture.
      </p>
      <p>The same was true for many young disciples outside the hall.</p>
      <p>His expression was calm, but he was actually sneering in his heart.</p>
      <p>
        The Sect Master of Taixu Sect was even more scheming. Hearing that this
        was deduced by their Ancestors and Gu Changge together, he immediately
        took action and traced it down, preparing it as an inheritance and
        leaving it for later disciples to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In just a short time, they already knew that the mystery of this
        cultivation technique far exceeded any cultivation technique they had
        practiced before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge also didn't seem to care about their general appearance,
        which made the Taixu Sect Master relieved.
      </p>
      <p>"Mr. Immortal is so kind, we are grateful."</p>
      <p>"We are grateful!"</p>
      <p>Soon in the hall, and even outside, such grateful voices sounded.</p>
      <p>
        They admired Gu Changge's act of personally bestowing the cultivation
        technique to the Lower Realm for the sake of a favor, thinking that this
        might be for the so-called Dao heart!
      </p>
      <p>
        "In this way, my favor with brother Taixu has been settled." Vissit
        novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge said with a fleeting and intriguing expression
        on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge lived at the highest peak of Taixu Sect with
        peace of mind, despite the intentional stay of the Sect Master of Taixu
        Sect and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        But within a few days, the control effect of this cultivation technique
        started to take effect, and the scope quickly enveloped the entire Taixu
        Sect, and even the Ancestor with the strongest cultivation base in the
        Taixu Sect was also involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivation of the Sacred Realm could simply sweep through the
        entire Xuan domain.
      </p>
      <p>Any one in the Great Sacred Realm was almost invincible!</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 218-2: Taking the initiative to use it for yourself is
        equivalent to condoning the evil (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        But without exception, they could not resist the temptation of this
        cultivation technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, in the entire Taixu Sect, except for those unqualified
        disciples who were not accessible, the rest began to practice this
        cultivation technique.
      </p>
      <p>This scene looked very similar to Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Wasn't this the case when he controlled the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan
        and other groups in the Ancient Immortal Continent?
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that the Elders and disciples of Taixu Sect had not noticed
        it at all. They were still excited, and they felt that there were signs
        of a breakthrough in their cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was slightly amused and did not choose a showdown.</p>
      <p>
        Then, he directly controlled the Sect Master of Taixu Sect through this
        cultivation technique, and ordered a series of instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the entire Xuan domain, nearly half of the domain was actually under
        the control of the Taixu Sect.
      </p>
      <p>And now it was like everything was under his control.</p>
      <p>
        The first thing Gu Changge had to do was naturally to search for people
        with great Luck everywhere, the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor was
        definitely hidden in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a giant force in the Xuan domain, Gu Changge received a lot of news
        after the layers of the Taixu Sect's search.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it wasn't enough. In order to further narrow the scope, Gu Changge
        thought of Jiang Chuchu who was trapped in the inner world by him.
      </p>
      <p>
        There should be many means on her body to determine the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong></p>
      <p>Inside the inner world, on a huge bluestone.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu, who was sitting cross-legged with her eyes closed, her
        whole body shrouded in a layer of fairy light, suddenly felt a layer of
        spatial fluctuations.
      </p>
      <p>She opened her eyes suddenly.</p>
      <p>In her cold eyes, there was hatred and killing intent.</p>
      <p>
        Then it quickly returned to calm, as if the expression just now was an
        illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        A layer of ripples spread as Gu Changge's figure walked in, not paying
        any attention to her expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu closed her eyes, did not look at him, did not want to see
        this man who gave her endless humiliation.
      </p>
      <p>"Open your eyes and look at me."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge spoke lightly with a tone that could not be resisted, "You
        are very clear about the consequences, if you go against my will here,
        you will be worse off than dead."
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu gritted her teeth and looked at Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        She understood the consequences and didn't dare to disobey his words at
        this moment, and said coldly, "Gu Changge, what the hell do you want to
        do with me, you demon?"
      </p>
      <p>
        All this time, she has been thinking of ways to break out of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she had been unsuccessful, and even despaired for a while, feeling
        that she could only be trapped here for the rest of her life.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now there was someone in the outside world, walking in the world
        with her identity, colluding with Gu Changge, and causing chaos in the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she was powerless to resist at the moment, there was nothing for her
        except suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only chance was the forbidden palace within her Sea of
        ????Consciousness, but with her current cultivation level, she couldn't
        touch it at all, let alone use its power.
      </p>
      <p>As for surrendering to Gu Changge?</p>

      <p>
        That was even more unlikely. She would rather die of old age, or get
        tortured to death!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Tell me how to find the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor." Gu
        Changge went straight to the point, and was too lazy to talk nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing that, Jiang Chuchu's expression changed slightly, and she
        couldn't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only did Gu Changge find someone to pretend to be her, but now he
        even had the idea of ?scheming against the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor?
      </p>
      <p><i>He is so brave!</i></p>
      <p>"I have no idea."</p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu directly shook her head, saying that he had no choice.</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, you really don't know or are you pretending that you don't know?"
        Gu Changge couldn't help laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If I knew where the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor was, I would
        have gone to find him long ago, why would I be trapped here by you?"
        Jiang Chuchu said coldly.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she thought of this, she felt that she was totally destroyed in the
        hands of this demon.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gave birth to a burst of sadness and hatred, wishing her to die.
      </p>
      <p>
        "As a descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall, don't you know? Saintess
        Chuchu, it's come to this point, do you still think you have the
        possibility of getting out of this?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said lightly, mocking mercilessly.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu said calmly, "So what if I can't get out of this? Even if I
        knew, I wouldn't tell you. I won't help my enemy, so just give up Gu
        Changge."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she didn't know that Gu Changge had left the Upper Realm
        and rushed to the place where the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor
        would appear.
      </p>
      <p>Because even she didn't know anything about it.</p>
      <p>
        The search for the Human Ancestor relied entirely on the secret methods
        and instructions of Human Ancestor Hall, as well as her talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        And most of the time, there was no need for the Human Ancestor Hall to
        intervene. The reincarnation of the Human Ancestor would stand out from
        all kinds of trials and battle, and it was dazzling enough to overwhelm
        his peers.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge frowned, it seemed that Jiang Chuchu really didn't know.</p>
      <p>
        After all, in his inner world, Jiang Chuchu's subtle emotional
        fluctuations could not be concealed from his perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing was that, in his opinion, the secret method of
        the Human Ancestor Hall was not as easy to use as the system's
        exploration.
      </p>
      <p>From the number of Luck points, he could judge easily.</p>
      <p>
        But in this way, it was tantamount to looking for a needle in a
        haystack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, Jiang Chuchu, like him, had never seen the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor .
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, do you already know the place where the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor appeared?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, seeing Gu Changge's expression, Jiang Chuchu couldn't help
        but slightly change her expression, and guessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Gu Changge's speed was actually faster than the Human Ancestor
          Hall?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p><i>How on earth did he do it?</i></p>
      <p>"Not only do I know, I'm already there."</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge had nothing to hide. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m
        for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
      </p>
      <p>
        He smiled lightly, with a bit of interest, "Why, are you worried that
        the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor will be found by me and get
        killed first? If you ask me, I might be able to give him an easier way
        to die."

          window.pubfuturetag.push({

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu suddenly felt a chill on her back, her face
        paled, and she felt an understatement of terrifying murderous aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You can't even think of the means that the Human Ancestor possesses.
        Even if you can kill the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor in this
        life, there are other ways for him to return. You can't fight the Human
        Ancestor."
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn't help but say this, by growing up in the Human Ancestor Hall
        since childhood, she understood how powerful the Human Ancestor was,
        almost omnipotent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge had the upper hand from the current point of view,
        it was still impossible for him to be the opponent of the Human Ancestor
        who had been reincarnated countless times.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Gu Changge couldn't help but sneer and said lightly,</p>
      <p>
        "Speaking of which, I'm your man anyway. If I get killed by the Human
        Ancestor will you stay indifferent?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I really don't know what kind of fascinating soup the Human Ancestor
        Hall gave you. It's just the Human Ancestor, and it makes you look in
        awe. Jiang Chuchu, what was the purpose of your cultivation since
        childhood?"
      </p>
      <p>"To be a tool man of the Human Ancestor?"</p>
      <p>"You are despicable and shameless…"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's first sentence, Jiang Chuchu's complexion suddenly
        changed, and she couldn't be as calm as before.
      </p>
      <p>He was so shameless that he still had the face to say it.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge had an indifferent attitude.</p>
      <p>
        However, these words still made her a little confused… Gu Changge was
        right, what was the purpose of her cultivation since she was a child?
      </p>
      <p>
        And no matter what, the relationship between her and Gu Changge had
        become very complicated.
      </p>
      <p>She hated Gu Changge to the core.</p>
      <p>
        Because Gu Changge, as the inheritor of demonic art, had caused chaos in
        the world, she was obliged to clean up everything for the common people
        and restore peace.
      </p>
      <p>This was the concept that was instilled in her childhood.</p>
      <p>
        "You are just a tool for someone, you haven't considered living for
        yourself?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing Jiang Chuchu in confusion at this time, Gu Changge didn't think
        it was a big deal, he smiled and said so.
      </p>
      <p>
        "A tool for someone? Wang Ziji also said this to me at the beginning,
        saying that she is not a tool."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was slightly stunned, and quickly drove these distracting
        thoughts out of her mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her expression returned to calm, and she looked at Gu Changge coldly,
        "But I am a descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall. The purpose of my
        birth is to maintain the justice of the people, the peace of the world,
        and to kill a demon like you."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, then I'm standing here, but do you have the ability to kill me?
        You're trash, and you have the guts to speak madly." Gu Changge sneered,
        looking very disdainful.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You can't even kill me, how dare you maintain justice in the world? How
        many people in this world are virtuous and act justly?"
      </p>
      <p>"Why didn't I see you kill them?"</p>
      <p>In his opinion, Jiang Chuchu's Dao heart was not stable.</p>
      <p>There was a great opportunity.</p>
      <p>"You……"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu's expression was suffocated, and she almost
        gritted her teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the first time she was scolded as trash, but she couldn't refute
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Am I wrong? You're just a piece of shit, staring at me alone, but you
        can't do anything, and you don't care about other people who are doing
        the real evil deeds."
      </p>
      <p>
        "When you say that you are like this, is it the same as condoning the
        evil in this world? Is it worthy of your identity?"
      </p>
      <p>"What's the difference between you and me?"</p>
      <p>
        With a slight smile, Gu Changge asked such a rhetorical question, with
        sincerity in every word.
      </p>
      <p>
        He found an interesting thing, part of the Luck of the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor would be damaged by Jiang Chuchu's unstable Dao
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that the fate of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor was
        related to the creatures in heaven and earth who revered him.
      </p>
      <p>Hearing these words, Jiang Chuchu's face became paler for a while.</p>

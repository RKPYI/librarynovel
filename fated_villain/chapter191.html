      <h4>
        Chapter 191: Wang Zijin, the Strongest Favoured Daughter of Heaven; This
        is the so-called Orthodox Way.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Continent was in the midst of turmoil. Fear, war,
        death, and despair ran rampant all throughout. The peace before the
        people from Upper Realm entered seemed like an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>Tranquillity cannot be easily regained once lost.</p>
      <p>
        Just a few days prior, the Great Elder of Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace
        had even appeared in person, rushing towards the Dragon Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was an ancient existence so old it’d be an insult to call them a
        living fossil.
      </p>
      <p>And his unfathomable strength was enough to make anyone tremble.</p>
      <p>
        No one knew what the Great Elder did when he finally arrived at the True
        Dragon Clan, nor did anyone understand why he ultimately fought against
        an ancestor of the True Dragon Clan, a legendary figure named Void
        Shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
        But one thing was for sure. Their battle had shocked every Daoist Sect
        and Ancient Immortal Races, and even the stars outside the Upper Realm
        were shattered by the fluctuations, becoming streams of ashen powder
        floating in the night sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder took action, shaking Heaven and Earth. The Qi in each of
        his strikes was as vast as a galaxy, submerging everything under its
        intense might.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what if even the phantom of the True Dragon Clan’s Ancestor
        reappeared?
      </p>
      <p>He was simply no match for it.</p>
      <p>
        The space within hundreds of thousands of miles of Dragon Island was
        blasted into dust in that battle, and the aftermath of the battle
        lingered on, making the hearts of many strong individuals tremble, not
        daring to go anywhere near.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the war, the Great Elder showed his strongest methods and
        persecuted the Ancient Immortal Races, thinking that they needed to be
        unified, lest the other Daoist Sects come to take a piece of the pie.
      </p>
      <p>
        The continent, which had survived since the Immortal Period, now needed
        a new ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
        And although the Great Elder did not specify who the ruler was, every
        clan in the Ancient Immortal Continent realized that it must be the
        current Heir of Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the identity of this heir was not a mystery to Ancient
        Immortal Races.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wasn’t it just a while ago that Gu Changge had raised a ruckus inside
        the Ancient Immortal Continent and pissed off the various Ancient
        Immortal Races?!
      </p>
      <p>
        The incident caused shock and anger throughout the Ancient Immortal
        Continent, followed by a sense of deep unease. Gu Changge’s backing was
        one that, as long as you knew about it, would already cause anyone to
        become terrified and fearful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet now there was the Great Elder showing up to support Gu Changge as
        well?
      </p>
      <p>It was simply unbelievable!</p>
      <p>
        The many Daoist Sects in the outside world that noticed Gu Changge’s
        ambition, gasped in astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>‘He intends to unify the Ancient Immortal Races!’</p>
      <p>
        However, they were also puzzled, thinking that Gu Changge was still
        merely a young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how powerful he was, could he possibly change the current
        situation of the Ancient Immortal Continent just using his own strength?
      </p>
      <p>
        Not unless the forces behind him, such as the Ancient Immortal Gu Family
        and the Primordial Divine Sect intervene, and put their influence on the
        table.
      </p>
      <p>Because it was a very unrealistic notion otherwise.</p>
      <p>
        The troublesome piece called the Ancient Immortal Continent had a lot of
        meat for sure, but if one is not careful it would be difficult to
        swallow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, its bone might even make one bleed if one was not careful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, although many Daoist Sects were planning to conquer the Ancient
        Immortal Continent for a long time, they never took any actions, unlike
        Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>This move of his truly shocked countless cultivators.</p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Continent had a glut of inhabitants, with
        inheritances that have been standing since the Immortal Period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from the destroyed Tiangou Clan, which had surrendered, no
        substantial harm or loss had befallen the other clans at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        That meant that the many Daoist Sects pouring into the Ancient Immortal
        Continent would not pose too much of a problem for the natives, since
        not every sect could kill everything in sight like Ancestor Gu Nanshan
        of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.

      </p>
      <p>
        Many ancient and huge warships floated in the sky, shrouded in golden
        mist, like immortal soldiers descending from myth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person who spoke was standing on the warship, his splendid golden
        eyes gleaming, the descendant and heir of the Immortal Wang Family –
        Wang Wushuang.
      </p>
      <p>He was still in the Ancient Immortal Continent.</p>
      <p>
        Besides him was an old but powerful elite of the Immortal Wang Family,
        with a stooped figure and terrifying aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        After learning of the Fairy Gate’s appearance, this old monster had come
        to the Ancient Immortal Continent to look for opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he received nothing but near-fatal injuries in the end. He had
        lost almost half their life on this journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet he did not choose to immediately leave the Ancient Immortal
        Continent but instead chose to stay by Wang Wushuang’s side. They
        planned to look out for Gu Changge and fish in troubled waters to get
        some benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“What a fine plan. Using the excuse of getting justice, not only did
          he pacify the Tiangou clan, but is now even intending to encroach upon
          all the Ancient Immortal Races...”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the old monster also sighed, incomparably amazed by the
        boldness of such a young junior, and feeling curious at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Hah, apart from those Ancient Freaks or the Forbidden Demonic Arts’
          Inheritors, I am afraid few people in the younger generation are
          qualified to fight against Gu Changge. We can only but speculate on
          what level of cultivation he might have already reached.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang's body, hidden in the thick fog, looked very mysterious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Revealing only those all-seeing golden pupils that flickered with runes
        from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>He nodded solemnly.</p>
      <p>
        Ever since his birth, he had prided himself on being invincible, yet he
        couldn’t help but be scared when facing Gu Changge, his heart
        palpitating.
      </p>
      <p>In a real fight with no holds barred, Gu Changge would crush him.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge is truly powerful, but he’s not necessarily invincible.
          Wushuang, have you forgotten about your sister? She should have left
          secluded cultivation and returned by now.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The old monster standing near Wang Wushuang smiled slightly at those
        crest-fallen words, before casually mentioning the arrival of Wang
        Wushuang’s mysterious sister.
      </p>
      <p><b>“My sister?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang was stunned for a moment, his reaction a bit sluggish,
        while all kinds of memories flashed through his mind like lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was actually very curious about this incomparably mysterious sister
        of his.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was said that she had been picked up and taken away by the Human
        Ancestral Hall at a young age to undergo specialized training because of
        her extremely terrifying talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        And during the practice which lasted more than 20 years, she had never
        once returned to the clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, many clansmen and even some senior members of the Immortal
        Wang Family did not even know about his sister’s existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Wang Wushuang himself had only heard about it recently from a Clan
        Elder.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it seemed like this elder sister of his had successfully completed
        her practice within the Human Ancestral Hall, and was now returning to
        the clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Is she very strong?”</b> Wang Wushuang asked after being silent for
        a while.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Strong?”</b></p>
      <p>
        The old monster smirked, shaking his head gently,
        <b
          >“To describe your sister only as strong is already considered an
          insult. Her talent is simply unparalleled.”</b

          cultivators to realize some bits of Dao on the spot.”</b

          her tremendous perseverance and willpower.”</b

      <p>
        <b
          >“This incident shocked several ancestors into awakening from their
          seclusion. Combining their strength, they then made a bold move to

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The words of this old monster, fuelled by deep admiration, dumbfounded
        Wang Wushuang.
      </p>
      <p>It was unbelievable!</p>
      <p>Born with a Sacred Realm Cultivation? What was this concept?</p>
      <p>
        Even with his god-gifted talent, he was still only in the False God
        Realm after training for so long and wasting so many resources.
      </p>
      <p>Yet his sister was born a Sacred Realm cultivator?</p>
      <p>
        It was too shocking! If he had not heard this directly from the mouth of
        the old monster, he would never have believed it.
      </p>
      <p>Horrifying. The news made him freeze in place, trembling slightly.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It's no wonder that my sister's existence was hidden by the clan,
          with no news available about her. If it had spread out, it would
          definitely cause a major earthquake, and she would’ve most likely been
          assassinated before reaching maturity.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang suddenly felt a sense of admiration for his estranged
        sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Yeah, at that time, many clansmen had their memories of this matter
          sealed. Thus, your sister's existence has always been kept a tight
          secret.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>The old monster nodded in agreement.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“So don't look at Gu Changge acting so victorious now, there are many
          more people with more monstrous talent than him in this world. For
          your sister, it won’t matter how strong Gu Changge becomes, he’ll
          probably never be worthy of being her opponent.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I remember hearing a few years ago that she was about to enter the
          God King Realm, and so it is estimated that she is not far from the
          Sacred Realm now...”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>Hiss!</b></p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang sucked in a breath of cold air, suffering another blow to
        his pride.
      </p>
      <p>‘She was in the God King Realm a few years ago?’</p>
      <p>‘Such monstrous talent!’</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he finally understood why those clan elders didn’t pay
        much attention to him as an heir, putting little effort into properly
        raising him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turned out that his existence was purely a cover-up for his sister!
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Wang Wushuang couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p>
      <p>
        But what could he say? Who asked his talent to be inferior to his
        sister?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“It seems my sister has left me a lot of trouble.”</b> Wang Wushuang
        sighed in acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old monster coughed slightly,
        <b
          >“I do have to say, though, that your elder sister strangely didn't
          cry or make trouble when she was born, which is different from other
          babies. It was as if she possessed life-transcending intelligence from
          her past life. The ancestors decided to investigate, but still
          couldn’t find out the reason...”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Furthermore, her personality is, uh...”</b></p>
      <p>
        Speaking until here, the old monster showed a weird tangled expression,
        as if it was difficult to describe exactly what he wanted to say.
      </p>
      <p>He still remembered it vividly.</p>
      <p>
        A young girl, with pink cheeks that looked like jade and skin as
        delicate and as flawless as a little fairy, opened her mouth to spill
        out “your mother’s…” and a various blend of exotic and expressive
        curses. The impact on his three views was simply immense that day.[1]
      </p>
      <p>
        [1: Three views is a Chinese thing. One's perspective over life, world,
        and value.]
      </p>
      <p>These memories left a deep impression on him.</p>
      <p><b>“By the way, what is my sister’s name?”</b></p>
      <p>Wang Wushuang was becoming more and more curious about his sister.</p>
      <p>
        It was unbelievable that this Clan Elder would show such an expression
        and say such words.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Your sister? Her name is Wang Zijin... and you’ll see her soon
          enough.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>The old enchanting smiled menacingly and spoke.</p>
      <p><b>“And soon, this name will shake the entire Upper Realm.”</b></p>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p><b>[At the same time in the Heavenly Domain, Upper Realm.]</b></p>
      <p>Within the most prosperous and ancient territory’s centre.</p>
      <p>
        A majestic palace that stood in the sky, magnificent and sacred, like an
        immortal abode.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tiles of flawless white jade and pure glazed glass, paired with eaves
        made of million-year-old purple gold sandalwood, lead up to a pavilion
        paved by Obsidian Star Stones.
      </p>
      <p>It was an extremely luxurious atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Domineering, yet quaint and solemn.</p>
      <p>Filled with a thick sea of surging immortal aura.</p>
      <p>A palace that oversaw the endless pond below the Ancient City.</p>
      <p>
        Rising as the sun, and setting as the moon, countless gleaming runes
        intertwined between every breath and move in the Main Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting the stars of the nine heavens, and viewing the universe like
        a supreme throne, it showed the transcendental status of this palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        A huge Immortal Plaque hung in front of the temple gate, with purple
        Immortal Gold as the base and inlaid with Immortal Gold Glyphs.
      </p>
      <p>Converging into three Archaic words.</p>
      <p>Human Ancestral Hall.</p>
      <p>
        Thousands of silver threads could be seen flowing from Heaven and Earth,
        rushing towards the palace crazily, as if they wanted to gather inside
        it, those lines of energy that appeared sacred and pure.
      </p>

        And inside these silver threads were countless chants, praises, and
        prayers. The culmination of the worship and recitation of Human
        Ancestor’s achievements from cultivators all over the realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, a beautiful woman dressed in flawless white clothes with a
        veil on her face was cultivating with her eyes closed in the main hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        A vague immortal figure, so grand and mysterious, seemed to chant
        scriptures behind her. It looked ethereal and ephemeral as if it was
        crossing the space-time barrier from an Immortal Period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her complexion was fair and delicate. Her eyebrows were fair and sharp.
        And her eyes were a pair of flawless black gems, shining with a lustre
        that could move the souls of any being.
      </p>
      <p>
        But her expression only showed a bone-chilling apathy. Vissit

          >“Reporting to the Saintess, Holy Maiden Zijin has left the Heavenly
          Domain and is on her way back to the Immortal Wang Family.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>A man and woman suddenly appeared out of thin air.</p>
      <p>The woman respectfully reported her piece.</p>
      <p><b>“Wang Zijin... so she still left secretly .”</b></p>
      <p>Hearing this, the woman in white seemed a bit surprised.</p>
      <p>
        Yet, her expression was as calm as ever, as the receding waves of an
        ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Did she say anything?”</b> The woman cloaked in white asked lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Holy Maiden Zijin also left a short message saying that she has no
          interest in finding the reincarnation of Human Ancestor and that it
          was purely a coincidence that she came to this place to cultivate, and
          that we... ‘did her dirty’.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“So now she's leaving.”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“She also said that she doesn't want the position of Saintess... and
          needed to go back to find a husband to marry...”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The woman who was reporting on the situation looked a little
        embarrassed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this type of remark to be said by the Human Ancestral Hall’s
        Descendent was simply too shocking. If any outside ever heard about it,
        they would be completely disgraced!
      </p>
      <p>
        Then again, considering the Holy Maiden’s “unique” attitude, it did not
        seem too strange.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even though the Holy Maiden talked about “marriage” so lightly, her
        words were shallow at best, since she barely had experienced the outside
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Wang Zijin’s dreams truly are big, but I’m afraid this matter is not
          something she can decide for herself. Once you enter the Human
          Ancestral Hall, you’ll be a member of the Human Ancestral Hall for
          life. Assisting the Human Ancestor in restoring the world’s peace
          becomes your lifelong obligation and duty.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>The woman in white just shook her head slightly.</p>
      <p>‘Wang Zijin cannot escape her fate.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘As for this “marriage” matter, although Wang Zijin said it so casually,
        she is actually a very arrogant person. Even in the Human Ancestral Hall
        where talents are abundant...’
      </p>
      <p>‘No one can hope to catch her attention.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Could the outside world possibly compare with the Human Ancestral Hall
        in this regard?’
      </p>
      <p>
        As her words echoed in the spacious chamber, a hazy mist began to appear
        upon the face of the woman clothed in white, covering her whole body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The voice became indistinct, and it was impossible to tell whether it
        was male or female.
      </p>
      <p>
        To think that there would be two descendants of the Human Ancestral Hall
        in this life and that the descendants were both women! It was something
        deemed unimaginable in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Elders decided to elect them as a pair of descendants because the
        talent of both those women was just too good to waste
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it was Wang Zijin of the Immortal Wang Family or the woman in
        white named Jiang Chuchu, they were both terrifying monsters of the
        younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, in the eyes of many old generation powerhouses in the Human
        Ancestral Hall, Jiang Chuchu was very likely to be the reincarnation of
        an Ancient Immortal!
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Wang Zijin was strong, it would be difficult for her to gain an
        upper hand in front of Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“According to my prediction, the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor
          should have been born already. It seems that I have to leave this
          place.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu pondered for a while, her calm face showing otherworldly
        insight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because not every generation would herald the Human Ancestor’s
        reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the descendants of the Human Ancestral Hall, their biggest task was
        to protect the Human Ancestor’s reincarnation in his infancy and help
        him slowly become stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        To aid in awakening the Human Ancestor’s past memory and guide him to
        become a powerhouse of the generation, in order to save the world and
        bring salvation to all races.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The reappearance of the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor in this
          life will inevitably lead to chaos in the world. On the way to finding
          the Human Ancestor’s reincarnation, I will capture the Demonic Arts’
          Inheritor and kill them first.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu muttered to herself. Bringing justice to the common folk
        and eliminating harm for the people was her primary moral code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Righteous, Brave, and Benevolent. If Gu Changge was here, he’d
        definitely understand that this woman had the bearing of the True
        Orthodox Path.
      </p>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        Horrifying pressure like a mighty mountain fell from the sky. A sea of
        suppression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shaking the Heavens and moving the Earth, the sun and moon lost their
        lights. It was like a supreme being, slashing forth a blow from the ends
        of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet in the next moment, the breath of Qi that made the sky tremble
        seemed to have been strangled by the throat, vanishing in the blink of
        an eye.
      </p>
      <p>The monstrous force dissipated like the fading embers of a fire.</p>
      <p><b>[Ancestral Hall, Divine Crocodile Clan]</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stood there with his hands behind his back, clothed in black
        hunting clothes, with a smile on his face as he stared down at the
        kneeling ancestor of the Divine Crocodile Clan.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Are you courting death?”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Young Master Gu, please don’t take my words seriously, you are a
          magnanimous and benevolent person. There is no need to listen to the
          ramblings of an old fool like myself...”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The Quasi-Supreme Ancestor of the Divine Crocodile Clan paled as cold
        sweat trickled from his scaly forehead and down his spine.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the clansmen behind him were even more frightened, almost bathing in
        desperation.
      </p>
      <p>
        They did not expect that their ancestor in the Quasi-Supreme Realm would
        be so helpless in front of Gu Changge, to the point where his life was
        in the palm of Gu Changge’s hand!
      </p>
      <p>This was no longer as simple as the prior deterrence.</p>
      <p>
        He had now firmly controlled the lives of clansmen of the entire Divine
        Crocodile Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“You seemed to be courting death, but I will spare you on the grounds
          that you still have some use to me. If there is a second offence, it
          will not only be you but also your entire Divine Crocodile Clan...
          that I will personally see buried.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the ancestor of the Divine Crocodile Clan, Gu Changge spoke
        with a slight smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contrast between his natural indifference and his bloody,
        threatening words, made all the Divine crocodile clansmen shiver, not
        daring to breathe a single breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“From today onwards, we will honour Young Master Gu as our Lord.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        They had no choice. It was either surrender or death by Gu Changge’s
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>And there was no doubt that they’d choose to surrender.</p>
      <p>‘One should not take Gu Changge’s words so simply.’</p>
      <p>
        Quite a few clansmen actually did not believe in his terror and had
        provoked him earlier. But just when they were about to attack him, their
        bodies collapsed, souls destroyed, dissipating as they died without
        taking a single move.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge’s view, it was necessary for the Divine Crocodile Clan to
        recognize the fact that he could kill them all without issue, lest they
        wonder if they might have a chance to break free from his control
      </p>
      <p>
        It was impossible for him to appear like this unless he was completely
        sure of his abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying control of the Immortal Binding Arts was not affected by
        the cultivation base.

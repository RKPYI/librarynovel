        Chapter 230-1: Jiang Yang is exhausted, Its good to sit back and wait
        for the benefits at this time (1)
      </h4>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>A layer of ripple spread out in the void.</p>
      <p>Immediately after that.</p>
      <p>
        A figure shrouded with Immortal bones in a divine posture appeared as
        Dao intent emerged from him. When his sleeves shook, it was as if even
        the stars outside the realm were trembling.
      </p>
      <p>It was Gu Changge who had arrived from the Immortal Lun Sect.</p>
      <p>
        He suddenly appeared and caught Yaoyao who had fallen from the void.
        R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on nùíê/v/ùíÜ/l(b)iùíè(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>
        His face was calm and one could not see the slightest happiness or
        anger, but at this time the cultivators and living beings in the entire
        ancient city felt a sense of fear like facing the might of heaven. They
        could clearly perceive Gu Changge's killing intent and anger!
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone's heart and soul could not help but tremble, as if they were
        about to face the end of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the scene in front of them, they could not help but kneel on
        the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        A terrifying pressure descended, like a big mountain hanging down above
        their head, at this time, they were even suffocated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now the sudden change of Yaoyao shocked everyone, that aura was too
        terrifying, as if it was a Supreme existence overlooking the mountains
        and seas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just before they could react, Yaoyao struck, displaying a terrifying
        strength that shook the entire ancient city.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, some of the old antiquities who were startled to
        recognize the Immortal Lun Sect's Supreme Elder Zhao Yi who was
        following behind Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a Great Sacred Realm existence was following behind a young man
        like Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made them incomparably shocked and incredulous, and they were
        speculating about Jiang Yang's identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But such speculation did not last long, Yaoyao suddenly struck out, the
        terrifying aura swept across ten thousand miles, and her single palm
        almost killed the famous Great Sacred Realm existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        What they saw today made them feel a chill going down their spine and
        overturned many of their previous perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>What exactly was the identity of Yaoyao?</p>
      <p>
        That kind of appearance and pressure of such a little girl was as if it
        could destroy the entire Heavenly Domain with a single move.
      </p>
      <p>The good thing was that this kind of aura did not last long.</p>
      <p>As for Gu Changge, who suddenly descended and appeared.</p>
      <p>
        There was no doubt that it was definitely the mysterious Superior
        Immortal who had been making a lot of noise in the Heavenly Domain
        during this period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this kind of aura and strength, do they still need any explanation?
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the cultivators and living beings of the entire ancient
        city, with a population of more than a million, all looked towards this
        direction in awe, like respecting a god.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Be careful, this Superior Immortal seems to be angry, it‚Äôs too
        terrifying, just like facing the end of the world, this feeling‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"This is the terror of the people from the Upper Realm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Countless cultivators trembled at this time, the whole ancient city fell
        silent, becoming dead silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one dared to speak loudly, nor did they dare clamor, they could see
        that this Superior Immortal seemed to be in a bad mood, and that kind of
        horrible killing intent was monstrous.
      </p>
      <p>
        The destruction of the heavens and the earth seemed to be just a matter
        of its thought.
      </p>
      <p>"What's going on?"</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>At this time, Gu Changge, who looked indifferent, finally spoke up.</p>
      <p>
        Once the horrible killing intent dispersed, he asked the equally pale
        silver haired granny next to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was as if he had just arrived and completely didn‚Äôt know about this
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Silver haired granny's face was pale, as she said with a trembling
        voice, "Reporting to the Immortal, the old woman also does not know what
        is going on."
      </p>
      <p>Until now, she did not react and her head was buzzing.</p>
      <p>How should she explain to Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>
        At this time, she was even secretly worried, afraid that Gu Changge
        would blame her for not keeping an eye on Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>"You don't know what's going on?"</p>
      <p>
        At these words, Gu Changge frowned, and then his cold eyes swept over
        the building that became a ruin in front of her.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        He poked out one hand, and the monstrous black light instantly
        transformed into an incomparably realistic and terrifying giant palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines were clear, the runes were interwoven, covering heaven and
        earth, with a surging aura, clutching down at Jiang Yang who was
        struggling to get up as his face was a little pale!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rumble!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The sky trembled, as if it was propelled forward, emitting a sound that
        made one‚Äôs soul tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this kind of aura, the beings in the whole ancient city were even
        more appalled, and their souls were about to explode.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the first time they witnessed such a terrifying sight, as if
        destroying the heavens and the earth.
      </p>
      <p>"Not good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Just a moment ago Jiang Yang was slapped away, and it was difficult for
        him to stand up.
      </p>
      <p>
        His expression changed greatly while watching Gu Changge‚Äôs palm falling
        again, and he was about to retreat back.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the moment this palm fell, every inch of the void became stagnant,
        even the heaven and earth were almost slapped apart, and Jiang Yang was
        firmly locked there!
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang could hardly move and could not dodge at all.</p>
      <p>
        Despite borrowing one percent of the Dao fruit‚Äôs cultivation, he had
        broken through to the False God Realm cultivation, but it was still
        useless!
      </p>
      <p>With a puff, he spurted out a mouthful of blood.</p>
      <p>
        He could only be unwilling and angry, being firmly clutched in the palm
        of Gu Changge's huge hand condensed by this aura, his bones were
        creaking and he was coughing blood continuously.
      </p>
      <p>"What did you do to Yaoyao?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge clutched Jiang Yang in his palm and looked at him
        indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no trace of emotion in his eyes, as if he could crush him to
        death with his hands, as easily as a bug.
      </p>
      <p>"I don't know how Yaoyao suddenly became like this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's face was pale, his eyes were full of anger, coldness and
        reluctance.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at this time, he could only grit his teeth to endure, and display a
        face of incomprehension, and bewilderment.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        The day before yesterday, he had borrowed the power of the Dao fruit to
        break through to the False God Realm, and originally thought that with
        his means, he could slightly counteract Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>But he still could not do a thing!</p>
      <p>The gap between the two of them was too big!</p>
      <p>
        This made Jiang Yang's heart very unwilling and he did not expect to
        suffer big losses one after another by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially today, in front of all the creatures and cultivators of an
        ancient city, he was caught in the palm in such a humiliating manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this matter was known later, it would be a stain that he could hardly
        erase in his life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This had never happened to Jiang Yang in his long years of cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this body was not too weak now, and it was difficult to bear more of
        his Dao fruit cultivation, he would absolutely borrow more power and
        strike to kill Gu Changge to clear this stain in his life.
      </p>
      <p>"No?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's brow was still furrowed and he looked deeply at Jiang Yang,
        as if he wanted to see him through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang gritted his teeth and stared at him without any fear, with a
        frank and self-assured look.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason why Yaoyao just became like this, in fact, he already had a
        guess in his mind and similar to the previous idea, Yaoyao's origin was
        not simple, involving the Dao fruit of a certain existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's own understanding of the Dao fruit was very deep, and at
        this time, it was even more unquestionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that, he didn't know whether Gu Changge really didn't know
        or faked it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If I find out that you lied to me, even Yaoyao will not be able to save
        you at that time."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge coldly snorted, his eyes were deep and cold, containing a
        frightening killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This voice fell on Jiang Yang's ears, but it was like a terrifying
        thunder blast, making him feel a tinge of sweetness deep in his throat.
      </p>
      <p>His five internal organs were shattered!</p>
      <p>There was a puff!</p>
      <p>Gu Changge let go of his hand.</p>
      <p>
        The big hand that was condensed by black runes, scattered in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang fell to the ground, his face was in a mess, his fists were
        clenched tightly, and his heart was filled with coldness and killing
        intent.
      </p>
      <p>"I will kill you!"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang roared lowly in his heart, it was the first time he wanted to
        kill someone so much.
      </p>
      <p>It was simply hatred.</p>
      <p>
        But his mind was overwhelming, and his expression still did not look
        much abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Gu Changge's face gradually returned to calm, unable to show the joy
        or anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system's frantic prompting voice rang out in his mind at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, the Daughter of Luck, Yaoyao resisted the Son of Luck, Jiang
        Yang, the Son of Luck was damaged, and you gained 8,000 Luck points and
        40,000 Destiny value!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, publicly humiliating the Son of Luck, Jiang Yang, the Son of
        Luck's Luck is damaged, and you gained 2,000 Luck points and 10,000
        Destiny value."
      </p>
      <p>"Ding‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        A series of system sounds made the smile in Gu Changge's heart deeper
        and deeper.
      </p>
      <p>Things were still developing in the direction he had predicted.</p>
      <p>
        According to this trend, Jiang Yang's Luck points would soon fall to a
        low point.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period, he actually kind of wanted to let Jiang Yang
        continue to be a treasure hunting mouse, but considering Jiang Yang's
        current cultivation, the chances prepared for him would not be of much
        use to himself.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 230-2: Jiang Yang is exhausted, Its good to sit back and wait
        for the benefits at this time (2)
      </h4>
      <p>So Gu Changge also gave up on this.</p>
      <p>
        The current Luck points contained in Jiang Yang's body were still tens
        of thousands, and they were still starting to grow with time.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge felt that it was his backhand that was starting to work.</p>
      <p>
        "Master, I don't know what's going on, this power somehow appeared‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        And in the Gu Changge‚Äôs embrace, her face was also all confused and she
        also did not know what just happened to herself?
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that because what Jiang Yang said was too angering to her,
        falsely accusing the Master, so she wanted him to shut up, and then felt
        a power that she could not refuse emerging from the center of her brow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This power was so powerful that she could destroy the sky and the earth
        with just a slight wave of her hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Forget it, if you don't know, from the aura just now, this power should
        have no effect on you, but you shouldn't expect this power to do
        anything either."
      </p>
      <p>
        "This power doesn't seem to be under your control." At that Gu Changge
        sighed and nodded.
      </p>
      <p>
        And hearing these words, Yaoyao's heart became more and more confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could it be that her origin was really as complicated as her Master
        said?
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now she had a strange feeling, as if she could overlook all living
        creatures, no matter what existence it was, she could be indifferent to
        it, and it would not make any difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, Gu Changge swept a glance at the many living cultivators in front
        of him, and didn‚Äôt bother.
      </p>
      <p>
        He took a step, instantly swept over ten thousand miles, taking her out
        of this place, returning to the Immortal Lun Sect, as if to understand
        more about what exactly had gone wrong with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching the two disappear, Jiang Yang, who was standing in the same
        place, with that calm face, also gradually couldn‚Äôt see clearly. He no
        longer had the previous calm and aloof expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Things have come to this, I can not let him live! If I invoke those
        means and arrangements, it is possible to put this guy to death, and by
        then Yaoyao will not suspect me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression became very cold, and many thoughts flashed
        through his mind.
      </p>
      <p>He finally made up his mind.</p>
      <p>
        Because he also felt the pressure, and knew that he was unable to keep
        everything firmly in control.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a small matter to lose face, but if Gu Changge ruined his plan,
        then it would be too late to regret.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now he must find a way to use the rest of the backhand, under the
        premise that Yaoyao would not suspect him, he had to get rid of Gu
        Changge, who was in the way.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        What happened outside the Immortal Lun Sect today, although it was only
        a minor incident, it also caused a huge sensation, it spread quickly,
        causing a huge earthquake among many forces in the Heavenly Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators also learned that the little girl beside that Superior
        Immortal was not simple either.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        But no matter what, many cultivators also witnessed the terrifying might
        of that Immortal with their own eyes, who could cause heaven and earth
        to topple with just one thought.
      </p>
      <p>Many rumors quickly spread around the world.</p>
      <p>
        After Gu Changge returned to the Immortal Lun Sect, he first comforted
        Yaoyao, reassuring her that she would not become another person, and she
        was still the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if she turned out to be the rest, he was still her Master, which
        would not change.
      </p>
      <p>
        And after getting Gu Changge's assurance, the little girl then calmed
        down and showed a happy smile. After all, she was very afraid that she
        would become another person in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the process, Gu Changge also told her quite a few things about the
        Immortal Lun Ancestor, saying that Jiang Yang was probably taken over by
        a divine soul left by the Immortal Lun Ancestor in the Immortal Lun
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        All kinds of signs and evidence showed that he was not talking nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        After hearing this, Yaoyao did not suspect anymore, and just as Gu
        Changge thought, she planned to take this revenge on Immortal Lun
        Supreme.
      </p>
      <p>The fact that he had made a mistake, Gu Changge did not care.</p>
      <p>
        During this period, Gu Changge kept an eye on Jiang Chuchu's movements
        in the Inner World, wanting to see if there were cultivators from the
        Human Ancestor Hall who had rushed to this realm based on her reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there were, he would have to ambush them first and kill them in this
        realm, otherwise it would cause a lot of trouble and affect his next
        plan.
      </p>
      <p>But based on Jiang Chuchu's reaction, he seemed to be overthinking.</p>
      <p>
        His Inner World was completely independent and closed to the outside
        world, and it was also the highest level kind of world seed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless he took the initiative to open it, it was impossible for Jiang
        Chuchu to detect the aura in the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was still considering how to snatch the final chance of Jiang
        Yang's return of all worlds to one, but Jiang Yang was slow to move,
        which forced him to put the matter on hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest chance left for Jiang Yang today was also the biggest secret
        of his return of all lives to one.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>"This letter‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, in the cave, Jiang Yang was frowning at the letter in
        his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a letter written in a script that did not belong to this realm,
        and every word contained an amazing dao rhythm, so it could be seen that
        the person who wrote this letter had a complicated cultivation level.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was impossible for a cultivator in the Heavenly Star Realm to read
        this letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the letter was written in a very ancient script of the Upper
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang could naturally see it.</p>
      <p>
        "This was handed over to the disciple by a mortal at the foot of the
        mountain for the disciple to hand over to senior brother Jiang Yang‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>The disciple in front of the cave, said respectfully.</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "Okay, you can go down first." Jiang Yang nodded his head, his gaze with
        thought in it.
      </p>
      <p>The content in this letter made him frown uncontrollably.</p>
      <p>
        The other party knew his identity and stated outright that they came
        from the Upper Realm and agreed on a place for him to rush there to
        meet.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he hadn't met Gu Changge. R√™Ad latùôöSt chapters at n√¥(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m
        Only
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang might not have been suspicious, but now he was wary, how on
        earth did the other party know his identity?
      </p>
      <p>
        Since he knew that he was the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, why
        didn't he come to the Immortal Lun Sect himself, instead of choosing a
        place?
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Is it because he is worried about Gu Changge, the so-called Immortal?
          Or is there some other purpose?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        There were all kinds of doubts, so he did not choose to believe it
        first, and the main thing was since the other party claimed to come from
        the Upper Realm, then why was there no movement before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another point was also the most important, now, except for the people of
        the Human Ancestor Hall, he did not believe other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The most urgent thing is to rush to the place where that Nirvana Green
        Lotus was planted as soon as possible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Many thoughts flashed through Jiang Yang's mind, after all, he could pit
        Gu Changge to death in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, as long as he fused with that Nirvana Green Lotus, he could
        complete the first step of the plan related to the unification of the
        worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time came, he would borrow the Dao fruit, his strength was
        bound to rise sharply, unlike now, when he could not even not withstand
        one percent of its power.
      </p>
      <p>For this reason, he had planned for a long time.</p>
      <p>
        Finally, he chose such a realm, found the most suitable place, planted
        his Nirvana Green Lotus seed, waited for it to gradually mature out, so
        that he could pick it and fuse with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nirvana Green Lotus seed was a divine object that he had obtained
        only after many reincarnations and a lot of thought and calculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the seed of the Green Lotus that was rumored to have been
        nurtured by Chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, he even cultivated it with the aura of many worlds, and
        even exhausted the Luck of the entire realm to make it take root and
        sprout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, he found the most suitable place for its growth in an
        isolated place in the Heavenly Star Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang was not worried that someone would snatch the Nirvana Green
        Lotus from his hands, because in that place, he left many traps, only
        for such a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as it was there, no matter who came, they would be suppressed by
        all of his traps, and would get buried there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang thought so, and his expression gradually became profound,
        although it seemed that Gu Changge stood steadily with an upper hand,
        but under his many means, the entire situation would be reversed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as Gu Changge died, Yaoyao would be left without a Master, and
        she would have to rely on him as his sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Jiang Yang called out to Zhao Yi, the Supreme Elder of
        Immortal Lun Sect, and asked her to report the exact location about
        where the Nirvana Green Lotus was located to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I learned this by chance but if I were to tell the Immortal, he
        probably wouldn't believe me, so it's better for you to go."
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang pondered for a while and said to Zhao Yi.</p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi smiled slightly, then nodded and said, "I know, then I will just
        say that this matter is what I know from the mouth of my disciples‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"

        Chapter 230-1: Jiang Yang is exhausted, Its good to sit back and wait
        for the benefits at this time (1)
      </h4>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>A layer of ripple spread out in the void.</p>
      <p>Immediately after that.</p>
      <p>
        A figure shrouded with Immortal bones in a divine posture appeared as
        Dao intent emerged from him. When his sleeves shook, it was as if even
        the stars outside the realm were trembling.
      </p>
      <p>It was Gu Changge who had arrived from the Immortal Lun Sect.</p>
      <p>
        He suddenly appeared and caught Yaoyao who had fallen from the void.
        R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on nùíê/v/ùíÜ/l(b)iùíè(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>
        His face was calm and one could not see the slightest happiness or
        anger, but at this time the cultivators and living beings in the entire
        ancient city felt a sense of fear like facing the might of heaven. They
        could clearly perceive Gu Changge's killing intent and anger!
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone's heart and soul could not help but tremble, as if they were
        about to face the end of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the scene in front of them, they could not help but kneel on
        the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        A terrifying pressure descended, like a big mountain hanging down above
        their head, at this time, they were even suffocated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now the sudden change of Yaoyao shocked everyone, that aura was too
        terrifying, as if it was a Supreme existence overlooking the mountains
        and seas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just before they could react, Yaoyao struck, displaying a terrifying
        strength that shook the entire ancient city.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, some of the old antiquities who were startled to
        recognize the Immortal Lun Sect's Supreme Elder Zhao Yi who was
        following behind Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a Great Sacred Realm existence was following behind a young man
        like Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made them incomparably shocked and incredulous, and they were
        speculating about Jiang Yang's identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But such speculation did not last long, Yaoyao suddenly struck out, the
        terrifying aura swept across ten thousand miles, and her single palm
        almost killed the famous Great Sacred Realm existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        What they saw today made them feel a chill going down their spine and
        overturned many of their previous perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>What exactly was the identity of Yaoyao?</p>
      <p>
        That kind of appearance and pressure of such a little girl was as if it
        could destroy the entire Heavenly Domain with a single move.
      </p>
      <p>The good thing was that this kind of aura did not last long.</p>
      <p>As for Gu Changge, who suddenly descended and appeared.</p>
      <p>
        There was no doubt that it was definitely the mysterious Superior
        Immortal who had been making a lot of noise in the Heavenly Domain
        during this period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this kind of aura and strength, do they still need any explanation?
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the cultivators and living beings of the entire ancient
        city, with a population of more than a million, all looked towards this
        direction in awe, like respecting a god.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Be careful, this Superior Immortal seems to be angry, it‚Äôs too
        terrifying, just like facing the end of the world, this feeling‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"This is the terror of the people from the Upper Realm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Countless cultivators trembled at this time, the whole ancient city fell
        silent, becoming dead silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one dared to speak loudly, nor did they dare clamor, they could see
        that this Superior Immortal seemed to be in a bad mood, and that kind of
        horrible killing intent was monstrous.
      </p>
      <p>
        The destruction of the heavens and the earth seemed to be just a matter
        of its thought.
      </p>
      <p>"What's going on?"</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>At this time, Gu Changge, who looked indifferent, finally spoke up.</p>
      <p>
        Once the horrible killing intent dispersed, he asked the equally pale
        silver haired granny next to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was as if he had just arrived and completely didn‚Äôt know about this
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Silver haired granny's face was pale, as she said with a trembling
        voice, "Reporting to the Immortal, the old woman also does not know what
        is going on."
      </p>
      <p>Until now, she did not react and her head was buzzing.</p>
      <p>How should she explain to Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>
        At this time, she was even secretly worried, afraid that Gu Changge
        would blame her for not keeping an eye on Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>"You don't know what's going on?"</p>
      <p>
        At these words, Gu Changge frowned, and then his cold eyes swept over
        the building that became a ruin in front of her.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        He poked out one hand, and the monstrous black light instantly
        transformed into an incomparably realistic and terrifying giant palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines were clear, the runes were interwoven, covering heaven and
        earth, with a surging aura, clutching down at Jiang Yang who was
        struggling to get up as his face was a little pale!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rumble!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The sky trembled, as if it was propelled forward, emitting a sound that
        made one‚Äôs soul tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this kind of aura, the beings in the whole ancient city were even
        more appalled, and their souls were about to explode.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the first time they witnessed such a terrifying sight, as if
        destroying the heavens and the earth.
      </p>
      <p>"Not good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Just a moment ago Jiang Yang was slapped away, and it was difficult for
        him to stand up.
      </p>
      <p>
        His expression changed greatly while watching Gu Changge‚Äôs palm falling
        again, and he was about to retreat back.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the moment this palm fell, every inch of the void became stagnant,
        even the heaven and earth were almost slapped apart, and Jiang Yang was
        firmly locked there!
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang could hardly move and could not dodge at all.</p>
      <p>
        Despite borrowing one percent of the Dao fruit‚Äôs cultivation, he had
        broken through to the False God Realm cultivation, but it was still
        useless!
      </p>
      <p>With a puff, he spurted out a mouthful of blood.</p>
      <p>
        He could only be unwilling and angry, being firmly clutched in the palm
        of Gu Changge's huge hand condensed by this aura, his bones were
        creaking and he was coughing blood continuously.
      </p>
      <p>"What did you do to Yaoyao?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge clutched Jiang Yang in his palm and looked at him
        indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no trace of emotion in his eyes, as if he could crush him to
        death with his hands, as easily as a bug.
      </p>
      <p>"I don't know how Yaoyao suddenly became like this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's face was pale, his eyes were full of anger, coldness and
        reluctance.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at this time, he could only grit his teeth to endure, and display a
        face of incomprehension, and bewilderment.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        The day before yesterday, he had borrowed the power of the Dao fruit to
        break through to the False God Realm, and originally thought that with
        his means, he could slightly counteract Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>But he still could not do a thing!</p>
      <p>The gap between the two of them was too big!</p>
      <p>
        This made Jiang Yang's heart very unwilling and he did not expect to
        suffer big losses one after another by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially today, in front of all the creatures and cultivators of an
        ancient city, he was caught in the palm in such a humiliating manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this matter was known later, it would be a stain that he could hardly
        erase in his life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This had never happened to Jiang Yang in his long years of cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this body was not too weak now, and it was difficult to bear more of
        his Dao fruit cultivation, he would absolutely borrow more power and
        strike to kill Gu Changge to clear this stain in his life.
      </p>
      <p>"No?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's brow was still furrowed and he looked deeply at Jiang Yang,
        as if he wanted to see him through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang gritted his teeth and stared at him without any fear, with a
        frank and self-assured look.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason why Yaoyao just became like this, in fact, he already had a
        guess in his mind and similar to the previous idea, Yaoyao's origin was
        not simple, involving the Dao fruit of a certain existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's own understanding of the Dao fruit was very deep, and at
        this time, it was even more unquestionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that, he didn't know whether Gu Changge really didn't know
        or faked it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If I find out that you lied to me, even Yaoyao will not be able to save
        you at that time."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge coldly snorted, his eyes were deep and cold, containing a
        frightening killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This voice fell on Jiang Yang's ears, but it was like a terrifying
        thunder blast, making him feel a tinge of sweetness deep in his throat.
      </p>
      <p>His five internal organs were shattered!</p>
      <p>There was a puff!</p>
      <p>Gu Changge let go of his hand.</p>
      <p>
        The big hand that was condensed by black runes, scattered in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang fell to the ground, his face was in a mess, his fists were
        clenched tightly, and his heart was filled with coldness and killing
        intent.
      </p>
      <p>"I will kill you!"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang roared lowly in his heart, it was the first time he wanted to
        kill someone so much.
      </p>
      <p>It was simply hatred.</p>
      <p>
        But his mind was overwhelming, and his expression still did not look
        much abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Gu Changge's face gradually returned to calm, unable to show the joy
        or anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system's frantic prompting voice rang out in his mind at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, the Daughter of Luck, Yaoyao resisted the Son of Luck, Jiang
        Yang, the Son of Luck was damaged, and you gained 8,000 Luck points and
        40,000 Destiny value!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, publicly humiliating the Son of Luck, Jiang Yang, the Son of
        Luck's Luck is damaged, and you gained 2,000 Luck points and 10,000
        Destiny value."
      </p>
      <p>"Ding‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        A series of system sounds made the smile in Gu Changge's heart deeper
        and deeper.
      </p>
      <p>Things were still developing in the direction he had predicted.</p>
      <p>
        According to this trend, Jiang Yang's Luck points would soon fall to a
        low point.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period, he actually kind of wanted to let Jiang Yang
        continue to be a treasure hunting mouse, but considering Jiang Yang's
        current cultivation, the chances prepared for him would not be of much
        use to himself.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 230-2: Jiang Yang is exhausted, Its good to sit back and wait
        for the benefits at this time (2)
      </h4>
      <p>So Gu Changge also gave up on this.</p>
      <p>
        The current Luck points contained in Jiang Yang's body were still tens
        of thousands, and they were still starting to grow with time.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge felt that it was his backhand that was starting to work.</p>
      <p>
        "Master, I don't know what's going on, this power somehow appeared‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        And in the Gu Changge‚Äôs embrace, her face was also all confused and she
        also did not know what just happened to herself?
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that because what Jiang Yang said was too angering to her,
        falsely accusing the Master, so she wanted him to shut up, and then felt
        a power that she could not refuse emerging from the center of her brow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This power was so powerful that she could destroy the sky and the earth
        with just a slight wave of her hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Forget it, if you don't know, from the aura just now, this power should
        have no effect on you, but you shouldn't expect this power to do
        anything either."
      </p>
      <p>
        "This power doesn't seem to be under your control." At that Gu Changge
        sighed and nodded.
      </p>
      <p>
        And hearing these words, Yaoyao's heart became more and more confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could it be that her origin was really as complicated as her Master
        said?
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now she had a strange feeling, as if she could overlook all living
        creatures, no matter what existence it was, she could be indifferent to
        it, and it would not make any difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, Gu Changge swept a glance at the many living cultivators in front
        of him, and didn‚Äôt bother.
      </p>
      <p>
        He took a step, instantly swept over ten thousand miles, taking her out
        of this place, returning to the Immortal Lun Sect, as if to understand
        more about what exactly had gone wrong with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching the two disappear, Jiang Yang, who was standing in the same
        place, with that calm face, also gradually couldn‚Äôt see clearly. He no
        longer had the previous calm and aloof expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Things have come to this, I can not let him live! If I invoke those
        means and arrangements, it is possible to put this guy to death, and by
        then Yaoyao will not suspect me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression became very cold, and many thoughts flashed
        through his mind.
      </p>
      <p>He finally made up his mind.</p>
      <p>
        Because he also felt the pressure, and knew that he was unable to keep
        everything firmly in control.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a small matter to lose face, but if Gu Changge ruined his plan,
        then it would be too late to regret.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now he must find a way to use the rest of the backhand, under the
        premise that Yaoyao would not suspect him, he had to get rid of Gu
        Changge, who was in the way.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        What happened outside the Immortal Lun Sect today, although it was only
        a minor incident, it also caused a huge sensation, it spread quickly,
        causing a huge earthquake among many forces in the Heavenly Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators also learned that the little girl beside that Superior
        Immortal was not simple either.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        But no matter what, many cultivators also witnessed the terrifying might
        of that Immortal with their own eyes, who could cause heaven and earth
        to topple with just one thought.
      </p>
      <p>Many rumors quickly spread around the world.</p>
      <p>
        After Gu Changge returned to the Immortal Lun Sect, he first comforted
        Yaoyao, reassuring her that she would not become another person, and she
        was still the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if she turned out to be the rest, he was still her Master, which
        would not change.
      </p>
      <p>
        And after getting Gu Changge's assurance, the little girl then calmed
        down and showed a happy smile. After all, she was very afraid that she
        would become another person in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the process, Gu Changge also told her quite a few things about the
        Immortal Lun Ancestor, saying that Jiang Yang was probably taken over by
        a divine soul left by the Immortal Lun Ancestor in the Immortal Lun
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        All kinds of signs and evidence showed that he was not talking nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        After hearing this, Yaoyao did not suspect anymore, and just as Gu
        Changge thought, she planned to take this revenge on Immortal Lun
        Supreme.
      </p>
      <p>The fact that he had made a mistake, Gu Changge did not care.</p>
      <p>
        During this period, Gu Changge kept an eye on Jiang Chuchu's movements
        in the Inner World, wanting to see if there were cultivators from the
        Human Ancestor Hall who had rushed to this realm based on her reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there were, he would have to ambush them first and kill them in this
        realm, otherwise it would cause a lot of trouble and affect his next
        plan.
      </p>
      <p>But based on Jiang Chuchu's reaction, he seemed to be overthinking.</p>
      <p>
        His Inner World was completely independent and closed to the outside
        world, and it was also the highest level kind of world seed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless he took the initiative to open it, it was impossible for Jiang
        Chuchu to detect the aura in the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was still considering how to snatch the final chance of Jiang
        Yang's return of all worlds to one, but Jiang Yang was slow to move,
        which forced him to put the matter on hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest chance left for Jiang Yang today was also the biggest secret
        of his return of all lives to one.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>"This letter‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, in the cave, Jiang Yang was frowning at the letter in
        his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a letter written in a script that did not belong to this realm,
        and every word contained an amazing dao rhythm, so it could be seen that
        the person who wrote this letter had a complicated cultivation level.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was impossible for a cultivator in the Heavenly Star Realm to read
        this letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the letter was written in a very ancient script of the Upper
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang could naturally see it.</p>
      <p>
        "This was handed over to the disciple by a mortal at the foot of the
        mountain for the disciple to hand over to senior brother Jiang Yang‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>The disciple in front of the cave, said respectfully.</p>

      <p>
        "Okay, you can go down first." Jiang Yang nodded his head, his gaze with
        thought in it.
      </p>
      <p>The content in this letter made him frown uncontrollably.</p>
      <p>
        The other party knew his identity and stated outright that they came
        from the Upper Realm and agreed on a place for him to rush there to
        meet.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he hadn't met Gu Changge. R√™Ad latùôöSt chapters at n√¥(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m
        Only
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang might not have been suspicious, but now he was wary, how on
        earth did the other party know his identity?
      </p>
      <p>
        Since he knew that he was the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, why
        didn't he come to the Immortal Lun Sect himself, instead of choosing a
        place?
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Is it because he is worried about Gu Changge, the so-called Immortal?
          Or is there some other purpose?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        There were all kinds of doubts, so he did not choose to believe it
        first, and the main thing was since the other party claimed to come from
        the Upper Realm, then why was there no movement before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another point was also the most important, now, except for the people of
        the Human Ancestor Hall, he did not believe other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The most urgent thing is to rush to the place where that Nirvana Green
        Lotus was planted as soon as possible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Many thoughts flashed through Jiang Yang's mind, after all, he could pit
        Gu Changge to death in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, as long as he fused with that Nirvana Green Lotus, he could
        complete the first step of the plan related to the unification of the
        worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time came, he would borrow the Dao fruit, his strength was
        bound to rise sharply, unlike now, when he could not even not withstand
        one percent of its power.
      </p>
      <p>For this reason, he had planned for a long time.</p>
      <p>
        Finally, he chose such a realm, found the most suitable place, planted
        his Nirvana Green Lotus seed, waited for it to gradually mature out, so
        that he could pick it and fuse with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nirvana Green Lotus seed was a divine object that he had obtained
        only after many reincarnations and a lot of thought and calculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the seed of the Green Lotus that was rumored to have been
        nurtured by Chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, he even cultivated it with the aura of many worlds, and
        even exhausted the Luck of the entire realm to make it take root and
        sprout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, he found the most suitable place for its growth in an
        isolated place in the Heavenly Star Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang was not worried that someone would snatch the Nirvana Green
        Lotus from his hands, because in that place, he left many traps, only
        for such a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as it was there, no matter who came, they would be suppressed by
        all of his traps, and would get buried there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang thought so, and his expression gradually became profound,
        although it seemed that Gu Changge stood steadily with an upper hand,
        but under his many means, the entire situation would be reversed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as Gu Changge died, Yaoyao would be left without a Master, and
        she would have to rely on him as his sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Jiang Yang called out to Zhao Yi, the Supreme Elder of
        Immortal Lun Sect, and asked her to report the exact location about
        where the Nirvana Green Lotus was located to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I learned this by chance but if I were to tell the Immortal, he
        probably wouldn't believe me, so it's better for you to go."
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang pondered for a while and said to Zhao Yi.</p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi smiled slightly, then nodded and said, "I know, then I will just
        say that this matter is what I know from the mouth of my disciples‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 230-3: Jiang Yang is exhausted, Its good to sit back and wait
        for the benefits at this time (3)
      </h4>
      <p>
        She was also not stupid, since she decided to follow Jiang Yang then she
        must listen to his decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, she did not know what medicine Jiang Yang was selling in his
        gourd, why would he tell such a thing to that Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn't help but feel some palpitations and a chill went down her
        back.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, she felt as if she was caught in a terrifying whirlpool.</p>
      <p><i>Jiang Yang, is he preparing to scheme against that Immortal?</i></p>
      <p>
        <i
          >This kind of thing is too terrifying, if that Immortal detects it,
          the entire Immortal Lun Sect would probably be turned into ruins.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi's face turned pale while thinking about this, her divine soul
        seemed to be trembling and she felt very uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's okay, you just need to remember that this news was learned by
        chance from the mouth of a disciple, and it has nothing to do with me."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang looked at her and said indifferently, there were purple
        swirls in his eyes that seemed to contain a strange power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi smiled and nodded her head in disbelief, and she could only
        choose to believe Jiang Yang with a hard head.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang smiled and looked bashful.</p>
      <p>
        If this allowed Zhao Yi to gain Gu Changge's trust, that would be great.
      </p>
      <p>Even if it didn't work, that would not be a problem.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, as a person from the Upper Realm, as long as he knew
        something about it, he must know what kind of divine object it was and
        would definitely be moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, he was not afraid that Gu Changge would probe Zhao Yi's
        memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        He moved slightly, and Zhao Yi had already remembered the things she
        wanted to explain, firmly and forgotten the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        So even if Gu Changge searched her memory, it wouldn't reveal the
        slightest flaw.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, there is actually such a good thing. Why should this Immortal
        believe this?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the main hall, Gu Changge opened his eyes and among his deep
        eyes, many visions emerged as his aura appeared to be majestic and vast.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a cold expression, he looked down on Zhao Yi below and said
        indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>Zhao Yi's face was slightly pale and she was standing below in awe.</p>
      <p>
        "Your Excellency, this is true, I learned from one of my disciples that
        there is a green haze shining in the sky at the Netherland Heavenly
        Pond, a Green Lotus is shining through the Chaos, and there is an
        incessant Dao sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        She replied respectfully, forcing herself to calm down and not to panic
        so that Gu Changge would not notice the abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as Jiang Yang had instructed, she came to report this matter to Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Supreme Elder of the Immortal Lun Sect, her status could be
        considered unspeakably honorable and unparalleled.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in front of Gu Changge, she was still in awe to the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Netherland Heavenly Pond? A green lotus shadow shining through the
        chaos? A green haze shining in the sky?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded, revealing a thoughtful look, as if he was seriously
        pondering about Zhao Yi's words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi stole a glance at him and found that Gu Changge was really
        thinking about these words and his reaction was not very different from
        what Jiang Yang said.
      </p>
      <p>She couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief in her heart.</p>
      <p>There was even more admiration for Jiang Yang, he was right.</p>
      <p>
        About this news, Gu Changge was very concerned and did not doubt its
        authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        He even calculated this point, how the hell did Jiang Yang do it? What
        exactly was inside the Netherland Heavenly Pond?
      </p>
      <p>Zhao Yi also had all kinds of doubts.</p>
      <p>"Did you tell anyone else about this matter?"</p>
      <p>
        And at this time, Gu Changge spoke again. ùíÇll new stùíêries at
        n0ve/lbi/ùíè(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>His cold gaze fell on her, causing Zhao Yi's face to turn pale.</p>
      <p>
        Cold sweat appeared on her forehead, as if it was difficult to withstand
        this terrifying pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't dare to conceal it from the Immortal, I only told you about
        this matter."
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi hurriedly replied, practically suffocating under this gaze, even
        though she was a Great Sacred Realm cultivator!
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you dare to deceive this Lord, then there is no need for the
        Immortal Lun Sect to continue to exist."

      <p>
        Gu Changge's voice was still indifferent, his voice contained a
        monstrous killing intent and endless bloodshed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if Zhao Yi dared to deceive him, then the entire Immortal Lun Sect
        would usher in the most terrifying massacre!
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi's face turned white, and her throat was so sweet from these
        words that her internal organs were about to rupture.
      </p>
      <p>
        She even said that she didn‚Äôt dare, then hurriedly bid farewell, not
        daring to stay here any long.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, after seeing Zhao Yi disappear, the cold indifference on Gu
        Changge's face dissipated.
      </p>
      <p>
        "At this time, you still dare to calculate against me, Jiang Yang, not
        bad, it‚Äôs just that this kind of tactic is too ridiculous‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>He let out a snort of disbelief.</p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi's performance could not be more normal, but it was impossible
        for Gu Changge to believe her.
      </p>
      <p>He knew that this was arranged by Jiang Yang as soon as heard this.</p>
      <p>
        As for the purpose, it was to make him go to that Netherland Heavenly
        Pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could Gu Changge not see such an obvious meaning of digging a hole?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, if it was an ordinary cultivator from the Upper Realm, he
        would have been fooled at this time and would have rushed to the
        Netherland Heavenly Pond with impatience.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, it was Gu Changge who knew Jiang Yang's identity long ago
        and had the upper hand, so he could understand all of his methods.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, Jiang Yang might still be able to kill many people.</p>
      <p>For example, Yue Mingkong who ventured to the Lower Realm.</p>
      <p>
        "It seems that there should be many traps of Jiang Yang there in the
        Netherland Heavenly Pond, that's why he is so confident‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I really have to thank you, Jiang Yang, for directly telling me where
        the opportunity was, and for saving my time."
      </p>
      <p>"Since you can set a trap, I can not set it?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's smile became intriguing and somewhat faintly related.</p>
      <p>
        He definitely would not go to the Netherland Heavenly Pond before Jiang
        Yang, he would go after Jiang Yang, sit on the sidelines and reap the
        benefits.
      </p>
      <p>After so long, he could also consider closing the net.</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Jiang Yang, who got Zhao Yi's reply, could not help
        but reveal a smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p>"In this way, it also solves a lot of trouble‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang breathed a slight sigh of relief, his expression became more
        and more bashful and confident, already anticipating what was going to
        happen next.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This fellow Yue Mingkong has also come to the Heavenly Domain, with her
        means, she should already know who the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that she didn't take the risk to run to the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following days, Gu Changge also sensed Yue Mingkong‚Äôs location,
        which was actually not very far from the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>This caused him to ponder.</p>
      <p>
        From what he knew about Yue Mingkong, at this time Yue Mingkong would
        definitely think of ways to scheme against the Human Ancestor, just like
        how she did with Ye Ling last time.
      </p>
      <p>So, Gu Changge had almost guessed what she would do.</p>
      <p>
        It was just to find a way to inform Jiang Yang, confess her identity,
        say that she came from the Upper Realm to help the Human Ancestor on
        purpose, and then agree on a location for Jiang Yang to rush to.
      </p>
      <p>
        And she would wait there, to wait for the rabbit to catch the turtle in
        a jar or something.
      </p>
      <p>This method sounded pretty good.</p>
      <p>But the only problem was, would Jiang Yang believe it or not?</p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge felt that this time Yue Mingkong was afraid that the
        basket would be empty again, just like the last time she let Ye Ling go,
        and in the end he would have to do it himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Jiang Yang's view, he belonged to the kind of rabbit that does not
        see the hawk, and Yue Mingkong was not helpful to him and the Human
        Ancestor Hall had a relationship with the means of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang would believe it?</p>
      <p>
        He would believe at most three points, even if he went to the location
        of the appointment there would certainly be something that he would rely
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was possible that the confident Yue Mingkong would have to eat a big
        loss.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Gu Changge was a little angry and happy.</p>
      <p>
        She was his own preferred woman, but he still couldn't say anything
        about her, and she did all of this for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This silly woman, for these loopholes, let this husband help you solve
        it, but Jiang Yang is not that easy to kill‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>The corner of his mouth showed a smile with deep meaning.</p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge took a step, his figure moved and went to find
        Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>He intended to make a plan based on Jiang Yang's calculations.</p>

      <p>"Master‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing Gu Changge arrive, Yaoyao opened her big flawless black
        jewel-like eyes, with a good and obedient look.
      </p>
      <p>"Listen carefully, Yaoyao."</p>
      <p>
        "Next, Master is going to a place called Netherland Heavenly Pond, it's
        very dangerous there. Yaoyao, you should not follow Master, stay by your
        grandma's side."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stroked the head of the little girl in front of him, smiled
        gently and said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, you don't want Yaoyao anymore? How come you are leaving me
        here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as Yaoyao heard this, her eyes instantly misted up with water,
        thinking that Gu Changge probably didn't want her anymore, which was why
        she was left behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that, Gu Changge showed a rare dumb smile, "Yaoyao is so good and
        obedient, why would this Master want to leave you behind?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It‚Äôs just that this time, the thing is different, the Master forebodes
        a strong danger, if I take you with me, I wouldn‚Äôt feel at ease, afraid
        that I might not be able to protect you."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry, with this Master's ability, in this Lower Realm, there is
        nothing that can hurt me."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, didn't you say that Yaoyao is a great person? Yaoyao should
        also be very powerful, I can certainly help you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Didn‚Äôt Yaoyao also
        suddenly have a very strong power that day?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though Gu Changge had already explained this, Yaoyao still shook
        her head and looked like she wanted to follow him.
      </p>
      <p>There was no other way.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had to show a straight face, the smile on the face of the
        convergence, it was not his usual gentle look.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Nonsense, how can this be mixed up, Yaoyao, you are not even listening
        to your Master now?"
      </p>
      <p>He put up a fight.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao also did not dare to retort anymore, and said with a watery look,
        "Master you must go?"
      </p>
      <p>
        She was very smart, Gu Changge‚Äôs attitude was serious, that could only
        mean that the place he was going to was really dangerous, even he was
        not sure.
      </p>
      <p>That was why he didn't want to let her get involved in the danger.</p>
      <p>This made Yaoyao's heart both worried and touched.</p>
      <p>
        "I have to go and try, knowing that this is a trap, but I don't want to
        give up. This is really making people refuse." Gu Changge sighed
        slightly, and then nodded his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I know, Master, Yaoyao will be waiting for you to come back." At this
        point, Yaoyao had to nod her head.
      </p>
      <p>From Gu Changge's words, she heard a lot of meaning.</p>
      <p>Knowing that it was a trap?</p>
      <p>
        Could it be related to her brother Jiang Yang, who was scheming against
        the Master?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Yaoyao's expression suddenly became much angrier,
        completely different from her usual expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't find any evidence that her brother Jiang Yang had been taken
        over, but her hatred for Jiang Yang had actually reached the peak.
      </p>
      <p>"That's the way to listen."</p>
      <p>
        Then, as Gu Changge was about to leave, he gave her another look and
        shook his head slightly, and said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, if this Master does not return within a month, you should
        follow your brother, he should not hurt you as long as he still has the
        rest of his purpose‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"But this Master should be back soon."</p>
      <p>After saying that, he left the small-faced Yaoyao.</p>
      <p>
        With a single step of his feet, the void became blurred and his figure
        instantly disappeared into the high sky outside the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>And noticing that Gu Changge left the Immortal Lun Sect.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang, who had been having his attention on the other side, had a
        faint smile on his face, "It seems that he still can't help it."
      </p>
      <p>"This is the place I have specially laid out for you to be buried."</p>
      <p>
        He felt that since Gu Changge suddenly left the Immortal Lun Sect at
        this time.
      </p>
      <p>Then he must be heading for the Netherland Heavenly Pond.</p>
      <p>
        It was just that he did not dare to send someone to follow Gu Changge
        for fear of being detected by him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the many means and arrangements within the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond, would be encountered by the rest of the people who dare
        to intrude, except him.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time would arrive, there were only two possibilities, either
        die or be trapped there for a long time, with no way to escape!
      </p>
      <p>
        As the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, Jiang Yang once left behind
        a terrifying trap.
      </p>
      <p>That was why he was so confident.</p>
      <p>"All said you are only in the third layer‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        After leaving the Immortal Lun Sect, the smile on the corner of Gu
        Changge's mouth looked somewhat playful, and he did not head in the
        direction of where the Netherland Heavenly Pond was located.
      </p>
      <p>Instead, he went forward to the place where Yue Mingkong was.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, he did not want to rendezvous with Yue Mingkong, but intended
        to help her in secret, so as to convince Jiang Yang to go to the place
        where she had already set up to catch the turtle in the jar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's means were exhausted, this good show was about to be
        staged, and Gu Changge was now waiting to reap the benefits sitting on
        the sidelines.

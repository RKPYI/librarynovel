          expression on Tang Wan’s face suddenly changed. Chu Hao clearly
          noticed the Communication Rune in her sleeve light up, so he guessed
          that the Tang Family must have had needed her to attend to some
          matter.</span

          previously still deeply entrenched in his heart, Tang Wan being forced
          by Gu Changge previously, he got worried. Thus, he wanted to check up
          on what she was tasked to do, and he used his divine sense to search.
          Naturally, he made sure Tang Wan would not be able to detect it.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Gu Changge. Of course, whatever orders she had received from the
          Communication Rune were from Gu Changge.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This scene made Chu Hao so enrage and out of breath that his
          expression suddenly changed. He almost couldn&#8217;t stand it and was
          about to ask Tang Wan about it directly. However, when considering
          that Tang Wan had no choice in the matter, he gave up. But his
          expression still didn&#8217;t look good.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Uncle Master, I’m already aware of what you’ve just said, that
          is why… I still need to become stronger, so that the Tang Family
          behind Wan’er won&#8217;t dare to look down upon me, and won&#8217;t
          dare to insult me so casually.&#8221; After taking a deep breath, Chu
          Hao finally calmed down. He knew that it was useless to be angry at
          this time. The most and only important thing, was to improve
          one&#8217;s own strength.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Hao’er, that’s a great way of thinking. When your cultivation
          level increases in the future and you are in charge of the Supreme
          Cave Heaven, no one will be able to bully you anymore. Although Gu
          Changge is powerful, he is only a Junior of yours after all.&#8221;
          Hearing this, Bai Yang smiled slightly to express his agreement. He
          treated Chu Hao as his own son and thought highly of him. That was why
          he rushed over from the Supreme Cave Heaven in a hurry after he heard
          that Chu Hao got oppressed by Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >During this period, he stayed in the Vermilion Bird Empire for half a
          month, worrying that Chu Hao would be bullied by Gu Changge. However,
          it was just as what Tang Wan had said to him before. As long as Chu
          Hao didn&#8217;t take the initiative to provoke Gu Changge, he
          wouldn&#8217;t care about such a nobody.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >During this period of time, Chu Hao was also worried that he would be
          attacked by Gu Changge, so he stayed in the capital of the Vermilion
          Bird Empire and didn&#8217;t dare to leave. But it seemed that Gu
          Changge had really forgotten about a nobody and an unimportant person
          like him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This made Chu Hao feel relieved, but at the same time, he felt more
          displeased and aggrieved. After all, he was someone who had been
          cultivating religiously, never stepping out to the world. Even now, he
          was a peerless young prodigy, and someone who would be in charge of
          Supreme Cave Heaven in the future. Yet, Gu Changge held no regard of
          him at all, and this huge difference made him feel extremely
          uncomfortable.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Uncle Master, do I still have to go to the Black Tortoise
          Empire with Wan’er?&#8221; Chu Hao then asked. He had already guessed
          who Tang Wan was going to meet when he followed her here. After the
          last incident, he had a faint resistance to this kind of thing. He was
          afraid that he couldn&#8217;t help but make a move if he saw something
          he wished not to.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if you go. I heard that Gu Changge is
          in trouble now. He is on the way to deal with Purple Mansion’s Sky
          King Zhi Yang, so he probably won&#8217;t have time to care about you.
          You can find a place to stay after you arrive at the Black Tortoise
          Empire. I&#8217;ll help you to find out what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;
          Bai Yang thought for a while and replied. He was worried that Chu Hao
          would not be able to control himself and take action because of Gu
          Changge. This way, it was more reasonable for Gu Changge to take
          action against Chu Hao.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The present Chu Hao really did not stand much of a chance when
          fighting against Gu Changge. And because Chu Hao had offended Gu
          Changge, he got into a little trouble in Supreme Cave Heaven. After
          all, his action had caused many Elders to be dissatisfied.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I will listen to Uncle Master.&#8221; Chu Hao nodded and
          stopped bringing up the topic. Then, the two of them concealed
          themselves again and followed Tang Wan secretly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the Dragon Carriage, Tang Wan was preoccupied with her worries.
          She held her dress tightly, having no idea that the two were following
          her in the sky. She was still recalling the matters Gu Changge had
          suddenly informed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although, in the Communication Rune, he didn&#8217;t say anything
          more; she knew it must have something to do with what had happened
          recently. This made her very nervous, uneasy, and even scared.</span

          >&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine how powerful Gu Changge actually is. If
          my guess is right, the method he used before was greatly related to
          the Successor of Demonic Arts.&#8221; With a serious look on her face,
          she couldn&#8217;t help shivering at the thought of what had happened
          before.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >During this period of time, she had looked up relevant ancient books,
          trying to find information related to her Slave Mark. She didn&#8217;t
          find anything in the beginning. When she had a thought that was
          disadvantageous to Gu Changge, she would automatically submit and feel
          fear.

          >Fortunately, heaven rewards those who work hard. At last, Tang Wan
          saw a brief record of words on an old and worn-out page. Although the
          record was very vague, and the methods in it were not completely the
          same as the Slave Mark that Gu Changge had used; she was sure that it
          was the same as what he had done at that time.</span

          Demonic Arts. This discovery sent chills all over her body. After
          relating this with the recent news and rumors, she increasingly felt
          that Gu Changge’s methods were terrifying and unfathomable. [If he is
          really the Successor of Demonic Arts, it would be beyond belief. No

          >After he escaped from Gu Changge, he didn&#8217;t immediately return
          to this place. Instead, he was worried that Gu Changge might have used
          some tricks on him. After that, Qin Wuya stayed in another city for a
          few days to make sure that Gu Changge had left nothing on or behind
          him. Then, he returned here and met up with Sky King Zhi Yang.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing this, Sky King Zhi Yang glanced at Qin Wuya, but his face was
          still gloomy. This time, in his opinion, he was sure that it would
          succeed. After all, Qin Wuya was on the move in person. Was there
          anything he couldn&#8217;t handle? But, something had to go wrong. The
          Successor of Demonic Arts had suddenly sent someone out to kill Liu
          Ziyan. And worst of all, Gu Changge noticed. As a result, all his
          plans fell short of success. Not only that, Liu Ziyan even grew to
          hate him. He had to admit that he had gone too far this time.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although Sky King Zhi Yang had some complaints about this, he also
          knew that it was not Qin Wuya&#8217;s fault. Who would have thought
          that the Successor of Demonic Arts would suddenly show up?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Damn it! The Successor of Demonic Arts ruined my plan. He not only
          framed me but also made me take the blame for him! Prince Ying,
          I&#8217;ll never forgive you!” Cursing, Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s face
          darkened as he clenched his fists. A horrifying aura surged around him
          as if it could change the direction of mountains and rivers, and the
          stars would fall, making this place shrouded in a depressing
          atmosphere.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now, apart from Gu Changge, Prince Ying, the Successor of Demonic
          Arts, was another person that Sky King Zhi Yang hated the most.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Junior Brother, this matter is very strange. In my opinion,
          the person you need to worry about most now is actually Gu Changge.
          Have you ever thought about the possibility that Gu Changge and the
          Successor of Demonic Arts are actually the same person?&#8221; Upon
          hearing Sky King Zhi Yang cursing, Qin Wuya frowned and said
          seriously. It was a thought he had that even made him feel like
          trembling. It even required him to collect his resolve to say
          something like that.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What?&#8221; Hearing this, Sky King Zhi Yang was stunned. His
          eyes widened in disbelief.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Eldest Senior Brother, why are you say that?&#8221; Then, he
          realized how serious the matter was. His face turned serious and he
          asked in a low voice in a hurry. [With Qin Wuya&#8217;s personality,
          he would not suddenly say such unreasonable things with no basis. He
          must have sensed something…]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;To be frank, I have only thought about it carefully these days
          before I suddenly realised it. At that time, I hid outside Gu
          Changge’s palace compound for several days. If there was someone
          lurking, I would have noticed, but there wasn’t. The appearance of
          that black robed man was very strange, as if he appeared out of
          nowhere. So, I suspect that he is actually one of Gu Changge&#8217;s
          men. In order to show up, he played a trick where the thief poses as
          the judge. And when I fought against Gu Changge then, although he
          looked injured, his real strength was not affected at all. Who in the
          world can remain alive after activating a Sacred Emperor Grade
          artifact a few days after hurting their Source?&#8221;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Junior Brother, this explains his terrifying Talent. Also,
          under this hypothesis, many doubtful things can now be explained.
          Don’t you think that Gu Changge always comes in at the perfect time,
          every single time. If he hasn&#8217;t calculated and planned all of
          this, I would never believe it.&#8221;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Qin Wuya explained. His voice was frightening and cold, and it was
          also trembling slightly, causing cold sweat to break out on Sky King
          Zhi Yang&#8217;s back.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even though Qin Wuya had gone through a lot of things in the Nine
          Realms, he was still frightened. Even his soul was trembling in the
          face of this situation. Before this, he had never thought that a
          person would be so terrifying.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the surface, he was a man who pursued righteousness, leader and
          the strongest of the younger generation. He was radiant, with hundreds
          of millions of people admiring him and regarding him as if he was a
          God.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Moreover, he shouldered the future of many forces. As long as he does
          not die, he would definitely be the most powerful figure, and the one
          to stand at the top in the Upper Realm. In other words, his future was
          limitless.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the flip side, in secret, he was the most terrifying being, the
          Successor of Demonic Arts. He hid in the darkness, devouring the
          Sources of many young prodigies, and had caused great chaos in the
          world.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Elderest Senior Brother, what you’ve just said is simply too
          terrifying….&#8221; After hearing this, Sky King Zhi Yang
          couldn&#8217;t help but tremble with fear. It sent chills down his
          back and he became extremely alarmed. He thought of the many
          possibilities and consequences if Gu Changge was the Successor of
          Demonic Arts. It would be simply beyond belief. It would bring
          unimaginable disaster to the Upper Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I only suspect this to be a possibility. It&#8217;s impossible
          for me to show evidence. Gu Changge is far too cautious. The so-called
          Successor of Demonic Arts, Prince Ying. He must be as unlucky as
          you.&#8221; Qin Wuya sighed and didn&#8217;t know how to comfort him.
          [Just how did Junior Brother offend such a terrifying person? Whoever
          offends Gu Changge would need to be prepared for their worst
          nightmare.]</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Senior Wuya, what should I do now? If he comes here suddenly
          right now, is my only choice to surrender without a fight?&#8221; Sky
          King Zhi Yang&#8217;s face turned pale and his voice trembled with
          fear. He had never thought of this possibility before Qin Wuya
          explained everything. But now, his head was buzzing and he was
          extremely frightened.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the Successor of Demonic Arts, Gu Changge not only pinned the
          blame for everything on him, but also wanted to kill him in the name
          of justice. Furthermore, if this was true, his situation was much more
          horrendous and desperate than it seemed.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >&#8220;At this time, perhaps only the Sect that is backing you, can
          save you. If I fight with Gu Changge, the chances of winning would
          only be fifty-fifty. It is said that he is seriously injured, but in
          fact, he is very healthy. He had deceives everyone, and is playing the
          world as if it is in the palm of his hand.&#8221;</span

          >Sky King Zi Ya’s expression darkened. No matter which choice it was,
          he couldn&#8217;t achieve both. The only solution at this time was to
          wait for Purple Mansion to send out its experts to protect him.</span

          Divination&#8230;&#8221; Out of the blue, Sky King Zhi Yang recalled
          the scene from the very beginning, when he had planned to use the
          Foreseeing Eye to pry into Gu Xianer’s future. [At that time, wasn’t
          she imprisoned in a dark and wet dungeon by Gu Changge, at her last
          gasp? If Gu Changge is really the Successor of Demonic Arts, all of
          this would make sense. Damn it! She is in danger! And she has no idea
          how horrible and terrifying that cousin of hers is!]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[No! I have to tell her of all this. I have noticed her searching for
          me outside these days. We can&#8217;t hesitate this time…] Thinking of
          this, Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s expression suddenly became firm. His
          fists clenched as if he had made a decision.</span

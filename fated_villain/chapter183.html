        <h4>Chapter 183: If its Xianer, I Shall Accept this Request; Acknowledging Her Identity to the World!</h4>
        <p> ——— </p>
        <p> In truth, she was still quite worried that Gu Changge would refuse the Great Elder’s request, but it seems
            that her previous speculations were completely off. </p>
        <p> However, it was clear the Great Elder intended to protect her. </p>
        <p> ‘The mind of Gu Changge is truly unpredictable and unfathomable.’ </p>
        <p> ‘It’s practically confirmed that he holds no malice towards her, but who knows whether he has any hidden
            motives?’ ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com</p>
        <p> ‘Who can say for sure what might happen in the future?’ </p>
        <p> At that moment, Gu Changge saw the Great Elder, Gu Xian'er and Gu Nanshan all looking in his direction. </p>
        <p> Fortunately, he already had a speech prepared in his mind. His expression remained unchanged, as he spoke
            with a faint smile,<b> “Please forgive me for not being able to accept the Great Elder’s request…”</b> </p>
        <p> When they heard this, the trio’s faces immediately changed. Gu Xian'er's petite face had instantly lost all
            its color, turning pale. </p>
        <p> Her body trembled. </p>
        <p> She clenched the corner of her skirt with a force so strong that her knuckles turned white. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge has spoken. But did he truly intend to get rid of her so soon? </p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge, you…”</b> </p>
        <p> The Great Elder's expression turned cold, unable to seal their deal by swearing with his Dao Heart. It was
            now sure that Gu Changge had something in mind for Gu Xian’er, and he couldn’t go without being able to harm
            her. </p>
        <p> How could he possibly trust Gu Changge? </p>
        <p> Gu Changge didn’t seem to have heard the Great Elder’s words. He prattled on, cold and indifferent as his
            voice fell on Gu Xian’er’s ears. </p>
        <p> <b>“Don't you think that this request is too excessive? To make me swear with my Dao Heart that I will not
                harm my enemy by any means. Does that not mean I would practically be waiting for death?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Such a request, Great Elder, if it were you, would you agree to it?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge smiled faintly. </p>
        <p> At this point, he naturally had to control the right to speak. </p>
        <p> <b>“This…”</b> the Great Elder too frowned, <b>“I was negligent.”</b> </p>
        <p> He’d ignored something important. On the off-chance that Gu Xian’er were to try to kill Gu Changge in the
            future, then wouldn’t Gu Changge be powerless? </p>
        <p> To sit back and wait for death, to be captured, just waiting for death? </p>
        <p> His request simply asked for the impossible. </p>
        <p> Unless… Gu Xian’er was to do the same. But could he truly make her swear with her Dao Heart that she would
            let go of all her hatred? </p>
        <p> He shook his head. That was even more unrealistic. He was so focused on protecting Gu Xian'er that he
            completely forgot who Gu Changge was. He was someone who would never accept a loss. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er got over her initial shock and started to carefully think about the situation. </p>
        <p> This request was unfair to Gu Changge. Knowing him, he would never accept it. </p>
        <p> If it were her, would she willingly swear with her Dao Heart that she wouldn’t harm her enemy in the future?
            Not unless there was something wrong with her brain. </p>
        <p> She might consider it if that enemy was somewhat special to her. </p>
        <p> Ultimately, she understood. However, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss. </p>
        <p> ‘Gu Changge still treats me as an enemy…’ </p>
        <p> Various thoughts passed through the three’s minds, as Gu Changge opened his mouth once more. With a serious
            tone, he said, <b>“However, if it’s Xian’er, then… I shall accept this request.”</b> </p>
        <p> ‘What?!’ </p>
        <p> As soon as she heard the words, Gu Xian'er froze, her eyes widening. </p>
        <p> She simply couldn't believe her ears. </p>
        <p> Perhaps she’d heard it wrong. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge made his points, only to agree in the end? </p>
        <p> ‘He actually agreed to such an excessive request?’ </p>
        <p> ‘Was he truly prepared to leave himself defenceless for the foreseeable future?’ </p>
        <p> For a brief while, her heart welled with a wide range of complex emotions… joy, happiness, excitement,
            sourness, like a broken mixing jar that contained a confusing mix of different flavours. </p>
        <p> <b>“As I said, Changge had good intentions…”</b> </p>
        <p> Although Gu Nashan was quick to react, he too was confused as to why Gu Changge had agreed. However, that
            didn’t stop him from praising Gu Changge for doing the right thing. </p>
        <p> From the perspective of the family, this was naturally the best possible situation. </p>
        <p> As long as Gu Changge promised not to hurt Gu Xian'er, everything would be fine. </p>
        <p> Naturally, Gu Nashan was ignorant of Gu Xian’er’s background. He had no idea that she had several masters
            with terrifying cultivation bases as well as a ‘Peach Tree’ with an incredible origin that he wouldn’t dare
            to even imagine. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge had taken all of this into account. He would never stake his life so easily. </p>
        <p> <b>“Since you said so, then I hope you will keep your promise. You should be aware of the consequences if
                you break the oath of the Dao Heart.”</b> The Great Elder responded by nodding his head, his eyes
            clouded with uncertainty. </p>
        <p> He wondered if he had been wrong about Gu Changge. Although he acted like a heinous fiend, he hadn’t reached
            the point of being truly heartless. </p>
        <p> ‘Was there some hidden agenda behind the bone digging back then?’ </p>
        <p> He looked at Gu Xian'er, who was frozen in place with an inexplicable gleam in her eyes and shook his head.
        </p>
        <p> ‘It appears I must find a suitable time to tell her about this matter.’ </p>
        <p> ‘Was he born with a demonic nature?’ The Great Elder pondered. Initially, he had no interest in this matter,
            but now he wanted to get to the bottom of it all. </p>
        <p> After that, Gu Changge spoke with a calm expression, <b>“Can the Great Elder be at ease now?”</b> </p>
        <p> Even if Gu Xian'er wanted to kill him, Gu Changge could suppress her at will. He had nothing to fear. </p>
        <p> Not only that, but at present, Gu Xian’er had no such intentions. </p>
        <p> As for the oath of the Dao Heart? Gu Changge doesn't think it will affect him in any way. How many times has
            he sworn by his Dao Heart? </p>
        <p> If the oath truly held such power over him, then it would be better to take back his words. </p>
        <p> <b>“I hope you won’t disappoint this old man.”</b> The Great Elder nodded. </p>
        <p> <b>“Then I’ll have to trouble the Great Elder regarding the True Dragon Clan.”</b> Gu Changge said with a
            smile. When the time comes, Gu Changge will show up again, and with his status as the heir of the Heavenly
            Dao Immortal Palace, the True Dragon Clan’s submission was a foregone conclusion. </p>
        <p> Once he controls the power of the True Dragon Clan, it will be much easier to control the entirety of the
            Ancient Immortal Races. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge had a big appetite, so he naturally wouldn’t stop there. </p>
        <p> His current target may be limited to the Ancient Immortal Races; however, he’ll soon make moves against the
            other Daoist Sects across the Immeasurable Heaven. </p>
        <p> And when he finally controls the entirety of the Immeasurable Heaven. </p>
        <p> That’s when he will reveal his sharp claws and fangs to the world. </p>
        <p> The Great Elder’s figure disappeared, as he left for the Ancient Immortal Continent once more. </p>
        <p> He gave his word to Gu Changge, and he would deliver. </p>
        <p> <b>“Was Xian'er touched by her elder brother just now?”</b> </p>
        <p> Then, Gu Changge looked at Gu Xian'er, who was still slightly dazed and asked with a soft smile. </p>
        <p> He didn't need Gu Xian'er to answer. </p>
        <p> He in fact already knew the answer, from the system’s message prompt, he again, from Gu Xian'er, obtained a
            great number of Destiny Points and Fortune Value. </p>
        <p> <b>“Who would be touched by you? You have no good intentions.”</b> In response, Gu Xian'er couldn't help but
            glare at him and take a few steps back, moving further away from him. </p>
        <p> She was trying to conceal her rapidly beating heart. </p>
        <p> <b>“That's good.”</b>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p> The smile on Gu Changge's face also disappeared and became calm, <b>“Remember what I said to you, don’t hold
                any sentiments for me. In the end, you’ll be the one to regret it.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Quit your nonsense, Gu Changge. Who would have any sentiments for you?”</b> </p>
        <p> Having been exposed, Gu Xian'er was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, glaring at him fiercely. </p>
        <p> This was the second time that Gu Changge had said these words to her. </p>
        <p> Once, it might have been an accident. </p>
        <p> But what did it mean for it to be said twice? </p>
        <p> Currently, Gu Xian’er was having misconceptions that Gu Changge was anticipating something to happen in the
            near future. </p>
        <p> She was in a joyous mood just now, only to have it be replaced with annoyance. </p>
        <p> <b>“Changge…”</b> </p>
        <p> Seeing that Gu Nanshan was about to speak, Gu Changge's eyes moved slightly, then he smiled and said, </p>
        <p> <b>“Please rest assured, ancestor.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Acknowledging Xian'er’s identity, it's quite a simple task, I only need to give a word.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Nanshan nodded his head and also closed his mouth. </p>
        <p> Although he was an ancestor, it was impossible for him to force Gu Changge into doing something he was
            unwilling to. </p>
        <p> After all, at present, Gu Changge was the face of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. He was their Young Master,
            someone that couldn’t be taken lightly. </p>
        <p> If Gu Xian’er were to be publicly acknowledged by him, then not only he but also the rest of the Ancient
            Immortal Gu Family will be disgraced and become the object of ridicule for all the Daoist Sects. </p>
        <p> He had to save face and would do such a thing willy-nilly. </p>
        <p> Thus, Gu Nashan would like to know how exactly Gu Changge would do it. </p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge, I don't need you to acknowledge my identity. I don't care.”</b> Gu Xian'er said. She carried
            not the least bit of courtesy for Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> <b>“Then I suppose I’ll just sit back and enjoy the show as the Sea King Palace retaliates against you. How
                about it?”</b> Gu Changge casually replied. </p>
        <p> He will never get used to her when she acts so arrogant. </p>
        <p> The pawn called the Sea King Palace has been at play for quite a while now. Naturally, he has to put it to
            use. </p>
        <p> Of course, if Gu Xian'er insists on acting tough, Gu Changge will make her understand what it means to be
            truly beaten. </p>
        <p> <b>“You…” </b>Gu Xian'er gritted her teeth. With its profound background, how could she not fear the Sea
            King Palace? </p>
        <p> Gu Changge rarely looks down on people. </p>
        <p> However, if such an event truly came to pass, then she can just escape back to Peach Village. </p>
        <p> Even if the Sea King Palace was strong, was it strong enough to unify all the sea creatures and go against
            the Peach Village? </p>
        <p> <b>“Stop fooling around and behave. Your brother has specially prepared this opportunity for you.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“You should have been the Young Lady of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, a jewel amidst the crowd.”</b>
        </p>
        <p> <b>“That is the identity that you deserve.”</b> </p>
        <p> At that moment, Gu Changge looked at her, his face carrying just the perfect soft smile, as he spoke. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er had never seen such a gentle appearance from Gu Changge. For a while, she was completely stunned.
        </p>
        <p> Her small brain buzzed; she couldn’t quite hear his last words. </p>
        <p> [TL/N: The author just called her dumb lmao] </p>
        <p> The only thing that echoed in her mind was the phrase “stop fooling around”. </p>
        <p> Suddenly, like a cooked crab, Gu Xian'er felt her cheeks turn bright red. </p>
        <p> ——— </p>
        <p> When the news of the Sea King Palace's strongest sea creatures rushing to the Ancient City of Heavenly Dao
            spread, it quickly shook the entire Immeasurable Heaven, attracting the attention of countless cultivators
            and creatures. </p>
        <p> As the ancient force that has ruled the Infinite Sea for countless years, the might of the Sea King Palace
            was beyond doubt. </p>
        <p> They were the subject of envy among many Great Immortal Sects and Supreme Daoist Sects who dare not provoke
            them so casually. </p>
        <p> However, the fact that the female disciple of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace's Great Elder killed the
            Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace in the Ancient Immortal Continent caused a huge stir. </p>
        <p> [PR/N: An absolute mouthful.] </p>
        <p> Many cultivators assumed that the Sea King Palace would be outraged and force the Heavenly Dao Immortal
            Palace to hand over the female disciple. </p>
        <p> The identity of Gu Xian'er was no secret in the Immeasurable Heavens nowadays. </p>
        <p> Her last name was Gu, but she was not acknowledged by the Ancient Immortal Gu family. </p>
        <p> In other words, Gu Xian'er was probably an outcast of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, having been expelled
            from the family. </p>
        <p> However, she had killed the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace. </p>
        <p> Most cultivators believed that the Ancient Immortal Gu Family wouldn't go against the vast and ancient Sea
            King Palace just because of an expelled descendant. </p>
        <p> Such a move was ill-advised. </p>
        <p> Even the Great Elder of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace would probably be unable to protect Gu Xian'er.
        </p>
        <p> He was powerful, but even he can't possibly resist such a great powerhouse. Furthermore, it was unlikely
            that the entire Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace would turn against the Sea King Palace just because of a
            disciple. </p>
        <p> Therefore, when the Sea King Palace marshalled their ancient warships and fiercely began their hunt, many
            treated it as though it were already over. </p>
        <p> The reception was mixed: a split between regret and pity… the young girl whose talent was said to be
            formidable enough to match that of Gu Changge’s death was set in stone. They couldn’t help but feel a deep
            sense of pity. </p>
        <p> The Sea King Palace demanded an explanation. </p>
        <p> Therefore instead of going to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family first, they rushed to the Heavenly Dao Immortal
            Palace! </p>
        <p> <b>Rumble!</b> </p>
        <p> At that moment, ten million miles to the east of the Ancient City of Heavenly Dao, there were vast warships,
            covering the sky with a terrifying aura. </p>
        <p> The terrifying aura swept across the sky, causing heaven and earth to tremble. </p>
        <p> There was a vast array of creatures assembled under the banner of the Sea King Palace: shrimp soldiers and
            crab generals from the deep sea, their origins accentuated by blue runes that rushed to the sky. </p>
        <p> Their eyes were filled with murderous intent, as they charged straight towards the Heavenly Dao Immortal
            Palace. </p>
        <p> <b>“The Sea King Palace is approaching fast, and it seems that persecution is inevitable! They demand
                justice for their Seventh Princess.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“The members of their young generation fought, but they met their match, leading to their deaths. How can
                they possibly say they’re here to seek justice?”</b> </p>
        <p> The cultivator beside him frowned, disgusted by the actions of the Sea King Palace. </p>
        <p> <b>“No, only people with a good background can say that. If you’re a nobody and you offend the other Young
                Supremes, can you truly say that you were fighting? It can only be called digging your own grave.”</b>
            Another cultivator replied with a sneer. </p>
        <p> <b>“Yes, that's quite true.”</b> The rest of them sighed. </p>
        <p> <b>“But I heard that the situation actually has to do with a girl surnamed Gu. She was being hunted, and
                when she was in danger, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family – Gu Changge – intervened. He
                was angered that his clan members were being pushed around, so he suppressed the Seventh Princess of the
                Sea King Palace.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Afterwards, the young girl surnamed Gu killed the Seventh Princess of the Sea King's Palace, causing
                this whole commotion.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Yes, it's a pity. Other than the Great Elder, I’m afraid there will be no one to protect her. Did I get
                that right? The Sea King Palace has caused such a large fuss, and yet the Ancient Immortal Gu Family
                doesn’t seem to have made a move.”</b> </p>
        <p> Within an ancient city, cultivators discussed amongst themselves. </p>
        <p> As they were talking, they soared into the sky, morphing into divine rainbows as they followed from afar
            with the intent of observing the commotion. </p>
        <p> They weren’t aware of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family’s secrets, let alone the many powerful individuals
            behind Gu Xian'er. </p>
        <div id="pf-9473-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> The Sea King Palace, no matter how strong it was, can't do anything to Gu Xian'er. </p>
        <p> In fact, Gu Changge has been long aware of this fact. </p>
        <p> However, couldn't he use the Sea King Palace? Obviously, this force was meant to be Gu Xian’er’s EXP, a
            wonderful pawn. </p>
        <p> <b>Rumble! </b> </p>
        <p> Tens of thousands of sea creatures covered the clouds in the sky, their terrifying might resounding from
            millions of miles away. </p>
        <p> [PR/N: At this point, I’ve given up on scale. You do you, author-san.] </p>
        <p> They arrived outside the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace. </p>
        <p> <b>“Hand over the murderer!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace hand over Gu Xian'er!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Justice for the Seventh Princess!”</b> </p>
        <p> They all shouted, their voices loud and overwhelming. </p>
        <p> Above the warship of the Sea King Palace, a blue-haired general appeared, with a medium build and cold,
            indifferent eyes. </p>
        <p> <b>“Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace, hand over Gu Xian'er!”</b> </p>
        <p> He was the Sea Clan's Great Commander. He too shouted, intending to force the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace.
        </p>
        <p> The death of the Seventh Princess had aroused the Sea King's anger. </p>
        <p> All the creatures of the sea across billions of miles were all affected and were punished by the Sea King.
        </p>
        <p> The blue-haired general stepped forward, wielding a blue trident and exuding a terrifying aura. </p>
        <p> The enormous pressure of the Great Sacred Realm was vast and boundless, transforming into a matchless Great
            Sacred Dharma Body that stood tall in the sky. </p>
        <p> Its eyes were like a vast lake that blocked out the sky. </p>
        <p> Runes imbued with the power of Rules morphed into long chains, entwining around the trident in his hand.
        </p>
        <p> The terrifying pressure of the Great Sacred Realm shook the heavens and earth, demonstrating its
            unquestionable might. </p>
        <p> Countless cultivators and creatures, who witnessed and perceived it with their own eyes, were all wide-eyed
            and left breathless. </p>
        <p> It's one thing to speculate, but it's a whole other thing to witness it with your own eyes. </p>
        <p> <b>“The Great Sacred Realm's Dharma Body!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“The Sea King Palace must truly be furious to have sent out such a powerful figure.”</b> </p>
        <p> The crowd of cultivators retreated towards the safe area, their faces pale with fear. </p>
        <p> If a battle were to break out… </p>
        <p> The strike of a Great Sacred Realm being was far beyond their ability to resist, even if they weren’t in the
            direct line of fire. Their bodies would be obliterated, and their souls would depart just from the
            aftermath. </p>
        <p> <b>“Great Sacred Realm! It’s actually a Great Sacred Realm…”</b> </p>
        <p> The Elders of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace paled under this terrifying pressure, feeling as though their
            very souls were about to freeze. </p>
        <p> They themselves were merely at the Sacred Realm. When faced with the might of the Great Sacred Realm, they
            would only end up falling. </p>
        <p> <b>“The Great Elder has yet to return to the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace; what should we do now? Should we
                ask those Old Freaks for their aid?”</b> The expression on their faces turned grave all at once. </p>
        <p> They were unaware of the many grudges between Gu Xian'er and Gu Changge. However, they felt that – without
            the Great Elder’s help – no one would be able to stop the Sea King Palace’s general. </p>
        <p> Even the Palace Master's cultivation was only at the Peak Sacred Realm. </p>
        <p> <b>“Though the Sea King Palace came in force, Gu Xian'er is the disciple of the Great Elder. I'm sure they
                won't dare to act too recklessly.”</b> </p>
        <p> Just as the elders and disciples of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace nervously looked at one another… </p>
        <p> In the sky, a divine rainbow passed by, followed by the appearance of a slender figure. </p>
        <p> She stood in the sky with her elegant skirt and bare feet. </p>
        <p> It was none other than Gu Xian'er, her delicate face carried a calm and composed expression. </p>
        <p> In the face of the vast and terrifying array of creatures gathered under the Sea King Palace’s banner
            outside the mountain gate, she was calm and unafraid. She seemed calm and collected, not a trace of fear
            could be seen. </p>
        <p> <b>“I'm here.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er indifferently announced. </p>
        <p> For a moment, the heavens and the earth fell silent. Many cultivators and creatures looked at her in shock.
            No one expected her to take the initiative and reveal herself. </p>
        <p> After all, before her were tens of thousands of the Sea King Palace’s creatures, alongside many hidden
            experts. </p>
        <p> Not only that, but a terrifying existence in the Great Sacred Realm stood right in front of her! </p>
        <p> Where did Gu Xian'er's bottomless confidence come from? </p>
        <p> The Ancient Immortal Gu Family didn’t react, and the Great Elder was nowhere to be found. Even the Heavenly
            Dao Immortal Palace chose to remain silent! </p>
        <p> Compared to the army assembled before her, her figure appeared to be very thin. </p>
        <p> <b>“This little girl has guts. Has she come to meet her fate? Very well, perhaps you’ll be spared some of
                the pain.”</b> </p>
        <p> Hao Miao, the sea creatures’ general’s cold gaze fell upon Gu Xian’er as he spoke with indifference as if he
            had already sentenced her to death with his words. </p>
        <p> <b>“Do you know how the Seventh Princess died?”</b> Gu Xian'er's expression was calm and composed, and she
            asked indifferently. </p>
        <p> <b>“How did she die?”</b> The great Commander, Hao Miao's face froze as his eyebrows formed the picture of
            anger. </p>
        <p> At this moment, the tens of thousands of sea creatures behind him were furious as well. They’d never
            expected that Gu Xian’er would be so bold as to bring up this matter herself. </p>
        <p> They were enraged, wanting to tear her into a thousand pieces. </p>
        <p> <b>“Because she bullied me.”</b> </p>
        <p> In the face of all the sea creatures’ hatred and fury, Gu Xian’er remained perfectly calm as she said these
            words. </p>
        <p> <b>“You…”</b> </p>
        <p> The great Commander, Hao Miao, was furious. Despite no one daring to stand up for her, Gu Xian’er dared to
            provoke them. Who could have expected it? </p>
        <p> If courting death was a subject, Gu Xian’er would get an A+. </p>
        <p> [TL/N: It's no surprise after all, Protagonists are usually very well versed in courting death.] </p>
        <p> With a sudden wave of his palm, the terrifying aura condensed into a golden palm, on which Dao Runes and the
            Great Sacred Rule shone with seemingly enough destructive power to suppress everything. </p>
        <p> The void trembled and shattered! </p>
        <p> However, right then, a pill shot up, and a terrifying light bloomed from within it. </p>
        <p> A burst of Sword Light was released, completely shattering General Hao Miao’s attack. </p>
        <p> Immediately afterwards, Gu Changge slowly stepped forward from the void. </p>
        <p> At that moment, an endless immortal Qi poured from his body. His aura grew to an unfathomable degree, as a
            Great Dao Dharma Body emerged behind him. </p>
        <p> <b>“Someone in the Great Sacred Realm taking action against a small girl. Do you not find it very
                degrading?”</b> </p>
        <p> He laughed uncaringly in the face of the terrifying pressure exuded by the general. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge didn’t intend to play coy, but this was precisely the opportunity he needed. </p>
        <p> The Sea King Palace dug their own graves. Naturally, he wanted to cause a larger scene. That way, the shock
            factor would be even greater. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er remembered what her ancestor Gu Nanshan had said to her, telling her to stand out boldly and with
            confidence. </p>
        <p> With an ancestor who killed a Quasi-Supreme with a single slap and countless trump cards in her hands,
            needless to say, Gu Xian’er wasn’t worried about her safety. </p>
        <p> Thus, she stepped forward without hesitation. </p>
        <p> However, she didn't expect that – rather than Gu Nashan – it would be Gu Changge who stood up for her, the
            same as he did last time. </p>
        <p> ‘Is this how he intends to acknowledge my identity to the world?’ Gu Xian'er stared blankly and unblinkingly
            at Gu Changge with her glassy eyes. </p>

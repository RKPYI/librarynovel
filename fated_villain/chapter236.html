        Chapter 236-1: Brother and sister torn apart, I can finally start to
        close the net (1)
      </h4>
      <p>Jiang Yang's appearance caused Yaoyao to become frozen for a while.</p>
      <p>
        She didn't expect him to arrive at the Netherland Heavenly Pond in order
        to find her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, she reacted and her small face involuntarily surfaced with anger
        along with a strong ice-cold look, she didn‚Äôt say anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, this was the culprit who pitted her Master against the
        Netherland Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, if the person she missed the most was Gu Changge then
        the person she hated the most was definitely Jiang Yang!
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for Jiang Yang, why would her Master rush to the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond, and why would he have been in danger there leading to his
        death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that the current Jiang Yang was not her brother, but an
        old demon who took over her brother‚Äôs body, the former Ancestor of the
        Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, she and the silver haired granny both heard
        about the Immortal Lun Sect encountering the siege of the major Sacred
        Mountains and forbidden areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at the end, Jiang Yang activated the Immortal Lun Seal, overwhelmed
        all the incoming enemies and even destroyed the Immortal Lun Sect which
        had the inheritance of a million years.
      </p>
      <p>This move really shocked the two of them.</p>
      <p>
        Everyone did not know why Jiang Yang was able to activate the Immortal
        Lun Seal, but they were clear, because the divine soul that was inside
        Jiang Yang's body was the Immortal Lun Supreme!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Lun Seal was originally his weapon, so why couldn't he
        activate it? Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, after Gu Changge informed Yaoyao, Yaoyao informed Granny
        Yinhua.
      </p>
      <p>So both of them were very clear.</p>
      <p>
        Immortal Lun Supreme was the extremely legendary figure of the Heavenly
        Star Realm, it was said that he was not born in this realm, and no one
        knew where he came from.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finally founding the Immortal Lun Sect, he was nowhere to be
        found.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that day, in order to kill all enemies, Jiang Yang even did not
        hesitate to destroy the Dao Lineage once founded by his own hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this matter, one could see how heartless Jiang Yang really was!
      </p>
      <p>
        This made the two of them uneasy in their hearts, and their scorn for
        Jiang Yang became even deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
        The silver haired grandmother saw the icy cold look of Yaoyao, could not
        help but pull her back, gently shook her head, indicating that she
        should not be impulsive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the life and death of Gu Changge was determined, if Yaoyao and
        Jiang Yang tore apart the last remaining face, it would probably lead to
        bad luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because at that time, if she went in that strange state, she could lose
        control at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao also understood this, gritting her teeth to death, squeezing her
        small hands tightly, forcing herself to calm down at this time and not
        to fight hard with Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother, how did you know that I would be here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Then, she spoke softly, condensing poetic rhyme in her eyes, only calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I know that you are worried about the safety of that Master of yours,
        so as soon as I guessed, I knew that you would come here."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang smiled, noticing the icy cold look that Yaoyao just had, he
        didn't really care.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his eyes, Yaoyao was just a little girl, now the Master she relied on
        had fallen dead, who else could she rely on except her brother?
      </p>
      <p>
        The little girl might be distant and cold to him because of something,
        but he felt that this kind of thing was going to change with time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Jiang Yang's heart, after erasing the previous consciousness, there
        were actually also two remaining obsessions of that consciousness, one
        was the hatred for the Immortal Lun Sect. As he was unwilling to be
        thrown to dig the Immortal Road for so many years and had almost died in
        the middle of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second was as a responsibility of the older brother towards his
        young sister, he wanted to take care of her and let her live happily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang did not seriously care about these two obsessions before.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, his soul was incomparably strong; these obsessions could not
        affect him at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, he felt that if these two obsessions were not resolved, it
        would trigger unimaginable consequences.
      </p>
      <p>Even his divine soul would be unstable.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang had reincarnated many times, but it was the first time he
        encountered such a situation, and in the end he felt that the reason
        probably lay in Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this little girl's existence involved the Luck of the Realm that
        originally belonged to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "As an older brother, I would definitely worry about you. You just left
        without saying goodbye, it really made me uneasy. I was afraid that you
        would encounter any trouble."
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang smiled and continued to speak, walking closer to Yaoyao.</p>
      <p>Zhao Yi, who was following behind him, had a complicated face.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        This little girl, Yaoyao, was obviously hiding big secrets, otherwise
        Jiang Yang would not have such an attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days Jiang Yang's strong pit after killing all enemies and the
        kind of invincible aura had deeply shocked her.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Jiang Yang was like this to Yaoyao, which was even more shocking to
        her.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang was really too strong and too mysterious!</p>
      <p>
        Even that terrifying Immortal was killed by him in the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond. Zhao Yi felt that she had made the right choice in life
        by following Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Jiang Yang had a Great Sacred Realm maid that would solve many small
        troubles along the way, so he naturally didn't mind letting her follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother doesn't need to worry about Yaoyao, the two of us, me and
        Granny, will find my Master."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yaoyao shook her head softly, "He is so powerful, I don't
        believe that my Master will die here."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang did not refute, understanding that this little girl belonged
        to the kind of heart that would not die until it reached the Yellow
        River.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he revealed a faint smile and said, "Yes, after all, the strength
        of the Immortal is so strong, how will he be easily buried here?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "If one only looked at the rumors then that would be wrong. As the
        saying goes, live to see the dead, since I have come here, then I shall
        help you look for the Immortal together."
      </p>
      <p>
        The many tricks of the Netherland Heavenly Pond were far more terrifying
        than the Immortal Lun Sect, and that Immortal would have perished here
        even if his methods were heaven defying.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had said this, but not in order to deal with this little girl and
        then let her die.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao also knew that she could not refuse at this time, if she said too
        much it might cause Jiang Yang's suspicion, so she nodded, "Thank you
        brother."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang smiled, "Why thank me, helping you with this is the right
        thing to do."
      </p>
      <p>Yaoyao pursed her lips, and did not speak.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, a group of people headed towards the middle of the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearby mountains were unusually steep, all kinds of strange ancient
        trees, incomparably gnarled, hanging vines were hanging down from all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        High in the sky there existed layers of white mist floating down, giving
        birth to a chill and uneasiness in people‚Äôs hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it was normal, there would be more or less some living creatures,
        such as fierce beasts and other existences, but now it was way too
        quiet, in addition to the sound of wind, there were no movements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire Netherland Heavenly Pond was silent as if it was dead, except
        for their party, no more creatures appeared!
      </p>
      <p>
        Above many mountains, some Dao patterns intertwined, flowing there, like
        strange patterns, emitting brilliant and eye-catching light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deeper down, a thick Chaotic mist was visible, shrouding the heavens and
        earth in gray, as if they had come to the place where the heavens were
        stretched open!
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang gave them the explanation that there was a great battle here
        that day, and all living beings were estimated to have died in the
        aftermath.
      </p>
      <p>But Yaoyao and the silver haired Granny did not believe it!</p>
      <p>"The fish is finally here, it seems that I can close the net."</p>
      <p>
        "From today onwards, the Human Ancestor will not exist in the world."
      </p>
      <p>
        Deep inside the Netherland Heavenly Pond, Gu Changge sat within the
        Lotus body, devouring and refining the essence of the Nirvana Green
        Lotus. His eyes were profound, in which many mountains and seas sinking
        like terrifying scenes emerged.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge spoke to himself, his smile carried a vague
        deep meaning as he had already noticed several auras rushing outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao, silver haired Granny, Jiang Yang and his Supreme Elder maid,
        Zhao Yi.
      </p>
      <p>There were four of them!</p>
      <p>
        If he hadn't interfered, according to the normal plot, these four people
        would have been in the same boat, providing all kinds of help to Jiang
        Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, the pair of relatives, Yaoyao and Granny Yinhua, were already
        very hostile to Jiang Yang and were just about to tear their faces off.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for that Zhao Yi, normally, she should be taken in the harem by Jiang
        Yang later, after all, she had followed him to such a point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was not interested in her at all. Although she looked good,
        in fact she had exhausted her potential, and she could be slapped to
        death with one palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, under his layers of arrangement, the Human Ancestor left his tricks
        in the Netherland Heavenly Pond back then and a very large part of it
        was now under his control.
      </p>
      <p>But at this time Jiang Yang was still unaware of it.</p>
      <p><strong>Swish!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge's figure stayed still, a powerful and terrifying divine
        sense just like an unspeakable ancient god clad in a monstrous gray fog
        took the form of a Soul Palace that rushed out from between his
        eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under his method of visualization, the power of the gods alone could
        swallow the heavens and the earth and easily slaughter the Great Sacred
        Realm cultivators!
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Even a Quasi-Supreme would not necessarily be something to be afraid of!
      </p>
      <p>
        Steeply, a bizarre fluctuation began to appear above the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        A dense black demonic cloud covering the sky emerged from all directions
        and began to coalesce there, as if it was pushed by an invisible hand!
      </p>
      <p>The dome of the sky was obscured!</p>
      <p><strong>Rumble!</strong></p>
      <p>"Under my Lord's order!"</p>
      <p>"Attack!"</p>
      <p>
        A headless horseman, as if he sensed something, rushed out violently
        from within a blood-stained cliff with a monstrous aura!
      </p>
      <p>"As my Master commands!"</p>
      <p>
        In the other direction, an incomparably blurred blood-red shadow emerged
        from within the deep valley, with scarlet pupils, staring out with
        monstrous killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This place is really odd, but you and granny must pay attention, don't
        get too far from me, if something dangerous happens at this time, I
        simply wouldn't be able to help you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this time, on the mountain path, Jiang Yang walked in the front
        and said with an indifferent expression, walking through something that
        looked like a strange light evolving.
      </p>
      <p>Every inch of this place was filled with a terrifying aura.</p>
      <p>Formation patterns were pervasive and killing intent was rampant.</p>
      <p>But he was able to walk out of it unharmed, leading to the depths.</p>
      <p>
        Many terrifying auras surged only in the vicinity, and did not come near
        him a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        If ordinary people were here, their legs would probably go weak and they
        wouldn‚Äôt dare to move.
      </p>
      <p>But Jiang Yang was incomparably calm on the road.</p>
      <p>Did he say that he had no means? Who would believe it?</p>
      <p>
        In fact, at this time, without having to say much, Yaoyao had already
        understood through the Netherland Heavenly Pond that Jiang Yang was
        deeply related to this place.
      </p>
      <p>He must know a lot about the hidden secrets of this place.</p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, he would not be so confident to send out the news and let Gu
        Changge come here, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        And now although Jiang Yang said that he came here while looking for
        her, but in fact, he came to the Netherland Heavenly Pond, to find his
        opportunity!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of these, the icy cold look in Yaoyao's eyes became more dense.
      </p>
      <p>Even she did not notice the change that was happening to her.</p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, the silver haired grandmother on the side saw the peach
        blossom-like pattern starting to emerge between her eyebrows, the same
        as the last time when Yaoyao suddenly stormed out.
      </p>
      <p>This was completely without any reason!</p>
      <p>It was more like being stimulated in the same way.</p>
      <p>
        Her face couldn't help but change, after all, Jiang Yang was holding a
        Supreme weapon in his hand, would Yaoyao be a match for Jiang Yang even
        if she turned into that state?
      </p>
      <p>
        "This journey, in addition to seeing the traces of the great battle of
        that day, I did not see any corpses, although the Immortal has divine
        power, but I am afraid that he also had bad luck."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang walked in the forefront, looking at the Heavenly Pond nearby,
        and could not help but reveal a faint smile as he said.
      </p>
      <p>He finally arrived here.</p>
      <p>
        In the boundless Heavenly Pond, ripples spread continuously, with a
        layer of white mist, floating in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the deeper part, the Immortal fog was indistinct, the blue waves were
        rippling, and there was a green haze rushing to the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, it was this light that attracted countless cultivators
        and living beings, including that Immortal, who eventually fell here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Jiang Yang looked more and more calm, but there was
        regret in his heart that he did not personally take action to eliminate
        the Immortal from the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>After all, that was the only person who had given him such shame.</p>
      <p>
        This way he did not intentionally touch the tricks left back then, lest
        the abnormalities were seen by Yaoyao, and with his aura, those
        terrifying beings hiding in the shadows, would not dare to strike him.
      </p>
      <p>And at this time, Jiang Yang's brow suddenly frowned slightly.</p>
      <p>
        Outside the Netherland Heavenly Pond, there was a divine light rushing
        to the sky. He had thought that his speed was fast enough, but he didn't
        want to be followed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang did not know why the other party could repeatedly sense his
        movements.

        And it was obvious that the group was brought by the same mysterious
        woman who planned to kill him in the first place, pursuing him
        relentlessly. They had actually arrived here.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's been so many days, why haven't the people from the Human Ancestor
        Hall come here? Even other people know where I am, why doesn't the Human
        Ancestor Hall know? Is it possible that the Human Ancestor Hall has had
        an accident?"
      </p>
      <p>
        A vague feeling arose in Jiang Yang's heart that something wasn‚Äôt right,
        that feeling of being schemed against, surfaced again.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, that day, he could not wrongly perceive that secret fluctuation
        from the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the end, he did not see the person, but the other side used it as
        bait to attract him?
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not likely that the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall would fall
        into their hands, right?
      </p>
      <p>"Master disappeared from here?"</p>
      <p>"Master is really not here anymore‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>And at this moment, at the edge of the endless heavenly pond.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was staring blankly ahead, her face was white, muttering and
        looking incredulous.
      </p>
      <p>
        The turquoise like lotus leaves were laid one after another, one could
        not see the edge and the seam.
      </p>
      <p>Each one was green, as big as a face basin.</p>
      <p>
        Especially a dazzling Chaos Green Lotus, it was incomparably tall,
        accompanied by the Immortal spirit Dao rhythm, propped up there,
        emitting the rumbling sound of the world.
      </p>
      <p>All these various divine things were not relevant to her anymore.</p>
      <p>
        Because she did not see the Master, not to mention the figure, even the
        trace left at the beginning was missing.
      </p>
      <p>"Ooooooooo‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Master, you really do not want to die young‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Steeply, bean-sized teardrops, like a broken line, slipped down from her
        face, and it was difficult for her to accept this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        The silver haired granny‚Äôs face looked bitter, she also did not know how
        to comfort her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a short period of time, Yaoyao's Master was already in Yaoyao's
        heart and had an unparalleled status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now she had to face the fact that her Master died? Could she accept it?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, Mr. Immortal might have really fallen. You have to mourn and
        change. It was rumored that his body was beaten to pieces. There are
        many beasts here. I am afraid that he has been eaten completely, and
        there are no bones left."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I actually don't understand‚Ä¶ Why did he insist on coming to this place?
        He made you so sad‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, seeing Yaoyao crying there, Jiang Yang frowned slightly in
        his heart, feeling a little irritable.
      </p>
      <p>
        He knew that this was the emotion left after the strong fusion of the
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>However, it didn't affect him.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        On the surface, he still said with a regretful expression, trying to
        comfort Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>However, he didn't care at all, and even made a slight mockery.</p>
      <p>The person he wanted to kill had never lived!</p>
      <p>A mere Immortal from the Upper Realm, what the hell was this?</p>
      <p>
        "Shut up! It's you who caused my Master to be like this. If it wasn't
        for you, how could Master come to such a place? It's all your fault!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "At this time, you are still pretending to be pitiful, obviously you are
        the one who murdered my Master!"
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at this time, upon hearing Jiang Yang's hypocritical words,
        Yaoyao suddenly turned around.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her small body was trembling, with an icy expression she stared at Jiang
        Yang with incomparable hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could she bear it, Jiang Yang still said that about her Master at
        this time? Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao, what do you mean by that? It‚Äôs all my fault?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang frowned and said displeased, "I'm just telling the truth as a
        big brother."
      </p>
      <p>As he said that, he closed his eyes and his voice was a little low.</p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that this brother, in your eyes, is completely inferior to
        your Master?"
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang could feel the changes in Yaoyao at the moment.</p>
      <p>What did she seem to really notice?</p>
      <p>
        Or what did Gu Changge tell her when he left for the Netherland Heavenly
        Pond?
      </p>
      <p>
        "You old monster, not only occupying my brother's body, but now you are
        also planning to assassinate my Master‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Now, what are you pretending to be?"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's voice suddenly became very cold, it was hard to imagine that
        this expression would appear on a little girl like her.
      </p>
      <p>
        One must know that not long ago, she was still frightened by a gangster
        and her face turned white.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, this kind of change was not surprising to Gu Changge. After
        all, Yaoyao was the real Daughter of Luck in the Heavenly Star Realm.
        Even without him and the reincarnation of Human Ancestor, she would have
        undergone a huge transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, her original destiny template came from the most talented
        woman in ancient times, and she was also the fruit of the mysterious
        Peach Tree.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, he heard Yaoyao's words.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression suddenly changed, and then he became
        indifferent.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, what are you talking about? I'm your brother, have you
        forgotten about our childhood? At that time‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't talk nonsense, at this time don't be bewitched by demons and
        forget your own identity‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>He spoke warmly, ready to play the emotional card.</p>
      <p>
        When Yaoyao said this, she planned to tear her face off with him. To be
        honest, Jiang Yang was very surprised, and he didn't expect things to
        develop like this so suddenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        He guessed that Gu Changge said something for Yaoyao at the beginning.
        Otherwise, how could she be so sure?
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Therefore, Jiang Yang's heart was gloomy, and he hated that he didn't
        kill Gu Changge earlier, causing so many twists and turns for no reason.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>"Damn you!"</p>
      <p>"Yaoyao is going to avenge Master today!"</p>
      <p>
        However, Yaoyao had changed a lot, the place between the eyebrows was
        bursting with dazzling light, the Peach blossoms were blooming, it was
        extremely gorgeous, and she didn't listen to his nonsense at all.
      </p>
      <p>She rose into the sky.</p>
      <p>
        Her dress fluttered, her bare feet were like snow, the strands of laws
        and rules hung down, delicate like a flawless elf, but her face was as
        cold as frost.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, there was a kind of power that could break the sky and
        the earth that emerged on her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, with a swipe of her small hand, strands of Immortal
        light emerged, turning into peerless Immortal swords, containing the
        strongest attacking power, sweeping towards the bottom, destroying Jiang
        Yang!
      </p>
      <p>
        "When in the world did she notice me, did the Immortal tell her this
        from the beginning? It's really bad for me, and it's not a pity to die."
      </p>
      <p>"And it's much stronger than the last time‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Jiang Yang's expression became gloomy, Yaoyao actually had
        a fall out with him and planned to kill him.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, many of the arrangements he had already thought of were
        completely in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things had been like a wild horse, and were completely out of his
        control!
      </p>
      <p>
        But at this time, his top priority was to stop Yaoyao, so as not to
        affect his biggest plan.
      </p>
      <p>"Let me block her for you!"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression was very ugly, he waved his hand and a small
        crystal clear cauldron flew to Zhao Yi's hand behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, he implemented the many tricks in his hand and this
        piece of Netherland Heavenly Pond began to rumble.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the outermost side, there was a murderous intent soaring to the sky,
        along with all the awakening patterns, it had evolved into a place of
        lore, to resist the mysterious woman who came to the Netherland Heavenly
        Pond.
      </p>
      <p>The tricks he arranged had started to work!</p>
      <p>
        "Netherland Heavenly Pond is even more dangerous than the Immortal Lun
        Sect. It seems that Jiang Yang really intends to use this strange place
        to fly to the sky. If he succeeds, won't he escape from this world?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong, who saw this scene outside the Netherland Heavenly Pond,
        her brows wrinkled, and the mighty Golden Armored warriors behind her
        stood on the horizon, like heavenly soldiers and generals, fighting in
        all directions.
      </p>
      <p>She felt a sense of misunderstanding.</p>
      <p>
        In the Netherland Heavenly Pond, there was the biggest fetish needed by
        the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, there was also its biggest arrangement. If she entered this
        place by mistake, her body and spirit would probably get destroyed if
        she was not careful.
      </p>
      <p>Human Ancestor was still a cunning man, so he could not be ignored.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        At this time, the sky suddenly darkened, as if there was the most
        terrifying Chaotic demon, awakening in the deepest part.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying gray fog rose to the sky, and a pair of indifferent eyes
        appeared in it, overlooking heaven and earth!
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire Netherland Heavenly Pond, with a vast territory and no
        boundaries, was trembling at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Farther away, there were countless terrifying beasts, waking up
        everywhere, looking up into the distance, and were extremely frightened.

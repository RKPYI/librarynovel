          were outside Gourd Valley, had all sensed the astounding quakes coming
          from within. Rocks rolled down and mountain ranges collapsed to form

          >Judging by the recent phenomena, Lin Wu most likely had acquired the
          mysterious gourd which had belonged to the Spirit Gourd Master.
          Otherwise, the murderous energy suffusing the place wouldn&#8217;t
          dissipate so easily. However, this made them uncomfortable and
          panicky. Since Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t killed them, he definitely had
          other plans for them. He might use this to threaten Lin Wu into
          handing over the mysterious gourd. They couldn&#8217;t think of other
          purposes Gu Changge since he had left them alive.</span

          came to that conclusion. Grandma Lu Cui and the other Elders frowned
          soberly since they were weaker than him and would thus find it
          difficult to escape even if they combined their efforts. Their only
          final resort was to harness the energy from the stars outside the
          domain to both destroy this space and bury Gu Changge here.</span

          themselves for no reason when it wasn&#8217;t a critical moment? Would

          >The group from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains froze as Gu
          Changge seemingly confessed his intention. Their resolve was wavering
          now; would Lin Wu be willing to exchange the gourd for their lives and
          was it worth it? Lu Luo and the others knew him and his character
          well, and he would never disregard their survival.

          wouldn&#8217;t be up to Lin Wu. The Immortal-Killing Gourd
          didn&#8217;t just belong to Lin Wu but to the entire Eight Wastelands
          and Ten Domains. If it fell into Gu Changge&#8217;s possession, he as
          well as all of them would be considered traitors by everyone else. To
          many cultivators, their lives weren&#8217;t as important as the
          Immortal-Killing Gourd.</span

          about stealing it. Dream on; we will rather die than yield to your
          wishes.&#8221; Many from the older generation had realised Gu
          Changge&#8217;s dangerous intention and couldn&#8217;t help but
          complain. They looked reluctant to surrender in the face of death and
          besides, Gu Changge clearly intended for them to fall into disarray
          when he said that. Once they fell apart, what did they have to fight
          against him?</span

          had made the claim turn pale as they attempted to fight back. However,
          all their newly activated techniques almost immediately fell apart.
          They were all crushed and their bodies exploded as they died, filled
          with regret and desperation. They hadn&#8217;t expected Gu Changge to
          be so cruel and decisive, since it had merely been uttered to maintain
          their dignity and not because they were brave. However, Gu Changge had
          not cared either way and immediately struck them dead.</span

          members of the young generation even looked desperate; they had no
          qualms about dying on the battlefield while fighting their peers, but
          they were far too inferior compared to Gu Changge and dying in such a
          humiliating way made them feel dissatisfied. They forgot one thing,
          though; they were of a similar age as Gu Changge.</span

          through the sky and landed right there. The group was led by several
          Elderly people with accomplished cultivation and powerful vitality,
          who looked far more formidable than the youths. They all looked
          ancient and included humans and members of other races; all of them

          shocked them immensely. They couldn&#8217;t believe this. The young
          men and women behind him were taken aback as well. They hadn&#8217;t
          expected to see Gu Changge in the flesh after coming from billions of
          kilometres away, since he was like a mythical religious being in the

          before. He had even heard that their Sect Master, Chu Hao having
          disagreements with Gu Changge in the past and ended up losing against
          the other man. After returning to Supreme Cave Heaven, Chu Hao had
          painstakingly cultivated in isolation before finally reaching the

          couldn&#8217;t help but remember Gu Changge from when he had returned
          from the Lower Realm before. He hadn&#8217;t been made to be the Young
          Master back then and he had been extremely insolent, cold, and
          formidable. He had challenged all the young prodigies of the family to
          a fight where everyone took on him at once, yet all of them lost.

          her eyes brimming with tears. His coldness and forcefulness had made a
          deep impression on her. While she had been furious due to her youth
          back then, she had gotten over it as she grew older. Gu
          Changge&#8217;s strength had improved to the point where none of them
          could even catch sight of him; he would definitely inherit the status
          as the Head of the Immortal Gu Family soon enough. Thus, she no longer
          cared about those antics and assumed that he had long forgotten about

          with static. He was sceptical about it but didn&#8217;t feel like Gu
          Changge would lie to him. It had only been a short time, yet their
          Sect Master and a group of experts including several Elders had been
          slain by Gu Changge. The shockwaves it would elicit when it reached
          the outside world would be violent.

          >Who knew if Gu Changge&#8217;s accusation that the group had
          cooperated with the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were true? He
          could just accuse them of anything he wanted without worrying about
          what he claimed. Lu Luo and the rest had witnessed the entire event
          where Gu Changge killed Chu Hao. When had Chu Hao cooperated with the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains? The claim was baseless and Gu
          Changge was merely framing Chu Hao.</span

          >The group from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains became stricken
          and fell silent, not daring to protest or question him. The sight sent
          a chill down their spines and they were nearly suffocating from the
          waves of fear and desperation. What kind of power did Gu Changge have
          that made everyone so afraid?</span

          and anger simmered within his gaze although he did not dare show it
          and looked dejected. The other Upper Realm young prodigies distanced
          themselves from him, standing slightly far away.</span

          >Just then, a windswept figure suddenly appeared at the entrance of
          Gourd Valley. It was Lin Wu, who had gone in to get the
          Immortal-Killing Gourd. He looked winded and had sustained some
          injuries, showing how difficult the journey had been. The gaze he
          directed towards Gu Changge was full of shock and his expression
          turned stony when he saw Lady Lu Luo sprawled at his feet.

          fists. Gu Changge had come here when he was in Gourd Valley and bound
          everyone; it was what he could discern from the sight awaiting
          him.</span

          of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains looked slightly stricken. They
          were worried that he would act recklessly. With the Immortal-Killing
          Gourd, it would be hard to deal with Lin Wu as a normal cultivator
          even if he couldn&#8217;t fully control its power yet. They might have
          a chance at survival if he utilised it just a bit.</span

          stepping on him, that&#8217;s another matter entirely.&#8221;</span

          didn&#8217;t think Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t know who his brother was.
          To the other man, the event was like crushing an ant to death, so he
          wouldn&#8217;t even recall who he had killed.</span

      <h4>
        Chapter 250-1: Are you really interested in your cousin? No way, no way
        (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Near Peach Village, everyone saw this scene and couldn't help but froze.
        Even the old guys were wide-eyed and dumbfounded, unable to believe this
        scene.
      </p>
      <p>"This‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        The Chief of the Peach Village helplessly held his forehead. The rest of
        the old guys also looked helpless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er would choose to dig out her own Dao bone to help Gu Changge.
        It surprised them a bit, but they couldn't say much.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it was a private matter between the two of them. As Masters,
        the most they could do was to prevent Gu Changge from bullying Gu
        Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er would do this, and it was difficult for them to stop it.</p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge actually stopped her and said such a thing, which
        surprised them a little.
      </p>
      <p>Then it was to make them old guys feel flushed and ashamed.</p>
      <p>
        But thinking about it carefully, as an Elder Brother, there seemed to be
        nothing wrong with Gu Changge talking to his Sister like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, after saying this, Gu Changge also let go of Gu Xian'er.
        His bottomless eyes stared at her without speaking, appearing very calm.
      </p>
      <p>"Woooooo‚Ä¶ Gu‚Ä¶ Gu Changge, what are you talking about‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        After just realizing the meaning of what Gu Changge said. A haze
        suddenly appeared on Gu Xian'er's face, which was red and scary.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was in a panic, her heart was beating fast, and her voice was
        trembling. Even her words were not complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        She never thought that Gu Changge, who had always been indifferent to
        her, would suddenly say such gentle words.
      </p>
      <p>Why would he rather die than see her hurt like this?</p>
      <p>
        It was way too cheesy. And he said this in front of every one of the
        Peach Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Gu Xian'er's head buzzing for a while as if being hit by a
        hammer. Her hands and feet went weak as if she couldn't use her
        strength. If it were any other time, she would definitely talk back to
        Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with his current appearance, wasn't he worried about himself,
        showing his true feelings?
      </p>
      <p>This made Gu Xian'er unable to find words to say.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge suddenly revealed his true feelings, which completely
        exceeded her expectations. N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at

      </p>
      <p>Today, she probably would not be able to dig out her Dao bone.</p>
      <p>
        "What nonsense did I say? I didn't say nonsense. I‚Äôm just telling the
        truth."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shook his head, and his expression returned to his natural
        state, "Anyway, as your elder brother, I won't be reduced to the point
        where you have to dig your bones to save me. For me, this kind of
        humiliation is worse than death."

        "The grievances between us have already been cleared up. You don't owe
        me anything, and I don't owe you anything. I don't need you to pay me
        anything."
      </p>
      <p>His voice was still calm.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, if he didn't make it clear, Gu Xian'er was an idiot and
        might have thought about digging her own bone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she did have experience in growing Dao bone, it was difficult
        to say whether she could save her life after digging her immortal bone.
      </p>
      <p>Not to mention growing a third bone again.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge also didn't want her to take risks for no reason. After all,
        after digging out the immortal bone, what was its use?
      </p>
      <p>The problem in his body had already been resolved.</p>
      <p>Of course, this kind of truth could not be told to Gu Xian'er.</p>
      <p>"You have a tough mouth!"</p>
      <p>"That's not what you said just now‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Xian'er was a little indignant, and her beautiful eyes
        stared at him.
      </p>
      <p>
        She still remembered what Gu Changge said just now, and was obviously
        worried about her safety and didn't want to see her hurt.
      </p>
      <p>"Didn't I just say that?" Gu Changge said calmly.</p>
      <p>"Why are you so stubborn, can't you admit that you care about me?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er snorted. She looked as if she saw through Gu Changge's mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in Gu Changge's opinion, her expression meant that she needed a
        beating.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed that she got used to it too much.</p>
      <p>
        "Senior Taoyao has already told me how to solve the demonic matter, so I
        don't need you to cause trouble." Gu Changge then added.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why do you want me to cause trouble?" Hearing this, Gu Xian'er's face
        was displeased.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge shook his head and said nothing more.</p>
      <p>
        "Since the Senior has already told me the solution, why did you tell
        this idiot this method?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, he looked at Taoyao, and there was some deep meaning in his
        words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this Taoyao seemed to be peaceful and gentle, in fact it had a
        taste of watching the fun and not taking it too seriously.
      </p>
      <p>It really was monstrous.</p>

      <p>
        "Are you blaming me? After all, this is entrusted by Xian'er. Since I
        say so, it must mean that I am sure‚Ä¶" The words that came from the Peach
        Tree were as plain as water, not knowing whether she was happy or angry.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Gu Xian'er was able to give birth to the Immortal Bone, to be
        honest, it was because of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she dared to tell Gu Xian'er like this, she was not afraid that her
        life would be in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I begged Sister Taoyao to tell me, Gu Changge, don't blame Sister
        Taoyao."
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing Gu Changge's questioning tone, Gu Xian'er also hurriedly said,
        and was a little anxious.
      </p>
      <p>
        For fear that Gu Changge would hold a grudge against Sister Taoyao
        because of this incident.
      </p>
      <p>She knew very well about Gu Changge's vengeful character.</p>
      <p>
        Although he was not as powerful as Sister Taoyao now, if Gu Changge
        really wanted to deal with someone, with the background and forces
        behind him, it was still scary.
      </p>
      <p>
        But speaking of it, Gu Changge would scold Sister Taoyao so much because
        he was worried about her.
      </p>
      <p>This made Gu Xian'er a little happy.</p>
      <p>
        Since Gu Xian'er said this, Gu Changge naturally didn't say anything
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taoyao didn't speak anymore and regained her tranquility, and she let
        down strands of divine light to continue cleaning the injury for Yaoyao,
        who was sleeping peacefully under the Peach Tree.
      </p>
      <p>This scene made several old guys sigh with emotion.</p>
      <p>In the next few days.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge stayed temporarily in Peach Village with Gu Xian'er.</p>
      <p>
        He had to say that although it was in the depths of the Land of Immortal
        Abandonment, the scenery here was very beautiful, like a paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The morning sun was falling, the golden clouds were rising, and the
        spiritual energy was dense.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Peach Tree stretched here, the scenery here was dyed with a layer
        of splendid brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were also many spiritual birds and auspicious beasts nearby, but
        large beasts were afraid to approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the villagers here did not cultivate, their strength and their
        bloodlines were far better than that of many cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge's opinion, it had something to do with Taoyao's frequent
        grooming of their bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the guardian of the Peach Village, she treated these villagers very
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps as she said, living for too long was boring and she had to find
        something to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Gu Changge got to know a lot of Gu Xian'er's masters.
      </p>
      <p>Under the side effects, he found out a lot about their origins.</p>
      <p>
        As he had guessed, Gu Xian'er had two sets of destiny templates, and
        none of her masters were fuel-efficient lamps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origin of each one of them was amazing. They once made a name for
        themselves in the outside world, and they came here for various unknown
        reasons.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 250-2: Are you really interested in your cousin? No way, no way
        (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge's view, their real cultivation base could be estimated to
        have exceeded the Supreme Realm or even the Emperor Realm that had been
        sealed up to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        As everyone knew, only after the cultivator that had completed the Nine
        Heavens of the Supreme Realm could surpass the Supreme Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was actually a threshold between the Supreme Realm and the Emperor
        Realm, which was called the Quasi-Emperor Realm by many cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that the Quasi-Emperor Realm was not actually a realm, it
        was a title for cultivators who had surpassed the Supreme Realm, but had
        not yet reached the Emperor Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some time ago, the sky-shattering sword energy that appeared over the
        Sea King Palace was actually caused by one of Gu Xian'er's masters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her master temporarily left Peach Village for some personal reasons and
        went to the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he learned that Gu Xian'er was bullied by the guys from the Sea
        King Palace, and immediately cut it off with a knife.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the Ancestor of the Gu family was also there at the time,
        which forced the Sea King Palace to seal the sea for hundreds of
        thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        So one shouldn't look at the small Peach Village here, but its real
        strength was even more amazing than some Eternal Forbidden Areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        With such a terrifying background of Gu Xian'er, she could even
        challenge some Immortal Great Sages at will. DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels
        on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge also got a lot of good things from these old guys.</p>
      <p>
        During the discussion, from their perspective, some of Gu Changge's
        insights were also full of amazement, and they felt that the rumors of
        him being the reincarnation of a True Immortal were not false.
      </p>
      <p>
        They agreed that he was worthy of the title of the strongest person in
        the younger generation. He deserved to be Gu Xian'er's cousin, the
        person who would be in charge of the Immortal Sect and the Ancient
        Immortal Family in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as this innate demonic problem was solved, the Upper Realm would
        be Gu Changge's world in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, several old guys were also happy to pass on some tricks to Gu
        Changge, but Gu Changge naturally refused it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, his method of building goodwill in front of everyone played a
        big role.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, they were very rude to him, and they didn't like him
        at all. How could they be so polite now? By the way, he also got a lot
        of Luck Points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge estimated that it was because of the quest from the Daughter
        of Luck related to Gu Xian'er that he accepted at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er didn't know what Gu Changge was thinking about. Seeing him
        and his masters fighting casually, she couldn't help feeling a little
        relieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was worried that her masters would still have trouble with Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Gu Xian'er hoped that this period of time would last
        longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it was rare to see another side of Gu Changge, and he could
        get along well with a group of children in the village.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        In the past, he always gave people a feeling of being aloof and
        overlooking everything indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in the blink of an eye, several days passed. Gu Changge's figure
        appeared outside Peach Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the villagers, including Masters of Gu Xian'er, came to see him off.
        Many children were even very reluctant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Gu Changge taught them a lot in the past few days, and gave them
        a lot of things, including scriptures on cultivation, etc., which made
        many children feel that this exiled big brother was very good.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, people who could be good to children were not bad people.
      </p>
      <p>
        This point was basically a consensus among people, and it was also the
        reason why Gu Changge could quickly gain the trust of the villagers in
        Peach Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Junior will leave first. If I have time in the future, I will visit the
        Seniors again."
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Gu Changge spoke.</p>
      <p>
        With a faint warm smile on his face, he said goodbye to everyone and
        planned to leave Peach Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, there were still many things waiting for him to solve. It was
        impossible for him to stay here forever. Gu Xian'er didn't plan to
        leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of Yaoyao's sake, she planned to cultivate in Peach Village for
        a while, and all along, a few masters could take the opportunity to
        guide her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was not weak, she was much weaker than many ancient freaks
        who were recovering today.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the words of the old guys, Gu Changge also knew that they should be
        opening a small stove for Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next time he saw her, her strength should have improved a lot. As
        for Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn‚Äôt know how long it would take for her to wake up. Judging from
        Taoyao's words, although Yaoyao was a Dao fruit, she was seriously
        injured in that chaotic thunder tribulation.
      </p>
      <p>After all, it was a major injury, and its impact was not small.</p>
      <p>
        If he wanted her to recover completely, it would definitely take a
        while.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge naturally had nothing to say about this.</p>
      <p>"Changge, remember to come over next time, the aunties like you."</p>
      <p>
        "Why don't you stay for a few more days? Seeing the reluctance of this
        girl Xian'er, you are also cruel‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, seeing that Gu Changge was about to leave, several aunties
        said in succession, joking around, making Gu Xian'er, who was a little
        unhappy, suddenly embraced.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled, "I will come later."</p>
      <p>
        "Look at Xian'er's reluctance, why don't you stay for a few more days?"
        an old lady asked with a smile as if she didn't think it was a big deal.

        ‚ÄúWho is reluctant to give up, auntie, don't talk nonsense, I wish this
        tough guy quickly disappeared from my eyes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, Gu Xian'er quickly denied it, as if afraid of Gu
        Changge's misunderstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I wish she was quieter, lest it always sounds like there are flies
        whining around."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge glanced at her and said calmly.</p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, what do you mean, how do I annoy you? Then look at me in
        the future and walk around a bit‚Ä¶" Gu Xian'er hummed and was not
        expecting this. Before Changge left, she was even mad at him.
      </p>
      <p>But Gu Changge could no longer hear her words.</p>
      <p>
        At the moment when these words fell, Gu Changge turned into a divine
        light and rose into the sky, and directly left Peach Village without any
        stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was a little indignant and waved her little fist, "Damn, this
        guy won't listen to me and let me finish my sentence."
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, the expression on her little face turned a little dejected,
        showing reluctance.
      </p>
      <p>"Xian'er, are you really interested in your cousin? No way, right?"</p>
      <p>"You are siblings‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Seeing her expression, several aunties started joking again.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er looked at them angrily, "Don't talk nonsense, okay? Besides,
        what happened to the siblings, he's not my brother."
      </p>
      <p>
        But as soon as she said this, she felt that something was wrong, and
        quickly changed the subject, "The weather is good today, the sun is
        very‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who would have thought that today, all of this is really good luck!"
      </p>
      <p>This scene made several of her masters laugh.</p>
      <p>Then they all sighed.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        After leaving Peach Village, Gu Changge's figure appeared on the top of
        a mountain outside the Land of Immortal Abandonment.
      </p>
      <p>"Master."</p>
      <p>
        There were several figures in front of him, all of them were very
        powerful, and their expressions were extremely respectful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person at the lead was a creature in the shape of a Yaksha, and his
        cultivation was in the True God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the rest, there were both males and females, and there were also
        other ethnic groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the last incident in the Ancient Immortal Continent, many young
        Supremes found Gu Changge and planned to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge accepted them all with the idea of ??not refusing those who
        came to him. After all, sometimes many things could be left to them to
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, this time, he let them pay attention to the Absolute
        Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>They had already been ordered by Gu Changge to wait for him here.</p>

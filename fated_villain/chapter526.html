          her surrender to the Upper Realm. Instead, it improved drastically,

          hard to take full, unquestionable control over the entire Dynasty in
          such a short time. There were things to do every day, plus she had to
          free up her nights to accompany Gu Changge after he arrived. According
          to her, she couldn&#8217;t spare the thought of not being with Gu
          Changge. Though, such feelings were mostly because she hadn&#8217;t
          seen him for a while and couldn&#8217;t avoid deeply missing him. She
          wished she could just leave all her duties aside and stay by his

          However, he could feel that she was jealous. It had to be because they
          hadn&#8217;t seen each other for some time.

          issues like this. While she was usually forceful and domineering,
          mundane questions without any emotions or purpose in them were not
          something she would ever ask. Considering that he might be kicked off
          the bed later, he thought for a moment before smiling.</span

          in a smile. She didn&#8217;t care how the other person looked or how

          even have to lie to them since they would lie to themselves.
          Naturally, he had no plan to lie to them over such things. Besides,
          the Sky Deer Goddess was truly not as beautiful when compared to Yue

          her regression and the events in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains
          had greatly changed from her memories of the previous timeline, it

          possession. She didn&#8217;t even need to interfere too much for him

          appeared coming to personally welcome him. The rumours regarding his
          work in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains had already spread
          through the entire Upper Realm and many disciples of the sect looked
          at him with fever and reverence. Many even knew that the current Vice
          Sect Master, Lin Qiuhan. had been brought to the Sect personally by Gu
          Changge, so that connection made them closer to him.</span

          complimented her slender figure and made her look beautiful yet
          refined. Gu Changge felt that she was so much different from when she
          first came to the Upper Realm. It was a total metamorphosis. This
          satisfied him since it showed that the Sect had been honest in
          nurturing her.</span

          happened, while the Sect Elders all tactfully left. However, Gu
          Changge did notice several extraordinary-looking youths leaving with
          dejected looks in their eyes. They were clearly her admirers, which
          did not really matter to him. Anyone smart would know what to do when

          an appropriately warm smile on his face as he responded from time to
          time, like the first time they met.</span

          the Violet Supreme Alchemy Pill here in the Sect, which she did

          prepared many dishes for him in the kitchen, which was rare. Not only
          was she outstanding in the art of alchemy but her talents in cooking
          and serving tea were also superior. She just didn&#8217;t do them
          anymore after coming to the Upper Realm.

          sea and its surrounding areas into a spooky Demonic Domain filled with

          >The Upper Realm was celebrating because of the successful occupation
          of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. The war had lasted for a long
          time, and the ceaseless fighting had finally come to an end. While it
          wasn&#8217;t considered an external threat, it was still one less
          thing to worry about since something else became much more urgent for
          the different forces of the Upper Realm. The Eternal Overcast! It was
          an internal issue which had grievous consequences.</span

          >Of course, something else was being heatedly discussed in the Upper
          Realm, which was widely considered to be much more dangerous compared
          to the Eternal Overcast. The Successor of Demonic Arts, who had been
          in hiding for a very long time, had appeared once again!

          >The Successor had suddenly attacked the Successor of War Immortal
          Manor. The Successor of War Immortal Manor had nearly died as a result
          but thankfully, his guardian had found him in time and rescued him.
          The consequences would have been worse otherwise.</span

          >The Successor of War Immortal Manor was a being who had joined in the
          war effort in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, and was widely
          thought to be one of the strongest in the younger generation besides
          Gu Changge. His abilities were unrivalled, making him shine
          brilliantly on the battlefield, yet he had nearly died at the hand of
          the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span

          >The news elicited a shockwave and enraged many Forces. Those who had
          their disciples or Successors killed by the Successor of Demonic Arts
          became infuriated yet again, deciding to hunt down the Successor of
          Demonic Arts. Many had assumed the Successor of Demonic Arts to have
          disappeared and no longer caused havoc. Yet, he had struck again after
          several years and nearly killed someone so powerful. This frightened
          many people since the Successor had survived Gu Changge&#8217;s
          attacks many times, making him a very formidable enemy.</span

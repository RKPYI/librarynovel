        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Marry?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word occurred in Gu Changge&#8217;s mind, after which he smilingly answered, &#8220;Naturally.&#8221;</span><span id="more-33849"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky turned amber as the sun was setting. The two walked side by side in the palace as though they were a couple from heaven. Although they were whispering to each other, Jiang Chuchu could feel the sneaky gazes coming from the guards around her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since Tuo Ba Xiao Yao is now locked up in prison, should we go and kill him and seize the Sword of World Domination? The prison of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty shouldn&#8217;t be able to stop us.&#8221; On their way back to their chamber, Jiang Chuchu suddenly remembered the matter and asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shot with the unexpected question, Gu Changge placed his hand on her perfectly carved face, smilingly replying, &#8220;He will be killed eventually. I will also seize the Sword of World Domination eventually. &#8216;I,&#8217; not &#8216;we.'&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I can help…&#8221; Jiang Chuchu eagerly muttered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge gently shook his head. &#8220;No need. Don&#8217;t forget your identity, Saintess of Mortal Palace. You shouldn&#8217;t be tending to such matters.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having been influenced by Mortal Palace, Jiang Chuchu was instilled with the principle to maintain justice in the entire world. Therefore, assisting Gu Changge would only stain her Dao Heart for no good reason.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve already betrayed Mortal Palace for you. How will this matter?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu lowered her head as she understood Gu Changge&#8217;s intention.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want you to fall from your pedestal into the revolting abyss.&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s eyes were fixated on his face. She eventually agreed with him. In that instant, she felt that everything she had done for him was worth it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gu Changge returned to his chamber, as he expected, Yu Tianzheng was already there, silently waiting for him. Although Yu Tianzheng still bore reverence, he was still visibly frustrated, as though he needed Gu Changge&#8217;s explanation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You should go and get some rest,&#8221; Gu Changge asked Jiang Chuchu to leave with a smile before casually entering his room.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge.&#8221; Yu Tianzheng tremendously resembled Emperor Yu. His features were symmetrical, though he seemed a little older as seniority was all over his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had obeyed Gu Changge&#8217;s order to cease the assassination attempt on Yu Lie during the Hunting Event, but he could not fathom why Gu Changge ordered him to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had Yu Lie died then, the entire Great Yu Celestial Dynasty would have fallen into chaos, enabling Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s numerous traps to be used, which was also what he was to question Gu Changge about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Changge smiled and breezily asked, &#8220;What brings you to me?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He deliberately asked the question in order to test Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s attitude. [If Yu Tianzheng is smart enough to listen to my orders without questioning what he shouldn&#8217;t, I will let him off this time; if he doesn&#8217;t, I can only show no mercy.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is something that baffles me, and I was hoping you could give me some answers.&#8221; Yu Tianzheng raised his head and spoke with an interrogating tone, as he had been feeling frustrated for days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, what is it?&#8221; Gu Changge replied calmly as usual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng then looked him in the eye and said, &#8220;Young Master Changge, I agreed to work with you out of sincerity. Once I become the ruler of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, I swear an Oath to my Dao Heart that I will gladly surrender it to you. Yet, you wouldn&#8217;t tell me the reason as to why you had me give up on the assassination. If you haven&#8217;t forgotten our agreement, then are you working with Emperor Yu to take me down?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since his prior preparations had all gone in vain, he sounded rather discourteous. In fact, he assumed that it was his courteousness that made Gu Changge feel that he was easily bullied and taken advantage of.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His cultivation level was slightly higher than that of Emperor Yu, and the divine abilities and techniques the two of them cultivated weren&#8217;t totally the same either. Having intensively trained for years, he could even trump a True Daoist now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Yu Tianzheng predicted that if Gu Changge was still intent on plotting against the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, he would dare to lay a finger on him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, his words to Gu Changge were not only to vent his frustration, but also to let Gu Changge realise his importance. Therefore, his suggestions should be considered seriously in their next moves and plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, you came all the way here in the middle of the night solely to question me?&#8221; Gu Changge retained the subtle grin on his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Yu Tianzheng suddenly felt unnerved. Yet, he endured it and replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s not like that. I simply wish that you could give me an explanation, or the next plans…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What about the next plans?&#8221; Gu Changge interrupted him with a fascinated grin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I may not be as cooperative as usual in the next plans,&#8221; Yu Tianzheng straightforwardly stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letting out a chuckle, Gu Changge answered, &#8220;There&#8217;s really not much to it. I called off your assassination plan not because I was worried you might fail, but doing that would have interfered with a matter of mine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A matter of yours?&#8221; Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s face slightly changed. His voice bore a little anger. &#8220;What can be more important than the assassination?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is none of your business,&#8221; Gu Changge answered with a faint grin. Naturally, he wouldn&#8217;t tell Yu Tianzheng about the Sword of World Domination and Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of silence, Yu Tianzheng felt as if Gu Changge haven&#8217;t given him any respect. Growing irked, he clenched his fists and talked before turning around to leave. &#8220;Fine. If that&#8217;s the case, I shall tend to my next moves myself…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before he could finish his sentence, shock and disbelief suddenly surged on his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, you…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who said you could leave?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s face was as serene as ever. Without saying much, he extended his hand and it was as though the void was frozen. Accordingly, five colours Chaos Qi whirled around his giant palm, as though the sky was about to collapse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s hair stood up as his soul trembled. He could feel his body overwhelmed by a chilly sensation. He never expected Gu Changge to be so ruthless as to resorting to violence out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So that&#8217;s it…&#8221; Yu Tianzheng vexedly yelled. Despite knowing he was no match for his opponent, he attempted to parry to prevent any unwanted accidents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Cling!* The metal sound of a sword was heard. A crystalline Dao Sword appeared, with heaven and earth revolving around it, plunging down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Cling!* </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s giant palm surrounded by Chaos Qi did not evade the attack as it continued to charge. The crystalline Dao Sword slashed one of the fingers and fiery sparks erupted, yet it had no effect on the palm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng was shocked. His Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact was supposed to be indestructible, forged with Immortal Gold, yet it couldn&#8217;t even slash across one of Gu Changge&#8217;s finger. A terrifying shaking sound was emitted, as though everything was about to fall apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn&#8217;t fathom how Gu Changge managed to attain such a cultivation level, an unfathomable level.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* The next moment, the void before him crumbled as it was unable to withstand such overwhelming power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What traumatised Yu Tianzheng the most was how their surroundings were turned into Gu Changge&#8217;s personal domain, as if he sealed up every centimetre of the void. Even if Yu Tianzheng wanted to run, he had no way to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Forgive me, Young Master Changge… I apologise…&#8221; Dread surged on Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s face. Cracks appeared on the Dao Sword in his hand, which seemed to be the result of the sword clashing with Gu Changge&#8217;s palm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, the Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact—in terms of material—was on par with Nirvana Grade Artifacts, yet it failed to withstand Gu Changge&#8217;s effortless palm strike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Yu Tianzheng grew immensely remorseful. He thought he was strong enough as there were abilities that he had yet to use. Nevertheless, even if he were to resort to those means, the outcome wouldn&#8217;t be any different.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gu Changge must be a True Daoist! Perhaps not a handful of people in the world knows about this!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I detest people who think they are smart. If you wish to not die, surrender your Primordial Spirit, and let me plant a Slave Mark within you,&#8221; Gu Changge blandly ordered as he shackled Yu Tianzheng before pulling his Primordial Spirit out of his forehead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, he had no desire to kill Yu Tianzheng just yet, as the latter&#8217;s survival could still prove useful. In order to ensure his cooperation, he decided to use the Demonic Manipulation Urn on him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Have mercy please, Young Master Changge… I&#8217;ll surrender my Primordial Spirit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although being imprinted with a Slave Mark would mean that he would be a slave for the rest of his life, Yu Tianzheng no longer had any other choice. As he shakingly spoke, the terror of the Demonic Manipulation Urn seeped through the strangest spots, deeply rooting in the deepest spot of his Primordial Spirits. Even True Daoists, experts on Primordial Spirits, wouldn&#8217;t be able to discover it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, word regarding the younger son of the Tuo Ba Family angering Emperor Yu, thereby sent to prison, spread across the entire Great Yu Capital. Every cultivator on the streets was discussing it, pushing Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, the person involved in the matter, into the spotlight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having lived his life discreetly for more than twenty years, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao performed excellently during the Hunting Event and became a young prodigy rivalling the Second Prince. At once, he was honoured and was envied by many.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in a flash, he fell from his fame and was turned into a prisoner. Even the merry Tuo Ba Family became a hollow, abandoned place. Such a drastic change rendered many helpless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, his declaration of love for Yu Feiya also became a laughing stock. Many were making fun of it. Enthusiasts even spread the word about Gu Changge claiming Tuo Ba Xiao Yao to be a burden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, some revealed their disappointment, and their feelings were rather contagious. Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had the chance to ascend to greatness, yet he ruined it so quickly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is that if not foolish or burdensome?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right as the people of the outside world were talking about it, in the depths of the Capital, the prison was extremely silent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a determined face, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao sat in his cell with a straight posture, as though he was unaffected by the rumours going around in the outside world. Traces of sword aura swirled around his body as thousand beams of Sword Qi intertwined. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having lived numerous lives, he indubitably knew that it would be impossible for him to escape the prison. Thus, his only way out was either to wait for Emperor Yu to get over his rage and release him, or to wait for his father and Yu Feiya to come up with a way to rescue him. Therefore, he had no intentions to resist or escape.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the security in the prison was tight, one thing remained to worry him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given Gu Changgee&#8217;s strength, it should be easy for him to sneak into it as the guards on duty and the arrays were basically non-existent to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right at that moment, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao detected a disturbance surging in the air before him. Swiftly, he opened his eyes. A glaring Sword Qi flashed before his eyes before dread arose on his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* A layer of grey mist dispersed as the air dissipated. Accordingly, a slender figure resembling a divine being walked out of it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge!&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao emphasised every syllable of the name he enunciated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since he regressed, it was his first time facing his nemesis directly, and the depths of his eyes bore nothing but resentment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Judging by his abilities, it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult for him to obliterate our world, but why doesn’t he just do so? What&#8217;s his purpose in coming to our world? This is what has been boggling my mind.&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s tall slender body stood on the mountaintop as her hair danced along the winds, exuding outstanding beauty. At that moment, under the white mask, her brows were tense, and her voice carried a tone that amazed even herself.</span><span id="more-33865"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He comes from such a formidable background? That is all the more reason to not trust him.&#8221; The Old Sword Immortal&#8217;s face grew even more taut, as the suspicion in his heart thickened. There was no way he would believe that Gu Changge came without a purpose, as genuine kindness was non-existent in this world, let alone from an Otherworldly Sky Demon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to what he knew, those Otherworldly Sky Demons had taken down numerous ancient worlds similar to Profound Sword World. In his perspective, them claiming to prioritise longevity and peace was nothing but nonsense that shouldn&#8217;t be believed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is not for certain. If he is indeed scheming against our world, why go through such great lengths?&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal lightly shook her head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you really intend to trust him?&#8221; The Old Sword Immortal revealed a scowl. His glare was incredibly piercing, causing air to tremble, and his tone carried dissatisfaction as he spoke with an extremely stern expression. &#8220;Xiao Xue (Little Snow), you are the Cliff Master. Please think things through before you make a decision and not be as rash as you once were.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of seniority, he was on the same level as the Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s Master. In earlier years, he had even personally instructed her. Thus, he had some understanding of her personality. Therefore, upon hearing her out, he could tell that she was planning to meet with Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, according to the reports, Gu Changge&#8217;s escorting subordinate seemed to be a formidable cultivator of the Ninth Realm. Needless to say, Gu Changge himself must possess strength that was even more immeasurable and unfathomable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Snow Sword Immortal was now in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earth Sword Immortal Realm, she was definitely inferior to Gu Changge. Hence, if Gu Changge bore a malicious intent, she would be walking straight into the lion&#8217;s den.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At this point, do I have any other choice?&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s face remained still. &#8220;I&#8217;ve contemplated the consequences. Stop worrying about me, Uncle Master.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221; With an infuriated expression, the Old Sword Immortal pointed at the Snow Sword Immortal with his shaking finger, obviously enraged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, seeing her emotionlessness, he subconsciously heaved a sigh towards the sky and turned into a divine rainbow, angrily leaving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the Snow Sword Immortal had made her decision, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to change her mind. Regardless, he was still sceptical of Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From his perspective, since Gu Changge&#8217;s identity and position was so terrifying in the Upper Realm, he could instil fear in the Forces of the Upper Realm by capturing Gu Changge as intimidation, and it might even prove useful at crucial moments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is time to bring out the Sword Immortal Order and gather all the Sword Immortals to take down those damn Otherworldly Sky Demons…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of swords made of light whirled in the eyes of the Old Sword Immortal as he traversed through the sky in the void. In a flash, he vanished from the world as he headed towards the Shu Sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the Old Sword Immortal disappear, the Snow Sword Immortal, who stood still for a long time, let out a soft sigh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* With that, her body transformed into a white mist and she reappeared at a spot thousands of kilometres away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep down, she understood the Old Sword Immortal&#8217;s concern, but certain things were worth a try, as they could be the one and only opportunity for the entire Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Profound Sword World, there were Thirteen States in total, and every state stood giant, dominant Forces such as Sword Cliff and Shu Sect. These Forces possessed legacies that had survived thousands of years, and within, there were at least two beings that were Earth Sword Immortals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, news of Gu Changge&#8217;s appearance in Southern Light Empire speedily spread among these huge Forces and caused great commotions. Given that he was an outsider from another world, he was classified as one of the Otherworldly Sky Demons. However, he didn&#8217;t seem to be hostile, as if he was merely here for a relaxing trip.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, several other details, including Gu Changge&#8217;s origin and motives, were constantly being questioned by the huge Forces, leading to numerous inferences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he had rescued Chen Ah Qing as well as Princess Xuan Dea of the Southern Light Empire, most were still unable to fully trust him. After all, an outsider would never bear the same mindset as the natives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, some expressed their concern, and some even disdained him, thinking that he must not bear a good heart since his intentions were unclear. Thus, he must be guarded against.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the Southern Light Emperor remained highly trustful of Gu Changge&#8217;s words. Hence, he began amassing the surrounding Forces, even sending men to scour for the location of the World&#8217;s Will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gu Changge, the World’s Will would not stay awake continually. Instead, it would only awaken at specific moments, while at other times, it would usually choose to remain in deep slumber. Thus, unless they could locate it, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to awaken it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, a terrorising battle erupted in the Southbarren State.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast army of the Upper Realm descended and began their annihilation of the forces of the Southern Light Empire. It created ruins all over the state. The scene was catastrophic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ferocious battle turned rivers red and piled bones into hills. Blood accumulated into rivers that was filled with floating skulls, as the sky was engulfed in gloom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the other Forces of the state also dispatched their armies to provide support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indubitably, this battle was the true beginning of the Upper Realm&#8217;s assault on Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profound Sword World was submerged in horrifying darkness. Too many of the powerful cultivators perished as giant territories collapsed into a broken land dyed in crimson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the battle, the young prodigies that came from the Upper Realm performed splendidly, devastating their enemies without any setbacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, instead of participating in the army attacks, they headed to various cities alone and challenged the younger generation of the foreign world with overbearing complacency and rampancy, feigning not the slightest respect to them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the fate of the world was determined. Even the disciples of Sword Cliff, Shu Sect, Kong Mountain, and other Forces of Profound Sword World were no match for the younger generation of the Upper Realm. Thus, they could either flee, or be slaughtered on the spot as their life faded away and their blood splattered everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, in Ancient Mulberry City, located in the northernmost region of North Cool State of the Profound Sword World. This city grew to fame thanks to an ancient mulberry tree a long time ago. Alas, as time went by, the ancient mulberry tree within Ancient Mulberry City had wilted, leaving behind only its withered stump. Nevertheless, the city kept the name,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the Southern Light Empire with Ah Qing, Gu Changge arrived at Ancient Mulberry City, and he was now waiting for her to meet with her mother.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city was impaired and its gates were falling apart. Almost drying out, the river that protected the city also became cloudy as it was filled with silt. Loaches could be seen drilling around in the river of the devastated city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Halt! Identify yourselves!&#8221; On the scarred aged walls of the city, there were a dozen soldiers. Clad in incomplete armours, they held their metal lances and rusty blades warily as they shouted at Gu Changge and the rest who were approaching.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the invasion of the Otherworldly Sky Demons, although Ancient Mulberry City was far away from the battle, after receiving news of it, everyone in the city grew immensely cautious and treated everyone as enemies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the city was extremely isolated, and visibly, it had experienced a difficult time recently. Even the lives of the innocent residents became extremely arduous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, the soldiers were highly guarded, ready to strike as runes gleamed on their body. It was rare for them to see someone as extraordinary as Gu Changge and his outworldly outfit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m back.&#8221; At that moment, Ah Qing, the young woman, with her complicated gaze fixed at the ancient city before her, walked up from Gu Changge&#8217;s back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, Ancient Mulberry City was under her maternal grandfather&#8217;s care. Although it was isolated, it wasn&#8217;t as damaged as it was now. Thus, something must have happened during the period she had disappeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since her father stepped into the Space Rift, she and her mother moved to the city from an inconspicuous area to live with her maternal grandfather. And half a year ago, she secretly left the ancient city and began searching for her father.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What happened to Ancient Mulberry City? Why has it ended up like this?&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea, who followed them, was also stupefied. Thanks to her relationship with Chen Ah Qing, she had visited Ancient Mulberry City in the past.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, although the city wasn&#8217;t exactly prosperous, it wasn&#8217;t as miserable as this. The city was in a state so atrocious that one would have assumed that it was another city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This city is indeed strange,&#8221; Gu Changge said with an odd sensation in his eyes. There were black and white colours intertwining in his eyes as he observed the surroundings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that really Lady Ah Qing? Lady Ah Qing has returned?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soldiers on the wall recognised Ah Qing and widened their dismayed eyes out of stupefaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turns out, news regarding Ah Qing had yet to spread to her from Southbarren State. They had always assumed that she had died in the other world. Her grandfather had almost passed out as he was unable to accept the &#8216;truth.&#8217;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, never did they expect that they would get to see Ah Qing again, and now, they were even suspecting that they were under an illusion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s me. I have returned.&#8221; Ah Qing nodded, her complicated gaze filled with daze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Incredible! It&#8217;s really Lady Ah Qing! Lady Ah Qing is fine! Report to the City Lord at once!&#8221; The soldiers on the wall were thrilled, unable to control their excitement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, the entire Ancient Mulberry City was startled. Ah Qing, who had vanished for more than half a year, suddenly returned safely and that caused an enormous commotion throughout the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divine rainbows flashed over as everyone from the City Lord Manor gathered to see her. Even the old City Lord himself hurried over right after hearing the news. Tears flowed down his wrinkled face as he was exhilarated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Grandfather…&#8221; Looking at her grandfather, who had visibly grown older, Ah Qing felt a tingle in her nose and muttered, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s fine. Now that you&#8217;re back, all is well. You&#8217;re safe and that&#8217;s all that matters.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old City Lord&#8217;s figure was somewhat hunched. Every strand of his hair was white, resembling metal needles. As if he was an old lion of great prestige, he carried a majestic aura, and it was clear that he was an extraordinary, heroic figure back when he was young.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, he reached out his boney hand and caressed Ah Qing&#8217;s head as comfort arose in his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I apologise for having made you worry. I shouldn&#8217;t have sneaked out of Ancient Mulberry City to look for Father behind both yours and mother’s back…&#8221; Ah Qing remorsefully stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s all in the past. Your safety is all that matters. Your mother has been worrying about you all this time and almost fell sick. Now, she can finally be at ease, knowing that you&#8217;re back,&#8221; the old City Lord sighed and replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he spoke, his gaze fell upon Gu Changge, who was behind Ah Qing. Thereupon, he asked with a questioning and confused tone. &#8220;This is?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could recognise Princess Xuan Dea, but Gu Changge was a total stranger to him. And now that his granddaughter suddenly returned and brought that young man with her, it was only reasonable that he felt baffled. Furthermore, even with his cultivation level, he couldn&#8217;t see through Gu Changge, which left him in awe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Where is mother?&#8221; Although Ah Qing was somewhat concerned, she clarified in response, &#8220;This is Young Master Gu, my saviour. If it weren&#8217;t for him, I couldn&#8217;t have made it back safely.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saviour?&#8221; The old City Lord was taken aback, but he managed to repress the ceaseless confusion in his mind and welcomed Ah Qing and the rest into the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On their way, he briefly told Ah Qing about the recent incidents, including how Ancient Mulberry City had fallen this badly. Ultimately, back then, Ah Qing&#8217;s father offended some foes and they had come to seek revenge after he had vanished.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father&#8217;s past foes?&#8221; Coldness surged on Ah Qing&#8217;s petite face as she clenched her soft white fists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her father was an Earth Sword Immortal, so the enemies must be powerful cultivators of the Eighth Realm or the Ninth Realm at least, while her grandfather was only in Seventh Realm, hence he was unable to resist them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are they still troubling us now?&#8221; Ah Qing questioned with a murderous look.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the old City Lord revealed a smile and shook his head. &#8220;Some time ago, for some reason, those that came to cause trouble suddenly disappeared. I believe it&#8217;s your father&#8217;s friends who&#8217;re helping us in the dark.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see…&#8221; Ah Qing heaved a sigh of relief. Since her father had disappeared, it was now her responsibility to protect her grandfather and her mother.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Who knew this place is where Spirit Veins intersect…] After entering Ancient Mulberry City, Gu Changge gradually grew astounded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the city appeared barren from the outside, in his eyes, he could perceive Purple Qi transpirating and engulfing the skies, as if Immortals were returning to heaven while dragons soared towards the sky. Such terrain obviously could only appear when thousands of Spirit Veins intersect to create such wonders. In other words, this city was significantly more precious than the Southern Light Empire’s Imperial Palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is something perhaps hidden underneath the city, or is something special about it?] Gu Changge wondered with a pondering look.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, in the City Lord Manor, Ah Qing finally reunited with her mother, whom she hadn&#8217;t seen for half a year. Unable to contain her emotions, she spent half the day to finally calm herself down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Silly girl, you left without a word. Do you know how worried I&#8217;ve been the past few months?&#8221; Ah Qing&#8217;s mother spoke with a criticising tone as she tightly grasped her daughter’s hands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sorry. I’m so sorry. I&#8217;ve returned, and I will never leave you again. I believe father did not fall into the hands of the Otherworldly Sky Demons. According to the information I&#8217;ve gathered, he managed to break through once again at the crucial moment and managed to escape deeper into the Space Rift.&#8221; After taking a couple of deep breaths, Ah Qing slowly spoke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew your father wouldn&#8217;t fall so easily.&#8221; Upon those words, Ah Qing&#8217;s mother and grandfather let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Ah Qing&#8217;s mother turned to Gu Changge and curiously asked, &#8220;So this young man is the saviour you mentioned?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge appeared to be extraordinary and benign, she had an inexplicable hunch that such a person shouldn&#8217;t be here and that he was from a different world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Young Master Gu rescued me. Actually, he comes from the other world…&#8221; Ah Qing&#8217;s eyes bore gratitude. After a moment of thought, she nodded and revealed the truth, intending to explain the situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From the other world?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right away, a surprised voice sounded outside the hall. A young man wearing a butler&#8217;s attire around his mediocre physique, who was fetching tea over, stood still, seemingly stunned.</span></p>

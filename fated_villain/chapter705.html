        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White fog surged and shrouded the entrance of Peach Village. Tao Yao, who had manifested her true body, exuded peerless elegance with her fluttering skirts and silky locks.</span><span id="more-36168"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the same whether we meet or not. She will come if she wants to see me.&#8221; She looked somewhat in a daze, but she soon came back to her senses and shook her head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, she had heard about Chan Honyi&#8217;s escape from the Demon-Burying Abyss, as well as how she killed everyone along her way as she established herself in Devil Mountain. It was just that Tao Yao was used to being unmotivated and staying in this tiny village. She didn&#8217;t even want to take half a step out of the Land of Abandoned Celestials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tao Yao didn&#8217;t have a clue how many Epochs had passed since the Forbidden Epoch. So much time had passed that she had almost forgotten her former friend. [Is she still the same person she was before?] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Chan Honyi should be able to feel Tao Yao&#8217;s aura, and she should know that Tao Yao wasn&#8217;t dead. There was hardly anyone in the Upper Realm who could stop Chan Honyi if she really wanted to see Tao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; Gu Changge raised his glass and took a sip from it smiling. &#8220;She is preoccupied with taking revenge on me right now. It is only expected that she can&#8217;t spare time to look for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tao Yao fell silent upon hearing that. She then looked at Gu Changge and couldn&#8217;t help asking in a soft voice, &#8220;Why happened?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She ended up asking the question that had been lingering on her mind for the longest time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Chan Honyi, Gu Changge was someone who was both her Master and father whom she respected and admired the most. Although Gu Changge was harsh on her, he never let her feel wronged. Not even Tao Yao knew why Chan Honyi would eventually choose to point her sword at Gu Changge, despite how deep Chan Honyi&#8217;s love for him used to be. After all, that battle was too fearsome. Even she, with her cultivation back then, felt inferior as if she was an ant as fear crept out from deep inside her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Heavenly Dao collapsed, tens of thousands of calamities befell the world. Even the River of Time became distorted and eventually collapsed. In the end, all the worlds were destroyed, and the Immortal Palace was destroyed. The burying of the Epochs had become a terrifying taboo to talk about for future generations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge didn&#8217;t seem surprised when he heard the question. Instead, he asked with a smile, &#8220;Would you believe me if I said I can&#8217;t remember?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would. The you from the past would never talk to me this way.&#8221; Tao Yao also put on a faint smile when she heard the words. Immediately, her already-glamorous self became even more refined and extraordinary. Just like tonight, she talked to Gu Changge back when she was still a small peach tree. However, he was like the lonely moon or the elusive wind, whereas she was just a speck of dust who could only quietly look up to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For things to turn out this way… It seems that something unimaginable </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">did </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">happen after all.&#8221; Feeling regretful and emotional about it, Tao Yao shook her head lightly and sighed. She had to pay a great price before she regained her memory after she woke up. If it wasn&#8217;t for Yao Yao, she might still be in a confused state right now. She could only imagine how much more Gu Changge needed to give up if he wanted to recover, considering what an indescribable and incredible existence he was. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge took another sip of his wine and casually brought up, &#8220;the Upper Realm will fall into chaos soon, and it won&#8217;t be long before I leave. There is a chance the Immortal Domain and the Upper Realm will merge, or there could be bigger opportunities…&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, he thought that Tao Yao could sense something, even if it was mere fragments of the future. But judging from her reaction right now, she didn&#8217;t seem to want to meddle in the affairs of the outside world. She couldn&#8217;t even be bothered in taking half a step out of Peach Village.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tao Yao couldn&#8217;t understand what Gu Changge meant, and she asked after a moment of silence, &#8220;You didn&#8217;t come to me only to reminisce about the old days and chat, did you?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing much, really.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled approvingly. &#8220;I just need you to do me a favour.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What could you need my help with?&#8221; Tao Yao was somewhat interested in this. Although her current cultivation had indeed surpassed the shackles of this world, it didn&#8217;t mean that she could exert power that touched upon the Immortal Realm. Gu Changge was definitely stronger than her now. [How can I help if even he can&#8217;t solve it himself?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want you to guard something for me. To be precise, I need your help to guard an ancient world,&#8221; Gu Changge said slowly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An ancient world?&#8221; Tao Yao was even more stunned when she heard these words. With her strength, she was more than capable of protecting an Immortal Force, much less an ancient world. [But why is he telling me to do this? Is there anyone in this world who dares to oppose him and take action against an ancient world he wants to protect?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was not surprised by Tao Yao&#8217;s reaction as he nodded and replied, &#8220;I have given it a long thought. You, with your identity, should make you the most suitable person I can entrust this task to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, he had been planning to plot against the entire Upper Realm for some time now. What he wanted Tao Yao to help him protect was, precisely, the Epoch Dao Fruit. Considering the time, the Fruit would ripen soon. Gu Changge intended to use this Fruit as bait to lure the strongest among the Upper Realm Forces to help him make the last move.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This plan was not complicated, but there was one thing Gu Changge needed to ensure—the plan had to be kept from everyone, especially those undying bastards who have been in seclusion, hiding away, cultivating for tens of millions of years, or even several epochs. These beings were the true backbone of the various Forces. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was impossible for them to touch upon the Immortal Realm, they didn&#8217;t necessarily have no means to fight against a True Immortal, if they ever came across one. When they were in their prime, they were also amazingly talented and unmatched. Not only were they terrifyingly powerful, but they were wise beyond their years. Anything that was slightly out of place would not go unnoticed by them. They would be able to deduce what was wrong in an instant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was why Gu Changge had to be careful if he wanted to dress up lies as truths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than needing to find an amazing ancient world, Gu Changge also needed to store the Epoch Dao Fruit in it so that news of it would lure those big fish into his net. Tao Yao&#8217;s role was to get those undying bastards to lower their guard. After all, the Epoch Dao Fruit couldn&#8217;t possibly be left there without someone to guard it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone from the Forbidden Era, Tao Yao’s aura was unfathomable, making it impossible for others to deduce her origin and traces of her if she chose to hide it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, it had been countless years since the Epoch Dao Fruit disappeared from the Upper Realm. For it, the Upper Realm fought with the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains for many aeons because they believed that the Fruit was lost there. Unfortunately, the Upper Realm’s Immortal and Formidable Forces still couldn&#8217;t find a clue about it even after they took over the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and turned it inside out. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there were plenty of rumours about the appearance of the Immortal Path nowadays. Not only that, but people would also talk about the Epoch Dao Fruit. Thus, how could those undying bastards and powerful Ancient Beings continue to sit still despite hearing about these rumours?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see.&#8221; Tao Yao fell silent after that. She didn&#8217;t ask about why Gu Changge was doing this. Even if she didn&#8217;t agree, she knew that Gu Changge would have a way to get her to eventually. No matter in the past or now, Gu Changge was not a soft-hearted person who would show mercy just because he knew someone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m only borrowing one of your Dharma Bodies. Of course, you can go there with your true body if you want to.&#8221; Gu Changge put on a casual smile. He had to make a trip to the Eternal Overcast Kingdom to get the Eternal Overcast Source as he hadn&#8217;t found a suitable ancient world yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things would get much easier after that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge only needed to completely refine and fuse that suitable ancient world with the Palm of True World, which he obtained from Neraka. After exerting his own influence over it, he would be able to create his own Demonic Land. Even True Daoists and Remnant Immortals would have no choice but to perish and cease to exist if they stepped into it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Forces of the Upper Realm are secretly planning to have dealt with me, So, I&#8217;ll have to prepare a huge surprise for them in advance.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge spent the next few days in Peach Village. He would either bicker with Gu Xianer, roam around the area with Yao Yao, or chat with Tao Yao at the entrance of the village about the Forbidden Epoch. Many of Gu Xianer&#8217;s Masters were closely acquainted with Gu Changge, and they would sometimes spend their days arguing when they got to certain issues related to cultivation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some ways, some things Gu Changge said enlightened them and planted a deep admiration towards him. They didn&#8217;t believe that Gu Changge would hurt Gu Xianer even until now. Instead, they started to guess Gu Changge&#8217;s true identity. There was no way they believed that he was just one of the members from the younger generation. After all, it didn&#8217;t make sense for the younger generation&#8217;s understanding and mastery over the Great Dao could leave them shocked and in awe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they believed that Gu Changge was the reincarnation of an extraordinary figure. His cultivation at its peak was unpredictable and unspeakable, and he could well be on par with the lord, emperor, or even ancestor of Immortals!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Gu Changge&#8217;s stay in Peach Village, the Upper Realm was also quietly changing. Those with ulterior motives spread the news about Neraka, Pagoda, and Nephrite Breeze Pavilion. It didn&#8217;t take long before the entire Upper Realm had heard about these rumours. It was a daily worry to see people in ancient cities discussing this matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The actual reason Neraka and Pagoda suffered such a catastrophe is because they blocked Nephrite Breeze Pavilion&#8217;s rise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People are saying that Young Master Gu is the true Master of Nephrite Breeze Pavilion, and he is silently supporting this assassin guild. That&#8217;s why Nephrite Breeze Pavilion attacked Neraka and Pagoda.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many young prodigies shrouded in divine light and oozing with overwhelming aura had gathered in a restaurant. They were also eagerly talking about this matter, as they were invested in everything about Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from all the signs there were now, Gu Changge definitely was deeply involved with Nephrite Breeze Pavilion. Therefore, there were also Forces calling on everyone to find the headquarters of Nephrite Breeze Pavilion and wipe it out like how Neraka was destroyed to eliminate future troubles. No one wanted it to develop into another Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, some remained sceptical about this. It didn&#8217;t make sense. After all, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t continue to attack the other assassin guild, Pagoda. If he really wanted Nephrite Breeze Pavilion to be at the top, he would have done so. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many even came up with the guess that Gu Changge had some inexplicable grudge against Neraka. However, due to the deliberate suppression of the various Forces, this kind of discourse had little influence and couldn&#8217;t stir up waves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a trivial matter,&#8221; a talent in the pavilion shook his head and uttered softly, &#8220;Nephrite Breeze Pavilion only emerged in the last few thousand years. It is still too soon for it to grow to Neraka&#8217;s level… On the contrary, there is something else that I think is more important.&#8221; The one who spoke was a tall man with golden eyes where traces of crossing Dao flowed. His mysterious aura made him seem like he wasn&#8217;t a person of this era. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the people here were extremely respectful towards him. When they heard his words, they couldn&#8217;t help but stare at him in astonishment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;May I know why you say so, Senior Brother Jin Yun?&#8221; A prodigal damsel with radiant eyes asked in a delicate voice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man in front of her was a Taboo Prodigy from ancient times. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was from the Immortal Sect, Purple Cloud Valley, and he was terrifyingly powerful. He broke out from a Divine Source to enter this era. He was as strong as the King with Six Crowns, the Phoenix Lady, Chosen Monk Jin Chan, and other top figures among the younger generation, excluding Gu Changge. Naturally, the words he uttered felt convincing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taboo Prodigy named Jin Yun raised his wine glass and lightly shook his head. There was a strange glint in his eyes when he remembered what Purple Cloud Valley had told him. He said unhurriedly, &#8220;Actually, you have all overlooked a crucial point. But I believe that the Forces you come from should have mentioned this.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he himself had not come in contact with Gu Changge, he had heard so many rumours about Gu Changge that his eardrums were probably calloused. He was someone who was proud and confident that he was unbeatable, believing such a thing would not have changed even after he waited to be born in this era. Naturally, he expected himself to touch upon the Immortal Realm one day. However, Gu Changge&#8217;s existence made him doubt himself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pavilion seemed to fall completely silent as soon as Jin Yun said that, and everyone had an unnatural expression on their faces. &#8220;Senior Brother Jin Yun, are you talking about… Young Master  Gu being the real Successor of Demonic Arts?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, they weren&#8217;t the only ones who knew about this. There was a widespread rumour that Gu Changge was the real Successor of Demonic Arts. However, he kept it so well-hidden that no one had actually found a flaw that might prove the rumour true. How else could his having powers so revered at such a young age be explained? Not even ancient books dared to record it as it was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the young prodigies present were not stupid. They were capable of having their own thoughts instead of just blindly treading through. The younger generation couldn&#8217;t actually see how Gu Changge had anything to do with being the Successor of Demonic Arts. On the contrary, Gu Changge had been fighting against the mysterious Successor of Demonic Arts, thus saving many young prodigies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a moment of silence in the pavilion before a straightforward young prodigy lamented and sighed. &#8220;This is inevitable, isn&#8217;t it? The situation has already toppled. This does not require any evidence. Any excuse will serve a tyrant. Young Master Gu has grown to the point where everyone is afraid of him… The Upper Realm needs such a reason to retaliate against him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin Yun shook his head disapprovingly and said no more. He only had to convey the message as per Purple Cloud Valley&#8217;s instructions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was quiet again. Although they all could sympathise with each other as like-minded people, they still felt some kind of relief. The pressure that Gu Changge put on everyone was too overwhelming as it seemed to lay over the top of their heads, suffocating them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, a young prodigy broke the silence with a bitter chuckle. He urged everyone to think less and drink more. &#8220;Young Master Gu&#8217;s fall may be a blessing for us. Don&#8217;t be shy. Have a drink. This has nothing to do with us, and it is not like we have the right to get involved.&#8221;</span></p>

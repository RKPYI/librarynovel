          suspended in the void while it made whooshing sounds. Every word on it
          seemed to have turned into a peerless divine sword that shone

          nervously stared at this page. Some young prodigies immediately used
          divine abilities such as Heaven Peering Eye to try to memorise the
          words on it. However, the text was too strange as every stroke seemed
          to be formed from sword energy. The moment it slashed ahead, it could
          penetrate any living being. The beings with slightly weaker
          cultivation had tears streaming down their piercingly painful eyes,
          and they didn&#8217;t dare to take a second look.

          they knew that this object was extracted by Gu Xianer, they could
          hardly contain their emotions. Despite that, they didn&#8217;t dare to
          make a move to snatch it. They locked the surrounding space to prevent
          this piece of paper from escaping. Many people also felt regretful. If
          they knew that this object was hidden inside the stone, they would
          have bought it a long time ago.</span

          Six Crowns, Young Holy King, the Phoenix Lady and the others also had
          serious looks on their faces. Every Emperor Technique was a priceless
          treasure which contained supreme profoundness and mystery that a
          cultivator could use for a lifetime. Only the Immortal and Formidable
          Forces had them. They could already imagine that the value of this
          object was more than any amount of Spiritual Stones could make up
          for.</span

          didn&#8217;t expect there to be a Sword Technique hidden in the stone.
          This paper had spirituality, and as it slashed out several terrifying
          black Sword Qis, it smashed the golden vines she shot out into ashes,
          causing even the space they were in to collapse. The other
          people&#8217;s attempts to stop it also seemed futile. They
          couldn&#8217;t stop it from escaping.

          ordinary methods.] Even an old Sacred Emperor Realm expert was injured
          by a Sword Qi just now, leaving a wound where dark blood flowed from.
          The Sword Qi was also difficult to get rid of right after.</span

          emerged. It was like a crystal-clear, gorgeous red jade which directly
          turned into a red cloud and flew out, wanting to knock down this dark
          gold paper. This was the Primeval True Feather, a Nirvana Grade
          artifact which Gu Changge gave her. It might be difficult for her to
          fully activate it with her current strength, but its power was far
          superior to other artifacts.</span

          >The moment the Primeval True Feather flew out like a red galaxy to
          cover the dark gold page, an unparalleled wave suddenly erupted here.
          If the other Sect Masters around the area hadn&#8217;t noticed
          something was wrong and rushed to block the wave, this place would
          have been ruined by the aftermath alone.</span

          divine swords, slashing through all the existences that approached it.
          Even the Primeval True Feather let out clanging sounds as Divine
          Chains shot out and red rays of dawnlight splashed everywhere.</span

          it in Hidden Celestialian&#8230;&#8221; She had already figured out
          that this thing was definitely related to the Hidden Celestial
          Bloodline. The text on it came from their bloodline, and they were
          written in characters she happened to recognise. However, she might
          not be able to control it well as she didn&#8217;t have the Hidden
          Celestial Blood. Niu Tian, on the other hand, was different. He was a
          pure-blooded Hidden Celestial. If there was anyone here who could
          guide the page, it would only be Niu Tian.</span

          as light green runes flickered in his eyes. Immediately after, he
          began to mutter, and strange characters appeared in light green colour
          around him. They resembled True Dragons, Celestial Phoenixes, Qilins,
          Black Tortoises, and other strange beasts. Each word contained the
          terrifying power of the gods.</span

          Masters, who were hiding in the dark, too, were also focused on Niu
          Tian. They felt the same energy as that of the dark gold paper from
          this burly man. There could only be one possibility—he had the blood

          sword reverberated in all directions. Faintly, the crowd saw a dull
          yellow dirty river which flooded over all living beings. A look of joy
          soon appeared on Niu Tian&#8217;s face; he could indeed feel the

          deep frown. Despite her annoyance, she didn&#8217;t let it show on her

          walked out with a proper and generous smile on her face. She said to
          Gu Xianer, &#8220;Lady Xianer, this thing has a big connection with an
          Ancestor of our family, the An Clan. I&#8217;m sure you and everyone

          face, continued to smile. &#8220;This is a belonging of an An Clan
          Ancestor. With your status and identity, you probably wouldn&#8217;t
          usurp someone else&#8217;s belongings. You may as well return it to
          its original owner. As long as you request it, the An Clan is willing
          to pay a high price to buy it back. My family will remember your
          kindness forever. Of course, if this bothers you, I will have my
          people give it to you.&#8221;</span

          that this young lady of the An Clan was not one to be trifled with.
          She spoke with the right amount of push and pull in an organised way.
          With just a few words, she clearly stated her purpose and won the
          upper hand.</span

      <p>

          that this object was left behind by their Ancestors before she put Gu
          Xianer on a pedestal. That way, it would make it seem inexcusable if
          someone of Gu Xianer&#8217;s identity were to forcibly take an item of
          someone’s Ancestor. An Xi then said that she was willing to buy it,
          which in other words, meant that she had no intention of taking it
          back by force. If Gu Xianer did not agree to it, An Xi would
          immediately return it to her.</span

          >So no matter whether Gu Xianer agreed or refused, there was nothing
          wrong with An Xi and the An Clan&#8217;s actions. They were on the
          absolutely favourable side.</span

          she would inevitably draw criticisms about how she had gone too far.
          Logically, it would be unreasonable. After all, she would be claiming
          a relic of another person’s Ancestor for herself. Many of the older
          generation present were beings with extensive experience who managed
          to analyse An Xi&#8217;s intentions almost immediately.</span

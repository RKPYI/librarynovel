          suppress his Demonic Nature?</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        As the entire Upper Realm was in an uproar regarding the relationship
        between Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain and the Forbidden Demonic Arts’
        Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>The Immortal Gu Family still seemed very calm on the surface.</p>
      <p>
        To think that such a big event would happen again right after the
        birthday banquet ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t a good idea for the Daoist Sects and Immortal Clans to
        continue their stay there since no one could be sure whether the
        Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor was hidden among them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creatures of the Primorial Ten Thousand Races left first, planning to
        return to their clans, and then discuss appropriate measures to address
        the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Forbidden Demonic Arts' Inheritor was not alone. This fact had
        become abundantly clear, alongside the assessment that there might be
        more than just one person backing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        But whether this force was Heavenly Emperor's Mountain or not, needed
        some more investigation, as it was difficult to determine the
        authenticity of the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon afterwards, the Immortal Ye Family, Immortal Lake, Heavenly Dao
        Immortal Palace, and other Immortal Sects also said their goodbyes and
        left.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Brother Gu, you have to pay attention. The Forbidden Demonic Arts'
          Inheritor will definitely target you after me.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin smiled charmingly before saying some parting words to Gu
        Changge, following the Immortal Wang Family as they departed from the
        place.
      </p>
      <p>She had to deal with some new issues upon returning.</p>
      <p>
        As Wang Zijin had just learned the news of Jiang Chuchu leaving the
        Human Ancestral Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she was right, Jiang Chuchu would most likely come and ask Gu Changge
        about details regarding the situation, and maybe even investigate him.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, considering her personality and then Gu Changge’s personality,
        it was also likely… that she’d faceplant into a metal wall this time
        around.
      </p>
      <p>
        The faint smile on Gu Changge’s face quickly disappeared upon finally
        losing sight of the Wang Family members.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Pay attention to the whereabouts of Miss Zijin.”</b> He quickly
        instructed the powerhouse of the Gu family beside him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, Wang Zijin was a Favoured Daughter of Heaven who brings
        good fortune, so observing her would only lead to more benefits for Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, he was not afraid of Wang Zijin discovering his intentions
        either.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Yes, Young Master.”</b></p>
      <p>
        The powerhouses of the Gu Family left hastily upon receiving the order,
        not daring to ask for the reason or the cause.
      </p>
      <p>It was none of their business anyways.</p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, Gu Changge’s power in the Immortal Gu Family was now just
        below the Patriarch, more respected than even all the clan elders
        combined.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was, of course, disregarding the Ancestors and Ancient Freaks as
        they had been lying around in the soil or hiding in coffins and would
        not easily show up to make decisions.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's words were no different from that of the Patriarch.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Yue Mingkong, this cunning lass, had left on the second day. She
          seemed to be in a hurry, but in order not to let me notice the
          abnormality, even returned to the Supreme Immortal Dynasty first, and
          didn’t immediately go to the place where the reincarnation of that
          Human Ancestor is.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's eyes squinted a bit as he took one step forwards, returning
        instantly to the palace.
      </p>
      <p>A smile had appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong thought she was smart, but in Gu Changge’s view, this was
        just a tiny speck of useless cleverness he could instantly see through.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The Human Ancestor’s Reincarnation will not be so easy to deal with.
          My Mingkong might end up suffering a loss… It seems that I have to
          arrange something in advance.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        He was pondering about this matter when Yin Mei's voice rang from
        outside the palace.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Senior Brother.”</b></p>
      <p>
        In front of outsiders, she would always address Gu Changge like so with
        a shout, indicating to him that he should not let the mask he wore slip
        just yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Since Junior Sister has something to ask of me, you should come
          in.”</b
        >
        Gu Changge spoke with a natural expression.
      </p>
      <p>Yin Mei soon walked into the hall alone.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Master, your guess was correct. There is news from the clan that the
          Heavenly Prince has mobilized his troops…”</b
        >
        She reported respectfully with cupped hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Mobilizing troops, huh. It seems like he doesn't know where the
          little servant is, so he wants to solve it using overwhelming
          manpower.”</b
        >
        Gu Changge dissected the report with ease using his observation skills,
        looking a bit disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
        A funny little trick. The current Heavenly Prince was not stupid after
        all and had sent troops to investigate the matter in his stead, not
        wanting to go himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        It made sense, as he couldn’t tell exactly what had happened to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was best not to meet face-to-face in case of an unexpected
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, what the imposter Heavenly Prince needed to do was to
        destroy the corpse and eliminate the remaining traces, solving the flaw
        that would most likely expose his identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as his reputation was not very stable nowadays, and he was
        constrained in many ways, the fake did not dare to show up and muddy the
        waters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It doesn’t matter. Act according to our previous plan. Let your
          clansmen inform the fake Heavenly Prince, revealing the whereabouts of
          that little servant, and say that he suddenly went crazy for no
          reason.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge recounted the plan with an intrigued smirk.</p>
      <p>
        It didn’t matter whether he was really crazy or not. He simply wanted
        the fake Heavenly Prince to understand that the little servant was in
        his hands and that he held his life in his hands.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge had grabbed hold of his biggest secret.</p>
      <p>
        With this important handle, Gu Changge now possessed all kinds of
        methods to squeeze and harvest the fake’s Fortune Value completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Yes, master.”</b> Instructions in hand, Yin Mei was ready to return
        to her clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        But before she could take her leave, Gu Changge stopped her after
        thinking for a moment, throwing a sealed jade bottle into her hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Master, this is…”</b> Even while stunned, Yin Mei could still
        perceive a potent, surging energy, churning silently inside the jade
        bottle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shook his head, too lazy to explain, and dismissively waved
        at her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei’s loyalty and ability did not escape his eyes, so he would
        naturally not treat her badly.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, in his previous world, she would be the so-called perfect
        secretary.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Thank you, master.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei was overjoyed, and her tails could not help but move about in
        excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contents of this jade pot didn’t really matter, as what truly
        mattered was that the often cold and indifferent Gu Changge had actually
        given her something as a gift.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was obviously a great change in Gu Changge's attitude towards her.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Serveral Days Later]</b></p>
      <p>The Immortal Gu family was busy with an important event.</p>

        After the tolling of a few bells, many clansmen put down their work and

      <p>
        On the islands of the various mountains and peaks, silhouettes of Divine
        Rainbows appeared one after another, falling through the sky, all headed
        towards the congregation of holy light that descended from the Heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        The air buzzed with idle chatter, as they all conversed with
        anticipating smiles on their faces.
      </p>
      <p>It was the Holy Land.</p>
      <p>
        Beautiful clouds streaked across the sky, as the rules of chaos and
        order rose, and majestic mountains stood tall. As if everyone had been
        transported back to the most ancient period when heaven and the earth
        first opened.
      </p>
      <p>
        The incomparably rich Heaven and Earth essence transformed and morphed
        into visions of dragons, phoenixes, unicorns, etc., liquefying into
        primordial beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the lush plains and forests, there were even Ancient Tea Trees of
        Dao Enlightenment and immortal trees that grew towards the sky.
        Countless DIvine Medicines and Immortal Herbs flickered with radiance,
        as gleaming treasures dotted the landscape like stars.
      </p>
      <p>And this was merely a sliver of their heritage.</p>
      <p>At the centre of it all…</p>
      <p>
        Inside a grand hall, five young men and women were standing there, led
        by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young scholar-like man was dressed in a plain white robe adorned
        with no accessories; his jade-like hair was tied back using a simple
        hairband.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er, whose expression seemed impossibly cold, was next to Gu
        Changge. Dressed in hunting clothes, exuding an immortal aura, and had a
        look of disgust towards Gu Changge plastered onto her face as if she
        didn’t want to stand near him in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to them, there were three other Young Supremes present, all
        of whom were the potential future elders of the Gu Family, possessing
        terrifying talents and powerful strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Here lies the entrance to the Nirvana Pond of the Ancestral Hall.
          Only five people in each generation can have this opportunity to come
          here to untie the shackles of our bloodline, understand the way of the
          ancestors, improve their cultivation realm, and learn to control the
          flow of nature and the world…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge explained softly, with a strange look in his eyes, as if he
        was talking to the three people beside him.
      </p>
      <p>[Kshn: Now even the author is totally ignoring Xian’er lmao.]</p>
      <p>The atmosphere within the hall was simple but ancient.</p>
      <p>
        Archaic carvings were etched into the ground that didn’t belong to any
        one epoch. Those that had absorbed and retained the mysterious
        principles of Heaven and Earth, containing truths that would allow one
        to realize the truth of the Great Dao at a glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Tch! I know that. You don't need to say something so obvious.”</b>
        Gu Xian'er snorted before retorting. She seemed to really like fighting
        against Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Gu Changge only ignored her, as if treating the lass’
        words as wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Gu Xian’er annoyed. Was he not the person who took her on a
        spending spree in Heavenly Dao Ancient City? Yet why was it, that after
        returning to their Immortal Gu Family, Gu Changge’s face had changed
        completely?
      </p>
      <p>Regressed back to the previous indifference.</p>
      <p>
        Even if she didn’t show it on the surface, she still felt secretly
        annoyed and frustrated in her heart. Having said that, she also knew
        that he had his own difficulties, which was why she’d let him off with
        just a slight beating.
      </p>
      <p>Yeah. That was the reason.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Is everyone present? If so, we will begin unlocking the Nirvana
          Pond.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the palace, a number of old people were already waiting in the
        shadows, carrying a large number of prepared rare immortal materials
        behind them. It was a wide collection of heavenly treasures that would
        incite madness if ever released in the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        All kinds of horrifically precious blood, of all colours and tastes,
        accompanied by phantoms of Ancient Beasts as if they had come back to
        life to fight across time and space.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as bright, peerless elixirs of eternal gold, coated by a flowing
        mist. The fragrance was similar to a field of endless flowers, and it
        alone seemed capable of changing a weak mortal into an immortal soaring
        through the Nine Heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even further in the back, people saw a series of mysterious eggs, shaped
        like small suns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rainbows of the Dao flowed, as immortal chants intertwined and merged
        inside of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brilliant light was incomparably magnificent, like divine jade, with
        molten liquid flowing inside, looking radiant and astonishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were many other divine materials, most of which no one had ever
        heard of or seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Every one of these goodies would cause a big sensation in the
          outside world. No wonder we can only open the Nirvana Pond once every
          generation. Who could stand the price?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the Gu family's Young Supremes couldn't help but mutter in
        amazement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Yeah, I'm afraid only our Family’s heritage can withstand this
          consumption…” </b
        >Another Young Supreme remarked, an exciting light gradually appearing
        in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“We’ve been preparing these things for a long time, even to the point
          of capturing the last sons of many pure-blood kings to fuel the
          source. Of course, the eggs haven't hatched yet, but that’s not
          important.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>An old man with a dry cough replied, feeling a bit heartbroken.</p>
      <p>
        The person next to him nodded and continued,
        <b
          >“For example, that drop of precious blood was acquired by forcing a
          supreme powerhouse to hand it over. It was the most essential drop of
          blood from his single horn. Without millions of years of continuous
          cultivation, it would be difficult to accumulate it again.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The drop of blood radiated immense energy as if it contained countless
        miniature worlds, and it was imbued with an amazing divine will.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single breath could create a peerless genius, thousands of threads
        linking into one. It was extremely precious and almost impossible to
        obtain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing the drop of precious blood, Gu Xian'er's eyes narrowed a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she was still in the Peach Village, though she also received such
        high treatment, the various materials given were far inferior to this.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she performed a second Rebirth inside the Nirvana Pond and her
        cultivation base broke through by a large margin, would there be any
        chance of defeating Gu Changge?
      </p>
      <p><b>“Don’t think too much.”</b></p>
      <p>
        As if reading Gu Xian’er’s wild thoughts, Gu Changge merely gave her the
        side eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er hummed in her heart, but she deliberately showed an
        indifferent expression on her face,
        <b>“Gu Changge, just wait and see.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, an old man looked at them and couldn't help but smile,
        <b
          >“With these materials, and adding on the secret techniques in the
          clan, your bloodlines can be fully transformed. Of course, your
          talents may also change because of this. After all, the original
          talents were all closely linked to one’s bloodline.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded in response.</p>
      <p>
        The others, on the other hand, were extremely excited. Such an
        opportunity was very rare, though how much they could get would depend
        on their own good fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all… it can only be said that they were lucky to be born into an
        Ancient Immortal Family, as only such immortal forces would be able to
        supply these earth-shattering resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outside world could only lick their lips and go insane from greed at
        these materials that even Quasi-Supremes would heavily covet until their
        eyes turned red.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Alright, we will unlock the Nirvana Pond in a moment, so absorb it
          with all your strength. We will help you transform your bloodlines
          with a secret technique. This process will last for a few days, and
          how much you receive will depend on your good fortune.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The words of the old made the expressions of the five people become more
        cautious.

      </div>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s cultivation base had actually long reached the Sacred
        Realm, so this Nirvana Pond or whatever wasn’t helpful to him in the
        slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in his opinion, it possessed value as a tool used to hide from
        people's attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the depths of his cultivation should be exposed some more with
        this ‘rebirth’. After all, Wang Zijin had left seclusion and was already
        walking about with Quasi-Sacred strength.
      </p>
      <p>For him to show a similar realm wouldn’t be too much, right?</p>
      <p>
        Now no one would suspect him to be the Forbidden Demonic Arts'
        Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, Gu Changge felt that this might also be a good
        opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>Isn't this related to bloodline talent?</p>
      <p>
        He wanted to see how his innate Devil Heart might change during the
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there had been rumours that one could glimpse past and future
        lives inside the pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt a little curious as to whether this rumour was true or
        not.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, several people entered the depths of the hall.</p>
      <p>
        There was a misty pond there, with Dao runes emerging one by one,
        reflected in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, there were traces of the Origin aura permeating the
        surroundings, giving rise to a sense of unparalleled harmony with
        nature, as if belonging to the core of this world.
      </p>
      <p>In the mist-shrouded pond, a light source emerged.</p>
      <p>
        Aura of Creation. A fortuitous sign composed of countless shifting
        runes, making it an extremely mysterious sight, as the silver glow
        illuminated the space where boundless divine rules and laws intertwined.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Sit cross-legged by the pond and absorb the substances in it through
          breathing circulation. It's up to you if you can absorb the right
          amount.”</b
        >
        An old man solemnly warned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge, Gu Xian'er and others all sat cross-legged
        here, preparing to wait for the Nirvana Pond to awaken.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hum!</b></p>
      <p>
        Following that, several old people quickly refined and threw all kinds
        of treasures in their hands into the Nirvana Pond, merging the immortal
        treasures into one.
      </p>
      <p>All types of priceless resources were put into it by them.</p>
      <p>The first was a magical plant similar to a sunflower.</p>
      <p>
        Squeezing the petals and leaves, every drop of liquid that seeped into
        the Nirvana Pond was as crystal clear as the most perfect jade, each
        drop the size of a thumb. Moreover, the drops were condensed into a
        fiery essence ten thousand times hotter than that of a Star Nucleus,
        rolling down the branches and stem without leaving so much as a burn!
      </p>
      <p>
        In an instant, an extremely terrifying and astonishing bang sounded, as
        if someone had split the sky in half, to devolve into chaos and return
        to the original source
      </p>
      <p>
        The crystal clear liquid dripped down, turning into an incomparably
        surging divinity. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>The second, the third, the fourth…</p>
      <p>
        Many divine objects and immortal materials entered the Nirvana Pond,
        turning into a surging and resplendent Qi breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at this moment, the void abruptly trembled, and there was an
        astonishing and fairy-like presence bursting through the empty space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was the first to react. Her new Fairy Bone shone brightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole person looked fit to soar into the air, out of worldly dust,
        aloof like an Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>And in that immortal bone, a new immortal intent began to form…</p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        As Gu Xian’er relished in her epiphany, a violent surge rang from Gu
        Changge’s side.
      </p>
      <p>
        His blood was flowing in his veins, making a rushing sound like a
        crushing river current.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was an incomparably thick and terrifying force, indescribable and
        boundless, shocking everyone with its arrival. The pond itself seemed to
        almost crack under the mighty weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge sat there, calm like a deep sea, as every cell in his body
        seemed to come alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only did his breath release a colourful, smoky air, but it was also
        filled with a mysterious black substance that floated up and down in the
        shrouded air.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he seemed to be the incarnation of the world, able to
        swallow everything, and his shocking momentum swept all directions,
        causing the pond to boil!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Aura of Creation rose and fell. A hazy glow, like a dazzling Dao
        rune, fluctuated up and down in the Pond, bubbling to the surface in
        immense amounts.
      </p>
      <p>Yet it was swallowed up by Gu Changge’s every cell!</p>
      <p>
        This terrifying speed even made several old people think it was an
        illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was motionless as his whole body became radiant. The colourful mist
        filled the space, and like a thick fog, completely wrapped around him.
      </p>
      <p>In his sea of ??consciousness, the Dharma Body sat cross-legged.</p>
      <p>
        Its eyes were horrifyingly indifferent, and when it opened its mouth, it
        emitted a monstrous suction force, much like a black hole.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hue of his primordial spirit was faintly changing towards a
        nine-coloured glass.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the sole exception of Gu Xian'er, the other three could not even
        properly settle down right now. Affected by Gu Changge's aura, their
        faces shifted rapidly between white and blue, but they didn't dare to
        say anything more nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Changge's talent is really too strong. How could we still not know
          what it is even after so many years? Today may be an opportunity to
          find out. Such a terrifying physique and vitality, peerless primordial
          spirit power, and to cause a spatial fluctuation like so…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“What kind of talent he has, it's really hard to tell. I just don't
          know if it will manifest…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's situation shocked several clan elders there.</p>
      <p>
        They started discussing it while observing it, and the more they looked,
        the more shocked they became. They wanted to continue watching until
        they could resolve their questions, but—
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        Just outside the palace, a stalwart figure with a deep and calm face
        suddenly appeared.
      </p>
      <p>It was Gu Changge's father.</p>
      <p>The current Patriarch of the Immortal Gu Family.</p>
      <p><b>“Patriarch! “</b></p>
      <p>
        The appearance of Gu Changge's father changed the expressions of several
        Clan Elders. They hurriedly greeted him with courtesy, feeling a little
        guilty in their hearts. After all, Gu Changge's innate talent has always
        been a secret, and Gu Lintian had also said that they should not expose
        it.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Do not forget my words.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Father Gu spoke lightly, his face blurred. A figure that seemed to be
        standing inside another world, and that tyrannical, yet indifferent tone
        caused the expressions of those several Clan Elders who were usually
        very prideful and respected to not dare say anything more.
      </p>
      <p>In any case, they were the ones who had crossed the line.</p>
      <p>
        At the moment, it was not necessary for them to continue staying there,
        since not only was Gu Changge's father present, they even had already
        put most of the divine materials into the Nirvana Pond, meaning their
        work had been accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
        After seeing the Clan Elders leave, Gu's father's expression became very
        complicated, and he looked a little worried, staring at the Nirvana Pond
        in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>He knew that something might happen.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's Devil Heart, in his opinion, was a secret that cannot be
        exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        And within this Nirvana Pond, the Aura of Creation was extremely strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was very likely that it might lead to a change in Gu Changge’s Innate
        Devil Heart. At that time, the reveal of its aura would be noticed by
        the clan elders, spelling disaster for Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, he had personally arrived at their Ancestral Hall to protect Gu
        Changge and at the same time strictly prevent the others from seeing any
        unwanted sights.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I hope I'm just overthinking it. I don't know if this Nirvana Pond
          is a blessing or a curse for Changge. Before, he could barely suppress
          his demonic nature. If a second transformation were to occur now, it
          would be very difficult for him to deal with, and might result in…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Father Gu guessed like so, his expression gradually turning more and
        more worried.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppressing the Demonic Nature of the Innate Devil Heart was too
        difficult for him, and it was no doubt terrifying torture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge would need great perseverance to prevent it from escaping
        this time.

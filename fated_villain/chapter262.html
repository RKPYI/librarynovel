      <h4>
        Chapter 262-1: Regarding the plan of releasing the Demon, If you want to
        die then dont die in front of me (1)
      </h4>
      <p>And in the blink of an eye, several days passed.</p>
      <p>
        The entire Southern Heaven was very uneasy because of the inheritor of
        demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two major forces, the Qilin Clan and the Endless Fire Nation, were
        the most furious. During this time, they had been dispatching their
        clansmen to search for the whereabouts of the inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the three Great Sacred Realm existences that appeared at the
        beginning could not have taken Prince Ying far away. They believed that
        Prince Ying was still in Southern Heaven during this time, but they
        didn't know where he was hiding.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Prince Ying had also become a street rat-like character. Almost
        every day, cultivators and creatures could be seen searching for his
        figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Emperor Mountain had said that Prince Ying had nothing to do
        with them, the incident of Prince Ying using the Ancient Golden Bell to
        kill many young supreme beings was still circulating in various places,
        causing a huge uproar.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hatred couldn’t be washed away by simply saying that they had
        nothing to do with Prince Ying. During this period of time, the Heavenly
        Emperor Mountain could be said to have suffered a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it was the sacred land of the Ancient clans, its status was
        detached, and it was worshiped by the Ancient clans on normal days, but
        at this time, it was still beaten by many forces in the name of seeking
        justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, it was inevitable to compensate for a lot of things before
        this hatred was settled. Heavenly Emperor Mountain was also bleeding
        heavily.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also hated Prince Ying. So, during this time, another Prince from
        the Heavenly Emperor Mountain had also appeared, named Prince Huang.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the day when the Prince Huang appeared, hundreds of millions of paths
        emerged on the road of immortality, thousands of divine splendors, and
        phantoms such as real dragons, white tigers, and immortal phoenixes
        descended all at once, and countless golden divine lotuses bloomed in
        the virtual space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the heavens and the earth, the Ancient Emperor's chariot fell,
        like a young Emperor was descending into the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding Prince Huang, many cultivators were no strangers to him. His
        father was an Emperor many times older than Emperor Ying, and was
        honored as the Emperor Huang by the Ancient clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prince Huang also had his bloodline, and his pupils were a mix of
        vibrant colors, known as the eyes of gods that could see through
        everything in the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        When Prince Huang was born, he immediately ordered the suppression of
        the lineage of Emperor Ying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, under all kinds of powerful means, everyone was overwhelmed!
        He even spread the word that he would personally suppress Prince Ying
        and wash away the shame of Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        This news immediately caused a sensation in all directions. There was no
        doubt that the power of Prince Huang would not be weaker than that of
        any Ancient freak, and his words were indescribably convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, the place where the True Immortal Academy was located,
        an old antique emerged to the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield while
        tracing the scene at that time, he felt that there were some problems in
        this matter.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        However, even this old antique did not find anything unusual, and his
        retrospective methods could not tell what happened at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This only showed that the inheritor of demonic art was really cautious.
        If it wasn't for Young Master of the Qilin Clan leaving behind clues at
        the time, everyone probably would have been kept in the dark by Prince
        Ying and no one would be able to find out about his true identity
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of news also spread all over the world. Then, because of the
        birth of the inheritor of demonic art in the HBattlefield, True Immortal
        Academy had finally opened doors to the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any young being who killed Heavenly Extinction beings in the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield could exchange points and secure a place to enter
        the True Immortal Academy.
      </p>
      <p>For a while, a huge wave went off in all parts of Southern Heaven.</p>
      <p>
        A group of young beings who were originally uneasy because of the
        inheritor of demonic art in the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield also
        took the initiative to leave this place after killing the Heavenly
        Extinction beings, for fear of being remembered by the inheritor of
        demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        At this time, in the depths of the land corrupted by Absolute Heavenly
        Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's figure emerged from the void. This was the third day after
        he and Yue Mingkong parted ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, his cultivation base also broke through to
        the middle stage of the Sacred realm. Because of the relationship
        between the Reincarnation Seal and the Dao Treasure Bottle, the
        breakthrough speed was much faster than usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, within the Sacred Realm, even if it was a breakthrough in a
        small realm, it would take tens of thousands of years at every
        advancement.
      </p>
      <p>
        He did inquire about a lot of news from Yue Mingkong. The matter about
        the Witch in Red seemed to involve the Demon Burying Abyss that would be
        born later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Demon Burying Abyss, as the name suggested, was where the True Demons of
        Nine Heavens were buried. Since ancient times, many Great Demons had
        been killed there, and over time, this place got this name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The location of the Demon Burying Abyss was hard to find. Since it would
        change from time to time, it was not always fixed. There were ancient
        existences asserting that the depth of the Demon Burying Abyss was
        actually an unknown space seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the legendary Depth of Hell would not be as deep as the Demon
        Burying Abyss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the most Ancient Immortals could not make their way out after being
        knocked down and buried in the Demon Abyss.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the location of Demon Burying Abyss involved the Golden Crane
        Temple, which was a mysterious temple on the top of Buddha Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        For countless years, only a handful of people had seen the Golden Crane
        Temple. However, the Buddhists who walked out of the Golden Crane Temple
        had all made a great name in the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every generation of Golden Crane Temple would send cultivators named
        Abyss Guardians, from the Abyss Guardian Town above the Demon Burying
        Abyss. They were responsible for guarding the changes in the Demon
        Burying Abyss.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Gu Changge learned from Yue Mingkong was that soon, there would be
        a riot in the Demon Burying Abyss, destroying the Abyss Guardian Town
        above. This generation of Abyss Guardian would be buried in it, causing
        great chaos in the world.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong didn't say it directly at the time, but Gu Changge also
        guessed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It is estimated that the riot in Demon Burying Abyss has something to
        do with the Witch in Red."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The first thing she would do after her emergence would be most likely
        to seek revenge on me. With my current strength, I don't have much
        chance of winning against her, but with such power behind me, I don't
        need to be afraid of her."
      </p>
      <p>
        "According to the general routine, this kind of female Demon will not be
        too awake after birth. This is a good opportunity for me…"
      </p>
      <p>Various thoughts flashed through Gu Changge's mind.</p>
      <p>
        He had a bold idea in his mind. Release the Demon! The so-called
        blocking was worse than sparse. Now he already knew in advance where the
        Witch in Red was likely to be born, and also knew when she would be
        born.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why couldn’t he take the initiative to go? After all, he was very
        different from the vest of his previous life. Gu Changge was not afraid
        of being noticed by the Witch in REd.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing to pay attention to was how to get there, with a suitable
        excuse by the way. A place like Abyss Burying Demon was not something
        that ordinary people could go to. Even if they go there, they would be
        noticed by the cultivators of the Golden Crane Temple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Gu Changge was still considering a surefire strategy. As for
        the consequences after releasing the Demon, he had not considered it.
        Even if he didn't do this, the Demon would be born sooner or later.
      </p>
      <p>As for re-seal? Were his Luck Points and Destiny Value gone?</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge never thought about resealing. And this kind of thing, if it
        failed, it was bound to cause even more terrible consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Witch in Red hated him like her hatred was indelible in the deepest
        hell. Now he wanted to seal her again? His thoughts gradually returned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Gu Changge swept across the space in front of him that had
        obviously been corroded by the Heavenly Extinction Aura, and his eyes
        darkened.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was an area that was very deep from the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield. If you looked at the distance, it was a million miles away.
        In the space in front of him, he could see many magnificent mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, due to the corrosion of the Heavenly Extinction Aura, there was
        no trace of vitality. The outline of a big power could be vaguely seen
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buildings and pavilions, and beautiful palaces, but now they had all
        become ruins, collapsing in the rich aura of Heavenly Extinction. There
        were no cultivators to be seen here.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that the Heavenly Extinction beings were constantly
        appearing and their strength was also very strong, reaching the Heavenly
        King Realm and even Quasi-Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the younger generation dared to come here, they would be killed in
        minutes. Naturally, Gu Changge didn't come here to kill Heavenly
        Extinction beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because he sensed the imprint left on Wang Ziji's body and knew that she
        had gone to the depths. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        "As a descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall, she is likely to find the
        core area of ??the Absolute Heavenly Extinction. It would be much more
        convenient for her to find the way for me."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had this idea. It remained to be verified where the core
        place of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction was. Gu Changge wanted to
        refine the entire Heavenly Extinction now, but it was not very likely.
        But he could try to refine part of it first.
      </p>
      <p>
        After having these experiences, he would have more confidence when he
        found the real location of the absolute Heavenly Extinction. And soon,
        Gu Changge disappeared again.
      </p>
      <p>
        He hid with the power of the void and was not worried that he would be
        noticed by Wang Ziji.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 262-2: Regarding the plan of releasing the Demon, If you want to
        die then dont die in front of me (2)
      </h4>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        On the other side, the depths of the land of Absolute Heavenly
        Extinction were not quiet, the mountains were shaking, and even the sky
        looked like it would explode anytime.
      </p>
      <p>
        The turbulent and vast aura of Heavenly Extinction was intertwined and
        diffused here, like a fog. There was a crack in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brilliance was soaring to the sky, the runes were blooming and
        intertwined in the sky, and there were powerful methods and supernatural
        powers evolving.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power of the Quasi-Sacred Realm broke out. Carrying an unparalleled
        force, it bombarded the Heavenly Extinction beings ahead like a tidal
        wave.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pale golden tower floated up and down in the void, interweaving a
        terrifying divine light, and pressuring all directions. A slender figure
        with her skirt flying and an icy face, was standing proudly under the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was fighting with countless souls that were swarming like a tide as
        if they wanted to wipe her out.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Chuchu, are you crazy? You plan to close this crack. With your
        current strength, you can't do it at all."
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind this slender figure, Wang Ziji was also making her move, shouting
        at Jiang Chuchu in front of her, while constantly slapping the many
        ghostly creatures that were flying toward her.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there were too many Heavenly Extinction beings here. In the high
        sky, the cracked sky was shrouded in thick gray fog, and it poured down
        like a gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the strength of the two of them alone, it was impossible to deal
        with so many souls in front of them. Not to mention that there were many
        Sacred Realm beings among them, which were extremely difficult to deal
        with.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this time, behind the crack, there seemed to be a more powerful
        aura awakening. The existence of the land of Heavenly Extinction was not
        something they could contend against.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Wang Ziji didn't know what went wrong. Instead of looking for the
        reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, or dealing with the inheritor of
        demonic art, she ran to the land of Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that slaughtering Heavenly Extinction beings had become the
        only means for her to clean up the world and restore the Human Ancestral
        Hall. This made Wang Ziji confused, and she didn't know the reason why
        Jiang Chuchu was like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall, although she shouldered the
        responsibility of safeguarding the justice of this world, she did not
        need to go to this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wang Ziji you go back, this is my business, you don't need to worry
        about it."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, hearing Wang Ziji's voice from behind, Jiang Chuchu also
        spoke. She looked back, her expression was very calm, but there was no
        regret or anything on her face.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, at this time, it could be seen that her exhaustion was not as
        natural as it appeared. Her dress was also stained with blood, and in
        this fight, she was not at all relaxed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji could not understand her. Now that the Human Ancestor was
        dead, Gu Changge, the inheritor of the demonic art, was at ease. There
        was absolutely nothing she could do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Jiang Chuchu thought that the only thing she could do was to come
        here to kill Heavenly Extinction beings, which could be regarded as
        worthy of her current status.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, even if she died here, she would be worthy of the
        cultivation and support of her teacher's sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What is it? How the hell is it only your business? I'm also a
        descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall, okay? Why do you have such a
        stubborn head? Can't you figure it out? Do you want to die here?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji shouted speechlessly, feeling that the current Jiang Chuchu
        was like the abandoned resentful girl she knew in her previous life, and
        who wouldn't listen to any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how she persuaded Jiang Chuchu didn't care, she was determined
        to fight against these Heavenly Extinction beings, and she could hardly
        hold it any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now the inheritor of demonic art has been found. You don't deal with
        him, you're wasting energy and time here, and I wonder what you are
        thinking…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji sacrificed a divine weapon, which was powerful and mighty,
        reflecting heaven and earth in a brilliant light. She was still
        persuading her, and she felt that it was really impossible. She thought
        of a way to knock Jiang Chuchu unconscious and take her away.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the strength of the two of them was not much different. If she
        used her trump card, it might have the opposite effect, after all, it
        was difficult to control it.

        "If I had called Gu Changge to find a way at the time, maybe it would be
        different now. But he doesn't seem to care about Jiang Chuchu's life or
        death. It's probably useless to shout."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin was a little distressed, and with her character, she couldn't
        ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>"The inheritor of demonic art…"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, Jiang Chuchu, who was originally fighting against a
        Sacred Realm Heavenly Extinction being, was suddenly stunned, and then a
        touch of cold hatred appeared in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        She almost gritted her teeth. However, it was because of it that she was
        shot by the Heavenly Extinction being in the Sacred Realm, and flew out
        directly, vomiting blood in the void, obviously not seriously injured.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, she had also reached the point where her spiritual energy was
        totally exhausted. She naturally knew who the inheritor of demonic art
        Wang Ziji was talking about. Prince Ying was nothing but an unlucky
        person who was blamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, the real inheritor of demonic art, was actually still at
        ease. No one even knew his real face, let alone that the Human Ancestor
        had actually died in Gu Changge’s hands and will never reappear in the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Gu Changge, Jiang Chuchu's mood was extremely complicated. If it was
        hatred, then it had to be the type of hatred to the core, but it was
        impossible to forget about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn't forget her expression and tone that day, let alone her
        actions, and her indifferent and irresponsible attitude.
      </p>
      <p>"Be careful……"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Jiang Chuchu seemed to be standing there in a daze,
        ignoring the large swathes of Heavenly Extinction beings attacking from
        behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji's complexion couldn't help changing, and she took out a
        crystal clear mirror and rushed forward to resist the next blow.
        However, during this period of time, Jiang Chuchu killed many Heavenly
        Extinction beings and was contaminated with a strong aura of Heavenly
        Extinction. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        A large number of Heavenly Extinction beings, with red eyes, swarmed up
        with incomparable hatred to drown her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She realized that it was too late. She resisted in a hurry, but also
        flew out in an instant, hurting her body.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Abyss above the sky, at this time, rioted again, and an
        even more terrifying aura came crashing down, and suddenly an
        incomparably huge gray giant palm was protruding from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wrapped in gray fog, it didn't look like a humanoid. But its aura was
        the Great Sacred Realm!
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Wang Ziji's expression change again. She didn't expect that it
        would attract the beings of the Great Sacred Realm. This was not
        something she and Jiang Chuchu could compete with at will.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they didn't run at this time, and there were beings in the Great
        Sacred Realm appearing, it would be even more difficult for them to
        escape.
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Chuchu, don't be stupid, if you stay here, you will die…"</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji couldn't help shouting, her expression was a little anxious,
        she noticed that the huge palm wrapped in the thick gray fog fell, and
        Jiang Chuchu was about to be photographed in a blood fog!
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Jiang Chuchu didn't seem to have reacted yet, but when she
        did, this terrifying giant palm had already fallen in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying and overwhelming aura of Heavenly Extinction devoured and
        covered her! Her face turned pale. Although she was ready to die, how
        could she be calm when she was really facing it?
      </p>
      <p>
        But at this moment, she realized that what appeared in her mind was not
        the teacher's sect, but the face of Gu Changge that she hated to the
        bone.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, between the heavens and the earth, there was a sudden sword
        chant, the light was like a chaotic light that broke everything, with
        boundless sword energy, it crossed the sky, separated the gray fog, and
        fell directly!

      <p>An infinite murderous aura rose to the sky!</p>
      <p><strong>Puff!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Accompanied by a scream, the terrifying giant gray palm was torn apart,
        and then it shattered in the void. Afterward, this sword kept going,
        like an ancient immortal sword that was slashed from the universe, and
        its sharpness was enough to split the universe.
      </p>
      <p>It cut straight into that terrifying crack!</p>
      <p>
        Countless Heavenly Extinction beings shattered into ashes under this
        sword light, before they could even scream!
      </p>
      <p>"…"</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji looked in the direction where the sword light came from in
        shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the void, a young man with indifferent eyes appeared, raised his hand
        with shaking fingers, and a ray of sword light disappeared in the palm
        of his hand.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, why are you here?"</p>
      <p>
        After reacting, Wang Ziji asked in shock. Unexpectedly, Gu Changge would
        appear here in the end, and at a critical moment, he even rescued Jiang
        Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, how could his blow be so terrifying? Had he already reached
        the Great Sacred Realm? Was this the true strength of Gu Changge? He
        really hid so deeply!
      </p>
      <p>"Holy Maiden Ziji…"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked at her, nodded, and then frowned. He did not explain
        why he came here. But Wang Ziji also guessed that it was probably for
        the land of Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, was it for Jiang Chuchu? However, Gu Changge didn't let her think
        wildly, and said casually, "The land of Absolute Heavenly Extinction has
        appeared, I have come to see it, maybe I can do something."
      </p>
      <p>
        He had actually been here for a while. It was just that he didn't expect
        that Jiang Chuchu would actually seek death like this, so she couldn't
        hold back the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it was said that she did not care whether she lived or died, it
        was one thing to say, but another thing to do. Gu Changge didn't plan to
        really ignore her, after all, Jiang Chuchu had a relationship with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a woman who had a relationship with him but could not threaten him,
        he couldn't let it reach the point of death. But hearing him say that,
        Wang Ziji didn't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, in this kind of place, unless there was a problem with the
        brain, who would come here? It was even more impossible for someone like
        Gu Changge to be helpless and stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he came. It was very likely that it was for Jiang Chuchu, something
        unknown happened between the two of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for herself? She was still a little self-aware. She couldn't even
        move.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge…"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Jiang Chuchu also reacted, and noticed that the young man
        who came was Gu Changge. At the critical moment, he saved herself. This
        made Jiang Chuchu a little stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, a cold meaning appeared in her eyes, and she stared at Gu
        Changge, "Didn't you say that you have nothing to do with my life and
        death? Why did you save me?"
      </p>
      <p>"I don't need your help."</p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge didn't seem to notice her, his eyes were deep, and
        he was still looking up at the terrifying crack in the sky. There was
        still a large number of Heavenly Extinction beings gushing out from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he guessed correctly, it was the real entrance that was connected to
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction! Hearing Jiang Chuchu's words, Wang Ziji
        immediately showed a melon-eating look.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was indeed something between the two of them, otherwise, Jiang
        Chuchu would not have said such a thing. It seemed that Gu Changge…
        abandoned her.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge…"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing that Gu Changge completely ignored her. Jiang Chuchu shouted
        again, her expression was very cold, almost gnashing her teeth. At this
        moment, Gu Changge turned his attention to her.
      </p>
      <p>His expression was flat, without much fluctuation.</p>
      <p>
        "If you want to die then don't die in front of me. It's an eyesore."

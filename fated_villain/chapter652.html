        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span><span id="more-34817"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world had been turned upside down, and everything was reduced to dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the World Principles collapsed and crumbled into ashes. There was an endless sea of lightning intertwined. The World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s body continued to melt as his voice faded away. To the crowd, the last indignant roar he let out was like a desperate and unwilling howling of an ancient giant who denounced the injustices of this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, nothing unexpected happened, now that the dust had settled. The horrifying, invincible, and condescending World&#8217;s Will, who regarded all living beings as ants, had turned into a light shower and dissipated before everyone&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s it? Is everything over? Now that the World&#8217;s Will has been wiped out, is our world going to return to normal?&#8221; Someone murmured in a low voice. They were barely in their right mind. With how everything that happened was so unbelievable that it felt like a dream, the people from Profound Sword World could only tremble in fear and disbelief. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They looked at Gu Changge, who was calmly approaching them, with their emotions written all over their faces. The Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, Princess Xuan Dea and others knew Gu Changge quite well. But at this moment, they couldn&#8217;t help but tremble slightly as their bodies turned icy cold. This was way scarier than having to face the World&#8217;s Will. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had been controlling everything from behind the scenes all this while. Even the World&#8217;s Will was nothing more than a pitiful pawn in his hand who was ruthlessly discarded after he had been put to good use. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, did you let us go in preparation for this day?&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal and the others looked bitter when they remembered what it was like when they were imprisoned in the Otherworldly Sky Demons&#8217; dungeon. At that time, they thought kind thoughts that Gu Changge was merciful, and he didn&#8217;t want to cause more killings. No one would have thought that all of this was a part of Gu Changge&#8217;s plan. He only released them so that they would lead the army here and be sacrificed as nourishment. Everyone was only his pawn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are not that stupid after all! What&#8217;s the matter? Are you still thinking of fighting back?&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head lightly and spoke with a calm and unperturbed expression. Both before and now, this group of so-called Earth Sword Immortals were no different from ants to him. And since they were someone he could destroy with the lift of his palm, he didn&#8217;t think he needed to get on their level and reason with them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Will that be of any use?&#8221; The Sword Immortals had a look of despair in their eyes. Princess Xuan Dea, Ah Qing and the others had also turned pale as they looked at Gu Changge who seemed so unfamiliar to them standing not far away. It turned out that it was all a misunderstanding on their part the whole time. From the very beginning, Gu Changge came to this world with a purpose. They were the ones who were too stupid to notice anything. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had been plotting everything out for too long that everyone was deeply involved without being aware. They couldn&#8217;t help shaking as fear completely consumed them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How can such a terrifying person even exist?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You could give it a try. After all, you have to still hold onto hope,&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled and sauntered over while darkness spread behind him. Despite laughing, the depths of his eyes were indifferent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why do this, Young Master Gu?&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea and the others forced a laugh. They couldn&#8217;t accept the fact. However, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t even look in her direction once. He was so apathetic it was as if he hadn&#8217;t heard a word she said. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; An Earth Sword Immortal who had turned red in the eyes howled and transformed into a dazzling sword-like beam as he dashed forward, ignoring the people around him who tried to stop him. He was going to have an all-out fight with Gu Changge. He had seen with his own eye how those dark cages were swallowed by flames, and the many figures imprisoned in them disappeared before they could even scream. He couldn&#8217;t possibly hold back after seeing something like that. Now that he knew that Gu Changge was the culprit of all this, the only thing he could think of was to kill him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a burly and tall figure holding a spear emerged before the Earth Sword Immortal could get near Gu Changge. The figure then pointed south with his tilted hand and, at the speed of lightning, jabbed and pierced through the spot between the Earth Sword Immortal&#8217;s eyebrows in an instant. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corpse was sent flying before it exploded into pieces in the void. The Earth Sword Immortal had died on the spot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a god of war who came out of the depths of hell, Ah Da appeared with an indifferent expression on his face while donning armour. His somewhat scarlet eyes slowly swept across the people in front of him as he stood in front of Gu Changge without saying a word. All the living beings who wanted to attack Gu Changge trembled when they saw this startling scene. Gu Changge&#8217;s subordinate alone was enough to take down everyone here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, they finally understood the reason the World&#8217;s Will said that they would only fall into despair when they learned the truth—everything was doomed from the start. How were they supposed to be hopeful about fighting back when their opponent was Gu Changge?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the low morale and despair on everyone&#8217;s faces, an extremely old Earth Sword Immortal roared, &#8220;Even if we know that there is no hope, we have to fight! How can we be worthy of the many Seniors who died here otherwise? How can we be worthy of the blood they shed?!&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stepped away from the army and ignited his last essence, Qi and Soul before he turned into a ball of flames that rushed forward with no fear of dying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He is right! We can&#8217;t give up yet. We still have one last chance. Wasn&#8217;t it the same just now?&#8221; someone yelled through gritted teeth when they came out of their misery and back to their senses, igniting everyone&#8217;s hope again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes! How can we say that there is no hope when it is not even the end?! Our hope lies in our hearts!&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal also roared. He soon wiped away his despair and dejection as he and the other Earth Sword Immortals charged ahead. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly influenced by the crowd&#8217;s emotions, the unrivalled figure from the Ancestral Symbol, that had faded out after being filled with darkness, suddenly burst into light and grew shone more brilliantly than before. All of a sudden, even the strands of its hair became thicker, and each hanging strand was like a vast galaxy that was surrounded by an immeasurable glow </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge!&#8221; Everyone couldn&#8217;t help looking at the unrivalled figure standing on the top of the dark clouds with hope in their eyes. This was the existence that was summoned when everyone&#8217;s essence, Qi and Soul were connected, and it contained the unyielding will of all the people. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just now, it was invincible when it launched thousands of attacks at the World&#8217;s Will. However, its current aura was even more powerful and terrifying. Endless rays of light, with various Principles resonated with every gesture.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the ancient figure in animal skin clothes and equipped with a bone staff, Gu Changge had an epiphany. [The Ancestral Symbol that the World&#8217;s Will spoke of might be from a True Immortal&#8217;s Source… The most likely reason the Profound Sword World had conceived a Will. Was this world created by a True Immortal or conceived by a dead True Immortal after death?] After thinking about all this, Gu Changge no longer held back and directly raised his hand and thrust forward. Vast Qi fluctuations surged and turned into a monstrous Demonic Cloud that instantly engulfed this space. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All who rushed towards him promptly collapsed under this force as their bodies and Souls were destroyed, and their bodies cracked before they turned into bloodmist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the battle with the World&#8217;s Will just now, this battle was obviously more tragic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large number of living beings charged towards Gu Changge, but before they came into contact with him, they were crushed by the majestic force. They couldn&#8217;t even muster a groan when they exploded into pieces. Their current state was comparable to a dead leaf crushed by violent waves in the sea. They were so small they could even cause a ripple. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a power of complete destruction. As the void collapsed and the world dried up, terrifying chains the size of mountains spread from the depths of darkness to absorb the power of this World Source. The ball of misty brilliance was also rapidly solidifying and growing, taking its time to transform from a Prototype to a mature one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calmly, Gu Changge watched the many ancient sacrificial scriptures around him light up and gather all the energy. However, the Source of this world, in his opinion, still lacked something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems that I will still need to devour you to make the Source perfect.&#8221; Gu Changge took the initiative to strike. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Eight Barren Demon Halberd fell horizontally, it seemed as if there was a glow capable of causing destruction, enough to overturn the River of Time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Clang!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Clang!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Clang!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the empty space, a terrifying and vast glow of the halberd emerged and bloomed endlessly. One ray was sufficient to destroy the universe!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just an instant, all the Principles and living beings in front of him were destroyed and turned to ashes that went away with the wind. Let alone living beings, even the universe would find this kind of godly power unbearable. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal and the others who were on their way to attack Gu Changge exploded immediately, shattering their souls until there was nothing left of them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the darkness, large stars spun and gathered before they all fell. The unrivalled figure manifested from the Ancestral Symbol had a cold look in his eyes as he charged towards Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It thought it heard the prayers of all living beings in this world. It walked out from the River of Time after gathering the beliefs and hopes of all living beings. As the Sound of the Great Dao resonated, various celestial phenomena that prompted sacred beings to kneel and demons to bow appeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Demon!&#8221; There was an inaudible buzzing sound in his mouth. It was a language too old to be from this period, but everyone understood what those words meant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surrounded by gigantic runes, the figure charged at Gu Changge. The countless beams of light turned into thousands of extremely bright divine weapons that rushed forward. This was an unpredictable and indescribable power capable of destroying the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Hum!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chilling halberd glow as hundreds of millions entangled wisps of Demonic Energy swept, smashing and washing away everything. As the Eight Barren Demon Halberd swung downwards, the gap between space and time was slashed in an instant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why would someone dead reappear in this world?&#8221; As Gu Changge walked away, the already decayed space suddenly collapsed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a terrifying vision emerging behind him as all kinds of Chaotic Lights permeated and intertwined. All kinds of ancient and powerful manifestations appeared in his palms as clear as seven-coloured divine glass. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of him was a Golden Dao shrouded in a dark fog. Holy and Demonic coexisted here. He was as indifferent and majestic as a god overlooking the heavens. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figure the Ancestral Symbol manifested from was equally terrifying as various ancient beasts seem to emerge under its feet. When they reappeared on this side of the world, they let out roars that shook the universe and bore their claws while they flapped their wings and rushed towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As I thought… This energy. It’s only possible if you have once reached the True Immortal Realm…&#8221;Gu Changge whispered to himself. Despite facing this kind of existence who had achieved such a cultivation level countless years ago, he remained indifferent. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not take out many Artifacts. It wasn&#8217;t a matter of only a one-level difference between an expert of this level and a True Daoist. It was impossible to obliterate and devour the figure by ordinary means. However, Gu Changge thought that the outcome of this battle was already determined by fate, and there was no second possibility. It was only a matter of time before his opponent was wiped out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The endless waves from the battle spread while this space continued to collapse. No one knew how much time and space passed in between this battle as Gu Changge fought against the figure. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world was almost turned upside down. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge’s eyes were emotionless and calm as he stood at the end of the darkness, shrouded in the thick dark fog. His powerful Grand Flask automatically appeared with runes hanging from it while it devoured everything. All the World Principles were then destroyed and sucked in. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thick Chaos Mists diffused and Principles were broken down, resulting in complete chaos. The only thing left behind was countless beams of light.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge swung his halberd again, and the terrifying brilliance seemed to tear apart the endless universe, shattering and destroying everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Perish!&#8221; he muttered with a calm look on his face. As massive fluctuations spread, the worlds collapsed, and the unrivalled figure standing on the top of the dark clouds began to break down inch by inch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scene left everyone in despair. They could no longer see any hope. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time seemed to stop in that dead silent space. Chaos was the only thing left after all fluctuations ceased. It wouldn&#8217;t be wrong to say that this place was the beginning of the division of heaven and earth. It was hard to even see its boundaries. Only the vast and majestic World Energy surged under Gu Changge’s feet as if an ancient world was being conceived within.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ancient and tall ancient battleship the size of a land passed slowly across this vast expanse. Dressed in clothes whiter and cleaner than snow, Gu Changge stood fore like a detached god. He only shook his head lightly with calm and unwavering eyes as he looked at the chaotic Profound Sword World. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After refining and taking away the World Source, he did not obliterate the many Souls left scattered in this world. In other words, after a few thousand years, or maybe hundreds of millions of years or even longer, this world would start to reform again. Everything would be reincarnated to start over. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The reincarnation of each world signifies the rebirth in the midst of destruction. Perhaps this is what real reincarnation is&#8230;&#8221; A slender figure slowly approached Gu Changge from behind. There was a myriad of emotions written on her demure and elegantly exquisite face. It was Yu Feiya, the Eldest Princess of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was actually a little surprised that Gu Changge followed the agreement and didn&#8217;t kill her. But after thinking about it, she came to a sudden realisation that it was because her being alive was more useful to Gu Changge, especially now that many of the Upper Realm Forces that came to this world had perished here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Destruction after rebirth and rebirth after destruction. Is this really reincarnation?&#8221; Gu Changge put on a faint smile and looked away before he disappeared on the spot. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted to start refining and devouring the World Source since he had finally obtained it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Things will only get more troublesome after I return to the Upper Realm.]</span></p>

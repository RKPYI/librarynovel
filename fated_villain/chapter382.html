          >The Godly Illusion Clan had already paid the price for what they did.
          After all, a Peak Scared Lord Realm Master wasn&#8217;t just anybody
          on the street. They were the pillars of any force, a vital existence.
          Even the Godly Illusion Clan would be pained by the loss and certainly
          wouldn&#8217;t just sit back and do nothing. Thus, it&#8217;d be
          inexcusable if Gu Changge continued to hold onto the matter, even if
          he was the Young Master of the Immortal Gu Family, and people would
          start to think of him as tyrannical.</span

          sit idly by and allow the Immortal Gu Family to be so domineering.
          After all, there had been a tacit understanding between the different
          forces of the Upper Realm for countless years, to try to not
          overstretch one&#8217;s boundaries..</span

          >One had to admit that Jiang Luoshen was shrewd, making herself the
          victim effortlessly. Moreover, she looked like a goddess with her long
          blond hair, impeccable facial features, and fair, flawless skin. So,
          naturally, many young prodigies felt bad for her.</span

          knew what she was trying to do. &#8220;That&#8217;d be an
          exaggeration, Princess Luoshen. I never consider myself a ruthless
          man, nor one to ever inflict violence upon women. No way would I do
          something like that. Of course, if you don&#8217;t believe me, you can
          try seeing for yourself if I will kill you.&#8221;</span

          inexplicably, having a feeling that Gu Changge genuinely wanted to
          feel what it was like to kill her.

          already put it like that, I&#8217;ll naturally believe you.&#8221;
          Jiang Luoshen was not someone ordinary either. Though she felt
          absolutely apprehensive, she still put up a calm front, staring
          impassively right into Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes as she chose to avoid
          fighting him without hesitation.</span

          her teeth in response. Then, with a disdainful snort, she flashed away
          and headed to the area near the crack and the palace. Meanwhile, the
          rest of the Godly Illusion Clan transformed into divine rainbows and

          feeling deeply hopeless and powerless. He now got an even deeper

          Luoshen, whom he thought was ever lofty and noble, could only suffer

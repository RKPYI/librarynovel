          >In a Palace, Gu Xianer looked especially slender and ethereal in her
          divine dress which complemented her beautifully. Annoyed by Gu
          Changge&#8217;s teasing, she raised her slender hand to slap his
          away.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Your smile disgusts me.&#8221; She glared at him, itching to
          tear off his face as he laughed at her. Did she say anything wrong?
          Which aspect of her wasn&#8217;t attractive?</span

          >&#8220;Did I say anything wrong?&#8221; He studied her with interest.
          She was still extremely confident in herself and he didn&#8217;t know
          where she got that from, considering she was as skinny as a bamboo
          pole.</span

          annoyance when he studied her before realising she didn&#8217;t have
          much to back up her claim. She recalled An Yan, who had a pretty good
          relationship with her, with some dejection. They were of a similar age
          but their bodily features varied widely.</span

          snorted. &#8220;Did you know the number of admirers I can summon with
          a wave of a hand can break the threshold of the Gu Family home with
          their sheer number?&#8221;</span

          if I say something against it?&#8221; Gu Changge pinched her nose as
          he smiled.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The more you protest, the greater my desire to do it.&#8221;
          He smiled lightly.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She knew that he would definitely do that judging by his character.
          That&#8217;s a good thing though since her admirers would buzz
          annoyingly around her like flies otherwise.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She stared at him doubtfully, sensing a hidden meaning in his words.
          In the next moment, her entire body stiffened as she blushed and tried
          to escape but wasn&#8217;t strong enough. Soon, she fell into his arms
          heavily. Her mind went blank and she couldn&#8217;t exert any strength
          at all due to her weak limbs.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Let me go.&#8221; She came back to herself quickly and glared
          at him, snorting when she remembered what he had said.
          &#8220;Weren&#8217;t you mocking me just now?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He smiled as he watched her face which was close to his and suddenly
          said, &#8220;Xianer.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Eh?&#8221; She panicked at the way he was looking at her and
          began to stutter, no longer as confident as usual. &#8220;Y-you
          can&#8217;t bully me from now on or I won&#8217;t care about you
          anymore.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Am I just a bully to you?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled, leaning
          his head against hers and closing his eyes. &#8220;You are so
          evil.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You are the evil one. You always just want to tease me.&#8221;
          Gu Xianer froze and then snorted, feeling that he wasn&#8217;t
          planning on anything much. She sighed in relief internally but then
          began to worry. [He doesn’t usually behave this gentlemanly; Is it
          because I am really no longer that attractive to him?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just as she was immersed in her thoughts, she heard the light sound
          of breathing from beside her ear while a weight landed on her
          shoulder. She turned to look; Gu Changge seemed to have fallen asleep.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This stunned her since cultivators did not need rest or sleep after
          reaching a certain stage. They would cultivate themselves when tired,
          consistently maintaining an alert state. For her, could only sleep
          well after returning to the Peach Village and relaxing in the peaceful
          quiet, no longer concerned about anything. That was when cultivators
          were at their weakest as well, so Gu Changge falling asleep surprised
          her. This meant that he completely lowered his guard when with
          her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[That must be it since he was willing to entrust his life to me back
          then.] Her gaze became soft. [He&#8217;s probably tired from leading
          such a glorious life. There&#8217;s so much he has to consider and
          plan.]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She looked at the frown remaining on his sleeping face and sighed,
          stretching out a hand to smooth out his brow. She was frustrated
          because she could have assisted him had she been stronger, including
          with the issue regarding the Demonic Heart or with powerful enemies;
          instead, she needed him to send his subordinates to protect her
          safety.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing how soundly asleep he was, Gu Xianer stared at him and seemed
          to think of something. Blushing, she turned her head and gave him a
          quick kiss, like a fox cub robbing a chicken coop.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The battle between the Upper Realm and the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains at the Aether Abyss quickly spread, causing shock in the
          worlds neighbouring the Border Marker Sea. Many of the Upper Realm
          were all stunned before becoming delighted. While this battle had
          given them plenty of surprises, the eventual blow it caused the other
          side as well as a stable pathway paved through the Aether Abyss was
          undeniable. For now, the All-Repelling Force of the Border Marker Sea
          would last for three years at most.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the different Domains of the Upper Realm, covered in fog and an
          all-encompassing aura, there were terrifying figures with infinitely
          strong Dharma Bodies thousands of kilometres tall beginning to leave
          their homelands. Each step they took covered millions of kilometres.
          They even tore apart the universe as they moved.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          three months when the timing was right.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the different clans
          discussed the issue, while trying to root out the spy from the Upper
          Realm. The path to cross the Aether Abyss was clearly because there
          was a traitor in their midst. Zhao Yunze, the Young Domain Master of
          the Great Cloud Domain, quickly noticed something suspicious and sent
          out an order.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >While Xiao Yang knew that it had been the Sky Deer Goddess who had
          betrayed their side, his lowly status made his claims doubtful. He was
          also worried that this might alert any spy she had placed, so he was
          careful to not speak too much. Now that the Array Cores of Sky Deer
          City didn&#8217;t belong to her, he knew it wouldn&#8217;t be easy for
          the Upper Realm to cross its barrier. That meant that the city was
          safe for now.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, had domains of extremely
          enormous size and filled with plenty of forces, which had been passed
          down from previous generations, The wastelands, meanwhile, was just as
          its name suggested—extremely barren and filled with clouds of dust—and
          very few cultivators living there. Though, clusters of wild beasts
          inhabited the area. Besides that, extremely unique clans could be
          found there though they hadn&#8217;t joined the battle during the
          invasion of the Upper Realm.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that things had become much more urgent, the Domain Masters of
          the Ten Domains set out to visit the leaders of the eight Wastelands
          to discuss the matter. Domain Masters or Wasteland Masters were True
          Daoists, at the very least. Furthermore, they were not just any True
          Daoist but those who had progressed far within the Nirvana Realm.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The events at the Aether Abyss had given every clan a headache and
          resulted in grievous losses on their part. Even Zhao Yunze who had
          been unrivalled 60 million years ago had sustained injuries after
          fighting with the leader of the Upper Realm Army. This made the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains extremely worried about the impending
          disaster, with every being and cultivator sensing the terrifying
          determination of the Upper Realm in trying to take over. The news of
          the deaths of the True Daoist Elders and Ancestors belonging to the
          Black Tortoise War God Clan, Lu Clan, and the Nine-Headed Golden Bird
          Clan caused further chaos soon after.</span

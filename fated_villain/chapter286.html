          within the areas where the Eternal Overcast have seized. The Yin
          Emperors have developed a mind of their own, leading the Eternal
          Overcast creatures under them to start attacking ancient cities and
          forces. As of now, the Vermillion Bird Empire has been attacked,
          leading to the loss of large swathes of land and the terrible deaths
          of many cultivators…”</span

          many of the young prodigies present. Hearing the news outraged many,
          who clench their fists with strong desire to avenge them. The Eternal
          Overcast had now invaded many surrounding worlds and realms while
          continuously birthing its own creatures. This was the greatest scourge
          many factions would face. The cultivators might be able to escape with
          their lives, but it would be a catastrophe for any normal human
          being.</span

          Chuchu this time?] Gu Changge was in deep thought, as he was attached
          to such a rare, precious Source. After consuming and digesting part of

          damsels. Other than his betrothed Yue Mingkong, the Successor of the
          Mortal Palace who was born in the Sacred Realm, also had a close
          relationship with him. Even Qing Xiaoyi, the young girl rumoured to
          have the Celestial Demonic Physique, seemed to fancy him; it was
          obvious in her admiring gaze. This made Gu Xianer moody for some
          reason. Furthermore, she was placed on the same team as Qing Xiaoyi
          and Qing Feng. [Doesn’t this mean I would have to look out for these
          two weaklings as well?]</span

          hadn&#8217;t seen anything. Bringing her with him would be extremely
          inconvenient. Being a Fortuitous Lady, she had a great abundance of
          Fortuity, so she should learn to develop herself by looking for any
          opportunity to improve. Gu Changge had been wondering if she would
          surprise him by bringing back one of the Tools of World Domination.
          [Foolish girl. Why are you waiting for me to lead you? There is no way
          I would do that.]</span

          care about her. [Just what had he drugged her with?]</span

          Overcast, led by the strongest of disciples, the Ranked Disciples.
          Since Qin Wuya, who had emerged from the Wondrous Stone, had
          temporarily left the Immortal Academy, many Unranked Disciples got the
          chance to draw straws as well, including Yue Mingkong and Gu Xianer.
          Even though they were still in the Enlightened King Realm, their true
          power was unknown to the Elders. This was because no one knew the
          techniques every young prodigy possessed. Who knew what ultimate
          technique they would use when they needed it the most? Thus, they were
          treated as Ranked Disciples for this trial.</span

          neither of them showed any awkwardness. If Gu Changge refused to

          watch the fun without any care. She was now even mentioning the enmity

          >The other teams the disciples joined were those belonging to the King
          of Six Crowns, Prince Shen, and Yue Mingkong. Gu Xianer, Qing Xiaoyi,
          and Qing Feng looked awkward as no one joined their teams including
          the Outer disciples. Everyone knew Qing Xiaoyi and Qing Feng&#8217;s
          current condition; although the Elders were all expectant of her
          Talents, she had only been cultivating for a short time. They would be
          a burden during the trial. Gu Xianer was not weak either, but she was
          still weak compared to the other young Ranked Disciples, especially
          with the two burdens she carried with her.</span

          >&#8220;What&#8217;s happening…&#8221; Even Gu Xianer, who had always
          been cold and proud, could not believe her eyes. There was no one with
          her except for the siblings. It made her surroundings look deserted
          compared to the other teams, who had plenty of followers. Even the Sky
          King Zhi Yang, a loser who had been humiliated by Gu Changge, had many
          disciples joining him. So why didn&#8217;t she have any? Was she that
          unpopular?

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She couldn&#8217;t understand this, as she was comparable to the
          other prodigal damsels in terms of beauty and power level, even far
          exceeding some of them. Why didn&#8217;t anyone join her then? This
          made her blush with embarrassment and awkwardness.</span

          used to such situations, but they could feel their faces getting hot
          with embarrassment. This was obviously because of them.</span

          &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, they just don&#8217;t have taste. It&#8217;s
          fine if we have fewer people so I can save the energy needed to
          protect them.&#8221;</span

          Feng smiled weakly as he made the promise. If not for him and his
          sister, Gu Xianer wouldn&#8217;t have been embarrassed like
          this.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Elders, watching this from the sky, did not know how to react. It
          was the first time such an awkward situation had happened in the
          Immortal Academy, especially when Qing Feng and Qing Xiaoyi were
          promising disciples in their opinion.

          >Qing Feng had shown profound transformation during his time here,
          developing traces of Chaos Qi within his veins, bones, and organs. The
          occasional sound of wind and thunder showed how shockingly strong he
          was. This made many of the Elders surprised, and they concluded after
          some research that he had a mysterious physique. It hadn&#8217;t
          awakened before since he couldn&#8217;t cultivate.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This meant that both Qing Xiaoyi and Qing Feng had great fortune in
          owning a unique physique, which surprised the Elders. This was why
          they had allowed the siblings to join the trial together. However,
          they hadn&#8217;t expected the other young prodigies to be so
          materialistic, favouring the stronger teams instead. While Gu
          Changge&#8217;s team was to the point of bursting, due to the sheer
          number of people, his cousin looked pitiful compared to him.</span

          siblings when I get the chance.&#8221; Gu Changge suggested with a
          smile as if sensing the frustration of the Elders. The siblings and Gu
          Xianer all had great Fortuity, so they wouldn&#8217;t be harmed so
          easily.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          was very sympathetic and was managing everything. The dissatisfaction

          a busybody,&#8221; Gu Xianer said scornfully when she heard their
          conversation. She was however pleased and smug. He might claim to not
          care about her, but his actions betray him.</span

          >After that, a blinding beam of light shone towards them. The air
          surrounding the great teleportation array was thick with spiritual
          energy. It was made out of interweaving lines of runes, exuded a
          terrifyingly intense power, resembling an ancient gateway.</span

          appeared with a wave of his hand. The ancient battleships disappeared
          as they entered the gateway, speeding towards the location of the
          trial.</span

          deaths should not exceed half the number.&#8221; One of the Elders
          sighed with worry in his gaze. The trials from the Immortal Academy
          were vastly different to that of the other factions. Since the law of
          survival of the fittest was a priority here.

          the Mountain Elders present and terrifying rays appeared in their

          Daoists of the Nine Great Mountains had shown up. The Third Mountain
          Elder in particular felt Gu Changge had tricked him, as he had been

          of the Mountain Elders, glaring coldly at her. His eyes shone brightly
          with indistinct five-coloured light, which made him look powerful and

          average True Daoists were inferior to her and so three of them
          instantly rushed towards her wielding their abilities. They might be
          different in terms of what and how they cultivated, but they were
          already at a stage of understanding and control of the Great Dao,
          along with its Principles, which was unimaginable by normal

          ashes as well.

          grab her like the ocean sweeping towards her in huge waves. However, a
          golden lotus bloomed beside her, which wasn&#8217;t a mere silhouette
          but a real lotus flower with mysterious power. It blocked the attack

          transformed into godly weapons which could easily split the universe

          Ninth Mountain Elder, whose power rushed forward like the ocean. It
          was unrivalled in its force and formidability. Stars from outside the
          area shook with the force, each one as weak as a speck of dust
          compared to it.</span

          but you guys chose to die instead.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head,
          seemingly sad about this, yet his cold gaze was unwavering. [I
          don&#8217;t mind the cumulative attack of True Daoists. The drop of
          True Blood which I have absorbed and consumed has made my cultivation
          improve even further, and besides, my own abilities have surpassed

          hard to invade with the support of the Celestial Seal of the Nine
          Mountains, leading to other variables such as excessive use of
          military force. He had already put that into consideration and thus
          felt extremely confident after he got the seal. After all, he had been
          waiting for a chance to do this.</span

          surging from him in response to the Ninth Mountain Elder&#8217;s
          attack. His enormous golden hand, as strong as an Immortal, was
          all-encompassing, It hit the figure before him. With a loud boom,
          bright light exploded like stars and the force swept through the sky
          and land. The figure immediately shook violently as his body hurt
          intensely and terrifying cracks began to show.</span

          >[How is he so powerful? He isn&#8217;t a True Daoist!] The Ninth
          Mountain Elder stared at Gu Changge with shock. The powerful Chaos Qi
          exuding from him was like an ocean. He then noticed a golden yellow
          gourd as big as a palm, covered with green patterns and beams of red
          light. It contained murderous power.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[The Immortal-Killing Gourd!? Why does he have it!?] The Ninth
          Mountain Elder recognised it immediately and felt more frightened,
          knowing how terrifying it was. He did not dare act recklessly. Nirvana
          Runes appearing all over his body as Nirvana Principles surged
          violently, transforming into an impenetrable shield as he tried to
          counter the attack.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The other Mountain Elders became shocked as well, knowing the
          strength and mystery of the item more than the ordinary person. They
          didn&#8217;t know how the lost Immortal-Killing Gourd had ended up in
          Gu Changge&#8217;s possession.</span

          on you.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s expression did not waver and with a
          split second&#8217;s thought, the Immortal-Killing Gourd shimmered
          with crimson light seemingly constituted from infinite rays of sword
          Qi. And then, a red beam of light shot from the mouth and through the
          universe and time. It bore a murderous intent as it moved as fast as
          lightning. With a popping sound, it went through something accompanied
          by a surge of blood.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The body of the Ninth Mountain Elder suddenly split apart at the
          neck, blood spilling like a geyser from his wound. There was terror
          and disbelief in the man&#8217;s gaze as his body and soul were
          forcefully split apart. The other Mountain Elders felt frightened and
          felt a coldness at their necks. This wasn&#8217;t just a simple
          decapitation as his life had been split apart as well.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Seems like killing the weakest True Daoist holds no issues.] Gu
          Changge watched this with satisfaction. The strength of the
          Immortal-Killing Gourd was dependent on the power and cultivation of
          its Master and he was still quite far from being a True Daoist.
          However, this Ninth Mountain Elder could only be considered a weakling
          at that level, which meant that the Gourd was the sharpest tool of its
          kind and yielded effective results. Of course, it was impossible to
          use it again in a short time.</span

          >[If we attack at the same time, he won&#8217;t be able to stop us by
          himself!] The Third Mountain Elder looked wary, as he knew how
          terrifying the Immortal-Killing Gourd could be as well. Besides, they
          didn&#8217;t know what other abilities he possessed until now. The
          only solution was to attack him at the same time.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Wudi advised, looking conflicted as he watched the Third Mountain
          Elder prepare to attack Gu Changge.</span

          and the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were both irreconcilable.
          Only when one side vanquishes could their enmity end. The Nine Great
          Mountains belonged to the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and had
          sent their disciples out of isolation to counter the invasion of the
          Upper Realm.</span

          expression shifted, not daring to stay when his life was in the other
          man&#8217;s hand. He transformed quickly into a divine rainbow and
          flew towards the Second Mountain.</span

          Great Mountains were fighting, the enormous Gu Family Army was
          approaching the borders of this place. A bright light illuminated the
          sky as disciples of the Nine Great Mountains wielded different
          artifacts and activated arrays at different parts in an attempt to
          defend the continent. This led to another battle of an unimaginable
          scale, and was unable to be stopped.</span

          formidable aura headed forward with a cold expression. He was in the
          Sacred Emperor Realm, covered head-to-toe in gold armour, with a spear
          in hand as he rode on a golden lion.

          rising tide, all exuding terrifying auras and heavenly light. Even the
          weakest of them was in the Sacred Lord Realm. This mighty army was
          filled with those in the Sacred Lord and Sacred King Realm, with
          several who had even reached the Sacred Emperor and Quasi-Nirvana

          waved his golden spear, it seemed like a True Dragon waving its tail,
          conjuring runes which destroyed the great arrays before it. The
          disciples of the Nine Great Mountains all coughed up blood from the

          scale comparable to the sun and the moon. It also had innumerable

          >The disciples of the Nine Great Mountains shivered with fear at the
          sight and became desperate. It was clear they didn&#8217;t have enough
          force to counter the great army approaching, and how were they going
          to push it back when more of its reinforcements were arriving? There
          weren&#8217;t many disciples in the Nine Great Mountains as it was
          isolated for far too long, and the only disciple they had accepted all
          these years was Xiao Yang.</span

          >The scent of blood was thick in the air as the continent, which had
          resembled a paradise, was reduced to ruins. It was a decisive massacre
          with a clear winner, as some eventually surrendered due to their fear.
          However, the terrifying army above the sky did not show any mercy and
          crushed them under the paws of their beasts.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, in the Second Mountain, the great mountain was covered in
          ancient trees and mist. Light glowed from many different parts of the
          mountain as its disciples readied themselves for battle with grave
          expressions. They had already sensed the terrible and shocking quakes
          from the battle being waged somewhere in the distance and felt like
          prostrating themselves from the aura.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They had just been taken back by the Second Mountain Elder and
          hadn&#8217;t really understood what had happened before they saw
          blood-coloured light on the edge of the continent, like a massacre was
          coming from that location. All of a sudden, a bright rainbow landed;
          it was Gu Wudi with a pale and terrified face.</span
        >

          >&#8220;Where&#8217;s the Second Mountain Elder? There&#8217;s an
          enemy attack. Take me to him now. My Master and his companions cannot
          hold on any longer!&#8221; He looked pale, and his voice shook from
          the shock from which he hadn&#8217;t recovered yet. The disciples of
          the Second Mountain were surprised to see him, not understanding why
          he was here. However, they did not dare hesitate any longer after
          hearing his words. He was still the Chosen One of the Nine Great
          Mountains no matter what had happened in the test.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, Gu Wudi was taken to a palace within the Second Mountain. The
          Second Mountain Elder looked solemn as he was conversing with Xiao
          Yang. The two of them didn&#8217;t look too happy to see Gu Wudi. Xiao
          Yang in particular wore a cold and hateful expression.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; His tone was frigid as he recalled
          how Gu Wudi had cheated when they spared just to defeat him. Anger and
          frustration rose inside him at that thought and thus he didn&#8217;t
          want to treat him with courtesy.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, Gu Wudi didn&#8217;t look like he had heard him, directing a
          desperate expression towards the Second Mountain Elder. He fell to his
          knees with a thump at the same time, looking regretful as he spoke
          with a shaking voice.

          >&#8220;Second Mountain Elder, I have realised my mistake. Please go
          save my Master. We’ve been tricked by Gu Changge! Even the Celestial
          Seal of the Nine Mountains had fallen into his hand! We
          shouldn&#8217;t have listened to him back then and followed his
          instructions to defeat Junior Brother Xiao Yang.
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a mistake and I hope both you and Junior
          Brother Xiao Yang will forgive me. If you don&#8217;t act now, my
          Master and the rest will be in danger. The terrifying army from the
          outside world is here! They even brought with them an ancient
          battleship! It has already stepped into the Nine Great Mountains and
          we cannot even impede their progress!&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He looked dejected, guilty, and tormented, and his words made Xiao
          Yang stunned and disbelieving. With his strength, he could only sense
          something suspicious happening there but could not know what had
          exactly happened. He hadn&#8217;t expected the Celestial Seal of the
          Nine Mountains to be taken by Gu Changge as well; did that mean that
          the Nine Great Mountains now had no defences left?</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Second Mountain Elder looked like he had already known what Gu
          Wudi wanted to say and sighed lightly while looking outside.
          &#8220;With my abilities, I can easily sense the terrible war
          occurring in the distance. The many Mountain Elders haven&#8217;t
          fought in so long. Yet, at this moment, they chose to attack in
          unison. This can only mean one thing—the Nine Great Mountains are
          facing an unprecedented crisis. I already know what you are talking
          about but I still have more pressing matters to attend
          to.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He did not have the energy to blame Gu Wudi right now and looked at
          Xiao Yang with an unreadable expression. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you
          off first.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;Master!&#8221; Xiao Yang couldn&#8217;t hide his reluctance,
          especially since the Nine Great Mountains were facing grave danger and
          he didn&#8217;t know when he could return.</span

          >&#8220;You must go and find out who you are.&#8221; The Second
          Mountain Elder shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already taught you
          what is required. From now on, you have to rely on yourself for the
          rest of your journey. If possible, seek out the Supreme Mountain
          Elder. Besides that, I may still have surviving relatives that might
          be able to help you.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Okay, Master.&#8221; Xiao Yang looked forlorn.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If you have to send him away, Second Mountain Elder, send me
          away with him. I don&#8217;t think I will be of help if I stay here.
          Now that the Nine Great Mountains are in a terrible crisis, I can at
          least still ensure Youngest Junior Brother is safe even if you
          encounter any danger. That way, we can ensure the continuation of the
          teachings of the Nine Great Mountains.&#8221; Gu Wudi looked like he
          had suddenly recalled something and became excited and pleased.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Coward!] Xiao Yang felt disgusted by his words and looked scornful.
          The first thing Gu Wudi thought of wasn&#8217;t to fight the enemy
          with his fellow disciples but to flee. He was a disciple of the Nine
          Great Mountains and also the Chosen One. Yet, he was behaving like
          this. This infuriated him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;re right. Another person leaving means another
          hopeful chance.&#8221; The Second Mountain Elder sighed again at the
          suggestion. However, his eyes were fixed on Gu Wudi as he continued,
          &#8220;However, you must swear on your Dao Heart to never harm Xiao
          Yang.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was still distrustful of Gu Wudi and decided to keep an eye on
          him. After all, it would be far too easy for Gu Wudi to get rid of
          Xiao Yang with his Sacred Emperor Realm might. Gu Wudi had no excuse
          for refusing and quickly agreed. He sighed simultaneously in relief as
          he had completed Gu Changge&#8217;s instructions, which meant he had
          managed to preserve his own life.</span

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, the marriage between the Immortal Gu Family and Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty left many Forces dissatisfied over a decade ago. However, due to the formidableness and age of those two Immortal Forces, as well as their immeasurable foundations, the other Forces dared not to intervene, afraid of drawing their retaliation.</span><span id="more-34834"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong were now at marriageable ages, both of their backings agreed to allow the two to get married after years of striving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge came to the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty all the way from the Immortal Gu Residence without deliberately hiding his tracks, so the spies of other Forces noticed him and speculated the purpose of his visit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them inferred that the reason Gu Changge headed to the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty was to discuss the marriage date. Truly, those two were extraordinarily charming, making the perfect coupleâ€”one would even refer to them as a divine couple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of influence and position, Gu Changge basically had no rival in the Upper Realm. Even the ancestors of various Forces had to be courteous in front of him, not daring to overstep their boundaries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the younger generation, on the other hand, Gu Changge had long become a terrifying, insurmountable mountain, as his strength and that of the rest of the younger generation were separated by an unclosable gulf.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Yue Mingkong was also one of the younger generation, her power and influence had far surpassed those of her peers and might even be equal to those of countless Sect Masters and Ancestors. Thus, other than her, there was probably no other person who could make a befitting partner for Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the other Forces had much to discuss regarding the matter as they were closely observing the movements of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the next few days, even the higher ups and the female officials of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty couldn&#8217;t find Yue Mingkong anywhere. During this time, the conferences of the Celestial Dynasty were personally tended to by Emperor Yue, as though he hadn&#8217;t retired yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, numerous speculations arose. While some inferred that Yue Mingkong was now cultivating a divine Immortal Technique, and therefore having to enter retreat for sometime. Some speculated that she was now studying cultivation Techniques and debating about it with Gu Changge in order to further her knowledge of the Great Dao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, during this period, Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong didn&#8217;t really do much, not even cultivate. Instead, he accompanied Yue Mingkong and left the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty to travel across the many corners of the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two resembled a heavenly couple, leaving behind their tracks across the spectacular mountain range and the exquisite lands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In various regions, some noticed the tracks left behind by Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong, which left many young cultivators excited, after which they reserved those places as reference in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, both Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong would definitely be the protagonists of the Upper Realm in the future. They would undoubtedly achieve incredible cultivation levels. Thus, the tracks they left behind were naturally significant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Yue Mingkong was joyous, never ceasing to smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Gu Changge compensated for the many grievances she had accumulated. Be it in her previous or current life, she had never expected to live such a day, where she was able to travel through the world with her beloved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they walked across the world, they also stayed by lakesides and in rural villages, as if they were already an old couple. Getting up through days and resting through nights, the two of them contributed equally to their harmonious relationship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a lifestyle was Gu Changge&#8217;s way to make up for everything he had owed Yue Mingkong for all these years. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truthfully, he quite preferred such a lifestyle compared to always scheming against cultivators, but he understood that this lifestyle wouldn&#8217;t persist for long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the two travelled across the world, they also stopped by certain Forbidden Areas, intending to enter them, only to give up in the end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Gu Changge wanted to enjoy the serenity as he accompanied Yue Mingkong through the world, not wanting to start any trouble. Though, given his cultivation level, he could enter the numerous Forbidden Areas in the Upper Realm safely as if they were any other land unless they contained power that exceeded the Immortal Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, half a year later, Yue Mingkong and Gu Changge finally returned to the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right on the day of her return to the Capital, Emperor Yue appeared and right in front of thousands of officials and higher-ups of the Celestial Dynasty, he made an official declaration that the throne shall be passed down to his daughter, Yue Mingkong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a decision left the entire the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, as well as the surrounding Forces, that were paying close attention to the matter, shocked and dismayed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their eyes, although Yue Mingkong was Emperor Yue&#8217;s daughter, she was still too young. She was merely in her twenties. In addition, her cultivation level was not sufficient, hence they were doubtful that she could efficiently rule the entire Celestial Dynasty. After all, not everyone of the younger generation could possess the strength of old monstersities at such an age like Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, thanks to Yue Mingkong&#8217;s relentless leadership, the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty became well-managed, orderly. Though, something still seemed to be missing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the leaders of the various Immortal and Formidable Forces, she was still too young and inexperienced, and her strength was lacking as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it was on the day when Emperor Yue made the declaration to abdicate the throne that Gu Changge, who had disappeared from the Upper Realm for a while, reappeared in the palace of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty together with Yue Mingkong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After showing himself, he did nothing. Simply, he briefly spoke of certain matters before announcing the date of his marriage with Yue Mingkong to the group of higher-ups. It was decided that their wedding would be held half a year later, by which almost all Forces of the Upper Realm would be invited to the banquet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as this announcement was made, it immediately caused a huge sensation and shock among the higher-ups of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the news spread like wildfire, causing commotion everywhere as everyone from almost every ancient city were discussing this matter, eagerly anticipating the big wedding in half a year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Forces that were extremely far from the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty and the Gu Family also began to send disciples and Elders to deliver their opulent gifts right away, intending to catch up with this grand wedding in half a year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the marriage between the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty and the Gu Family was an unimaginable event, especially since Gu Changge, the undeniable leader of the Upper Realm, was the bridegroom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news, as if it was a hurricane sweeping through, swiftly reached the ears of cultivators, rendering them dumbfounded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Gu Changge appeared in the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, the higher-ups who were against Emperor Yue&#8217;s abdication grew silent. After all, with Gu Changge supporting Yue Mingkong, no one dared to express their disapproval.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Yue Mingkong would succeed the throne and become Empress Mingkong of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, making a historical record as she was one of the few who became the prominent ruler of an Immortal Celestial Dynasty in their mere twenties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, Forces offered their presents and their blessings. As Yue Mingkong would soon marry Gu Changge in half a year&#8217;s time, the power she would control by then would be fathomless. Thus, these Forces dared not to offend her and did everything to please her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right when the Upper Realm was all excited over the matter, in a palace within the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, Yue Mingkong was subtly furrowing her brows as she summoned radiant beams with her snowy hands. As the beams shot into the sky, she turned around to Gu Changge and started speaking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve only condensed four of the Seven Tools of World Domination your men sent over. The remaining three are rather tricky. Namely, the Tower of World Domination, the Sword of World Domination, and the Flask of World Domination.&#8221;</span></p>

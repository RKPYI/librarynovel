      <h4>
        Chapter 147: Waste of Time Even if You Breakthrough a Few Major Realms;
        You Got the Wrong Script!
      </h4>
      <p>
        It didn’t take long for Gu Changge to shoot down Long Teng even after he
        went all out in resisting his onslaught.
      </p>
      <p>
        In just a few moves, Gu Changge first smashed Long Teng to the ground,
        and then slapped him with a palm that shattered his arms.
      </p>
      <p>It was all simple and straightforward, without any sloppiness.</p>
      <p>
        Combined with his words from before, everything seemed natural and
        expected, and that brought extreme shock to those who were watching the
        scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It seems this guy obtained a lot of good opportunities over this period
        of time. It’s very likely that he robbed quite a few ancestral tombs…I
        knew he wouldn’t settle down and be quiet for no reason.’
      </p>
      <p>The only one who wasn’t surprised by the outcome was Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>
        She was the person who knew Gu Changge best; she understood the depths
        of his strength and the way his mind worked better than anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s Cultivation Base was stronger than Gu Changge, sure, but
        that didn’t mean he could take advantage of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of him suppressing Gu Changge, it was Gu Changge suppressing
        Long Teng without giving him any room for confrontation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was no longer a matter of talent, but a gap in their combat power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s true strength was something no one could estimate right
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >He’s indeed a Young Sovereign! Brother Gu has definitely reached that
          step, or it won’t be possible for him to suppress Long Teng like that
          when he’s only in the Initial Stage of the False God Realm…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >Long Teng can only threaten those who have a lower Cultivation Base
          than him. When facing someone in the same Realm, his combat power
          should be, at most, in the ranks of the Middle or Upper Tier Young
          Supremes…he’s still far from reaching the level of Young
          Sovereigns!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >I am afraid that no one from the younger generation will be able to
          compete with Gu Changge from now on, except for those freaks from
          ancient heritages.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Many couldn’t help but speak up with shock still lingering in their
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        They knew that Gu Changge was strong, but they never expected him to be
        so overpowered.
      </p>
      <p>
        He even suppressed Long Teng without breaking a sweat, so they reckoned
        that only those from the older generation could compete with Gu Changge
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of them felt a burst of pressure when they thought about this — an
        invisible mountain pressed down on their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >If the Successor of the Taboo Inheritance grows up and makes an
          appearance in the future, I am afraid only Young Master Changge will
          be able to compete with him.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >Speaking of which, I haven’t heard any news about the Successor of
          the Taboo Inheritance in a while. Did he not sneak in with us? It
          would be great if he didn’t.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Many Young Heavenly Geniuses discussed the matter.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, many of the beauties watched the mighty figure
        standing in the distance with strange emotions in their eyes, desiring
        to send themselves to Gu Changge’s bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent, on the other hand, were
        filled with fear and no longer held the arrogance they showed before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before, they looked down on the geniuses from the outside world due to
        their superior Cultivation Bases, but now, the scene in front of them
        proved to them that the strength of the outsiders was better than them
        even if their conditions weren’t comparable to their’s.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge…he was mighty enough to make them tremble!</p>
      <p>“<b>Do you have any last words to say?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stepped down from the air with his robes fluttering and inky
        hair flowing with the wind, and resembled an immortal taking a stroll in
        his backyard.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a chuck, he stared at Long Teng, whose arms were destroyed by him.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >How is this possible? How could I lose to you?! I still haven’t used
          my mighty Innate Ability that no one can match!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Long Teng spoke with a pale face.</p>
      <p>
        By now, he had lost the arrogant and confident demeanor he possessed
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        His confidence was obliterated as soon as he went against Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, he could crush his peers from the younger generation
        without breaking a sweat due to his tyrannical Cultivation Base, but
        when facing Gu Changge, all that failed to work.
      </p>
      <p>On the contrary, he was suppressed and forced into a tragic shape.</p>
      <p>“<b>Are those your last words?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge sneered and looked down at Long Teng like he was looking down
        on an ant.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had never seen someone as brain dead as Long Teng, who courted death
        on every turn. Did he fail to comprehend the difference between the two
        of them?
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge shot again!</p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        The palm fell again and covered everything, making it seem as if the sky
        was shaking and going to explode. The Universe fell in its wake, and
        large tracts of mountain peaks crumbled under the tyrannical aura of the
        oncoming attack!
      </p>
      <p>“<b>Gu Changge, you…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng wanted to recover his broken arms as soon as possible, but his
        complexion showed a drastic change, and he tried to avoid the falling
        palm with his True Dragon Steps.[1]
      </p>
      <p>[1: a movement technique that lets him move at high speeds.]</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, a layer of golden light covered his body and made his
        fine dragon scales glitter.
      </p>
      <p>He reacted at breakneck speed, but…</p>
      <p>
        Alas! He was hit by the edge of the palm and coughed up blood and shards
        of broken internal organs with a groan.
      </p>
      <p>His mind went blank.</p>
      <p>
        After all, this was the result just from getting touched by the
        aftermath!
      </p>
      <p>
        The golden light covering his body crumbled as soon as it came into
        contact with the palm, and failed to provide him with any protection!
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge’s palm had directly hit him, then he might have been
        flattened into a cloud of blood mist.
      </p>
      <p>Long Teng felt chills go down his back as he thought of this.</p>
      <p>“<b>How can you be so strong?! This is impossible!”</b></p>
      <p>
        He couldn’t help but roar in disbelief, after all, his Cultivation Base
        was far higher than Gu Changge’s!
      </p>
      <p>“<b>How would I slaughter you if I wasn’t strong?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge put his hands behind his back and stared at his prey with a
        playful expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could tell that Long Teng was still hiding a final trump card up his
        sleeve, and that’s why he didn’t directly obliterate him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he had to let Long Teng experience true despair, or he
        wouldn't feel good if he just let him die an easy death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then, the Void in front of Gu Changge blurred and he disappeared
        from his spot after taking a step forward.
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>In the next moment, he appeared right in front of Long Teng.</p>
      <p>“<b>You…”</b></p>
      <p>Long Teng was shocked and opened his eyes wide.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s speed chilled his soul, since he appeared and disappeared
        out of thin air as if he was teleporting.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wondered if Gu Changge was using a lost, ancient art? After all, how
        could he scale such distances so fast?
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas! Before he could react, a slender, fair-skinned, jade-like hand
        reached towards him — the hand moved at a slow speed, and Long Teng
        could see its trajectory, even, but he still found it hard to resist it
        as there seemed to be some mysterious force holding him down.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Hum!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Endless brilliance burst out from the hand, as if the power of Immortals
        covered it, and in the next moment, Long Teng roared out.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ancient aura filled his blood, and the figure of a terrifying True
        Dragon appeared behind him.
      </p>
      <p>“<b>That’s useless! Don’t you understand the gap between us?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked at him with pity, as if he was looking at an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of a sudden, the Void stagnated, and time and space seemed to
        freeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how extraordinary the True Dragon phantom might have been, it
        was destroyed by Gu Changge in a blink.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, Gu Changge’s physical strength far exceeded those in the
        same realm as his visible Cultivation Base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if others beside him could perceive the strangeness of his
        overpowered physical strength, they wouldn’t think too much into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all…he was a Young Sovereign with a tyrannical Cultivation Art and
        Training Regime, so was it wrong for him to be that strong?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, Gu Changge grabbed Long Teng’s neck while breaking
        through all of his defensive Mystical Arts, and lifted him straight up.
      </p>
      <p>“<b>Argh…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s arms were already destroyed, so he couldn’t even flail them
        to resist, and his face turned red with extreme feelings of grievance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene in front of everyone…it made them feel as if Gu Changge was
        carrying a dead dog that had drowned.
      </p>
      <p>From the beginning to the end, Long Teng had no ability to resist.</p>
      <p>“<b>Lord Long Teng…”</b></p>
      <p>
        All the creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent appeared as if the
        sky had collapsed over their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        The invincible Lord Long Teng, the one they worshiped, was now held by
        their foe like a drowned, dead dog.
      </p>
      <p>They couldn’t bear to see him like that.</p>
      <p>“<b>How is this possible?! This can’t be true!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Some of the female creatures were so shocked by the reality that they
        screamed out and then fainted with their eyes rolled back.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene they witnessed today would haunt their nightmares forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their spiritual symbol of power, the one they worshiped for almost all
        their eyes, ended up in such a messed up situation — the reality in
        front of them made their eyes darken and their legs go weak.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >Long Aotian’s template isn’t popular these days; Long Teng, you were
          born in the wrong era.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said with a casual smile.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Long Teng couldn’t comprehend his words.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Gu Changge strengthened his grip around Long Teng’s
        neck, making the bones in his neck crack with audible sounds. Long Teng,
        on the other hand, couldn’t help but let out a muffled, miserable cry.
      </p>
      <p>“<b>Ah! It’s unbearable!”</b></p>
      <p>“<b>Gu Changge, I will fight you to death!”</b></p>
      <p>Long Teng roared with reddened eyes.</p>
      <p>
        If he couldn’t slaughter Gu Changge today, then he would definitely live
        a life of humiliation, and it wouldn’t be possible for him to wash away
        this stain of disgrace.
      </p>
      <p>“<b>It’s a little late for you to say that.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s eyes gradually darkened as he stared at the pair of dragon
        horns above Long Teng’s head.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to deal with the Favored Son of Heaven crafted after the
        Long Aotian template was to crush him with absolute might.
      </p>
      <p>That was because Long Aotians were mindless and fearless fools.</p>
      <p>
        It would be a waste of time to devise devious plans and plots to deal
        with them slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, Gu Changge felt that he had almost achieved his goal since
        the success of the [Fortune Plundering Card] depending on the opponent's
        state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then, a colorful light burst from Long Teng’s body and released a
        powerful aura filled with unparalleled vitality that kept surging.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        A terrifying whirlpool of Qi appeared between Heaven and Earth, and Long
        Teng started to undergo a transformation out of nowhere. At the same
        time, he broke free from Gu Changge’s hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        His ruined body started to heal at speed visible to the eyes, and his
        amazing vitality recovered, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the Void in their surroundings started to shake as if
        it couldn’t bear the pressure!
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s Cultivation Base suddenly broke past the Pinnacle of the
        False God Realm and he stepped into the True God Realm, raising his
        strength to another level.
      </p>
      <p>The sudden change caused a sensation in the surroundings.</p>
      <p>
        Many people widened their eyes, while Long Teng’s admirer’s cheered in
        excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some were so excited, they started to shed tears while mumbling with
        quivering voices,
        <b
          >“Lord Long Teng was born invincible, so how could he be defeated?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >He merely suffered a minor setback today! As for this wicked man with
          the Gu surname? He will pay his dues now…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>They said in excitement.</p>
      <p>
        By now, they had long forgotten that they were the ones who provoked the
        trouble and brought it to their doors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now, Long Teng was reduced to a miserable state by Gu Changge. His
        condition was so messed up that they thought Long Teng had no hope for a
        comeback, but at a critical moment, he achieved a breakthrough and
        survived a certain-death situation!
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, almost all of the creatures believed that Long Teng would be
        able to reverse the situation and wash away all the shame he suffered.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >Is this the trump card you were hiding? Achieving a breakthrough in
          your Cultivation Base at a critical moment, eh? Tsk…tsk…tsk…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was momentarily surprised by the sudden change, but after
        thinking about it for a moment, he realized that it wasn’t all that
        unexpected.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, achieving a breakthrough at a critical moment was the special
        ability of these Favored Runts!
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever they encountered a great enemy or a dangerous situation, they
        would achieve a breakthrough in their Cultivation Base and turn the
        tides with absolute might.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a trope…he was more than familiar with those due to his previous
        life!
      </p>
      <p>
        Back then, he hated to see the use of that damned trope, and even wanted
        to dig out the brains of the critics who acclaimed it to see what crap
        was filled inside their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge never imagined that he would come across an enemy who would
        achieve a breakthrough in the midst of their bout.
      </p>
      <p>
        The timing of his breakthrough was too much to be a coincidence, and he
        estimated that it was all due to Long Teng’s explosive potential, the
        opportunities he obtained in life, and other factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, even if Long Teng broke through another few major realms, he
        still wouldn’t be able to make any waves in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        A playful smile appeared on Gu Changge’s face as he thought about that.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >Gu Changge, you never expected this, right? I am destined for
          greatness, while you are destined to become a corpse beneath my feet
          today!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng let out a roar and stood on the horizon with divine fire
        burning around his body. Dazzling runes moved around his body, and his
        aura kept surging. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
      </p>
      <p>
        His head was clearer than ever before, and the divine fire burned from
        his head to toe as his Cultivation Base improved and made him far
        stronger than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        It helped him regain his lost confidence, indifference, and contempt for
        everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >I am afraid you got the wrong script! Aren’t you the one with a
          higher Cultivation Base here?”[2]</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        [2: in the normal setting, the protagonist has a weaker Cultivation Base
        than their enemy — around two major realms of difference — so when they
        are at their lowest, they achieve a breakthrough and close the gap
        between the cultivation base of their foe and them and then slaughter
        the foe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng, on the other hand, has a Cultivation Base higher than Gu
        Changge, which isn’t how the script is supposed to go because the roles
        are reversed.]
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge still spoke with indifference and a faint smile.</p>
      <p>
        Long Teng could see mockery and playfulness from his expression, and
        that enraged him further.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, he believed that he would now be able to slaughter Gu
        Changge since he had broken through to the True God Realm, and his
        strength was far stronger than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, Gu Changge was the strongest enemy he faced to date, but Gu
        Changge was only in the Initial Stage of the False God Realm!
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >I won’t play with you anymore. After all, the best time to plunder
          your Fortune would be when you are in absolute despair.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled and then pointed his finger forward.</p>
      <p><b>[BANG!]</b></p>
      <p>
        A Heaven-shattering Sword Qi appeared in the Void, with the desire to
        annihilate everything, and brought along a sea of blood that rose and
        fell in the Void with corpses of Immortals piled up!
      </p>
      <p>‘Slaughter the Immortal Kings and Annihilate the Immortal Gods.’</p>
      <p>‘Let there be none who live forever.’</p>
      <p>
        Right then, everyone felt as if a peerless bronze sword materialized in
        Gu Changge’s hands.
      </p>
      <p>“<b>That is…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Many Young Supremes felt their eyes shrink and showed great changes in
        their expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        The complexion of the creatures from the Ancient Immortal Continent also
        changed, and they felt their very souls shiver.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<b
          >That’s the terrifying Sword Art that slaughtered the Seventh Princess
          of the Sea King Palace!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A Young Supreme with a face full of fear said after feeling the
        terrifying aura from a long distance away.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a trance, they all saw a bronze immortal sword slash down with the
        might to destroy the Universe!
      </p>
      <p><b>[Shua!]</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge walked through the Void like a peerless Sword Immortal.</p>
      <p>
        He resembled a peerless figure about to bring about the end of the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the attacking power of the Sword Qi? Whatever stepped in its path
        had to bleed.
      </p>
      <p>‘Why does this guy have so many Arts…’</p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s indifferent and confident complexion showed a drastic change
        as he couldn’t believe what he witnessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sword light descended from the sky was still far away, but it had
        already made several cuts on the surface of his body, and was about to
        slash him into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>He was about to die!</p>
      <p>
        Before, he believed that Gu Changge already went all out when attacking
        him, or he wouldn’t have lost, but not, he realized that Gu Changge’s
        means were even more tyrannical than before, and that made him feel
        regret and feelings of hopelessness.
      </p>
      <p>“<b>I don’t believe I will fall here!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng roared and resisted the terrifying murderous intent in
        desperation.
      </p>
      <p>He was likely to fall here today.</p>
      <p>
        Even if the Elders of his Family broke the rules to save him, it was
        likely that they wouldn’t make it in time!
      </p>
      <p>
        He regretted the fact that he didn’t allow his Family’s Elders to break
        the rules and follow him from the shadows when he left the Family.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>The Void trembled!</p>
      <p>
        A pure killing intent assaulted Long Teng, and an icy aura lingered
        around his neck and made him feel as if his head would separate at any
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the critical moment, his eyes turned red and he burned his blood
        essence as a last resort to break away from the shackles of the Natural
        Laws holding him down!
      </p>
      <p><b>[Crack!]</b></p>
      <p>
        However, the hardest dragon-horn on his head was cut off and fell to the
        ground with a thud and released five colored blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge kept pointing his finger forward and slashed at will while
        striding forward at breakneck speed.
      </p>
      <p>“<b>You…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s face was covered in horror and desperation as he bled from
        the corners of his mouth and moved back with unsteady steps.
      </p>
      <p>“<b>Don’t kill me…”</b></p>
      <p>“<b>Plunder!”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge ignored his words and only said one word.</p>
      <p>Immediately, the [Fortune Plundering Card] took action.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, a wisp of sword energy that could slash through the
        world easily penetrated in the middle of Long Teng’s eyebrows and went
        through his head!

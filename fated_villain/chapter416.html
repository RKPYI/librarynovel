          too.&#8221; Gu Changge looked towards the Blood Demon Overlord and the
          other Demon Overlord. With a mere shift in thought, the void around
          them suddenly froze and a strong vibration moved towards them. Chaos
          Qi swirled violently while images of grand holy structures such as
          heavenly palaces, celestial palaces, and divine buildings surrounded
          them. Blinding light exploded from within which blocked out the world
          and reduced everything to chaos.</span

          >&#8220;The Great World-Sealing Array.&#8221; The Blood Demon Overlord
          recognised the array at once and turned pale. He was already badly
          injured; he would have easily broken the array if he had been at his
          prime, yet he couldn&#8217;t do that now. Even if he could, it would
          take some time. Gu Changge would have gotten rid of the Solar Demon
          Overlord and shifted his focus to him.</span

          Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord die. The Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord
          wouldn&#8217;t be so easily dealt with even when he was on the verge
          of death from his grievous injuries, as he could draw power from the
          World Principles and easily regain his health. However, he had been
          killed by Gu Changge&#8217;s terrifying weapon.</span

          >[We must fight him the best we can or we will have no chance at
          survival.] The Demon Overlord decisively activated his most powerful
          ability. Blood-coloured light surged up from behind him as if able to
          penetrate the universe, while blood rained down from above and bloomed
          into a frightening yet alluring blood flower within the void. Ancient
          worlds containing enormous power seemed to evolve within the flower.
          He wielded that energy and ground forward.</span

          point?&#8221; Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t concerned and looked cold as
          ever. The Eight Barren Demon Halberd sliced across the air, emitting
          waves of dark light which made the world shake and different worlds
          crumble to ashes. The attack ended up being futile as the halberd
          immediately sliced the Blood Demon Overlord into two.</span

          this. Even though they were already grievously wounded, killing
          someone in the Sacred King Realm should be child&#8217;s play.
          However, they couldn&#8217;t fight against Gu Changge. The weapon the
          man held was terrifying but also proved he had formidable
          strength.</span

          now?&#8221; The Solar Demon Overlord&#8217;s expression darkened,
          knowing he could no longer escape his fate but still wondering how Gu
          Changge had acquired the Solar Heavenly Blade or entered the place
          successfully.</span

          >&#8220;You…you killed my son?&#8221; The Solar Demon Overlord was
          overcome by hatred. This was the first time he hated someone more than
          those Demon Overlords. Even his hatred for his old rival, the Crimson
          Cloud Demon Overlord, wasn&#8217;t this intense.</span

          >*Slicc!* Gu Changge didn&#8217;t let him finish, his arm moving once.
          The EIght Barren Demon Halberd sliced downwards and split him in half.
          Any thought the Solar Demon Overlord might have had of defending
          himself was useless. The halberd then shot from his hand with a flash
          of dark light towards the shaken Demon Overlord watching from a
          distance. Blood rained down and World Principles broke apart before
          the place became quiet once more.</span

          smiled, lightly mocking, as he floated down from the sky. With a flash
          of golden light, the Primeval True Feather landed in his palm,
          glimmering sharply. It contained a lot of ancient Dao energy and array
          patterns.</span

          >A terrifying dark fog soon emerged, blocking out the sky. An
          all-encompassing dark hole seemed to appear between the sky and the
          earth, consuming everything. Gu Changge sat on the ground, all the
          cells in his body had awakened. His bones, organs, and flesh expelled
          waves of Qi and vitality, while pieces of the River of Time appeared
          behind him. An indistinct figure which could crush ancient worlds
          could be faintly seen within, melding into one with him.

          Flask.Sources combined as they surged towards him, the ones belonging
          to the Nirvana Realm Demon Overlords were especially brilliant and

          >Gu Changge&#8217;s cold expression didn&#8217;t change whatsoever as
          his aura transformed. His gains were plentiful as the understanding he
          had of the Source of World Principles had broken through the limits of
          his current Realm and reached another. His cultivation level was the
          only thing weak about him now.</span

          middle stage of the Sacred Emperor Realm. No matter how unusual the
          Forbidden Demon Arts were, it couldn&#8217;t create a Nirvana Realm
          being from a Nirvana Realm Source. Besides, the number of Sources he
          needed to consume was astronomical, though the understanding of
          cultivation as well as the techniques and abilities acquired were
          pretty valuable.</span

          became peaceful once more, with nothing much changed except for the
          signs of fighting. Four Demon Overlords had died here, two in the
          Nirvana Realm, and all their bodies had been reduced to ashes. This
          would have been breaking news to everyone had this happened in the
          outside world, yet no one knew except for him. As far as the outside
          world was concerned, the Six Demon Overlords had already died six
          thousand years before and so no one would notice this event.</span

          advantage of their inner turmoil.] Gu Changge transformed into a beam
          of divine light and went after the Lunar Demon Overlord. The World
          Source wasn&#8217;t an urgent issue since there was only him inside

          this state after being attacked by two people if she had used all her
          abilities, yet she had to make the others lower their guard.

          within. A robe dropped from it, glimmering with myriad Principles and

          indestructibility. This was the Indestructible Robe, which was said to
          be made by a Primal Godly Spirit in ancient times that could shield

          Demon Overlord used his son as a backup so Jun Bufan would bring the
          Solar Heavenly Blade to him. She had her own plan too, but she

          Changge wielded, yet she didn&#8217;t feel comforted by it at all. Her

          coughing up blood.</span

          feather was the Primeval True Feather which the Crimson Cloud Demon
          Overlord had used in the fight with the Solar Demon Overlord. This was
          the toughest feather on his body, which he had cultivated for many
          years, so its power wouldn&#8217;t be inferior to that of a Nirvana
          Grade Artifact.</span

          fear. This was far too unbelievable to her. [How? How did he do it?
          But, if he did not kill them, how is it possible for him to get that
          feather!?]</span

          only in the Third Minor Quasi-Nirvana Realm. But, your Indestructible
          Robe is unique though. So, that might be why it did not immediately
          kill you.&#8221; Gu Changge did not answer her question, his eyes on
          the shimmering Indestructible Robe. She felt a chill run up her spine
          and shivered, feeling fear towards a youth for the first time.</span

          hungry.</span

          hand.&#8221; The Lunar Demon Overlord&#8217;s voice shook
          uncontrollably as she couldn&#8217;t fathom how that had happened.
          Even if Gu Changge possessed a mysterious ability, he couldn&#8217;t
          have killed two beings in the Nirvana Realm. This was like a
          nightmare. But, it was a fact that the Primeval True Feather belonging
          to the Crimson Cloud Emperor was now in his hand.</span

          Heavenly Blade appeared in Gu Changge&#8217;s hand with a clang. The

          She felt cold with fear and moved different Dao runes, wondering if
          the Indestructible Robe could block the attack from the blade.</span

          >&#8220;Do I need a reason?&#8221; He sliced the blade downwards,
          making her cough blood once again. The light coming from the
          Indestructible Robe dimmed as the runes on it were erased. All her
          abilities were useless in the face of such power and she felt
          desperate. Even though she had healed from most of her injuries, she
          didn&#8217;t have a chance against this young man. He was just too
          powerful.</span

          Indestructible Robe to you, but please agree to my request or I will
          blowup and destroy the Indestructible Robe without letting you possess
          it.&#8221; The Lunar Demon Overlord gritted her teeth as she had
          finally thought of this idea. She trusted that he wouldn&#8217;t so
          stupid and realise which option was more advantageous for him.</span

          >&#8220;What request?&#8221; Gu Changge asked quietly. He was actually
          interested in the Robe since it was a precious treasure which could
          counter a Nirvana Grade Artifact. It was considered rare even among
          the Immortal Forces. While he wouldn&#8217;t need it, Yue Mingkong
          might like it.</span

          daughter Yao Xi. All these years, I&#8217;ve-&#8221; She smiled
          bitterly, having accepted her fate and no longer struggling uselessly.
          What she wanted most was to leave this place so she could tell her
          daughter, Yao Xi, everything that had happened in these six thousand
          years and ask for her forgiveness.</span

          her. &#8220;Save that for when you go see her.&#8221;</span

          >He didn&#8217;t like leaving any open ends. The secret of the Six
          Demon Overlords should remain buried here; the Lunar Demon Overlord
          was merely a nobody even though she was Yao Xi&#8217;s mother. Empress
          Yao Xi was just a tool for him to use and he wouldn&#8217;t spare too
          much of his emotions on her. Still, he still cared for her feelings
          occasionally.

          intention to mend her relationship with her daughter, he didn&#8217;t
          want to concern himself with having the Lunar Demon Overlord’s blood
          on his hand &#8211; for Yao Xi&#8217;s sake. If the Lunar Demon
          Overlord felt nothing for Yao Xi, he would have gladly helped Yao Xi
          kill her mother.</span

          kill her before this, yet now, he wasn&#8217;t going to do it. She
          wasn&#8217;t going to ask too much about it though, assuming it was

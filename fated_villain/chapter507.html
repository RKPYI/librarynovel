          to escort a young man was truly unexpected. That could only indicate
          that the identity of the young man must be boundlessly terrifying and
          would haunt anyone that dared imagine it. As such, those of the
          Swallow Clan were feeling goosebumps all over.</span

          and composure. After taking a deep look at Gu Changge, she figured out
          his identity. Essentially, there was only one person who could draw
          such respect and awe from the Bone Ancestor.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You may drop the courtesy. I saw you were looking for the
          escaped survivors. How is it going?&#8221; Gu Changge casually
          asked.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although there was quite a distance between Great Bone Domain and
          Westwin Domain as many territories were in between them, given the
          strengths of Gu Changge and the Bone Ancestor, it wouldn&#8217;t take
          a long time for them to travel between the two Domains.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          way to Crimson South City.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ni Shang was a cultivator with the greatest of Talents. In fact, the
          Bone Ancestor had not encountered someone so blessed for countless
          years. It would be only a matter of time until she eventually
          surpassed him. Therefore, he had entrusted certain parts of the Bone
          Clan&#8217;s history to Ni Shang before sharing to the rest.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Earlier, Gu Changge was fascinated when he saw Ni Shang investigating
          the Family of Protectors.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;We have gotten some leads, Young Master Gu. I made deductions
          based on the bloodline I collected from the family in the past and
          ultimately arrived at Crimson South City. I am certain that the
          remnants are now in Crimson South City. Though, the area remains too
          wide to determine in which corner they are currently hiding in,&#8221;
          Ni Shang answered honestly, and her speech was professional and
          clean.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge then slightly nodded. With a casual look, he replied,
          &#8220;Is that so? Since they are in Crimson South City, that makes
          things easier. If you are still unable to find them, you may try
          annihilating the city.&#8221;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Ni Shang and the Bone Ancestor didn&#8217;t have any
          noticeable reaction. After all, to them, massacring an entire city was
          nothing major as they could finish it in a second given their
          strength.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, seeing how Gu Changge effortlessly decided Crimson South
          City&#8217;s fate, as if he was mindlessly stepping on a bug, the
          people of the Swallow Clan were absolutely terrified. Their
          dread-filled faces blanched as their bodies uncontrollably
          shook.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;But of course, only do that when push comes to shove. Surely I
          don&#8217;t strike anyone as a killer of innocents, do I?&#8221; Gu
          Changge scanned across the fearful faces of the people of the Swallow
          Clan and smilingly stated.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite his words, the people of the Swallow Clan couldn&#8217;t help
          but remain shivering, and their souls were basically frozen. They
          wouldn&#8217;t even dare to guess Gu Changge&#8217;s identity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Rest assured, Young Master Gu. This old one is the Ancestor of
          Crimson South City, and my words carry remarkable weight in this city.
          Should you intend to look for a person, all you need to do is ask for
          it and this old one will have men scouring for them no matter how deep
          they hide.&#8221; The Ancestor of the Swallow Clan vigorously
          suppressed his fear and spoke with a shaking voice.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The rest of the Swallow Clan hastily nodded in response, signalling
          their agreement as they were worried that they would be dragged into
          the disaster. Otherwise, they would be devastated by remorse when
          Crimson South City was destroyed by Gu Changge before the Upper Realm
          Army&#8217;s attack could even reach here.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;With your assurance, I am assured.&#8221; Gu Changge breezily
          chuckled. [Well, under such circumstances, I doubt that the Family of
          Protectors would be able to hide for long.]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Followingly, Ni Shang reported every single detail she had found
          during her days of investigations to Gu Changge.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Splendid work. Were you responsible for the annihilation of
          the family at that time as well?&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After listening to the report, Gu Changge shot Ni Shang a gaze of
          appreciation. Be it strength or capabilities, she easily disgraced the
          many prodigal damsels that walked the streets.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes, though unfortunately, some managed to escape.&#8221;
          Seemingly humble, Ni Shang nodded, though she wasn&#8217;t as reverent
          as the Bone Ancestor towards Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It is no big deal. Since they managed to escape, they will
          eventually expose their own tracks.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled,
          unbothered by her minor mistake. [If the annihilation back then
          wasn&#8217;t flawed, how could my dear leek, Xiao Yang have been
          born?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon the sight, the Bone Ancestor&#8217;s smile grew even wider. If
          Ni Shang managed to gain Gu Changge&#8217;s respect and liking, it
          would naturally be advantageous to him as well.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[It seems this old one&#8217;s years of cultivating Ni Shang has not
          gone in vain…] He pondered in his mind.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Given Gu Changge&#8217;s identity, he must have seen every prodigal
          damsel the world had to offer, so it would be impossible to impress
          him merely by one&#8217;s appearance. Therefore, only one&#8217;s
          capabilities could do the trick. [Judging by the situation, Ni
          Shang&#8217;s accomplishment seemed to satisfy him.]</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ni Shang noticed her Ancestor&#8217;s gaze that was signalling her to
          perform impeccably in front of Gu Changge. Thus, after wondering for a
          while, she proposed her idea, intending to take the opportunity to
          find the remnants of the Family of Protectors.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Apparently, he had another plan. Judging by Ni Shang&#8217;s current
          result, it was safe to assume that she was now in possession of not
          just bloodline but Blood Essence from someone in the Family of
          Protectors, which allowed her to make such a precise deduction of
          their whereabouts.</span

          Essence, as I intended to look into the secrets of their bloodline.
          However, all these years, my effort has been to no avail. Hence I took
          the opportunity to burn a few drops of it, and I eventually ended up
          in Crimson South City.&#8221; Ni Shang was dazed for a moment before
          answering the question.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In his hands, he was holding the Chaos Purple Scripture, which worked
          as an inexplicable wonder in making deductions and predictions. With
          the Blood Essence of the Family of Protectors, he could use the Chaos
          Purple Scripture to deduce their fates and traces.</span

          protagonist, Luo Feng, laughingly spoke as he made a thankful hand
          gesture towards his guests. He seemed especially respectful towards
          the silver-haired old woman on the other side.</span

          old woman was a Sacred Emperor Realm expert of Thousand Dao Academy,
          so he felt obliged to pay respect to her.</span

          leader of the Luo Clan couldn&#8217;t help but feel remorseful for Luo
          Ying. If she didn&#8217;t marry Luo Feng, she might be a limitlessly
          influential woman in the future. She might even break through to the
          Sacred Realm and reach the Sacred Emperor Realm.</span

          twenty years. I have watched Luo Feng grow up since he was only a boy,
          so how could I bear seeing him suffer?&#8221; Luo Ying gently spoke in
          a tender tone, as though she wasn&#8217;t affected by the
          marriage.</span

          hired, no one could ever discover the root of such a sickness. As time
          went by, all he could do was to leave it as it was.</span

          careful look at Luo Feng. For a moment there, it was as though he
          noticed a twitch in Luo Feng&#8217;s eyes, as though Luo Feng
          wasn&#8217;t dozing off like he always had.</span

          from getting up and welcoming the unexpected, important guess. After
          all, he was the Young Master of Crimson South City. Given his
          identity, no one could ever come in contact with him during usual
          times.</span

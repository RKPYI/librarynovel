          into the cluster of stars below like a torrent. The Lin Clan members,
          who had risen from the ground, fell apart at once and disappeared
          under the onslaught. The thick smell of blood spread in the air as
          bright balls of light exploded, while bones dropped from the sky. It
          was a chilling sight to behold.</span

          shouted battle cries despite their desperation. Their bodies glowed as
          they rushed towards their enemy. It was a terrible fight which many
          had thought they could avoid after their clan migrated here. Who would
          have thought Gu Changge would lead his army to attack them without
          leaving any chance for them to survive?</span

          the universe. The arrays surrounding the place hadn&#8217;t been
          inscribed for a long time and were unstable in several places, yet

          Bone Ancestor and the others standing behind Gu Changge enquired
          respectfully despite the man remaining unruffled. Many Bone Clan
          experts had come including several True Daoists, which could be an
          unstoppable force in itself.</span

          is hiding from us. Wait for them to show before acting.&#8221; Gu
          Changge shook his head. He could see that the World Principles at the
          depths of this place was changing slightly, and was now emitting a
          strange new fluctuation. There were only two possibilities: either
          someone was manipulating it, or it had been suppressed. Both these
          possibilities did not alter the fact that a stronger expert was
          hiding.</span

          not passed so I wonder if it&#8217;s him.&#8221; The Bone Ancestor

          a cold snort. He didn&#8217;t look that mighty and imposing. However,
          those were just his physical attributes, the aura he exudes was
          alarming.

          enquired the instant he appeared, looking straight at Gu Changge with
          a cold gaze. He knew that this man was the mastermind. The one who had
          planned everything. Many cultivators of the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains hated this man more than they did anyone who belonged to the
          Upper Realm!</span

          Gu Changge smiled, standing proudly on the ancient battleship while
          sleeves moving with the breeze. His gaze landed on the star behind Lin
          Qinglong.

          rid of him. This so-called Fortuitous One should experience the
          feeling of betrayal. Of course, this catastrophe befalling the Lin
          Clan had been brought upon them by Lin Wu.

          aback by this, especially the younger ones whose eyes were wide with

          >&#8220;Gu Changge…you shameless and lying bastard!&#8221; Lin Wu
          roared, now understanding Gu Changge&#8217;s malicious intentions. His
          expression darkened, eyes filled with hatred. He knew that there was
          no longer a place for him in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains;
          even if the Lin Clan wasn&#8217;t exterminated, they would never
          accept him ever again.</span

          >&#8220;How despicable!&#8221; Lin Qinglong knew what Gu Changge was
          implying. They really did have a traitor in their midst, who was also
          the most brilliant genius of his generation. It was just as the clan
          had guessed. Nothing else could explain how Gu Changge had found the
          clan so quickly and led an army to their new place.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Lin Qinglong&#8217;s expression suddenly shifted as he sensed a beam
          of Sword Qi, containing as much power as a falling mountain, heading
          towards him. It was powerful enough to cut down the stars in its path.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, a gorgeous yet cold and imposing figure, clad in a black dress,
          emerged from behind Gu Changge. A pearly white sword seemingly made
          from bone appeared in her hand, shimmering with celestial energy. She
          looked much weaker than him, but her aura was still
          intimidating.</span

          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains as well!&#8221; Lin Qinglong
          immediately recognised her after blocking the attack and his
          expression turned ugly. He did not expect that even the Bone Clan had
          taken part in this war and secretly become loyal to Gu Changge. [No,
          maybe, they have been secret chess pieces that the Immortal Gu Family
          had placed in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains from the very
          beginning?]</span

          >&#8220;We were originally from the Upper Realm, so how could we have
          betrayed you?&#8221; Ni Shang glanced at him, wielding her sword once
          again. Its aura was like a stormy sea which threatened to drown Lin
          Qinglong. She was extremely decisive and decided to attack instead of
          saying anything meaningless.</span

          Realm…&#8221; Lin Qinglong was shocked and angry. He might be a
          descendant of the Lin Clan’s Prime Ancestor and possessed unrivalled
          abilities, but it was still difficult for him to take her down
          quickly. She was inferior to him in terms of cultivation but her
          powers were nevertheless formidable.</span

          atmosphere. Sword Qi sliced through the air as if about to split the

          strength was frightening, his eyes glowing as he raised his hand
          threateningly while still fighting Ni Shang. Smoke filled the air, yet

          They could no longer withstand the power of their enemy and had

          had chosen to surrender with clenched fists. He was not regretting the
          disaster he had brought upon his clan in the slightest. His only aim
          now was to survive this and become stronger in order to seek revenge
          upon Gu Changge.</span

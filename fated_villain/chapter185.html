        Chapter 185: Shocking the World by Returning the Stolen Dao Bone; Is
        this Justice of Mine Enough for You?
      </h4>
      <p><b>Puff!</b></p>
      <p>
        The Sword Intent pierced through the front and back bones, accompanied
        by a dazzling blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strange sounds suddenly resounded across heaven and earth, reverberating
        and chanting the Truth of Dao. All the while a golden lotus soon bloomed
        in the void, filled with Dao Intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its Divine Power began to surge, and a faint fragrance started
        permeating the land and sky!
      </p>
      <p>
        Each drop of blood was like crystal, as if an Ancient God was bleeding
        out. It appeared radiant and mysterious, like a small universe was
        contained within. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading

      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone was shocked by this scene. They’d never expected Gu Changge to
        do such a thing so suddenly.
      </p>
      <p>‘Self-harm? He actually tore open his own body?’</p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators were even more confused about what Gu Changge said just
        now.
      </p>
      <p>Returning the bone?</p>
      <p>Returning what bone?</p>
      <p>Was Gu Changge going to dig out his own bones?</p>
      <p>A great number of people were stunned by this.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“You….”</b> Even General[1] Haomiao, who had previously mocked him,
        was frozen. He was in a state of utter shock and disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        [1: He was previously stated to be a commander, but general is his
        official rank.]
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge….”</b></p>
      <p>The beautiful eyes of Gu Xian'er became wider as she trembled.</p>
      <p>
        Her jade hands pinched the corners of the skirt tightly, with a light
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        She thought that Gu Changge would just tell her the truth in person
        later. She’d never expected this vicious method of his, to dig out the
        bones himself and return them to her.
      </p>
      <p>Her head began to buzz!</p>
      <p>
        Her head was completely empty, as she watched all this with her mouth
        open. She didn’t even know what to say, frozen in midair.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“What a surprise! I can't believe he’s digging out his bones to
          return it to his sister.”</b

      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This guy is so ruthless! He didn’t even hesitate. It seems he’s
          anticipated this for quite some time….”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >For those who’d known the secrets of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family
          from that year, their hearts leapt. They’d never expected to feel such
          a strong sense of danger from a junior like Gu Changge.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>They felt fear and apprehension.</p>
      <p>
        ‘I didn’t expect Gu Changge to really do it. If I’d known he was about
        to do this, then I wouldn’t have bothered.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘However, it’s good that this matter has finally been made public. The
        family will indeed lose face because of what happened to Xian’er, but a
        bit of gossip doesn’t matter. In the whole of the Upper Realm, is there
        truly anyone who dares speak against my Gu Family?!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Nanshan sighed, but his eyes had considerably softened when he looked
        at Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was now on the same boat as Gu Xian’er. ‘Perhaps she was right, Gu
        Changge might be hiding some unspeakable secrets…’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s words continued to echo through heaven and earth.</p>
      <p>
        He confessed the incident without adding any oil and vinegar, it was a
        simple and straightforward confession.
      </p>
      <p>After all, paper can’t hold the fire forever.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Sooner or later, this matter was bound to become public. If you’re
        going to be forced to say it anyway, it’s better to take the initiative
        to confess on your own.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘So long as one controls the initiative, things will never spiral out of
        control.’
      </p>
      <p>‘Besides, who said this was a bad thing?’</p>
      <p>Gu Changge continued to speak.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This Dao Bone originally belonged to Xian'er. Back then, when her
          parents were away at a young age, I took the opportunity to dig it up,
          causing Xian'er to be stranded and drift away for over ten years
          …..”</b

      </p>
      <p>
        <b

          justice in front of the whole world.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>His expression was calm, but there was a strange look in his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        This Sword Intent that pierced through everything continued to rattle.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the area of ??the wound, glorious and dazzling lights intertwined, as
        bright runes appeared one by one, floating and pulsating.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were crystal clear and subtle, yet vast and mysterious. They were
        divine and otherworldly.
      </p>
      <p>With Gu Changge’s words, this past secret was now made public..</p>
      <p><b>“There was such a secret between the two?”</b></p>
      <p><b>“This is incredible; it’s unbelievable!”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If Gu Changge hadn't said so, then we would’ve never known! So
          that’s what the rumours meant when they say that Gu Xian’er was a
          young supreme in her childhood! Speaking of which, it’s pitiful that
          Gu Xian’er had her Dao Bones dug out by her own cousin at such a young
          age…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Yes, she’s endured too much for one so young! Gu Changge has gone
          too far!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“She would’ve been the Princess of the Ancient Immortal Gu family.
          Instead, she suffered all those years living in exile, tasting the
          sorrows and sufferings of the human world, it wouldn’t have been easy
          …”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Many young women previously felt envious of Gu Xian’er thinking Gu
        Changge was a good big brother for protecting her.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, they’d never expected Gu Xian’er to have such a tragic past.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Now that Gu Changge has confessed all this, did he plan to make amends
        with Gu Xian’er?’
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, everyone was stunned, regardless of who it was. Men,
        women, young, old, creatures of all races were all frozen in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who knew about this secret kept their silence. Gu Changge’s
        confession had completely exceeded their expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that he confessed to all this and shouldered the blame for this
        act, even personally dug out his own bones to return them to his sister,
        all of this only served to make their hearts beat even faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was ruthless to others, but he was even more ruthless to himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it were them, they would’ve never been able to dig out their own
        bones so calmly.
      </p>
      <p>Just thinking about it made them shudder.</p>
      <p>
        However, this was a private matter of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.
        How it would be resolved was entirely up to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, after today, Gu Changge’s reputation would suffer a
        tremendous loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the most dazzling existence of today’s young generation, his
        brilliance was incomparable. His strength had even reached the level of
        a Young Asura.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was one word to describe Gu Changge before, it would’ve been
        perfection!
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, there was a stain on this perfect man that could not be erased.
      </p>
      <p>
        How old was Gu Changge when he did this sort of thing to his own kin?
      </p>
      <p>
        He had a ruthless heart hidden deep within his jade-like, transcendent
        exterior.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how desperate his attempts or how real his guilt was, it would
        be difficult to erase this stain.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge will carry this stain his whole life!</p>
      <p>
        Many female Young Geniuses who’d previously adored Gu Changge felt their
        entire world collapse, their vision darkening.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their eyes, Gu Changge was as perfect as a jade, unparalleled among
        his peers.
      </p>
      <p>‘How could he do such a thing?’</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Impossible, none of this is possible. It’s all lies.”</b> They
        murmured to themselves for a while, they couldn’t accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Gu Changge, you needn’t say any more… it’s all in the past now.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Xian’er, who had been stunned for a long time,
        finally recovered. Her voice was cold, but it trembled, threatening to
        collapse at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>Her eyes were a little red.</p>
      <p>
        It was evident that she was also in a very complicated state of mind at
        the moment, trying desperately to maintain her composure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her mind was in too much turmoil, buzzing as if there were a million
        flies flying around.
      </p>
      <p>But at times like this, how could one possibly be calm?</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Since I dared to do it, why should I be afraid to admit it? I’ve
          made good use of this bone for many years, and the time has come for
          me to return it.”</b
        >
        Gu Changge spoke calmly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, stop! I already have a new bone. You don’t have to
          return that one to me!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s face suddenly turned pale, but his eyes were very calm,
        like a bottomless ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s voice trembled and was unable to control herself after
        seeing this. She quickly moved, wanting to stop him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, at Supreme Peak, Gu Changge had almost been killed by her
        master’s weapon. The Dao Bones had almost shattered, at that time.
      </p>
      <p>In Gu Xian’er’s eyes, this account was already settled.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s wish to return the Dao Bone was a completely unexpected
        event.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn’t want Gu Changge to do this, because she felt it was
        unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>‘We’re already even!’</p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge moved faster than her. After reaching this point of his
        plans, there was no need to stop now.
      </p>

      <p>Even more blood started spilling.</p>
      <p>He dug deeper into his wound.</p>
      <p>
        Blood, rich with divinity, dripped along his wrist and down to his
        palms, like an incomparably dense mist that sparkled within the sacred
        light.
      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: monkey explanation: blood = shiny &amp; strong]</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s face paled even further, and his eyebrows wrinkled, as he
        violently dug out the Dao Bone!
      </p>
      <p>A multicoloured ball of dense light appeared in his palm!</p>
      <p><b>Hum!!</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Heaven and Earth trembled as a splendid, crystalline bone burst out.
          When it did, all the cultivators heard and felt the aura of the great
          Dao.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        This piece of bone was phenomenal to directly invoke the Dao Intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The Dao Bone…! What terrifying talent! With its ability to influence
          the rules of the world, I dare not imagine its full potential!”</b

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The complexion of many cultivators changed drastically, for they had
        felt the awe-inspiring aura of the Dao Bone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their Dao techniques began to circulate on their own, making a small
        breakthrough.
      </p>
      <p>What could this mean?</p>
      <p>
        That piece of Dao Bone can help them practise and affect the rules of
        heaven and earth.

        <b
          >“No wonder Gu Changge is so powerful. He used his little sister’s Dao
          Bone all this time. He’s nothing but a fraud! Today, after digging the

          to return to his former glory!”</b

          time to face reality! Hehe, it would seem that he is only a Young
          Asura thanks to his little sister’s Dao Bone.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Gu Changge’s rise to power, there were many who held feelings of
        extreme jealousy. And now, they were bursting with excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, they couldn’t help but feel a dark sadistic sense of
        pleasure. ‘Gu Changge’s cultivation base will suffer a tremendous loss,
        and his strength would be greatly reduced once he takes out this bone!’
      </p>
      <p>They felt that their chance to rise had come!</p>
      <p>
        Of course, the many elites who hid in the shadows were no exception.
        Their eyes blazed with enthusiasm, staring intently at the Dao Bone, as
        they sensed the surging power hidden within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they could comprehend the innate patterns and various mysteries held
        within, then their cultivation would greatly increase. It would be a
        tremendous leap forward!
      </p>
      <p><b>“Those who want to snatch this Dao Bone are free to try.”</b></p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge, despite looking very pale, held the Dao Bone
        in one hand with a smiling face.
      </p>
      <p>His grace remained undiminished and transcendent!</p>
      <p>The bright red spot on the white clothes looked shocking.</p>
      <p>
        Many women couldn’t bear to watch this scene anymore, their hearts
        trembled, as they looked away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tens of thousands of creatures from the Sea King Palace all stood in the
        sky. They too were silent, their hearts beating fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a ruthless person like Gu Changge made their hearts feel an
        uncomfortable amount of fear, even a sense of dread.
      </p>
      <p>
        General Hao Miao, who stood in front of the army, was no exception. His
        face was pale, and everything had – once more – exceeded his
        expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thought he could use this matter to threaten and force Gu Changge.
        Instead, the latter’s actions made him tremble, sending shivers all over
        his body.
      </p>
      <p>‘This is definitely not something an ordinary person can do!’</p>
      <p>‘This young man is terrifying!’</p>
      <p>
        <b>“The Dao Bones are yours </b><b>again</b><b>.”</b> Gu Changge said
        with a smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p>The Dao Bones wrapped in endless runes fell towards Gu Xian’er.</p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s fingers trembled a bit. However, she caught the bone, which
        still contained traces of Gu Changge’s blood.
      </p>
      <p>She was frozen in place, suddenly at a loss for words.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s sudden actions had left her bewildered. Gu Xian'er truly
        never expected Gu Changge to dig out the bone himself. However, given
        the familiar aura on it…
      </p>
      <p>
        There could be no mistaking it; it’s her Dao Bone. It’s the same one she
        was born with, the same one that contained all kinds of Innate runes and
        terrifying talents that belonged to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She’s cultivated for so long and so hard to beat Gu Changge, to reclaim
        everything that belonged to her with dignity.
      </p>
      <p>And yet, she still hasn’t beaten Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>Instead, Gu Changge returned everything he’d taken from her!</p>
      <p>
        This left Gu Xian’er at a loss, feeling like she’d suddenly lost her
        goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In truth, she’d long lost the hatred she’d felt for Gu Changge at the
        beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her emotions were a mess, so complicated that even she didn’t know what
        to make of them.
      </p>
      <p><b>“There are some things that you can’t covet.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s faint voice suddenly fell on her ears, causing Gu Xian'er
        to raise her eyes to look at him in bewilderment.
      </p>
      <p>She felt an inexplicable peace of mind in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was obviously a black-bellied schemer whose lies were written
        all over his face, so why was he good to her?
      </p>
      <p><b>“Not good…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's words caused many cultivators, who eyed the Dao Bone in the
        shadows, to feel a sudden chill running down their backs. They suddenly
        felt like they were the target of some terrifying existence.
      </p>
      <p>It was a shockingly cold aura that enveloped heaven and earth!</p>
      <p>
        ‘Some people need to learn that I’m still above them even without these
        bones…’
      </p>
      <p>
        Without deterrence, there will always be clowns jumping to their deaths.
        ‘How very annoying.’
      </p>
      <p><b>Hum!!</b></p>
      <p>His gaze landed on a nearby building.</p>
      <p>A divine light appeared in his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Black and white runes condensed within, intertwining with one another,
        as they instantly crossed the void, striking at their intended target!
      </p>
      <p>The void trembled like torn paper.</p>
      <p>
        It was as if a supreme immortal sword had been unsheathed, its Sword
        Intent was so vast that it could tear through the heavens at speeds that
        sent chills through everyone's body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many even felt a deep and vast primordial intent, which would remind Gu
        Changge of an ancient and mysterious well.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sword light seemingly pierced through this well, like a gateway to
        the realm hidden by the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        [PR/N: Well, well, well. That was absolute torture to translate. The
        attack is basically connected to the Samsara Talent and the abode of the
        Ancient Deity.]
      </p>
      <p><b>“AGHHHHH!!!”</b></p>
      <p>The attack was met with a miserable and horrific cry.</p>
      <p>
        The many cultivators in that building were eying Gu Xian’er’s Dao Bone.
        When they were met with this scene, they felt both horror and despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        They wished nothing more than to take flight and flee as quickly as they
        could.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this Sword Intent was so fast that it seemed to pierce through
        space-time itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sword Intent pierced between their brows and left with a buzz,
        leaving only a pile of withered bones behind, for not even their
        primordial spirits were spared.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the wind blew, their withered bones were instantly reduced to
        ashes.
      </p>

        Gu Changge spoke with indifference, his eyes sweeping across all

        Despite his pale and bloodless face, he greatly succeeded in creating a

      <p>At this moment, no one dared to say more.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had personally offered an explanation, and he returned Gu
        Xian’er’s Dao Bone. As such, it would be strange if Gu Xian’er still
        held onto any lingering hate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that he’s displayed his great strength once more, the people
        trembled at the mere thought of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That aside, this was a private affair of the Ancient Immortal Gu family!
      </p>
      <p>
        Even General Hao Miao’s expression changed abruptly, unable to help but
        take a step back.

        The corners of Gu Changge's mouth carried an inexplicable meaning as he
        suddenly smiled.

      <p>
        His injuries were healing rapidly, dense divine light blossoming from
        his blood.

      <p>
        The divine light was quickly closing the wounds, as well as repairing
        the bones that were previously ripped out.

        The terrifying and surging breath of life was like a vast and exuberant
        river of stars.

        imagination.

      </p>
      <p><b>“Not good!”</b></p>
      <p>
        The moment he heard Gu Changge’s words, General Hao Miao’s complexion
        changed drastically.
      </p>
      <p>He immediately used the Sea King’s decree.</p>
      <p><b>Hum!!!</b></p>
      <p>
        This Sea King’s decree was unfathomably large, and it radiated a vast
        aura as soon as it appeared. The word ‘KILL’ was written on it, like a
        small golden sun, it instantly covered the sky!
      </p>
      <p><b>“Please protect me, my king!”</b></p>
      <p>
        General Hao Miao’s scalp was tingling, as he roared and got down on one
        knee when he unveiled the golden decree.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone looked at all this in shock.</p>
      <p>
        There was a golden decree suspended above the Sea King Palace’s
        General’s head.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aura of a supreme being covered the sky, divine chains of runes
        intertwining and rushing to the heavens, creating a terrifying crack in
        the void.
      </p>
      <p>One could faintly guess that a supreme being was about to descend!</p>
      <p><b>“Humph! Courting death!”</b></p>
      <p>With a cold snort, a man with dark skin appeared from the void!</p>
      <p>It was Gu Nanshan.</p>
      <p><b>“Today, none of you shall leave!”</b></p>
      <p>He swept over the golden decree and spoke with indifference…</p>
      <p>
        Tens of thousands of sea creatures grew even more terrified. They
        couldn’t help but fall to their knees, as though the heavens themselves
        had unleashed its glorious might!
      </p>
      <p>
        Many elders, including those from the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace, and
        even the old masters who were alarmed by the aura of the Great Sacred
        Realm, all changed their faces ever so slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Nashan was not the least bit weaker than Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>And so he personally struck.</p>
      <p>
        In the palm of his hand, entire galaxies seemed to turn, as the stars
        themselves seemed to shatter, a terrible sight to behold.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hum!!</b></p>

        The world spun, now seemingly devoid of light as a vast black star
        trembled in the sky, threatening to fall at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        An incomparably large palm fell from the heavens, pressing down on the
        multitude of beings under the Sea King Palace’s banner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their warships, their flying boats, and even their mounts burst into
        pieces under this pressure. In an instant, they vanished into thin air
        like powder!
      </p>
      <p><b>“The ancestor of the Gu Family is taking action!”</b></p>
      <p>

        All cultivators and creatures carried expressions of horror, as they too
        had now briefly felt what it was like to face off against such
        invincible and heavenly might!

      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>

      <p>The heavens trembled, and the earth was overturned.</p>
      <p>
        There was an endless sea of ??blood where the corpses of immortals sank
        and floated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accompanied by a terrifying <b>poof</b> sound, all the creatures of the
        Sea Clan were crushed. Their battleship was broken, and both their
        bodies and souls were destroyed in an instant!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The Gu Family is too much! Bullying the young with the old, where do
          you put your face?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, an angry and majestic voice resounded.</p>
      <p>
        A sea dragon, whose body was made of dark Immortal Gold, emerged from
        the golden decree and spread its wings, soaring into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>The void cracked open, like a ragged piece of paper!</p>
      <p>
        Its eyes were like two small suns, and its body was draped in black
        divine fire, exploding with a blinding divine light that seemed to burn
        and consume all.
      </p>
      <p>
        On its back sat a terrifying and blurred figure, wrapped in chaotic
        energy, wearing an Immortal Gold crown and wielding a majestic divine
        sword!
      </p>
      <p><b>“My King, help me!”</b></p>
      <p>
        General Hao Miao, who was in a state of extreme desperation, found a
        glimpse of hope.
      </p>
      <p><b>Puff!</b></p>
      <p>
        The sea dragon swooped downwards. The Sea King’s figure rode on its
        back, like some sort of invincible existence, that rushed towards Gu
        Nanshan with killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The Sea King’s Palace has no right to act so freely in front of my

        Gu Nanshan's expression was cold as he quickly struck out, trying to
        obliterate the golden decree.
      </p>
      <p>
        General Hao Miao attracted too much attention, for he was quickly
        subdued with the divine might of a Supreme. A punch slammed in his
        direction with enough force that it seemed like entire worlds were
        crashing into one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“No…”</b> the General despaired. No matter how he resists, the gap
        between the two was simply too great. Escaping an attack of this level…
        was impossible.

      <p>
        In the next moment, he burst into pieces, vanishing without leaving
        behind even a single trace!
      </p>
      <p>
        A cultivator in the Great Sacred Realm has fallen without even being
        able to resist.
      </p>
      <p>This horrified the rest of the Sea Race.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Stop!”</b> The Sea King was furious, utilising his own arsenal of
        terrifying divine powers, as hundreds of millions of beams of light
        burst outward!
      </p>
      <p>
        In an instant, the heavens cried and the earth mourned. The sun and moon
        darkened as if ancient times had descended once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        A battle between supremes was so terrifying that it made everyone
        tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how far away they were, they couldn’t help but prostrate
        themselves on the ground, for even their Primordial Spirit was
        suppressed to the brink of death.
      </p>
      <p>At the end of the day, no one was able to see the battle clearly.</p>
      <p>
        They could only tell it was over when they heard an earth-shattering
        roar of resignation from the Sea King.
      </p>
      <p>
        The golden decree, reduced into fragments, drifted before turning into
        ashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the tens of thousands that the Sea King Palace had deployed to
        hunt down Gu Xian’er, none of them survived!
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge instructed all the elites of the Primordial Divine Sect to
        restrict anyone from entering within an 8,000-mile radius, as they have
        already set up a net of heaven and earth!
      </p>
      <p>
        After the incident, the news will spread like wildfire, causing a
        sensation throughout the Immeasurable Heavens, and even passing on to
        the rest of the Ancient Cities.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Chaos Purple Scripture was a Heavenly Treasure with the ability to make deductions. Even Bai Kun almost got himself killed just because he coveted this treasure. Gu Changge had a feeling that the combination of Bai Kun&#8217;s Heaven&#8217;s Physique and this treasure might end up useful in a way that would surprise him.</span><span id="more-34842"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pagoda and Neraka… I doubt that you can hide for long…] Gu Changge shook his head and had someone called Bai Hua. Soon, Bai Hua, who had just recovered from serious injuries, came to Gu Changge with Bai Lian&#8217;er leading the way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to before, Bai Hua still looked afraid of Gu Changge. He was a man with a handsome face, a medium build, and an abnormally pale complexion. Due to his deduction of the Immortal Domain&#8217;s location, he and Bai Kun were gravely injured. However, Bai Hua&#8217;s injuries were nothing compared to Bai Kun&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You called for me, Young Master Gu?&#8221; Bai Hua asked in a shaky voice as he stood in front of Gu Changge. He still couldn&#8217;t forget about his imprisonment by Gu Changge some time ago. Moreover, Gu Changge came to Bai Kun just seven days ago to help him deduce the location of the Immortal Domain. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was one of the most taboo things to divination and deduction. One would never attempt to deduce anything related to the Heavenly Dao and the Immortals, as doing so would lead to bad luck and a backlash. The reason why his master Bai Kun became blind was that he saw something he shouldn&#8217;t have.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a total of 50 patterns heaven and earth would operate and develop according to, but only 49 could be derived. The one that could not be derived was a Heavenly Secret. And what they attempted to derive was the one that they should not have, and it often contained unimaginable peculiarities and danger. That was why Bai Kun was almost struck to death by lightning from it when he was attempting to deduce the location of the Immortal Domain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want you to deduce one more thing for me.&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at Bai Hua and mentioned it casually. He could tell that Bai Hua had completely recovered, and the reason he looked pale and weak was just for show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bai Hua&#8217;s face fell when he heard this, and his fear and restlessness grew evident. After all, it would be something which results even Gu Changge didn&#8217;t know. Bai Hua could imagine what it was that Gu Changge wanted him to deduce. A slight carelessness could end up with him being torn to bits, and both his body and soul would be destroyed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry. This won&#8217;t be as dangerous as deducing the Immortal Domain. I will lend you a treasure to help you as well,&#8221; Gu Changge added with a faint smile when he saw the worried look on Bai Hua&#8217;s face. Standing beside them, Bai Lian&#8217;er wrapped her arms around her torso and looked at them coldly. She wanted to know Gu Changge&#8217;s purpose for getting Bai Hua to come.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Gu Changge finished speaking, his sleeves were filled with brilliance followed by an astonishing purple tinge. It was as though there was a vast Star Territory evolving as there was a scene of the beginning of flowing chaos in them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aura Bai Hua sensed caused his eyes to widen in disbelief. He couldn&#8217;t help saying, &#8220;This is&#8230; the Heavenly Treasure that Master deduced&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could never forget the time Bai Kun was the military advisor of Bandit Thirteen in Chaos Star Territory. If it wasn&#8217;t because they got greedy after deducing this thing, Bandit Thirteen wouldn&#8217;t have been wiped out by Gu Changge later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Hum!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dazzling purple light diffused from inside. It was like a simple floating divine rock entwined with a thick purple Chaos Qi. This was majestic energy as magnificent as the sky. It was so abundant, vast, dazzling, and eye-catching that it was difficult for one to look away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How amazingly mysterious…&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er couldn&#8217;t help comment as this was the first time she had ever seen this. Just in sight, she could see that this thing was condensed and intertwining with the Great Dao. It was truly extraordinary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, do you mean you want me to use this thing for the deduction later?&#8221; Bai Hua asked before gulping. He found it difficult to avert his gaze from the Chaos Purple Scripture. He didn&#8217;t dare to have any greedy thoughts. [Won&#8217;t I be courting death if I touched something that belonged to Gu Changge?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded slightly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you can do it, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hmm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bai Hua took a deep breath as he tried to calm herself down before he assured Gu Changge without missing a beat. &#8220;Rest assured, Young Master Changge. As long as I have this thing, I am not afraid of making divination or deduction no matter what it is.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn&#8217;t possibly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be tempted in the face of such a treasure that involved deduction. Furthermore, being able to use this treasure would greatly benefit his cultivation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bai Lian&#8217;er then instructed the subordinates to clear an area for Bai Hua, and all the living beings in the surrounding mountains were sent away. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chaos Purple Scripture hung in the air as purple wisps of air dripped from it. It looked like a bright mirror that could reflect every world. After Bai Hua made all the preparations, he stood under it with a dignified expression and clasped his hands together as he muttered something. The ancient words seemed to have a strange power as they shone bright and manifested around his body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, the Heavenly Secrets here seemed to blur, and there were thick and majestic Clouds of Tribulation blowing over from the distance. Terrifying bolts of lightning intertwined and shone upon the ancient palaces and pavilions here. It was an unimaginable sight that looked like it could crash at any moment. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Bai Lian&#8217;er felt apprehensive and uneasy despite her current cultivation. [Is it so difficult to deduce Pagoda and Neraka&#8217;s hiding places?] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She sported a light frown on her face. She already knew what Gu Changge wanted Bai Hua to deduce. In fact, this was a problem that had been bugging her for the longest time. To her, it would save her a lot of trouble if Bai Hua could really resolve this. However, Pagoda and Neraka had been in hiding for countless years. It was difficult to find all their locations and uproot them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can Bai Hua succeed?] However, she lightly shook her head again and put her thoughts to rest when she looked at Gu Changge standing aside with a calm expression as if he was in another world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, the Chaos Purple Scripture emitted several bright purple rays of light and the Karmic Force that emerged turned into countless long silver threads that extended into the void. A terrifying thunder as thick as a mountain soon pierced through the clouds and shot down at Bai Hua.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Bai Hua&#8217;s face fell, and he spurted out a mouthful of blood. He couldn&#8217;t avoid the thunder at such a critical moment during the deduction. However, an inexplicable fluctuation suddenly appeared on his body as if his energy had disappeared from the world all of a sudden. The frightening thunder that was about to strike also dissipated midair in a puff of smoke as if it was never there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems like this is what makes the Heaven&#8217;s Physique so profound. It can help its owner hide from the backlash of trying to peer into Heavenly Secrets…] Gu Changge suddenly nodded in understanding when he saw this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this exact moment, Bai Hua shouted excitedly, &#8220;I&#8230; I see it&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked terrifying with blood flowing from his eyes that only the whites were visible. However, it was as though he couldn&#8217;t feel it. He kept his eyes wide open as if he saw something amazing. After saying this, Bai Hua let out a muffled snort and shuddered before blood and foam came out from his mouth. He eventually passed out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems that he got information about Pagoda and Neraka.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled when he saw this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was located in the east of the Ashen Immortal Star Domain. It was a vast and primitive land which contained countless mountains and ancient stars. There were many scary beasts whose roars were so loud that the stars in the distance would tremble and threaten to fall. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a high altitude, one could see the pervasive fog and endless miasma blowing over from afar, obscuring everything. Clusters of white bones which were difficult to tell whether they were from the human race or the other races could also be seen in some places. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities and dangers coexisted here. Not only could one find divine techniques left by the worthy predecessor from ancient times, but there were also stone tablets and stone forests which Sacred Emperor Realm experts carved on to record their comprehensions when they cultivated. Some had even found a Nirvana Scripture handed down by a True Daoist. However, anyone who wanted to enter the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds must pass through the All-Encompassing Border City and get permission from the patrol guards. They would only be allowed to step inside after making sure that there weren&#8217;t any issues. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battlefield of Hundred Worlds brought together the elites from every corner of the Lower Realm. It could be said that this was the best place for the Forces from the Upper Realm to come here for fresh blood. The successors of certain Forces would also come here in search of followers or servants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, ‘chaos’ and ‘massacre’ would always be the highlights of the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. This place was not so much a battlefield as it was a place the Upper Realm specifically used to breed Gu creatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were six main regions in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, and each region contained many cities. However, the regions treated each other like enemies. According to rumours, the leader of the six major regions had ordered their people to live as enemies of one another. Peace between them was not an option. Therefore, any cultivators from the outside world must join one of the six main regions if they didn&#8217;t have strong backing and get ready to become enemies of the other five main regions. This was especially true for cultivators who have passed through the teleportation array from the Lower Realm. They had no other choice. If they didn&#8217;t pick one region to join, they would have to either drift about without a home or end up being killed by the cultivators from the six main regions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big competition was held on the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds to select the young, fresh blood from the Lower Realm every hundred years. Those who ranked high would receive extremely generous rewards. Because of that, the Lower Real still took great pleasure in cultivating youngsters to come here to fight despite knowing that the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was a place of no return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowds of people were gathered today at the entrance of the All-Encompassing Border City as they waited for the patrol guards at the gate to check them and let them enter. The aura of these people was obviously different from that of the Upper Realm&#8217;s locals. The shocking and unimaginable looks were all over their faces. Standing here, they seem extremely restless and agitated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around them were some Elder who had come along with them. Just like the young ones, they didn&#8217;t look like they were doing any better. It was as if this was the first time they had seen such a scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a majestic and gigantic city ahead in this boundless universe. Surrounded by the cries of dragons and phoenixes. The timeless city was a spectacular sight to behold as it sat there under the stars and moon. Everyone was looking at this ancient city from a distance. It had an immense aura while an celestial force flowed around it, making the city look like it could last forever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this the first city we have to go through to enter the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds&#8230;&#8221; Many young living beings murmured, their shock evident on their faces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city was magnificent and mysterious. Instead of being located on a planet, it hung directly in the starry sky of the universe and received the baptism of countless stars. It was an amazing sight to see. The wide area the city covered was surrounded by city walls like mountains that extended endlessly. The tall and splendid towers, on the other hand, looked like they were standing at the end of the world. The sturdy city gates that were closed then looked like they could block off thousands of troops and horses, and even ancient deities!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are they all from the Lower Realm? Sure enough, they look like lowly nobodies. With their weak cultivation, they will probably be marching to their own deaths on the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are from the Lower Realm after all. It is probably their first time in the Upper Realm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another direction, many Upper Realm cultivators shook their heads slightly as they disdainfully peered at the group in the distance who had rushed over from the Lower Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of the teleportation array to get to the Upper Realm from the Lower Realm was not cheap by any means. Therefore, only a small batch of people could be brought here every time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was hard work for the Forces because they needed to spend time cultivating their disciples before they could be sent over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, they were still contaminated with the aura of the Lower Realm after coming here. With their weak cultivation level, they either needed to spend time to get rid of this aura, or they had to receive help from major Forces.</span></p>

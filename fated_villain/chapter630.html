        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The yard might not be big, but it was incredibly serene, with a thin layer of mist enveloping the small bridge, flowing stream, and gazebos. The place was covered in reishi and sacred flowers, making the place ethereal-like. </span><span id="more-33881"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, the atmosphere right then was eerily grave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Ah Qing, Princess Xuan Dea, and the others who arrived later couldn&#8217;t help feeling apprehensive, not to mention the Shu Sect Elders, who led Tuo Ba Xiao Yao to this place. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their faces were, even more so, pale, for they never expected the man to hold a grudge against Gu Changge. However, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t express anything, so they dared not speak up either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Remember your promise. My sister would suffer no harm,&#8221; said Tuo Ba Xiao Yao icily as he looked towards the image in the void from within the yard. The weight was finally lifted off his shoulders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rest assured, I, Gu Changge, never go back on my words. Since I have given you my word, I will naturally adhere to it.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled. As he gently swung his arm out, the image in the void dispersed into thin air with a pop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone fell silent as they watched the image disappear, for they dared not speak foolishly when they didn&#8217;t know the whole story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might look like Gu Changge had captured Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s younger sister and used it as leverage to make Tuo Ba Xiao Yao give up an artifact, but it was evident that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was also from the Upper Realm. However, who could tell if he was a friend or a foe when they weren&#8217;t sure of his motives?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope so,&#8221; said Tuo Ba Xiao Yao as he gazed frostily at Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next second, a bright glow resembling a crystal clear palm-sized sword marking surrounded by ancient markings shone in the middle of his forehead, and various terrifying ancient beasts like the True Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Taotie, and Bi Fang emerged before merging and transforming into clanging of swords.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, a powerful burst of a Sword Will intertwined and weighed down on everybody around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear and terror enveloped the many Elders and disciples of the Shu Sect right then as their Spiritual Swords were oppressed and seemingly wanting to bow down to the lord of all swords.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz, buzz, buzz!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the innumerable Divine Swords within the Sword-Forging Pool, a Forbidden Area of the Shu Scet, churred like they were awakening, bowing down in Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s happening to the Sword-Forging Pool?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The countenances of many Elders and disciples turned awful as their bodies shuddered, all while the swords made of light lacerated their skins.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phenomenon left them in incredulity, for they had never experienced such a strange scene. Especially when the Spiritual Swords that resided within them also suffered the oppression and nearly bowed down towards Tuo Ba Xiao Yang.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, the Shu Sect Master, who rushed over as a divine rainbow, watched the scene with great dismay after landing outside the yard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He recalled a story documented in one of the records.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shu Sect once had a peerless prodigy with a Spirit Sword that created such a mysterious phenomenon, triggering a reaction from the countless Divine Swords in the Sword-Forging Pool as though the lord of all swords had emerged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the prodigy was met with an untimely death, accidentally killed by Heavenly Tribulation when watching the Prime Ancestor trying to breakthrough/ That day marked a great loss for the Shu Sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, to the Sect Master&#8217;s surprise, he was seeing the same terrifying phenomenon on Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. What shocked him even more so was that the man could cast some of the Shu Sect&#8217;s secret techniques, and he couldn&#8217;t help wondering who Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Snow Sword Immortal, Ah Qing and the others were similarly unnerved by the scene, they weren&#8217;t shocked like the Sect Master. Their gazes were locked profoundly at the gradually appearing sword silhouette on Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s forehead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every cultivator born in the Profound Sword World, a Sword Spirit accompanied them, thereby classifying their talents, which would determine the speed of their cultivation in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal was billed as the number-one prodigy in the last three thousand years of the Profound Sword World. Naturally, Her Sword Spirit wouldn&#8217;t be weak. As such, the sword silhouette&#8217;s terror felt even more profound to her. It was a terrifying energy beyond this world and its principles. In fact, she could tell the energy was enough to wipe out the entire Profound Sword World the second it was unleashed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Sword of World Domination… Is this why Gu Changge came?&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal couldn&#8217;t help looking towards Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, she heard the man demanding for the Sword of World Domination. But then, she thought her notion wasn&#8217;t right either. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was from the Upper Realm and not the Profound Sword World. There was no reason for Gu Changge to come all the way here just for a man from the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait. This man can use a Shu Sect secret technique!&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal caught the surprising fact very quickly, and her pupils shrank subtly in response. &#8220;What in the world is going on? Who is he? Is he a disciple of the Shu Sect?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secret technique Tuo Ba Xiao Yao used to part the Sword of World Domination from himself was from the Shu Sect. It would be impossible for him to cast it if he weren&#8217;t a Core Disciple, and she believed the other perceptive Elders present could certainly tell as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is going on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is this Sword of World Domination?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Shu Sect Elders were feeling incredibly shocked as well, and they couldn&#8217;t stop looking at each other in bafflement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz, buzz!* Right then, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao stood in the centre of the yard with his eyes closed while his robe and hair fluttered despite the absence of wind. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the crystal clear sword marking in the middle of his forehead surged, forming something physical, the terrifying Sword Qi stormed the place, making the countless Divine Swords of the Shu Sect churr and clatter. In fact, illusions of ancient men praying and presenting offerings to blurry celestials shot into the air, and everyone thought they heard an ancient and mystical worldly hum reverberating throughout the place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being far away from Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, everyone still felt as though their organs suffered from a terrible impact, as countless Sword Qi burst from the Sword-Forging Pool all at once, slitting their skins, wanting to turn their souls into dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You want the Sword of World Domination? Here, catch!&#8221; roared Tuo Ba Xiao Yao with a hint of madness in his eyes while being enveloped in an intense azure glow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Ring!* A crisp ringing of a sword echoed through the place, and an azure celestial sword just barely two and a half centimetres long suddenly shot out of Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s forehead as endless rays and Principles intertwined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an incredibly dazzling sword, and it looked as though it had been refined hundreds of thousands of times by heaven.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless swords within the Shu Sect hummed from the moment the azure sword&#8217;s physical form appeared.  All of them unsheathed themselves and flew towards the sword, piercing the air and shooting across the sky with incredibly terrifying sharpness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!* While the sword nearly crushed the void and caused the world to quake, countless Divine Swords flew over, bringing the world into darkness as they enveloped the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shu Sect had collected countless of Divine Swords over the hundreds of thousands of years since its establishment, and right then, all of them simultaneously flew over to this yard as though they had been summoned, forming a massive sea of swords.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was certainly a terror-striking scene, and even the countenances of characters like the Shu Sect Master turned awful. Even they had trouble holding onto their swords.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even someone as powerful as an Earth Sword Immortal would have a hard time bearing the innumerable terrifying sword edges. It already felt as though his skin was on the verge of exploding, let alone the others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such power was enough to annihilate the entire world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He actually attacked Young Master Gu!] Ah Qing and Princess Xuan Dea couldn&#8217;t help widening their eyes with incredulity when they realised what Tuo Ba Xiao Yao wanted to do.</span></p>

          Celestial Demonic Physique and her cultivation had surpassed many
          ancient monstrosities, although she only started cultivating at 14
          years old. Her drastic improvement was so great that defeat was
          unheard of for her. She, together with the Wondrous Stone of the
          Immortal Academy, are called the Twin Geniuses of the Immortal
          Academy. Though, I can’t tell if she might be harmed again by Changge
          in this life. Well, in the end, she died when she was in her prime in
          my past life. This angered the Immortal Academy tremendously, yet they
          couldn&#8217;t get any results from the investigation and her death
          became a mystery. It is clear now that she got killed by
          Changge…]</span

          biding its time. After Qing Xiaoyi’s disappearance, it kept such a low
          profile that very few have seen its true form. However, from what
          Changge said, it was the only one who had escaped from him unscathed.
          Its cultivation must be above the Sacred Realm at the very least.
          Though, anything from Gu Changge should be taken with a pinch of salt.
          The Wonderous Stone might have escaped from him unharmed, but it was
          most likely because Gu Changge did not use his full power.]</span

          Mingkong sat on her bed. Her figure was slim, and her face was
          extremely beautiful. Her eyes were narrowed as thoughts flashed across
          them. She was pondering the next step in her plans, as well as a way
          to gain the ancient artifact from Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s oldest
          brother.</span

          want anything to do with Qing Xiaoyi as they had no relation to each
          other. She didn&#8217;t care about how her present life would end,

          mirror appeared in her palm. It looked extremely ordinary and did not
          have any adornments. However, as she activated her power, the mirror
          began to glow with light. All dirt and rust on its surface were gone
          as if washed away by rain, leaving behind a shiny mirror.</span

          muttered to herself. &#8220;I now have two out of the Seven Tools of
          World Domination. The Flask of World Domination is with Qing
          Xiaoyi&#8217;s oldest brother, while the Jar of World Domination is
          with Changge. I don&#8217;t know where the others are,

          collecting all seven tools. One could even find the ruins of Skyward
          Schloss by using them, which had collapsed into the River of
          Time.]</span

          >It was obvious how much it was coveted. Any individual with a long
          life hadn&#8217;t found it, even though they had searched for it for a
          long time. These Seven Tools were the key to the ruins of Skyward
          Schloss. Out of the seven, she possessed both the Mirror and Seal of
          World Domination; the others were the Sword, Wheel, Flask, Jar and
          Tower of World Domination. She had found the Mirror and the Seal
          according to the memories from her past lives, while the Jar had been
          rumoured to appear in an auction. She hadn&#8217;t attended it as she
          knew Gu Changge would get his hands on it. After all, her purpose in
          collecting them was to help Gu Changge and reduce his worries. She
          hadn&#8217;t informed him about this, though, as she didn&#8217;t want
          to arouse his unwanted suspicion.</span

          plotting his next steps for his plans in his cave manion. [That horse
          feeder would have to carry the blame for a while, as no one else is
          currently a better choice. However, before I continue with anything, I
          have to acquaint myself with what I call the Organisation of the
          Demonic Arts.]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In his opinion, the organisation was made up of followers of the
          Demon Lord, who had flocked together to form an organisation,
          ironically knew very little about the Demon Lord and the Successor of
          Demonic Arts. However, they were a little useful, since Ying Shuang
          hadn&#8217;t dared to reveal his whereabouts for now and that Elder
          from the Immortal Academy would protect him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >For this reason, Gu Changge considered letting all the young
          prodigies know that the current Successor had concealed himself in the
          Academy. This would lead to fear, and then further chaos, enough to
          hide what he was doing. Once something happened to one of the young
          prodigies, Ying Shuang would have no choice but to claim his
          involvement, as the organisation was currently the only thing
          protecting him right now.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, Gu Changge was also giving her this opportunity. He just
          needed to employ some nicely hidden schemes and let her take the fall,
          so that the organisation would notice her. Once that happens, Ying
          Shuang would have exhausted all his worth and did not need to live
          anymore.</span

          Noble Realm, and prepare to take on the Sacred Lord Realm. I&#8217;m
          just not sure whether the Source of the Celestial Demonic Physique
          could be received by the Dao Fruit of Reception and be
          recreated.]</span

          Treasure Chest he acquired after the defeat of the Mortal One. In
          simple terms, could be used to duplicate things.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that Qing Xiaoyi had many Elders and ancient freaks around her,
          it would be extremely suspicious for him to act now. It would be too
          much of a risk. Besides, he sensed that the girl was interested in
          him; it would be more useful to use her rather than consume her
          Source. So, he would have to find another way to get the Source of the
          Celestial Demonic Physique.</span

          every pore of his body, as powerful as the energy exuding from a
          galaxy. The top of his head shone brightly as the Celestial Chant
          transformed into an ancient, mysterious, and indescribable old god.
          One glance was enough to make the beholder insane and quivering with
          fear, ready to prostrate themselves. The energy was so terrifying that
          even an expert in the Sacred Lord Realm would feel like their skin
          would split from its intensity.</span

          Fatum first. Even though he had plenty of things in the System Market,
          the one he most desired was the Absolute Detachment Bone. He already
          had a total of sixty Absolute Detachment Bones in his body, all with
          mysterious colours woven inside.</span

          brightly like unyielding divine gold. Of course, this description
          wasn&#8217;t accurate; it was like it had completed its transformation
          to the extreme. It contained the world, its beginnings, its colours,
          the entire universe, chaos, and matter. This was no longer just
          bones!</span

          dream-like mysterious light emitting from Gu Changge&#8217;s flesh,
          skin, and organs. Ten more of his bones had transformed into Absolute
          Detachment Bones.

          Detachment Bones have far surpassed that of a normal Sacred Lord Realm
          expert. I might even be stronger that a few Sacred King Realm
          experts.] Gu Changge thought as his expression became colourful.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, three more days remained until the Immortal Academy closed
          their gate. Many young prodigies from the Upper Realm had gathered
          here before then, including the Successors of the Mortal Palace,
          Prince Shen of Sky Emperor Mountain, and the mysterious King with Six
          Crowns. However, except for those from the Demon World, there were no
          other Successors that came, which made the situation bizarre.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Outside the tall gates of the mountain, Gu Xianer walked with light
          steps. Her features were pretty, and her skin glowed. Her expression
          was distant and haughty as she walked up the stone stairs. This
          attracted the attention of many young prodigies, who looked at her in
          amazement.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was still young, but it was obvious that she would develop into a
          devastatingly gorgeous woman. She was clad in a light green dress
          which attenuated her trim figure and her hair was smooth and soft. A
          bright red bird was perched on her shoulder.</span

          Battlefield to kill Eternal Overcast creatures before coming to the
          Immortal Academy, where Hong Yutian currently was. She was a prodigal
          damsel from the Immortal Gu Family but she still did not act as
          high-profile as Gu Changge. She just brought along her red bird with
          her, which made her look slightly plain and impoverished.

          method of falling and picking myself up again is a painstaking way of
          cultivating. Nonetheless, it is very effective. I will catch up to Gu
          Changge very soon!] Gu Xianer was in a good mood as she walked lightly
          towards the entrance. Many young prodigies wanted to talk to her but
          were denied with a cold, haughty expression. She made a fighting pose
          when most of them approached her. This scared them away, as they knew
          she was far more powerful than them.

          present as she followed the procedure, checking the bone age and

          was already in the Enlightened King Realm and thus stronger than them.

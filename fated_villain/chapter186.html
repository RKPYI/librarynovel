      <h4>
        Chapter 186: Gu Changge is Cold on the Outside and Warm in the Inside;
        His Disguise Will be Torn Off One Day!
      </h4>
      <p>
        On that day, in front of the Ancient City of Heavenly Dao, the great
        army of the Sea King Palace was eradicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only the scattered wracks of their ancient warships remained, as well as
        some residual of the terrifying aura that recounted this great and
        horrible battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The news spread quickly, like a boulder slamming into the deep sea,
        causing enormous waves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivators that witnessed it all were shocked beyond belief. Even
        now, they still felt chills when they recalled the events that took
        place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though the Sea King Palace was extremely powerful, in the end, it
        didn't get the slightest advantage, instead they completely offended the
        Immortal Gu Family, and in some ways, even humiliated themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators even speculate that the situation in the Immeasurable
        Heavens will undergo a terrible change in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        That day, the Golden Dharma Decree shrouded the sky, holding as much
        divine might as a Heavenly Tribulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Sea King's phantom from the Sea King Palace appeared in person,
        but it failed to change anything. And in the end, even his Decree was
        smashed into ashes by the Gu Family’s ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Gu Family demonstrated to everyone its horror and
        might.
      </p>
      <p>There was no room for humiliation!</p>
      <p>
        In the following period, news of the event rapidly fermented, spreading
        like wildfire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of who they were, they were shaken to the core, unable to
        stay calm.
      </p>
      <p>No one expected that such a secret past would be involved.</p>
      <p>
        Whether it was by Gu Changge’s words or Gu Xian’er’s origins and tragic
        childhood, many were left shocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stir caused by this incident was no less than the appearance of the
        Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor some time ago, who killed many Young
        Supremes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some even felt that Gu Changge's ruthlessness in certain areas were
        comparable to that of the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritors.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, such a narrative was soon drowned in the waves of diverse
        opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result of the bone digging incident at a young age, Gu Changge's
        reputation had taken a great blow, and his perfect image in the hearts
        of many of the younger generation had been tainted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the younger generation couldn't believe it and found it hard to
        accept, but the fact remains that Gu Changge did it with his own hands.
        He said it with his own mouth, and he even dug out the bones, the sight
        of which caused the eight directions to shake.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge’s bold confession of his past actions to world made
        many people swell with admiration. Some people even began to think that
        his actions were even justified.
      </p>
      <p>Is there really a perfect person in this world?</p>
      <p>Unlikely.</p>
      <p>No one is perfect, not even the greatest of saints are.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge carries a stain that would be hard to erase, but isn't that
        normal?
      </p>
      <p>
        From this perspective, the many young women who practically worshiped Gu
        Changge before felt that he only became more “real”. Thus, their
        admiration for him was no less.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the previous Gu Changge, who was a transcendent
        immortal-like being above the nine heavens, unstained by even a speck of
        dust…
      </p>
      <p>
        This version of Gu Changge made them feel as though the gap between them
        was no longer as wide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, not even saints are without fault, and Gu Changge had been open
        to the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this not a sign of his guilt and atonement? He will make up for his
        previous mistakes and compensate for his debt to Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>Why shouldn't they choose to forgive him?</p>
      <p>After all, were Gu Changge’s words not convincing?</p>
      <p>
        Over time, people began to praise Gu Changge's transparency and
        unspeakable courage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who else could’ve done what he did? Who would admit their past mistakes
        and dig out their own bones in front of the whole world, in order to
        repay their debts?
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this period of time, various opinions rose: praise, anger,
        sorrow and ridicule…
      </p>
      <p>
        The younger generation, in particular, never stopped debating such
        opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Young Supremes who were in the Heavenly Dao Ancient City and
        witnessed everything, were even more devastated by the events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though Gu Changge had dug out the bones of the Great Dao, he
        retained his absurd strength, seemingly unaffected in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
        They wanted to catch up to Gu Changge, but it was simply impossible. The
        cultivation level that Gu Changge revealed at present was already at the
        late-stage of the False God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the rest of the Young Supremes were just beginning to touch the
        barrier of the False God Realm. The gap between them was so immense that
        many had become desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a great mountain weighing down on the peers, difficult to
        overcome, impossible to turn over.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this day, there hasn't been a single Young Supreme that can be given
        the title of Young Asura, the same Gu Changge has.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mysterious and ruthless Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor, Ye Ling,
        had vanished into obscurity, but no cultivator had forgotten his
        strength. After all, he was powerful enough to escape from Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Continent can be considered the best breeding
        ground for the Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritors; who knows how far his
        cultivation skyrocketed there?
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, quite a few cultivators began to ponder, discovering
        a… contradiction in the story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did Gu Changge choose to dig out his own cousin's Dao Bones; what
        exactly was he trying to achieve? What was his intention? To make
        himself stronger with Gu Xian'er's talent?
      </p>
      <p>
        But if so, why did he dig out the Dao Bones and return them to her, in
        front of everyone?
      </p>
      <p>Is it because the Dao Bones no longer had any use to Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>The entire thing was simply too bizarre; it was too suspicious.</p>
      <p>
        Some people speculated that this incident was due to the pressure from
        the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. Gu Changge was the Young Master of the
        Immortal Gu Family; thus, his every word and action represents them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless this matter was not resolved, it would come to light sooner or
        later. When that time comes, Gu Changge will be forced to acknowledge Gu
        Xian’er’s identity one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, many people felt that such a secret was only the tip of the
        iceberg.
      </p>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p><b>[At the same time, Supreme Peak]</b></p>
      <p>
        The mountain breeze blew, and the clouds and mist, like jade ribbons,
        wrapped the eight directions.
      </p>
      <p>The already magnificent scenery now resembled a heavenly paradise.</p>
      <p>
        Immortal flowers were in full bloom, as the sounds of freshwater flowing
        filled the area.
      </p>
      <p><b>“If you have something to say, say it quickly.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stood at the top of the mountain with his arms behind his
        back, his robe fluttering, his expression profound.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a calm voice, he turned his back to Gu Xian'er. Her expression
        reflected her complicated emotional state, as she found herself at a
        loss for words.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, Gu Changge's body no longer showed the slightest injury, not
        even a trace of change in his breath.
      </p>
      <p>Digging out the Dao Bones had no effect on Gu Changge whatsoever.</p>
      <p>However, even now, his face still seemed a little pale.</p>
      <p>It was the third day since he revealed the truth to the world.</p>
      <p>
        That day, after Gu Nanshan exterminated all the creatures from the Sea
        King Palace, Gu Changge ordered a group of powerful individuals from the
        Primordial Divine Sect to clean up the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        He returned to the Supreme Peak and hadn’t spoken a word to Gu Xian'er
        during that time. So naturally, there were no interactions between the
        two.
      </p>
      <p>
        He and Gu Xian'er appeared to have become strangers who did not know
        each other in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>Her blue skirt fluttered, as the mountain wind blew.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er's delicate face was in a daze. When she looked at Gu Changge,
        various thoughts swirled in her mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        She squeezed the corner of her skirt, her heart was not as calm as it
        appeared on the surface. At this moment, her knuckles were a shade
        whiter.
      </p>
      <p>‘It’s been three days since he’s acknowledged me…’</p>
      <p>
        Initially, Gu Xian'er wholeheartedly believed that Gu Changge would
        explain to her what truly happened back then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Gu Changge clarified what happened back then in front of the whole
        world and said that he would make it up to her…
      </p>
      <p>‘Isn’t it clear that he feels guilty?’</p>
      <p>
        In addition to his previously damaged origin, he dug out the Dao Bones
        and returned them to her. He even declared that he would protect her…
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of all the Daoist sects no less, such a statement truly shocked
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a strong and indifferent attitude made her head buzz, as she felt
        an unprecedented sense of peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge has a black heart and vicious hands, having such a
        big brother seemed rather appealing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, she planned to reluctantly forgive Gu Changge for what he had
        done more than 10 years ago. “Let bygones be bygones.”
      </p>
      <p>
        From then on, the grudges between the two would come to an end, with
        neither of them owing each other anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Xian’er never expected Gu Changge to suddenly act as if he
        had completely forgotten her. Let alone explain himself, he didn’t even
        pay attention to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        His indifferent attitude reminded her of what she was like in the
        beginning, back when she didn’t even want to speak with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>She was confused, unable to make sense of any of it.</p>
      <p>
        She thought that Gu Changge really wanted to make amends because he felt
        guilty for the bone digging incident in the past. He practically
        announced the secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why does the current situation differ so much from what she had
        imagined?
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed as if… Gu Changge had only shown up to fend off the Sea King
        Palace’s retaliation and doing all of this simply to acknowledge her
        identity, simply to do her justice for what happened back then.
      </p>
      <p>Or perhaps it was for the sake of the family's reputation.</p>
      <p>
        After returning the bones to her, the two seemed to have no further
        relations with each other.
      </p>
      <p>The two had settled their grudges and became complete strangers.</p>
      <p>
        The superficial brother-sister relationship, naturally, no longer seemed
        necessary to be maintained.

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er couldn’t believe it had come to do this, nor could she accept
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Gu Changge must have more secrets. That’s why he’s pretending; that’s
        why he’s treating me like this.’
      </p>
      <p>
        With such an attitude, it was clear to her that Gu Changge simply didn’t
        want her to understand him!
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, Gu Xian'er took the initiative to come to the Supreme
        Peak. She was determined to find Gu Changge and ask him about the truth
        of what had happened back then.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, after hearing Gu Changge’s words, Gu Xian'er took a deep
        breath and regained her former calm and composed demeanour.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, what was the purpose of your actions three days ago?”</b
        >
        Her tone of voice was incomparably calm, with a serious look on her
        delicate face.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er felt the need to tear off Gu Changge's disguise.</p>
      <p>
        ‘What is it, that it’s so hard to say; can't you just say it? Do you
        have to hide all by yourself?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge treated her so well before; she didn't believe that it was
        all a fa?ade that Gu Changge put on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was, in fact, cold on the outside and warm on the inside!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“What was the purpose? Gu Xian'er, this is what you came to ask me
          about? I thought it was a big deal.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>“You disappoint me.” </b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Instead of wasting your time, why don't you go back to your
          cultivation? Or do you think that, from now on, I won't be able to
          suppress you? No more motivation to practice?”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing these words, Gu Changge appeared to be slightly frustrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he turned to look at her and spoke with a snicker in his voice.
      </p>
      <p>It was as if he had witnessed something stupid.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was angered by his carefree and contemptuous attitude. With
        her nose wrinkled, she said in a clear and plain voice,
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, stop pretending. Don't think you can hide it from me
          like this.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        All this time, Gu Changge used various means to force her to work hard
        on her cultivation, in order for her to surpass him.
      </p>
      <p>Even now, this has remained unchanged.</p>
      <p>
        With such an obvious flaw, did Gu Changge really think she wouldn't
        notice?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er stared at Gu Changge's eyes as if she was trying to see
        through him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Xian'er, did you think that after I said those words and swore
          with my Dao Heart that I wouldn't strike at you? I haven't beaten you
          for a while, so you've grown bolder.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge snickered and looked at her,
        <b
          >“Don't try to provoke me; otherwise, I really will throw you down a
          pit for the next few years.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge…” </b></p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, Gu Xian'er's voice rose abruptly, and her eyes were
        filled with anger, glaring at him fiercely,
        <b
          >“I have already forgiven you, why are you still treating me like
          this?”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she knew that Gu Changge was deliberately trying to anger her,
        she couldn't help but be angry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge indifferently replied,
        <b
          >“You forgave me? Last time, I offered you my life, you didn't want
          it, we don't owe each other anything.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“You…”</b> Gu Xian'er didn’t know what to say. Gu Changge was right;
        their grudge had already been settled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only, for such matters, how could it be said to be settled so easily,
        even forgetting it ever happened?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“But what about your words to the rest of the world? You even dug out
          the Dao Bones and returned them to me.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If she was strong enough to beat Gu Changge, she would’ve taught this
        tsundere a lesson by now.

      <p>Gu Xian'er's face turned pale.</p>
      <p>The more Gu Changge spoke, the more she refused to believe.</p>
      <p>He was clearly hiding something!</p>

        teeth and truly wished to cut open Gu Changge's heart to see what he was
        really hiding inside.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was simply unfathomable otherwise.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Kindness? No need, a person like me doesn’t need kindness.”</b> Gu

      <p><b>“Do you still not understand? Is that why you’re asking?”</b></p>
      <p>
        He had a faint look of mockery on his face. A completely different look
        than when he was protecting Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Gu Changge you…”</b> Gu Xian'er was fuming at Gu Changge's words.
      </p>
      <p>
        What did he mean he didn’t need her kindness? He practically accused her
        of carrying hatred and bitterness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she didn't know he was doing it on purpose, she would’ve definitely
        thrown a tantrum by now.

      <p>She vowed to tear off Gu Changge's disguise one day!</p>

        <b>“What am I? Don't you know the difference between old and young?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s cold gaze landed on her. With a wave of his sleeve, a large
        palm appeared in the void, instantly slapping Gu Xian'er off the
        mountain and sending her flying.

        During this period of time, the entirety of the Immeasurable Heaven was
        solemn, as if an ominous sign had appeared just over the horizon.

      <p>
        Many cultivators and creatures were afraid to show their faces outside
        casually.

      <p>
        What's more, the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ inheritor, who had been in
        hiding for a long time, had reappeared.

      <p>
        This time it was the most elite and powerful of the clans that had

        In the Immeasurable Heavens, outside of the great Immortal Daoist Sects

      <p>
        Radiant body, fiery crystalline hair, like a demigod of the sun, Ye
        Langtian.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he heard these events, he practically sang Gu Changge’s praises,
        his eyes filled with admiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his opinion, Gu Changge truly deserved to be called the number one of
        the younger generation. For now, at least, there was no Young Supreme
        who can be compared to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only one left was the mysterious Yue Mingkong, whom Ye Langtian felt
        had the ability to compete with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>But the two are an engaged couple, so why would they fight?</p>
      <p>A private spar was not likely to be known to the world.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“But what could Daoist Brother Changge’s true power be? The Dao Bones
          didn’t originally belong to him, so could it be a spatial type
          talent?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian's eyes narrowed, thinking that Gu Changge's hidden talent
        was probably related to space.
      </p>
      <p>
        The speed that Gu Changge demonstrated in the several battles he had
        fought was mind-boggling and inconceivable.
      </p>
      <p>It would make sense to say that he was travelling through the void.</p>
      <p>As for the matter regarding the bone digging?</p>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, many Young Supremes, including Ye Langtian, did not
        care.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world is a place where the strong feed on the weak, devouring the
        weak to strengthen themselves is the law of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        He himself was not entirely a good person; therefore, he considered Gu
        Changge's actions in the past to be completely understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, young people don't know any better. On that note, there was
        little to be said.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s confession was already out of his expectations.</p>
      <p>If it were him, he would’ve never had the guts to do such a thing.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I knew that there was a grudge between Gu Changge and Gu Xian'er.
          However, for a person like Gu Changge to actually do such a thing as
          digging up his own bones and returning them to his sister, is truly
          unexpected.”

      </p>
      <p>
        Beside Ye Langtian, a purple-skirted, stunningly beautiful girl was also
        in shock.
      </p>
      <p>It was none other than Ye Liuli.</p>
      <p>
        When she mentioned Gu Changge, she remembered the scene when Gu Changge
        forced her to apologize in the Lower Realm. As for the memories with Ye
        Chen, she could only vaguely make out a few images.
      </p>
      <p>
        She only remembers that Ye Chen had offended Gu Changge, and although
        she wanted to help, in the end, she was unable to do so.
      </p>
      <p>Ye Chen was killed by Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Other than that, Ye Chen in her opinion, was a small, insignificant
        person.
      </p>
      <p>Not someone worth caring about.</p>
      <p>
        Instead, she often couldn't help but think of Gu Changge, which made her
        very troubled.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was any disrespect towards him, there would be a feeling
        comparable to facing all the glory of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Brother, will the Sea King Palace really start a war with the
          Ancient Immortal Gu Family? I feel even though the Ancient Immortal Gu

          underestimated. They’ve ruled the Infinite Sea for so many years and
          have never broken its legacy…”</b

        <b
          >“This war is impossible to win; the Sea King Palace will not
          dare.”</b

      <p>— — —</p>
      <p><b>[The Infinite Sea]</b></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, at the end of a large swamp, there was a dark blue sea.</p>
      <p>
        On this sea were black warships made of bones, as the golden sun sunk
        into its depths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, the sound of slaughter echoed in the sky, accompanied by a
        roar.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large number of Sea Creatures rushed from all directions, rulers of
        the Sea King Palace and their many subordinates from all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        A general leading ten of thousands of sea creatures sent to the Heavenly
        Dao Immortal Palace to seek justice, carrying the Sea King’s decree,
        were all destroyed by an ancestor of the Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        This incident provoked the wrath of all the Sea Clans in the Infinite
        Sea. Thus, they gathered here, determined to wipe away their
        humiliation.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, a dense fog filled the sky.</p>
      <p>The Sea King Palace was built in the middle of the sea.</p>
      <p>[TL/N: Thanks, captain obvious.]</p>
      <p>[PR/N: No s***, Sherlock.]</p>
      <p>
        Dense Immortal Qi poured, as the leaves of an Ancient Tree danced to
        create shade. A boundless world was formed around this tree, which
        seemed to hold up the sea itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside it, the sun, moon, and stars were all present, and the rules of
        heaven and earth were intact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking around, mountains and rivers, pavilions, towers, palaces, and
        courts lined up one after another, as one would normally see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the ancient palace in the centre, the Sea King wore an Immortal
        Gold Crown and held an immortal sword imbued with the King’s Dao. He had
        a gloomy look on his face and shouted,
        <b
          >“The Ancient Immortal Gu Family has crossed the line! This is the
          first time my Sea King Palace has been humiliated in countless
          years!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        He can still clearly recall his phantom’s encounter just shortly after
        its manifestation, a rusty kitchen knife slashing down on his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        If not for the immense solidity of the phantoms that he had refined for
        a long time, there was no doubt the knife would’ve reduced it to ashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, what truly got under the Sea King’s nerves was Gu Nashan’s
        attitude. He never once took a step back.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed as if… the Sea King Palace was afraid of the Gu Family!</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Your Majesty, we cannot wage war just yet. If we must fight, we
          should first gather all the elites of the Sea Clans together to
          slaughter the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, to let them know that we are
          not easy to provoke.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A turtle-shelled creature with green bean-like eyes turned and said so.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his opinion, with the seemingly endless number of sea creatures, even
        if the Gu Family was strong, they would not be able to withstand it.
      </p>
      <p>After all, the vastest area of the Upper Realm was still the ocean!</p>
      <p>
        The Sea Clan was powerful, although not as strong as the ten thousand
        clans of the Immortal Period who branched out and made clans of their
        own clans, they were still superior in numbers!
      </p>
      <p>After hearing these words, the Sea King's face changed quickly.</p>
      <p>However, in the end, he couldn't help but grimace.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This King is not the opponent of that old ancestor of the Gu Family,
          if we really go to war with the Gu Family over this matter… it will

          through countless wars and chaos. Unless we also have reinforcements…”

        The Sea King roared in a low voice. He was loath to do so, but this was
        all he could do to vent.

      <p>[PR/N: AMOGUS?!]</p>
      <p>[TL/N: SUS?! SUSSY BAKA-]</p>
      <p>
        The senior members of the Sea King Palace below were all silent and
        didn’t dare speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at that moment, all their faces changed. A terrifying aura was
        descending upon the Sea King Palace!
      </p>
      <p>The tumultuous sea and the sky trembled!</p>
      <p><b>“It's the Gu Family’s ancestor!”</b></p>
      <p>
        The Sea King's face changed drastically; he never imagined that Gu
        Nashan would follow him even here.
      </p>
      <p>
        He walked slowly, one step at a time in the palace. With his monstrous
        and intimidating aura, a divine chain formed with the power of Rules
        rushed to the sky, instantly heading for the outer palace. The slaughter
        had begun.

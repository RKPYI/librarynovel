        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At those words, the remnants of the Fourth Palace all became stricken and in disbelief. Many even felt their heads ringing, as if a lightning bolt had struck them.</span><span id="more-36160"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Fourth Palace Lord had surrendered? How is that possible? He is one of the oldest and strongest in Neraka. He is as peerless as the mysterious Ruler of Neraka! Even the Ruler of Neraka has to give him some respect.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had known that the Fourth Palace Lord could die in battle after being defeated. Never had they thought he would surrender and submit himself to another. He was a formidable, prideful, and determined figure, so how could he choose to yield to Gu Changge?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible. No matter how powerful Gu Changge is, he could never make the Fourth Palace Lord yield even if he could defeat him.&#8221; The close advisors of Yan Luo couldn&#8217;t believe this and their voices shook. Many others felt as if their worlds had collapsed and their unwavering faith slowly disintegrated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you don&#8217;t believe me, you can all try to escape this place alive.&#8221; The True Daoists in black stood near the horizon, exuding overwhelming might, which pressed down on the world and pushed it to the verge of collapse. They were all puppets without emotions and were only following Gu Changge&#8217;s orders. Anyone who dared fight back would face a powerful strike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just take them down. The Fourth Palace Lord will never yield. He&#8217;s probably recuperating somewhere and will summon us back when his injuries are healed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the survivors couldn&#8217;t believe this and rushed forwards with angry growls, burning their Blood Essences, which made them look as though they were on fire. They might have come from Neraka, a group of killers, but they weren&#8217;t just focused on their own survival. At this point, their only thought was to fight their opponents without regretting anything even if they died. The others hesitated for a moment before charging forwards as well, ready to engage with the True Daoists before them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How foolish.&#8221; The True Daoists in black only looked on coldly, completely unmoved by this, and raised their hand to crush them. The entire world seemed to be held within their hands as the hands slowly dropped down on them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless clouds of blood exploded once again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following days, the Palaces of Neraka in the other Lower Realm Worlds were attacked and surrounded by other Forces. Even True Daoists could not defend themselves properly. At most, they could only escape with serious wounds. However, they were caught up by their enemies and were either captured or killed. At this point, the Palace Lords could not change anything and could only watch as the experts of Neraka were picked off one by one and died on the battlefield. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a brutal battle that dyed the entire world red, caused ancient worlds to collapse, and remains to float about. Corpses and ruins of ancient battleships were littered everywhere. Neraka had sustained the worst losses since the ancient hidden worlds were all destroyed and rooted out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the main focus of the various Forces of the Upper Realm were the Immortal Grade Artifacts that Neraka had. Yet, such artifacts had not been summoned even with the fall of the Palace Lords. This was extremely strange to many supreme experts since Neraka had been around as long as any Immortal Force. Logically, there should be some.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the depths of the vast sky outside the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, fog surrounded the many ships which hovered up above. Several tall blurry figures stood as though they were immovable mountains. They came from various Upper Realm Immortal and Formidable Forces, all of them True Daoists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is Neraka’s foundation that bad, or are they just trying to fool us?&#8221; s figure surrounded by crimson light muttered slowly as he stared at the ruined world beneath his feet. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His voice was cold and murderous since he had an unresolvable hatred for Neraka. The most powerful young prodigy in his clan, his older brother, had been assassinated by Neraka when he was little. It was said that the skull of the child had even been turned into a wine goblet and placed on display. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had exited seclusion just to join the war against Neraka and to find his brother&#8217;s remains. Yet, after going through the different Palaces, he had not found the rumoured location, which held skulls and skeletons of different young prodigies and Ancestors on display. So, he suspected that Neraka had a base somewhere else. They were an assassin guild and were definitely cunning enough not to have just one base of operation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All the Palace Lords have been dealt with or are being dealt with. The very few that had escaped seem to not be worth much. The Ruler of Neraka hasn&#8217;t shown any sign of appearing even when Neraka is being destroyed. Has he passed on?&#8221; Muttered another ancient being. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were all wary of the Ruler of Neraka. They were all cautious enough not to go deep into the various worlds in Neraka’s control. They only sent their armies to surround and attack them. All True Daoists took great care of their lives and would never risk them if there weren&#8217;t any benefits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh yes. Where is Gu Changge now? Since he intends to destroy Neraka, he shouldn&#8217;t be so unbothered about the whereabouts of the Ruler of Neraka,&#8221; someone suddenly questioned as they recalled this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There has been no news of him recently. I heard that the Fourth Palace had been annihilated by him alone,&#8221; murmured one of the True Daoists, the universe evolving within his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The survival of the Fourth Palace Lord, known also as the second most powerful expert in Neraka, is unknown too. He may have been killed by Gu Changge&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several True Daoists guessed, all extremely afraid of Gu Changge. He had already shown strength far surpassing the average True Daoist back in the invasion of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. His abilities had only improved during the past few years. It was an unbelievable miracle which they couldn&#8217;t fathom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No matter what, Gu Changge has made many people at his current level fearful and cautious. Someone might make a move on him after the issue regarding Neraka has been resolved. We&#8217;ll just enjoy the show then.&#8221; Ear-splitting cold laughter resonated within the misty world. It was already an unspoken agreement among the Immortal Forces, and they already heard the news since they were all considered Ancestors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal Gu Family might have kept a low profile during the last few years, but their might shouldn&#8217;t be underestimated. The elimination of Purple Mansion had shaken the entire Upper Realm, and one of the Gu Family’s Ancestors, who was a Remnant Immortal, had appeared during the invasion of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, how would the Gu Family compare to all the Immortal and Formidable Forces of the Upper Realm?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloody bone fragments flew about while organs turned to compost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the frightening battlefield filled with the terrifying and nauseating scent of blood. Sounds of moaning filled the air as corpse after corpse fell into a pile. Battles and killings occurred everywhere, resulting in a scene that could only be described as a bloodbath.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the ancient world where the Third Palace was situated. It was the final defensive line for Neraka. Armies from different Forces arrived on ancient battleships from outside this world, with evidence of war everywhere. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivators fought without regard for their lives; even those in the Sacred Emperors Realm and Quasi-Nirvana Realm seemed like savages as they killed. Their tattered bodies were covered in blood. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terrifying quakes spread everywhere like a stormy ocean and reduced everything to dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Neraka shall be exterminated today and no one can stop it.&#8221; A golden giant stood towering over the world, his voice resonating like a loud gong that intimidated the entire land. His fist seemed to penetrate the ruined world with one strike, which reduced the corpses and blood to ashes. Everyone before him all exploded, bodies and souls destroyed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a Sacred Emperor Realm expert from the Ancient Golden Godly Clan, who exuded a powerful aura. Just one stray wisp of it could cause everything to collapse. He watched the brutal scene before him as he continued punching downwards, fighting with another Sacred Emperor Realm expert from Neraka without any sign of emotion, pity, or mercy in his expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the experts who had come here now resembled evil spirits from a dead world, showing no mercy to the assassins of Neraka due to their deep-seated hatred. This was already the seventh ancient world they had destroyed. While assassin guilds had run rampant and caused fear and havoc due to their countless slayings of young prodigies, they now had their comeuppance and were finally being exterminated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ancient battleships rumbled in above the sky and blocked out the daylight while exuding an overwhelming aura. Gu Changge stood on one of them and watched the events unfolding below with an unbothered expression. Neraka might have gone extinct because of him but he wasn&#8217;t going to feel guilty about it, since Neraka was being a hindrance to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the Third Palace, there are just a few Palace Lords left along with Old Lady Meng. It&#8217;s uncertain if the Ruler of Neraka is in there too.&#8221; Bai Lian’er looked on, her gaze filled with ambition. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beams of light expelled from the ancient battleships. Vast Dao Runes enclosing and transforming into killing auras to reap the lives below.</span></p>

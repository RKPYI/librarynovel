        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was now in an uproar after the assassination attempts on the royal descendants as well as the ministers and their families. War began to rage in different parts of the territory as murderous intent began to rise everywhere, with many nobles starting to claim the feudal lands they oversaw in a bid to build their own country.</span><span id="more-34821"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was an Immortal Celestial Dynasty that had lasted since ancient times and had given birth to Immortals. Since it occupied an infinitely enormous expanse of land, too many nobles had been allocated feudal land during peaceful times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation in Imperial Capital was chaotic as well, causing Emperor Yu to become extremely troubled. Even if he wanted to send an army to calm the riots, he couldn&#8217;t reach such a far off distance in a short amount of time. The nobles had noticed this as well and felt that Celesital Dynasty was facing an unprecedented catastrophe, being on the edge of breaking apart. That was why they had taken advantage of the troubling circumstances and began claiming lands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, I have followed your orders by instructing the usurping forces to attack. I will then force Emperor Yu into vacating the throne in the name of clearing up the riots. If he refuses, I will fight him to the death in the capital. I have 80 percent confidence in killing him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a quiet mansion in the Imperial Capital, Gu Changge stood under an ancient tree with crimson mulberry leaves falling from it as he nodded while listening to Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s report. The latter sounded extremely respectful, fearful and reverent. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge, with his shimmering dark hair, looked otherworldly in his clothes purer than snow which made him look tall and slender. It seemed as if three thousand worlds orbited indistinctly around him, as if he was standing in the mythical Immortal Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng knew how terrifying Gu Changge&#8217;s abilities were. If he hadn&#8217;t seen it himself, he wouldn&#8217;t have believed that Gu Changge was safe and unharmed, without the serious injuries and a damaged Source as described by the rumours. That meant that the claims of Gu Changge getting injured after fighting the a World’s Will or being seriously hurt in the process of saving Yu Feiya were all fake. The destruction of that Lower Realm World might even be caused by him. A truly  terrifying thought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have 80 percent confidence in dealing with Emperor Yu?&#8221; asked Gu Changge, his serene gaze dropping from the fluttering mulberry leaves to look at Yu Tianzheng.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, I know Emperor Yu well and thus have a clear idea of what abilities he has. I am 80 percent confident in winning the fight,&#8221; promised Yu Tianzheng seriously. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His original plan had been to sneak into the Imperial Palace to assassinate Emperor Yu, but Gu Changge had persuaded him to forget that plan after knowing of it. As far as Gu Changge was concerned, plenty of hidden experts existed in the capital, especially in the palace. After residing in the Imperial Palace for so long, the Yu Emperor would have a deep understanding of its forbidden arrays and defenses. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the Imperial Palace was close to the forbidden area of the Celestial Dynasty and any battle might awaken the ancient beings that entered seclusion within the area. The success rate of the assassination attempt would be close to zero, so it was better to take advantage of the riots and take the throne in the name of justice and peace rather than take that route. That way, not even the ancient beings of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty could stop him since they had no reason to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your confidence looks to be just 10 per cent to me.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head as he studied Yu Tianzheng from head to toe. Yu Tianzheng had a slight edge over Emperor Yu in terms of strength, but their abilities and the Fortituity they possess weren&#8217;t at the same level.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, I—&#8221; Yu Tianzheng froze, not understanding Gu Changge&#8217;s purpose for saying that he had only a 10 percent chance against the current Emperor. However, he did not dare doubt Gu Changge&#8217;s judgment since it was far too easy for the man to kill him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will give you a secret technique which can enable you to kill him in the final battle between you two.&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at him without elaborating, then tapped his finger against the air. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ball of faint light appeared, flickering with many ancient and strange Dao runes, before transforming into a light beam that shot straight between Yu Tianzheng’s eyebrows. Instantly, a frightening, ancient, and obscure scripture exuding a demonic aura appeared within Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s mind. Every word flickered brightly like stars which illuminated and purified the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng could faintly see infinite amounts of Demonic Qi surging out and flooding the world due to its sheer power. He was extremely shocked and shivered with a strange feeling of fear, as if his soul was consumed by the scripture.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, Young Master Gu.&#8221; Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s forehead was damp with cold sweat and he couldn&#8217;t calm down due to his shock. He knew that the scripture was overwhelmingly powerful and had an unimaginable origin, so he didn&#8217;t dare hesitate and quickly expressed his gratefulness with reverence. Since it was gifted by Gu Changge, it wasn&#8217;t something trivial. It definitely increased his confidence in winning the showdown against Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge only retracted his stare after Yu Tianzheng left, his expression becoming thoughtful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That secret technique you gave him isn&#8217;t that simple, right?&#8221; A soft, melodious yet seductive voice came from beside Gu Changge. A woman in white walked in as she embraced her nine fluffy fox tails before standing quietly behind him with some puzzlement on her indescribably beautiful face. She was tall and slender, with pale flawless skin and bright eyes. She was a peerless beauty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was Yin Mei, Gifted Lady of the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan, who had come quickly as soon as she knew he had returned to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It would overuse what remains of his remaining lifespan, but it’s powerful enough for him to deal with the matter. This is all the remaining value I can get out of him.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head slightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, you are as cruel and ruthless as usual.&#8221; She smiled, not surprised by this. She didn&#8217;t think Yu Tianzheng could be of much value to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not being ruthless but just recycling trash. I need a suitable pawn like him to take control of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. He has the ambition and capability but not the fortune and fate to do so, and I can supplement that lacking fortune.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and pulled her into his embrace. He wasn&#8217;t about to keep something like this a secret from his lover.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. I shall make arrangements for the Alliance to take over the business channels of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.&#8221; She tilted her head as she stared at him reverently and admiringly. &#8220;You seem to have gained a lot from your current endeavour. Even the living Remnant Immortals might not stand a chance against you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had sensed that intuitively. Even though she hadn&#8217;t seen him fight, she could make some guesses from the events that had transpired in the Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s hand touched her hair as he smiled without denying her statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yes. Young Master Gu, Lady Xianer seemed to have disappeared without a trace since we could not locate her anywhere in the Upper Realm…&#8221; Yin Mei suddenly murmured with a worried expression as she recalled something.</span></p>

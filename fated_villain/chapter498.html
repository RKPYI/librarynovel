          Fight the Upper Realm valiantly, or abandon the city?&#8221; Gu
          Changge lifted a hand to smoothen her fringe. &#8220;Or do they still
          have something concealed, even now?&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;Concealed?&#8221; She shook her head. If they truly did, she
          wouldn&#8217;t have surrendered like this. Sky Deer City was now
          facing its greatest threat, yet the decision that would be made by the
          True Daoists made her uneasy. If things progressed to that stage, it
          was clear which route they would take. This made her sigh.</span

          However, the remains of generations of supreme experts who died in
          battle with the Upper Realm are buried there in the hopes that they
          would be reborn or restored.&#8221; She recalled something after some
          thought. As the guardian of Sky Deer City, she naturally knew of that
          mysterious place. Yet, she hadn&#8217;t gone there due to fear of
          disturbing the souls of those supreme experts resting there. Thus, she
          didn&#8217;t know a lot about it.</span

          >&#8220;The Land of Rebirth? Is there a connection with it?&#8221; Gu
          Changge raised his eyebrows, feeling that this sudden aura of death
          might have come from the so-called Land of Rebirth. It seemed that Sky
          Deer City was built here for a reason; he would have to explore that
          place when they take over the city.</span

          >*Boom!* Fluctuations came from the space behind them, which they both
          sensed immediately thanks to their powerful abilities. Gu Changge
          wasn&#8217;t surprised but the Sky Deer Goddess looked cautious after
          sensing how strong the aura was.\</span

          >&#8220;Greetings, Eighteenth Ancestor.&#8221; He smiled towards the
          source of the fluctuations.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Lang materialised, no longer the valiant and formidable character
          from before. He currently looked like any other old man with a hunched
          back as well as with a pale and wrinkled face. However, his eyes
          looked wise and unwavering.</span

          >&#8220;The Eighteenth Ancestor?&#8221; The Sky Deer Goddess was
          shocked as she recognised the figure, who was the man close to the
          Immortal Realm who had just attacked Sky Deer City.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If not for the limitation, he would have been a True Immortal. The
          power he held could destroy the universe and reduce it to ash. No one
          would expect this unrivalled being, who nearly felled Sky Deer City
          with his hand, to be such an ordinary-looking old man. Even so, she
          dared not underestimate him.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Besides, she was also astounded by how Gu Changge had addressed the
          man. [The Eighteenth Ancestor? Did this person merely rank eighteenth
          out of all the Gu Family Ancestors?]</span
        >

          >&#8220;Did I disturb you?&#8221; Gu Lang smirked at Gu Changge after
          showing himself. He didn&#8217;t mind the Sky Deer Goddess, who was
          from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. He didn&#8217;t treat her
          like an enemy like the other older beings.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You can&#8217;t even give me some courtesy?&#8221; Gu Lang
          didn&#8217;t seem surprised by the words and smiled openly before
          staring straight at Gu Changge. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been a long
          time since I saw you, yet you can now fight against True Daoists.
          Everyone has their secrets, and while no one in the Upper Realm would
          dare investigate you because of your status, you still need to be
          careful.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry, Eighteenth Ancestor.&#8221; Gu
          Changge raised his eyebrows, trying to guess what this man meant. He
          eventually concluded that it was because his current cultivation level
          was far too unfathomable. However, he didn&#8217;t believe anyone
          would dare verify his identity at this point, plus the true Successor
          of Demonic Arts, Su Qingge, was in the Upper Realm and could be
          tracked down easily. Thus, nothing could be traced back to him.</span

          >As for the Sky Deer Goddess, Ancestor Gu Lang didn&#8217;t ask too
          many questions nor was concerned about her. After talking briefly with
          Gu Changge, he left in a light and serene carefree manner, like he was
          here in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains just for some fresh air.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >A few days later, something which shook the entire Sky Deer City
          suddenly happened. Divine rainbows had suddenly shot down from the sky
          and appeared within the pavilions and palaces. Bright Space Tunnels
          then appeared in the sky as countless people were stored within
          artifacts, and were taken away.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This shocked the city, with many noticing that those who had left
          belonged to a mighty great clan of the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. They didn&#8217;t even hide their intentions, whisking their
          members away in broad daylight.

          beings appeared to stop them, it was ineffective. These people had

          refusing to stay here any longer.

          them? Absolutely not! Why should they risk their lives while the

          unfold within the city. They sounded sentimental yet gleeful since
          they had sent their order for their clans to flee. They even made up a
          logical excuse to escape from the city in broad daylight. As they had
          expected, the city had become far too chaotic and no one would say
          anything about them leaving. However, they hadn&#8217;t reached that
          stage in their plans yet. They still need to order their clans to
          continue ‘protecting’ the city. This gave them more reason as well as
          moral credibility.</span

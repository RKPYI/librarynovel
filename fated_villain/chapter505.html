          was cultivating somewhere here. The children carried a kind of
          spirituality in them, an exuberant amount, which was clearly a result
          of having absorbed spiritual energy for a long time. The reason the

          grey and white somehow indicated that countless lives were lost in the

          rumoured Young Master of the Gu Family, yet he could only acknowledge

          Domains in the near future. Even so, your arrival is sooner than I
          expected. This old one intended to present to you the heads of the

          fair deal. Now don&#8217;t look at me like that. The fate of your Clan
          is in my hands now. Best believe that a word from me can fill the
          other forces with so much hatred that they’d dispatch the army to hunt
          down your Clan. I doubt the Godly Illusion Clan will be able to fight
          back then. Tsk, tsk. But the eight Sect Masters represent the eight
          forces, each from a different direction. I wonder, how will your Clan

          &#8220;Don&#8217;t push it, Gu Changge. I can agree to the rest of the
          conditions, but this was absolutely unacceptable. If you want a

          him to submit and make a deal with them. However, this so-called

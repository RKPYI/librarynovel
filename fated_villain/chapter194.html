        <h4>Chapter 194: Such a Bold Approach is Truly Astounding; A Fellow Otherworlder!</h4>
        <p> Atop the nearby mountains, there were countless cultivators and creatures, all of them came from all over
            the world to witness today's excitement. </p>
        <p> The True Dragon Clan has been standing since the Immortal Period with immense power and vast heritage, who
            would dare to offend them? </p>
        <p> Usually, in the Ancient Immortal Continent, they were used to being arrogant and conceited, not putting
            anyone in their eyes. </p>
        <p> However, now after meeting someone stronger than them, they were oppressed to such an extent. </p>
        <p> Many cultivators were even looking forward to seeing the True Dragon Clan suffer a big loss and get their
            karma for acting arrogant all this time. </p>
        <p> Many of them heard Xiu'er's words, but no one thought any differently. </p>
        <p> It seemed perfectly normal to them. After all, it was Gu Changge. Which woman in the younger generation
            didn't admire him? </p>
        <p> Hearing this, Wang Zijin looked at her speechlessly, then said with a nod, <b>“Look how excited you are. But
                this Gu Changge is indeed quite good-looking, his appearance is rather impressive. It gives people a
                kind of transcendent feeling.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“No wonder he has so many admirers.”</b> </p>
        <p> She didn't say anymore. </p>
        <p> After all, who in the world isn’t a dog for beauty? </p>
        <p> Even she considered herself to be quite charming. Her appearance, naturally, needed no comments. </p>
        <p> During her years cultivating in the Human Ancestral Hall, Wang Zijin got quite used to seeing all kinds of
            Young Supremes, and each one of them also firmly believed that they were invincible with formidable
            strength. </p>
        <p> But, the moment they were defeated or suffered a huge blow, they became devastated and couldn't be compared
            to the big characters she knew from her previous world. </p>
        <p> The kind of character to grow increasingly stronger with each setback, always unyielding. Characters such as
            Great Emperor, Ancient King, etc. </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin didn’t consider herself to be a superficial person. Naturally, she wouldn’t judge a person at
            first sight. </p>
        <p> She needed to get closer to Gu Changge in order to get a good grasp on what type of character he is. </p>
        <p> <b>“Yes, I was right, Young Master Changge is indeed the number one in the younger generation!” </b>Xiu'er
            said with excitement. </p>
        <p> ‘With that appearance, he certainly can’t be one of those ordinary fair-faced protagonists. And he’s even
            forcing the True Dragon Clan to submit currently, what he’s doing doesn’t seem like something a righteous
            character would do.’ </p>
        <p> ‘I wonder what kind of protagonist he has offended…’ </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin nodded, staring at Gu Changge's figure in the distance. A peculiar colour flashed past her eyes.
        </p>
        <p> She was still thinking, trying to figure it out. Moreover, she always felt that Gu Changge seemed to be
            inexplicably different from the male-oriented novel routines she was familiar with. </p>
        <p> ‘It’s obvious that his cultivation is only at the True God Realm, but why does he give me a faint sense of
            danger?’ </p>
        <p> This was the first time she couldn’t see through the cultivation of a young man. </p>
        <p> In fact, in front of her, no matter what kind of a Young Supreme it was, it would be difficult for them to
            hide their true strength. </p>
        <p> And they were easily defeated, making Wang Zijin think of them as nothing more than trash. </p>
        <p> However, looking at Gu Changge, she discovered the existence of a special case that seemed to be shrouded in
            a layer of mist, making him seem very mysterious. </p>
        <p> As a matter of fact, even Jiang Chuchu, who was known as the reincarnation of an Ancient Immortal, didn’t
            give her such a feeling. </p>
        <p> ‘This is very unusual.’ </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin's intuition was very accurate, she even used that intuition to find out the true strength of her
            old coachman. </p>
        <p> And in her opinion, Gu Changge was very familiar with such things as oppressing people with power, he was
            obviously a repeat offender. </p>
        <p> At present, ordinary Young Supremes were at most challenging their peers, getting into petty fights, while
            Gu Changge was actually plotting the entire Ancient Immortal Continent. </p>
        <p> His courage and ability were obviously not comparable to those Young Supremes she had seen before! </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin admitted that she had been underestimating Gu Changge so far, and things were obviously not as
            what she thought. </p>
        <p> And she became increasingly curious about Gu Changge, he had piqued her interest. </p>
        <p> <b>“This Gu Changge isn’t simple.”</b> Wang Zijin couldn't help but mutter. </p>
        <p> <b>“Hehe, Young Miss, this is the first time you’ve said someone of the younger generation isn’t
                simple…”</b> </p>
        <p> When Xiu'er heard this, she was very surprised and appeared shocked. </p>
        <p> Then she became even happier, it seemed that her Young Miss also realised the fact that there were people
            above people, and heavens above heavens. </p>
        <p> Previously, she had spoken many times about the rumour regarding the Gu Changge, but Wang Zijin never cared.
        </p>
        <p> ‘Now that she has seen Young Master Gu in person, she must believe it, right?’ </p>
        <p> It was naturally impossible for Wang Zijin to explain anything to Xiu'er. In any case, she felt that her
            decision to leave the Human Ancestral Hall and come to the outside world was indeed correct. </p>
        <p> As soon as she arrived at the Heavenly Dao Ancient City, she met a person that she found intriguing. </p>
        <p> <b>“Young Miss, the Immortal Wang Family warship is over there! Young Master Wushuang should also be
                there.”</b> </p>
        <p> Then, Xiu'er suddenly pointed toward a group of cultivators not far away and said in a surprised voice. </p>
        <p> The ancient warship was floating in the sky, with brilliance soaring into the clouds, as many cultivators
            with tyrannical auras stood on top of it. </p>
        <p> The banner of the Immortal Wang Family was fluttering, with a big, simple and imposing Wang character,
            demonstrating the strong heritage of the Ancient Immortal Wang Family. </p>
        <p> The young man at the front appeared to be very mysterious and had golden eyes filled with pride. </p>
        <p> But Wang Zijin saw through the mysterious aura at a glance, it was Wang Wushuang. Although she hadn't seen
            him before, she recognized him at once that he was her younger brother in this life. </p>
        <p> <b>“They're here.”</b> </p>
        <p> Afterwards, Wang Zijin couldn't help but reveal a smile on her face. Then, the two servants and the master
            rushed over there, with the intention to meet up first. </p>
        <p> She put the matter of Gu Changge aside for the time being. After all, the two were complete strangers, they
            had never even met before and there was no animosity between the two. </p>
        <p> There will be time to find out later. </p>
        <p> — — — </p>
        <p> <b>[Far away on the other side]</b> </p>
        <p> The battle was fierce and thrilling, causing everyone in the surroundings to be filled with a chilling
            atmosphere! </p>
        <p> High above, divine light soared into the sky, and the sound of slaughter shook all directions. </p>
        <p> Such a terrifying force made countless Daoist Sects go pale. </p>
        <p> At this moment, all the protective formations on Dragon Island glowed with brilliance, attempting to resist
            the incoming attacks. </p>
        <p> The three major clans, Black Heavenly Eagle, the Ancient Serpent, and the Divine Crocodile Clan were all
            fighting. Following Gu Changge's instructions, at the critical moment, they became a sharp sword to break
            apart the situation in the Ancient Immortal Continent! </p>
        <p> <b>“Die!!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Kill for the Young Master!”</b>

        </p>
        <p> Leading a vast army of elites, they swept through heaven and earth like a torrent to slaughter the Dragon
            Island frontier. </p>
        <p> The ancestors of the three major clans who were at the Quasi-Supreme Realm were also brutally slaughtering
            True Dragon clansmen. </p>
        <p> The aftermath of their battle with the Dragon Clan's Quasi-Supreme beings shook the heaven and earth,
            causing all the mountains within a ten thousand-mile radius to collapse and turn into dust and ashes! </p>
        <p> [Kshn: Yep, there you have it. The messed up sense of scale.] </p>
        <p> All living beings could only perceive the astonishing aura that swept across the world from afar. </p>
        <p> Beyond the sky, the stars trembled like grain, the sky shook, and the heaven and earth warped. </p>
        <p> The roar of anger and resignation came from within, rattling countless creatures and cultivators. </p>
        <p> One could imagine what kind of terrifying battle was taking place there. </p>
        <p> Quasi-Supreme beings, which were the fundamental ancestors of the major clans, usually remain in seclusion
            to cultivate, and wouldn’t appear unless faced with the most critical situation. </p>
        <p> However, at present, the ancestors of these three major clans all appeared together, fighting against the
            True Dragon Clan for Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> This scene shocked countless Daoist lineages and Major Sects beyond words, and their hearts were filled with
            a deep shock. </p>
        <p> <b>“During the Immortal Period, I heard that the ancestors of these three major clans were all followers of
                the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation. Looks like this rumour is indeed true.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“I never expected that the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation actually left such resources for his heir; the
                three major clans for him to use as he pleases!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation simply did the best for his heir! No wonder Gu Changge is so
                powerful!”</b> </p>
        <p> Many cultivators had eyes filled with envy and jealousy. </p>
        <p> These were the three major clans of the Ancient Immortal Races! And the background of each clan wasn't
            simple, with ancestors in the Quasi-Supreme Realm, who were now all being used by Gu Changge! </p>
        <p> This kind of power, can not only be described as horrifying, but simply unimaginable. </p>
        <p> This caused many Young Supremes to clench their fists and tremble, feeling disinclined, desperate, and even
            depressed. </p>
        <p> Before they knew it, the gap between them and Gu Changge had grown to such an extent. </p>
        <p> With such power, Gu Changge was almost on an equal footing with the Elders and Patriarchs behind them. </p>
        <p> Initially, they were peers, but now, they can only look up to him. </p>
        <p> Today, Gu Changge's identity as the Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation was solidified without a
            doubt. </p>
        <p> After all, everything at present, with even the three major clans of the Ancient Immortal Continent
            following his orders. </p>
        <p> Was there anything left to say anymore? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m</p>
        <p> This was a battle that made the entire True Dragon Clan tremble. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge revealed his identity as the Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation and the Black Heavenly
            Eagle and other major clans were fighting against the True Dragon Clan under his orders. </p>
        <p> [Kshn: We got it already author-san!] </p>
        <p> This scene caused the Ancient Immortal Races, which were now on edge, to tremble and feel very uneasy. </p>
        <p> They knew that as soon as the True Dragon Clan fell, Gu Changge would definitely use the opportunity to
            attack them next. </p>
        <p> With the methods and temperament that Gu Changge currently displayed, he would definitely do it so! </p>
        <p> Thinking of this, many clans became uneasy, feeling that after this war, the situation in the Ancient
            Immortal Continent would change drastically. </p>
        <p> They could only stand in line and wait. If they tried to resist like the True Dragon Clan, it’ll only result
            in the extermination of their entire clan. </p>
        <p> Even the rest of the Daoist Sects and Immortal Clans, at present, wouldn’t dare to offend Gu Changge! </p>
        <p> This was true power! </p>
        <p> <b>“It's completely unimaginable, is this really a young man?” </b> </p>
        <p> Many cultivators of the older generation couldn’t help but sigh. </p>
        <p> <b>Buzz!</b> </p>
        <p> Currently, Gu Changge's expression was calm, almost unusually indifferent. </p>
        <p> The Ancient Wheel of Samsara resembled a black sun, its glorious majesty was almost earth-shattering, and
            the Divine Rune radiated its tyrannical might. </p>
        <p> Under such an oppressive aura, he didn't need to do anything at all to deter many powerhouses of the True
            Dragon Clan, they simply didn’t dare to attack him! </p>
        <p> Not to mention, there were many powerhouses guarding him and even a Quasi-Supreme Realm ancestor following
            him closely. </p>
        <p> Moreover, if needed, Gu Changge could also bring out the Great Sacred Realm puppets that the Ancient Deity
            of Reincarnation had left for Ye Ling at any time. </p>
        <p> With so many methods at hand… </p>
        <p> He didn’t need to worry about anything, he had come here to do nothing more than to show his face. In
            addition, deter all the major leaders, in case some of them don't value their life and think of snatching
            his prey. </p>
        <p> Originally, this was a plan he had arranged for a long time, and to call it a seamless plan wouldn’t be
            wrong! </p>
        <p> A flawless victory! </p>
        <p> Even if the True Dragon Clan was not reconciled, they still wanted to keep up their face and would not give
            in easily. </p>
        <p> But then, as Gu Changge slaughtered more and more of the True Dragon clansmen, they started feeling fear,
            realising their own stupidity. </p>
        <p> It was the perfect example of not shedding a tear until one sees the coffin[1]. </p>
        <p> [1: Meaning: unknowingly on a bad course, though it should be obvious.] </p>
        <p> Naturally Gu Changge didn't seem concerned. </p>
        <p> Currently, all kinds of thoughts flashed through his mind, however, he was in fact thinking about something
            else just now. </p>
        <p> In the system that hadn’t changed for a long time, a new task prompt suddenly appeared. </p>
        <p> This caused Gu Changge to be a little surprised. The leek that he was looking forward to had finally
            arrived, moreover, they even took the initiative and came to him! </p>
        <p> Certainly, Gu Changge had recently been thinking about how to earn a large amount of Fortune Value and
            Destiny Points to prepare for his future plans. </p>
        <p> As for Yue Mingkong and Gu Xian'er, he had other plans, that would have to proceed step by step, not
            something that can be done in a hurry. </p>
        <p> While thinking about how to sleep, someone actually came to deliver a pillow. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge felt a little moved. </p>
        <p> ‘The leek this time seemed to be quite self-conscious.’ </p>
        <p> Not only that, the system prompt this time, made him a little intrigued. </p>
        <p> <b>[A new Favoured Daughter of Heaven has appeared, a fellow from another world]</b> </p>
        <p> ‘Tsk!’ </p>
        <p> ‘Another world?’ </p>
        <p> Obviously, there’s no need to say more, a transmigrator like himself was the Favoured Daughter of Heaven
            this time. </p>
        <p> For Gu Changge, the foremost thing to do when he meets his fellow transmigrator in this world would be to
            find a way to kill them. </p>
        <p> Things related to one's origin should naturally remain in the stomach until it goes rotten, and it would be
            impossible for a second person to know. </p>
        <p> Not to mention, the person in question also had a great fortune. Naturally, he had to find a way to plunder
            it all. </p>
        <div id="pf-9473-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> Gu Changge's idea was actually as simple as always, either to kill or subdue, the one most beneficial to
            him, he would naturally choose. </p>
        <p> And since the system had already given a prompt, it would mean that this fellow transmigrator, without
            knowing, was already at odds with him. </p>
        <p> When the time comes and a transmigrator meets a fellow transmigrator, they would certainly not have tears in
            their eyes. </p>
        <p> If the other party knew that he was also a transmigrator, they would also never allow his existence. </p>
        <p> Then it’d only depend on who possessed more methods. </p>
        <p> Moreover, Gu Changge doesn't know what the other party's golden finger was. </p>
        <p> What if they also have a system? It would certainly be amusing. </p>
        <p> However, in Gu Changge's opinion, the possibility of such wasn’t that big. </p>
        <p> Since his system was able to prompt him, it's evident that his system was superior to the opponent's golden
            finger. </p>
        <p> Therefore, Gu Changge was in no rush. </p>
        <p> The system wasn't necessarily omnipotent. In fact, his reliance on the system wasn’t that big. Only in the
            beginning, did he rely on the Fortune Value and the Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex for his cultivation. </p>
        <p> After that, he just casually adds some points from time to time in order to fool people. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge could, in fact, find replacements for everything in the system shop in the world. </p>
        <p> Only, exchanging things from the system for Destiny Points was simpler and more convenient. </p>
        <p> Now, the most important thing for him right now was that the other party was unaware of his identity as a
            transmigrator. </p>
        <p> In this way, it’s the same as him being in the shadows while the other party was in the light. </p>
        <p> The other party believed herself to be the only transmigrator, but she could never have thought that he was
            a transmigrator as well. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge revealed a smile laced with deeper meaning. </p>
        <p> He planned everything to be under his control. </p>
        <p> Of course, before that, Gu Changge needed a way to find this new Favoured Daughter of Heaven. </p>
        <p> And since the other party was a transmigrator, her temperament and habits would definitely be different from
            the natives of this world. </p>
        <p> It would naturally be pretty easy to find someone as such. </p>
        <p> Not to mention, Gu Changge had a simpler and more intuitive method; Fortune Value! He could tell at a glance
            how much Fortune Value one had. </p>
        <p> As long as the other party comes within his sight, they would definitely not escape his perception. </p>
        <p> Thinking of this, Gu Changge decided to keep an eye on the matter but set it aside for the time being. </p>
        <p> And soon, under the oppression of the Great Elder, the several top powerhouses of the True Dragon Clan were
            swiftly defeated and retreated. </p>
        <p> Under the combined aggressive attack of the Primordial Divine Sect, the Ancient Serpent, the Divine
            Crocodile, and the Black Heavenly Eagle Clans, the protective array of Dragon Island finally dissipated and
            shattered. </p>
        <p> It was a completely one-sided beating, like a broken bamboo stick. </p>
        <p> On the sacred mountain of the island, all the clansmen were wailing, never expecting that their once mighty
            clan would eventually experience a day such as this. </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> In the deepest part of Dragon Island, an Ancestral Artifact floated between heaven and earth, absorbing the
            power from the universe, before morphing into a pitch-black, lifeless void. </p>
        <p> Ripples spread out, each ripple seemingly containing a small world, appearing extremely miraculous. </p>
        <p> However, at the end of the day, the ancestors that had awakened it were depleted of their strength and it
            fell down with a loud thud! </p>
        <p> <b>“Our clan is willing to submit!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Our clan is willing to submit!”</b> </p>
        <p> Faced with all this, the Dragon Clan Elders, no matter how unwilling and unyielding they were, chose to
            submit, not wishing to see any more casualties among their clan. </p>
        <p> The miracle didn't happen, the ancestor they were praying for, didn't come! </p>
        <p> <b>“If you were going to submit, why struggle so much to hang on?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge couldn't help but shake his head slightly, with a bit of regret and pity, but not surprised in
            the slightest. </p>
        <p> The True Dragon Clan's strongest members turned blue with humiliation and trembled, but they dared not say
            more. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge smiled faintly and gave the order for everyone to stop. </p>
        <p> The area was still flooded with blood and bones, and many of the True Dragon clansmen were crying out in
            anguish. </p>
        <p> After all, they brought this disaster on themselves, and there was no one else to blame. </p>
        <p> If it wasn't in the name of righteousness, Gu Changge wouldn't be able to do it so easily. </p>
        <p> Soon, the brutal battle of slaughter that rattled all directions finally came to an end. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge sent his trusted subordinates to start the clean-up, planning to integrate the True Dragon Clan
            in one fell swoop, at that time his status as the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family would come
            into play. </p>
        <p> After all, he never once used the influence and power of the Ancient Immortal Gu family for any of this.
            Instead, relied entirely on his own methods to make the True Dragon Clan submit. </p>
        <p> There was no Daoist Sect that would dare to refute! </p>
        <p> At this time, no one dared to show up and snatch all that he had planned! </p>
        <p> Moreover, from the start to the end, the Ancient Immortal Gu Family never intervened, nor provided Gu
            Changge with a single bit of help. </p>
        <p> This did not touch the final bottom line between the various Daoist Sects at present, no one could say
            otherwise. However, once they dared to make a move against Gu Changge, it was tantamount to provoking the
            Ancient Immortal Gu Family itself, a situation far more frightening than the battle at present. </p>
        <p> Today, the True Dragon Clan suffered heavy casualties, and in the end, they had no choice but to submit to
            Gu Changge, just like the Tiangou Clan! </p>
        <p> The news shocked everyone. </p>
        <p> Whether it was the Daoist Sects or creatures observing from nearby, or all the other Immortal Clans. Right
            now, a huge wave was stirring in their hearts! </p>
        <p> In the end, the True Dragon Clan was unable to escape their fate. </p>
        <p> Many clans began to regret why they hadn't united together with the True Dragon Clan earlier to resist Gu
            Changge, perhaps then the situation would’ve been different. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, it was a useless thought now. </p>
        <p> The three major clans, the Ancient Serpent, the Divine Crocodile and the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan, acted as
            a sharp sword at the critical moment, dealing a fatal blow to the entire Ancient Immortal Continent. </p>
        <p> But on the other hand, it allowed many clans a way out and a chance to survive. </p>
        <p> The news soon began to spread rapidly, causing major earthquakes in all parts of the world. </p>

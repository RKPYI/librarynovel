          identity and status, she knew she had to receive his protection if she
          wanted to live long in this world. Hence, she would often mention how

          otherwise, back in Skyward Schloss.</span

          Thus, with time, many Elders and disciples came to believe that she
          was actually one of Gu Changge&#8217;s people, and thus, many Elders
          would act discreetly towards her and dared not cross her.</span

          everything, and she worried Gu Changge would get upset if he found out
          about it. So she would correct them every time people got the wrong
          idea about her relationship with Gu Changge.</span

          Sometimes she even wanted the entire Upper Realm&#8217;s Forces to

          treasures in such a short time. Furthermore, every single one of these

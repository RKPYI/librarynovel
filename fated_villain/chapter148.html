        <h4>Chapter 148: Growing into an All-Rounder; Ain’t Your Fault You a Beauty!</h4>
        <p> <b>[Puff!]</b> </p>
        <p> Blood splattered, accompanied by a desperate cry. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s sword light pierced through Long Teng’s glabella and a hole appeared on the front and back of
            his head. </p>
        <p> Still, the sword light didn’t dissipate and kept pressing down on Long Teng’s Primordial Spirit. </p>
        <p> A look of panic and despair covered Long Teng’s face and he regretted his actions to the extreme. </p>
        <p> Long Teng had never imagined that even after breaking through a major realm, he wouldn’t be Gu Changge’s
            opponent. </p>
        <p> He was destined for destruction as soon as Gu Changge made a move. </p>
        <p> The gap between the two wasn’t something that could be made up for by raising a realm or two. </p>
        <p> Long Teng’s desperation rose as he thought about this. </p>
        <p> At the same time, a terrifying pain tried to tear apart his Primordial Spirit as the sword light formed by
            the [Infinite Immortal Wisdom] kept attacking it. </p>
        <p> After all…[Infinite Immortal Wisdom] was a supreme Primordial Spirit-attacking art. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s figure appeared in front of Long Teng and his spotless, white robes fluttered in the wind. From
            his appearance, not one person thought of him as someone who just went through a battle. </p>
        <p> As long as one ignored the blood on his hands, they would only see a handsome and elegant man unmatched by
            anyone in the world. </p>
        <p> Right now, even Gu Xian’er shook her head and didn’t know what to think of. </p>
        <p> At the same time, her face turned somewhat crimson as this was exactly what she imagined Gu Changge to look
            like before, a cold and cruel devil. </p>
        <p> [Ding! The Fortune Plundering Card succeeded and net you 4000 points of Fortune Value! </p>
        <p> Long Teng’s Fortune is gone! Triggering the Slaughter and Profit rules for the defeated Favored Son of
            Heaven.] </p>
        <p> Gu Changge squinted his eyes for a moment but soon regained his previous expression. </p>
        <p> It was as he expected: ‘the [Fortune Plundering Card] worked the best when the other party fell into
            despair.’ </p>
        <p> All of Long Teng’s Fortune now belonged to him. </p>
        <p> All that was left was to see whether he could get something good from him after putting him to death. </p>
        <p> The Heavenly Rewards, plus the rewards given by the System, could be regarded as quite a good sum of income
            for him. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge might even have a chance to consider another Transcendent Dao Bone for himself. </p>
        <p> After all, Transcendent Dao Bones were far too overpowered, to the point that just one of them allowed him
            to gave him rudimentary control over the Natural Laws. </p>
        <p> If he could get more of those, then it might be possible for him to gain complete control over Natural Laws,
            or…the Source of Dao, even. </p>
        <p> “<b>Lord Long Teng…”</b> </p>
        <p> “<b>You with the surname of Gu, let our Lord Long Teng go if you are sensible!”</b> </p>
        <p> Many of Long Teng’s followers shouted loudly at this time. </p>
        <p> Their pale faces showed drastic changes in their expressions, and they feared that Gu Changge might
            slaughter Long Teng for real. </p>
        <p> Although all parties agreed upon the fact that no one from the older generation would interfere even if the
            younger generation slaughtered each other to the point of extinction, the one going to die right now was
            none other than their Lord Long Teng! </p>
        <p> How could they sit still at this moment? </p>
        <p> It’s just that they were afraid of Gu Changge, so the young creatures with golden wings or dragon-horns only
            dared to shout at him for demonstration purposes, and dared not approach him. </p>
        <p> They weren’t as retarded and arrogant as Long Teng, who would go to their deaths even when they knew they
            had no chance of survival. </p>
        <p> After all, even Long Teng, who broke through to the True God Realm, wasn’t Gu Changge’s match, so who else
            from the younger generation of the Ancient Immortal Continent could stop him now? </p>
        <p> Gu Changge stared at the bunch of creatures in front of him and an inexplicable light flashed through his
            eyes. </p>
        <p> In the next moment, all of the creatures trembled in fear as their bodies turned cold and their souls shook.
            A single look from Gu Changge was enough to scare them to the point that they dared not move. </p>
        <p> “<b>Master, do you want to slaughter them?”</b> </p>
        <p> Seeing this, a group of Gu Changge’s followers stepped forward and asked him with cold, cruel grins. </p>
        <p> They weren’t afraid of the powerful creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent. After all, even their
            strongest Long Teng was nothing more than a crushed melon in front of Gu Changge, so as his followers, how
            could they fear anything? </p>
        <p> “<b>Slaughter them…”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge commanded with a light tone. </p>
        <p> Killing a little dragon or a group of creatures from the Continent…it was all the same to him. </p>
        <p> “<b>Understood, Master!”</b> </p>
        <p> The group of his followers responded with respect. </p>
        <p> Right after that, a battle broke out on the scene, and soon, all the creatures and cultivators in the
            surroundings started to fight in desperation. </p>
        <p> No one expected that Gu Changge would be so ruthless and decisive, so as to not intend to leave a single one
            from the opposing party leave alive. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong, however, knew that Gu Changge would make this decision as she was familiar with him. </p>
        <p> Whoever dared to offend him would have a bitter end. </p>
        <p> ‘It seems that the old foggy in the dark isn’t dumb; even now, he dares not show up to save Long Teng.’ </p>
        <p> Gu Changge glanced towards the east sky and showed a smile filled with an inexplicable meaning. </p>
        <p> He had long sensed the existence of quite a few ancient monsters from the Ancient Immortal Continent spying
            on them, but he didn’t care about them. </p>
        <p> Whether he decided to slaughter them or not, he didn’t have to worry about anything. ViiSiit
            n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels</p>
        <p> After all, the confrontation between Long Teng and him was a fight between peers, and it was already agreed
            upon by all parties that life and death depended upon ones ability, so if they tried to stop him at this
            time, wouldn’t they be slapping all the forces that agreed to the rules in the face? </p>
        <p> The True Dragon Family of the Ancient Immortal Continent dared not stop him even when they witnessed the
            scene in front of them. </p>
        <p> And soon, Long Teng’s Primordial Spirit perished in Gu Changge’s hands and disappeared into thin air. </p>
        <p> When Ye Langtian, Wang Wushuang, Peng Fei, and the other Young Supremes witnessed the scene in front of
            them, their expressions changed and they shook their heads and sighed with bitter smiles. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s methods were strong and cruel, and he never intended to let Long Teng survive. </p>
        <p> If any of them were put in his place, they estimated that they would think multiple times before doing
            anything. </p>
        <p> However, Gu Changge was the Heir of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace and the Young Master of the Ancient
            Immortal Gu Family, so did the heritages of the Ancient Immortal Continent even dare to move against him
            when he was following the rules? </p>
        <p> If they really dared to overstep their bounds, then the Supreme Heritages and Sects from the outside won’t
            sit by idle. </p>
        <p> After slaughtering Long Teng, Gu Changge threw the dragon corpse — which dead Long Teng transformed into —
            into his Spatial Ring with the intention to not waste such useful resources. </p>
        <p> After all, no one dared to speak up and snatch Long Teng’s body back from his hands. Even if the Master of
            the True Dragon Family appeared right now, Gu Changge still won’t hand it over. </p>
        <p> Everyone in the surroundings looked at the scene with complicated expressions — they were shocked to the
            extreme, and couldn’t calm their hearts for a long time. </p>
        <p> Today’s events could be said to have shook the younger generation inside the Ancient Immortal Continent
            right now, be they aboriginal creatures or those from the outside world. </p>
        <p> They required time to calm down. </p>
        <p> Long Teng, a mighty and confident fellow who looked down on everyone and everything and believed himself to
            be invincible, fell in such a gruesome manner — Gu Changge even took away his corpse. </p>
        <p> But…if they were in his place, they wouldn’t let Long Teng’s corpse go either…after all, it contained a lot
            of Long Teng’s True Dragon blood! </p>
        <p> One could refine it with some medicinal materials and use it to strengthen their physique. </p>
        <p> And if one could get a glimpse of the True Dragon Family’s innate talent, then they would make even more
            profit. </p>
        <p> Many people speculated that Gu Changge was plotting exactly that. </p>
        <p> Right then, the System’s Prompt sounded in Gu Changge’s mind as expected. </p>
        <p> [Ding! You successfully completed the task of slaughtering the Favored Son of Heaven, Long Teng, so the
            rewards are being calculated. </p>
        <p> The Fortune Value of the Favored Son of Heaven was cleared before death, so you triggered the Heavenly
            Rewards and obtained a Heavenly Rewards Chest. </p>
        <p> For the completion of the task, you receive 3000 points of Fortune Value and 15000 Destiny Points!] </p>
        <p> Speaking of which, his gains weren’t small this time. </p>
        <p> He plundered 4000 points of Fortune Value before and now received another 3000 points of Fortune Value, plus
            15000 Destiny Points. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge could do a lot with all these points. </p>
        <p> ‘Open the Heavenly Rewards Chest.’ </p>
        <p> Without further ado, he commanded in his mind. </p>
        <p> Every time he slaughtered a Favored Son of Heaven, he obtained a lot of good things, so he wanted to know
            just what this Long Aotian would drop for him. </p>
        <p> <b>[Hum!]</b> </p>
        <p> Soon, a golden treasure box jumped in front of Gu Changge and released a mysterious aura as mist surged
            around it. </p>
        <p> Then, it opened with a bang. </p>
        <p> Colorful lights rushed out of the chest and a drop of crystal blood with surging aura came out of it,
            reflecting the world’s birth inside it. </p>
        <p> [Ding! Host, congratulations for obtaining the Five-colored True Dragon Blood Essence. </p>
        <p> <b>Introduction: </b>The Five-colored True Dragon Blood Essence is the drop of blood essence found under the
            hardest scale of a True Dragon. It is extremely rare and contains ultimate defense and recovery ability.]
        </p>
        <p> Gu Changge couldn’t help but nod in satisfaction when he saw the introduction. He had regarded Long Teng as
            nothing but an experience-giving monster in a game, so the drop of True Dragon blood brought pleasant
            surprise to him. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge guessed that Long Teng’s sudden breakthrough in the face of danger was related to this
            [Five-colored True Dragon Blood Essence]. </p>
        <p> Soon, Gu Changge consumed the [Five-colored True Dragon Blood Essence]. </p>
        <p> A warm, familiar feeling washed over his limbs and bones as it rejuvenated every cell in his body with vast
            amounts of vitality. </p>
        <p> <b>[Kacha! Kacha!]</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge could hear the sound of his bones and muscles morph, as if they rapidly dissolved and then
            reassembled themselves. At the same time, he felt as if dragon scales started to cover his person. </p>
        <p> ‘My physique is stronger than before, and my defense and vitality…it seems I will have to follow the
            all-rounder development route.’[1] </p>
        <p> [1: there are different types of cultivation such as body cultivation, spirit cultivation, etc. An
            all-rounder is someone who develops his physique as well as spirit. It’s like a mage who’s also good at
            close-combat and assassinations. </p>
        <p> Until now, Gu Changge was only getting rewards from the System that upgraded his Primordial Spirit
            cultivation, but now he’s getting rewards that jack up his physical ability.] </p>
        <p> Gu Changge thought so in his heart but soon abandoned the thought. His strength kept on improving at a rapid
            pace, and all these talents and abilities were merely icing on the cake. </p>
        <p> <b>[Shua!]</b> </p>
        <p> <b>[Shua!]</b>
        </p>
        <p> Soon, all the onlooking creatures and cultivators turned into brilliant rays of light and started to leave
            the scene. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er took one last look at Gu Changge and then left with the big, red bird. </p>
        <p> She decided not to show up and say hello because she still remembered the time when Gu Changge bullied her.
        </p>
        <p> She had planned to see Gu Changge hit an iron plate, but who would have thought that Long Teng would turn
            out to be a dud that couldn’t even take one of Gu Changge’s attacks. </p>
        <p> This annoyed Gu Xian’er, who had wanted to find out the depths of Gu Changge’s strength. </p>
        <p> Soon, the news of what transpired spread in all directions by the cultivators and the creatures who were on
            the scene. </p>
        <p> A lot of people already expected such results from this battle, but the process shocked everyone and they
            couldn’t believe what they saw and heard. </p>
        <p> First, Long Teng didn’t just lose, he died. </p>
        <p> Second, Gu Changge’s strength was verified and now, no one doubted the fact that he had indeed stepped into
            the ranks of Young Sovereigns. </p>
        <p> This, however, was just a conservative estimate. </p>
        <p> Soon after the news spread, it caused a massive sensation throughout the Ancient Immortal Continent; after
            all, not everyone went to watch the battle. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s name once again caused great waves throughout the aboriginal heritages of the Ancient Immortal
            Continent, and they now treated him as a taboo-like existence. </p>
        <p> Hearing about them would make them change their expressions and their hearts would palpitate. </p>
        <p> Many creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent decided to avoid him, after all, even Long Teng, the
            strongest from their younger generation met a brutal end at his hands. </p>
        <p> If they encountered him, would they even have a chance to surve? </p>
        <p> They couldn’t comprehend how they could come across such a terrifying existence among the younger generation
            — his strength was outrageous. </p>
        <p> This brought clouds of gloom above the heads of many from the younger generation of the Ancient Immortal
            Continent. </p>
        <p> Afterwards, Gu Changge’s figure flashed and he appeared right in front of Yue Mingkong’s chariot and looked
            at her, who was sitting inside. </p>
        <p> “<b>Mingkong, the fact that you didn’t come looking for me after entering the Ancient Immortal Continent
                saddened me.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge said with a casual tone, as if planning to discuss this matter with her. </p>
        <p> There wasn’t any trace of sadness on his face, however. </p>
        <p> “<b>We pay our respects to Young Master Changge.”</b> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong’s followers immediately paid their respects. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge waved his hands in dismissal. </p>
        <p> The followers knew the identity of the two, and the relationship between them, so they soon left the place
            to the two of them. </p>
        <p> “<b>What are you sad about? Shouldn’t you be happy over the fact that I am not trying to hinder you?”</b>
        </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong, who witnessed the entire battle from beginning to end, couldn’t help but raise her wariness
            and think that Gu Changge was going to do something to her. </p>
        <p> She believed that Gu Changge was now going to settle the account with her. </p>
        <p> Her expression, however, didn’t show anything unusual as she had dealt with Gu Changge many times before, so
            she was quite familiar with him. </p>
        <p> Her ‘dear husbands’ ability to enrage her was top-tier both at home and outside. </p>
        <p> “<b>Why do I feel you are somewhat nervous?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge seemed to see through her thoughts at once even though there was a curtain between Yue Mingkong
            and him, and she looked at him from behind it. </p>
        <p> At that moment, Yue Mingkong decided to calm down as she knew that it was impossible for her to hide such
            thoughts from someone as shrewd as Gu Changge, and replied, <b>“It’s because I have a guilty
                conscience.”</b> </p>
        <p> “<b>Why would you have a guilty conscience?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge couldn’t help but laugh out loud. </p>
        <p> “<b>Because I am guilty — I am afraid you are going to settle accounts with me.”</b> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong said with a cold and annoyed tone, and at the same time, she rolled her eyes at him. </p>
        <p> She couldn’t understand why Gu Changge was still pretending not to understand, but from his attitude, it was
            clear that Gu Changge didn’t care about this matter, right? </p>
        <p> For some reason, she felt relieved. </p>
        <p> “<b>What’s the matter? It’s not your fault that you are so gorgeous, after all.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge shook his head with an expression of ‘you think too much’ and said with a tone that made it seem
            as if he was stating mere facts. </p>
        <p> Beauties would be coveted, that was the truth of the world. </p>
        <p> It’s a pity that Long Teng decided to target the wrong person. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong couldn’t help but freeze when she heard his words, and then blinked in disbelief. </p>
        <p> She wondered if she had heard wrong? </p>
        <p> <b>Was Gu Changge</b><b>praising her for her beauty?!</b> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong couldn’t help but feel a little joy in her heart as it wasn’t easy to hear such words from Gu
            Changge’s mouth. </p>

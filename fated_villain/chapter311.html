          senses like Gu Changge and the other Ranked Disciples. Likewise, they
          did not possess their strength. Thus, the effects of the Yin Energy

          black as ink, eyes as deep as the seas, with whole body radiating an
          otherworldly glow, he seemed like an Immortal God surrounded by
          colourful heavenly light. Around him was the swirling energy of the
          Great Dao, intertwined with World Principles, making him seem like he

          couldn&#8217;t help but wonder just how terrible a fight he had had to
          go through for such an otherworldly, almost-perfect man without a

          Changge from her memories had always been strong, confident, without
          flaw, and unperturbed. He had always looked as though he could easily
          handle everything, even if the sky were to fall. In fact, Gu

          been hit hard by the Successor of Demonic Arts and hurt his Source in
          order to rescue Yin Mei. Coincidentally, his injuries today were
          because of the Successor of Demonic Arts as well. On top of that, he
          was more gravely injured this time than in the past. Even from this
          distance, she could see how pale his face was and the rapid
          dissipation of his life force. She could clearly see that something
          was devastatingly wrong with him now. With his extremely weak vitality
          and lack of blood, he was entirely holding on with the help of his
          Forbidden Technique.</span

          thought of killing the Successor of Demonic Arts. [So, he can get

          before it morphed into a dragon and formed into a Golden Decree. When

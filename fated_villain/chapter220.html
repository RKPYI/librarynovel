      <h4>Chapter 220-1: The Peach Heart is burning, Finally found it (1)</h4>
      <p>In the blink of an eye, one month had passed.</p>
      <p>
        From the Xuan Domain, to several major Domains outside the Hong Domain
        where Yue Mingkong was, all of them were searched by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, with the exclusion method, those cultivators who were
        older than thirty years old did not need to be considered, which also
        saved him a lot of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this process, Gu Changge did find a few cultivators with quite high
        Luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although they were not related to the Son of Luck, they were barely
        considered to be people with Great Luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        At his command, the Tai Xu Sect's reputation grew more and more, and the
        widespread acceptance of disciples even spread to the rest of the
        Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        So much so that a version that the Immortal from the Upper Realm wanted
        to accept disciples to take back to the Upper Realm, attracting
        countless geniuses to rush here, so much so that even some old guys had
        shown up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge also did not bother to correct anything, and did not even
        show up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more this kind of thing was described, the more confusing he would
        become and the more difficult it would be for people to see his true
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>After all, it took a bait to catch a fish.</p>
      <p>
        In this way, there were rumors that the Immortal was aloof and
        indifferent, and those who could enter his eyes must be gifted and proud
        of the past and present.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, Gu Changge directly moved, and chose to go to the farthest
        Domain from the Xuan Domain, the Heavenly Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was, in his opinion, the most central area of the map of the Lower
        Realm, where the Dragon Veins converged.
      </p>
      <p>
        He would not be surprised to find the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor in the rest of the Domains, but felt that the greatest
        possibility would be in the Heavenly Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of search method was slow but victory was meticulous, there
        would not be any big mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, he was also paying close attention to the whereabouts
        of Yue Mingkong, knowing that she was actually as clueless as he was
        about the news of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor .
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, she stirred up some trouble and was nearly detected by
        some powers who doubted her origin to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, it was Gu Changge who stepped in and helped her to remove
        these traps.
      </p>
      <p>All these things made Gu Changge sigh secretly.</p>
      <p>
        This foolish fellow, Yue Mingkong, really thought her foresight was
        invincible?
      </p>
      <p>
        If he didn't follow, with her little means she wouldn't even find where
        the reincarnation of Human Ancestor was, so how could she deal with
        others?
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, she would place herself in a very dangerous situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt that after returning to the Upper Realm, he had to let
        Yue Mingkong understand one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was anything, she must consult with him as a husband first, and
        act only after he agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, midway through several twists and turns, through quite a few
        transmission formations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere in the Heavenly Domain of the Heavenly Star Realm, Gu
        Changge's figure appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was still alone, not intending to bring a large group of people
        around him, who were not even as useful in the Heavenly Star Realm as a
        Great Sacred Realm puppet that he had taken out with his hands.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, the void distorted for a moment.</p>
      <p>
        A puppet with a tall, waxy face that looked no different from an
        ordinary person appeared beside Gu Changge and respectfully shouted,
        "Master."
      </p>
      <p>"Acting as a slave or something, it's completely sufficient."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded slightly, with a servant of the Great Sacred Realm,
        all the cultivators and creatures in the entire Heavenly Star Realm
        would be scared silly if they saw that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the master and a servant left this place and headed for the more
        populated areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Domain was different from the rest of the Domains, the overall
        cultivation realm here was much higher, the rest of the Domains mostly
        had cultivators in the Sacred Realm, Heavenly Domain could only act as a
        first-class, while others were second-class forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not long after arriving at the Heavenly Domain, and was about to
        find a place to settle down.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge suddenly heard the prompt sound from the system again.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, you triggered the quest of finding hints about the Reincarnation
        of the Son of luck."
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"Do you want to accept it?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's expression was a bit peculiar as he nodded, "Accept."</p>
      <p>
        It seemed that as his own Luck points increased, the range of the
        system’s sensing the Sons of Luck would also expand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course the more likely reason was that the place where Gu Changge was
        now, and the characters of this quest were not very far.
      </p>
      <p>And as Gu Changge choose to accept the prompt.</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>The scene in front of him became blurred.</p>
      <p>
        A colorful and splendid peach tree opened up in the middle of the
        chaotic ocean, and a thick, mountain-like divine thunder struck down,
        shaking the heavens and earth with a terrifying sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, this divine thunder became a vast and continuous scene like
        a galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each ray of lightning seemed to split the world itself, causing the
        entire universe to break apart, terrifying to the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this peach tree, after facing the divine lightning, was sinking as
        if to undergo a transformation.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the picture shifted.</p>
      <p>
        The scene here disappeared, the peach tree was scorched and torn, as if
        it had lost its vitality and fell down from the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        And there was a cloud of hooded light wrapped in the middle of it,
        falling down to a vast unknown place.
      </p>
      <p>"Baby girl?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge saw clearly, that cloud of hooded light, clearly wrapped in a
        small baby girl.
      </p>
      <p>This made him frown.</p>
      <p>
        The moment he saw this peach tree, he first thought that it was that
        peach tree in the Peach Village where Gu Xian'er was at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, according to the template of taking care of Xian'er, that
        peach tree must have had an extraordinary origin, perhaps it was the
        ancestral sacrificial spirit of the oldest era as well.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge had never doubted this point.</p>
      <p>
        And now, seeing this image, especially seeing that mysterious baby girl,
        made Gu Changge couldn't help but associate it with the rest of the
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reincarnation of the Son of Luck, that was obviously said to be the
        reincarnation of the Human Ancestor .
      </p>
      <p>
        In that case, this mysterious baby girl, and the Human Ancestor, the Son
        of Luck were related?
      </p>
      <p>Soon, Gu Changge had a vague guess in his mind.</p>
      <p>"Of course, it still has to be determined."</p>
      <p>He smiled, and his expression looked a little deeper.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Taking the puppet with him, his figure crossed this area and headed for
        the nearby ancient city.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, under his eyes, the many movements of this terrain
        were manifested.
      </p>
      <p>In this way, Gu Changge could also narrow down his scope.</p>
      <p>
        Since the system prompted this image, the mysterious baby girl should be
        in this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it was related to the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, judging
        from her age, she should not be very big.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>"Granny, brother didn't come back today, it's been a year."</p>
      <p>"Do you think he forgot about Yaoyao?"</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

        </script>
      </div>
      <p>In the middle of a remote village called North Mountain Village.</p>
      <p>
        A little girl with a goat-horn braid and a face smeared with mud was
        looking at the village head and asked the old woman with a stooped
        figure and silver hair next to her.
      </p>
      <p>The little girl's clothes were very old.</p>
      <p>
        Many places were still patched, but it was very clean, her eyes were
        black and white, like the most flawless and purest of gems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her face was deliberately smeared with mud, looking at her appearance
        she should only be four or five years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        But people in the village who were familiar with the little girl knew
        that her real age was more than four or five years old.
      </p>
      <p>The little girl was very understanding, but also very poor.</p>
      <p>
        She had a strange disease. Over the years, she had not grown at all, and
        her appearance had always been only four or five years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How is that possible? Even if your brother forgets everyone, he can't
        forget Yaoyao!"
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao, don't worry!"</p>
      <p>
        "Brother was just taken away by the cultivator, and he will come back
        soon after learning. At that time, he will also be a cultivator who can
        fly in the sky, so he can take you everywhere and eat a lot like candied
        fruit, okay. Things to eat……"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing the words, the old woman showed a kind smile and said to the
        little girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, I’ll listen to grandma, then I'll wait in the village for my
        brother to come back."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wait for him to take me to fly like a cultivator and eat delicious
        food."
      </p>
      <p>
        The little girl named Yaoyao nodded her head wisely, but she couldn't
        help but glance at the entrance of the village again, showing a look of
        longing.
      </p>
      <p>
        For so many years, it was her brother who took care of her sick grandma
        and her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that his brother had been favored by strong cultivators and taken to
        practice for more than a year, but no news had come back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she looked young, she actually understood everything in her
        heart. Every time she came to the village to take a look, apart from
        missing him, what did she have to worry about?
      </p>
      <p>
        The outside world was very dangerous. Although her brother was taken
        away by a strong cultivator, he was not necessarily safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had heard a lot of stories about the cultivation world since she was
        a child.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, don't worry about your brother, the cultivator said, he was
        from Immortal Lun Sect."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And your brother's physique is very powerful in the cultivation world.
        At that time, he will be vigorously cultivated by the sect. Now he
        should be busy with cultivation, so he has no time to come back to see
        us."
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing that the little girl still had the same expression, the
        silver-haired old woman couldn't help but smile and comforted her.
      </p>
      <p>She found the baby girl under a blooming peach tree that year.</p>
      <p>
        At that time, she was shrouded in a layer of light, which looked very
        extraordinary.
      </p>
      <p>But it was more like being thrown there.</p>
      <p>
        The scene at that time was very suitable for these words, so she adopted
        him and named her Yaoyao. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>
        It took so many years to raise her, but Yaoyao stayed at the age of four
        or five, and never grew up.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made the silver-haired old woman helpless. She tried many methods,
        but none of them had the slightest effect.
      </p>
      <p>As if God made a joke for this little girl.</p>
      <p>Yaoyao was also very sensible and never made her worry.</p>
      <p>Another child she adopted was also doing well.</p>
      <p>
        One year ago, he was valued by the cultivators from the Immortal Lun
        Sect who passed by here, and took him with them to cultivate, saying
        that he had a promising future.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, the old woman's smile deepened.</p>
      <p>Tremblingly, she led the little girl to the house.</p>
      <p>
        North Mountain Village was in a remote location, and it was backed by
        the mountains to the north. From time to time, monsters would come out
        and run into the village to cause trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the south was a desert, where bandits could often be seen running
        around, looting the meat and some spiritual stones of the villages.
      </p>
      <p>The villages were deeply affected and miserable.</p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, the old woman wouldn't smear some dirt on Yaoyao's face,
        because she was afraid that the deranged bandits would notice her.
      </p>
      <p>
        The little girl Yaoyao followed her grandmother and greeted
        acquaintances in the village along the way, while walking towards the
        house.
      </p>
      <p>
        The villagers liked Yaoyao, a well-behaved and obedient little girl.
      </p>
      <h4>Chapter 220-2: The Peach Heart is burning, Finally found it (1)</h4>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        However, at this moment, the sound of horses' hooves suddenly sounded
        outside the village, like a galloping army of thousands of horses.
      </p>
      <p>The momentum was shocking and extremely frightening.</p>
      <p>
        From a distance, one could see a terrifying aura rising up in the sky,
        which was extremely terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, it's bandits! The bandits are rushing towards the village. Female,
        children and the elderly, hurry back to the house and don't show up."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Damn it! Didn't we just give them the spirit stones? These bandits are
        here again?"
      </p>
      <p>"These renegade robbers! Everyone take up arms!"</p>
      <p>This scene shocked everyone in North Mountain Village.</p>
      <p>They responded quickly.</p>
      <p>
        Everyone's complexion changed greatly, they were extremely pale, and
        they shouted, asking the elderly and other weaker people to hurry back
        to the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young and middle-aged people and some people who had a little
        cultivation picked up weapons and converged at the entrance of the
        village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bandits looting villages, this kind of thing was normal, and one
        couldn’t expect them to talk about friendship and credit.
      </p>
      <p>"Grandma, the bandits are here again…"</p>
      <p>The expression on Yaoyao's face also turned a little scared.</p>
      <p>Bandits were notorious for killing people without blinking an eye.</p>
      <p>"Don't be afraid, Yaoyao, grandma is here."</p>
      <p>
        At this time, the silver-haired old woman was much calmer, holding
        Yaoyao's hand tightly and comfortingly said.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there was still a hint of worry in her eyes. After all, judging
        from the momentum, this group of bandits seemed to be different from the
        previous ones.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>Accompanied by the yellow sand in the sky.</p>
      <p>
        At the entrance of North Mountain Village, there was a large group of
        bandits riding fierce beasts, covering a large area, and they were
        rushing here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bandits sitting on the beasts were all very agile, with amazing
        murderous aura, flashing divine brilliance, and grim faces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aura was powerful and amazing, far exceeding that of ordinary people
        and cultivators. It was impossible for ordinary bandits to have this
        kind of momentum.
      </p>
      <p>"This… how is this possible…"</p>
      <p>"This is… the Black Wind Bandit!"</p>
      <p>
        "Black Wind… Bandit, this is the most powerful bandit in the vicinity,
        and many forces who came to crusade against them were killed by them!"
      </p>
      <p>"It is said that their head is an almighty god!"</p>
      <p>
        "How come, how can the black wind bandits come to our village, this is
        completely impossible!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing the identity of these bandits, all the villagers in North
        Mountain Village were stunned, and their faces turned pale with fright.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people were even more unbearable, and their feet went soft and fell
        to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        A group of villagers who were still holding weapons and were about to
        confront this group of bandits had no courage at this time, and they
        were almost stunned.
      </p>
      <p>This monstrous aura alone will drown them and suffocate them.</p>
      <p>
        Some people were timid, rolled their eyes, couldn't bear the
        fluctuation, and fainted directly to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Black Wind Bandit, why did you come here… Although it's just a group of
        people, how could it be something that ordinary villages can resist…"
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression of the silver-haired old woman also changed slightly, a
        little she couldn’t believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Grandma, they all said that the head of the Black Wind Bandit wants to
        eat people, and he likes to eat children the most…" Yaoyao's big eyes
        showed fear.
      </p>
      <p>After all, she was just a little girl.</p>
      <p>
        Although she was more sensible than his peers, how could she not be
        afraid in front of this black wind bandit who killed people like insects
        and even took pleasure in eating people?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't be afraid, Yaoyao, those are all rumors that are made up by
        adults to deceive you. With Grandma there, no one will hurt you."
      </p>
      <p>
        The silver-haired old woman gritted her teeth slightly, and protected
        Yaoyao behind her to prevent the group of black wind bandits in the
        distance from seeing her.

      <p>
        She didn't know why, but a powerful bandit like the Black Wind Bandit
        would send a team to a remote village like them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the vicinity, apart from North Mountain Village, there were still
        Black Stone Village, Wolf Village and other villages. Could it be that
        those villages had also been looted?
      </p>
      <p>What was there to care about in North Mountain Village?</p>
      <p>
        Just as the silver-haired old woman had all kinds of thoughts in her
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the door of the village, a bandit with a strong aura opened his
        mouth, his face was horrific, and there was a scar running through it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivation base alone had reached the holy land realm, which was
        enough to sweep around at will and do whatever you want!
      </p>
      <p>"Get the chief of your village out!"</p>
      <p>He said indifferently, with an ant-like look overlooking them.</p>
      <p>
        The many bandits behind him also looked indifferent, sitting on top of
        the beast, as if they would slaughter the village if they didn't
        cooperate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The villagers of North Mountain Village had never seen such a terrifying
        posture, their faces were pale and bloodless, and they could not speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Little old man is the village head of North Mountain Village,
        greeting!"
      </p>
      <p>Accompanied by a panic.</p>
      <p>
        A trembling old man came out and said with a terrified expression on his
        face.
      </p>
      <p>It was the mayor of North Mountain Village.</p>
      <p>
        When he was young, he practiced outside, but his foundation was damaged,
        so he returned to the village and served as the villager.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, he also instructed the villagers to polish their muscles and
        bones and strengthen their bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in front of such a fierce black wind bandit, they were the same as
        paper, and there was not much difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, so it’s a cultivator, but it can't even reach the Soul Palace, so
        what's the use of it?"
      </p>
      <p>The leading bandit glanced at him and sneered.</p>
      <p>
        The old village chief's face turned pale, and he did not dare to
        retaliate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, the bandit saw awe, worry, fear, and panic among all the
        villagers.
      </p>
      <p>
        He swept over everyone coldly, and said slowly, "Our boss has an order.
        In the nearby villages, all girls under the age of fifteen must submit
        offerings! He wants them all!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Three days later, I will bring someone to fetch them. If anyone dares
        to run away or resist, then we will… slaughter the village! Not a single
        one will be left!"
      </p>
      <p>A wicked crack appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p>
      <p>
        Saying such words, combined with this appearance, had a terrifying
        deterrent.
      </p>
      <p>Ahh!</p>
      <p>At this moment, many children were frightened and cried.</p>
      <p>
        Not to mention children, at this time, even the adults looked extremely
        frightened.
      </p>
      <p>Some people held their children tightly in despair.</p>
      <p>Against the black wind bandits resistance was a dead end?</p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Do they have to hand over their children at this time? Why would they
          want to?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the reputation of the black wind bandits had not been good
        these years, they had never seen them arresting children! And also
        called for girls under the age of fifteen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made many people despair, thinking of the rumors that the black
        wind bandit’s boss wanted to eat people!
      </p>
      <p>
        After saying this, the black wind bandits in front of them also left in
        a mighty manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the sky-high yellow dust, they rushed to the rest of the villages
        with great momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving behind a group of desperate and terrified North Mountain
        Villagers.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why? Black Wind Bandits deserve to die, why must they steal our
        children!"
      </p>
      <p>"Even if I die, I can't give it to them!"</p>
      <p>
        Soon, the place resounded with bursts of sobs, and the sound of angry
        hisses of resignation.
      </p>
      <p>Many villagers were yelling.</p>
      <p>
        The old village headman's face was desperate and he fell to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention the Black Wind Bandits, even the ordinary bandits, who
        were much weaker than them, were not something they could fight against
        with their small village.

      <p>What did it mean to disobey the Black Wind Bandits' orders?</p>
      <p>It meant slaughtering the village, leaving no one behind!</p>
      <p>Escape? Relocate?</p>
      <p>
        In three days' time, how could a group of ordinary people outrun the
        Black Wind Bandits on their ferocious beasts?
      </p>
      <p>"Grandma, I'm afraid……"</p>
      <p>
        In the middle of the northern mountain village, naturally, Yaoyao also
        heard the words of this leader of the black wind bandits, stained with
        mud on her small white face.
      </p>
      <p>Less than fifteen years old girls, did not this also include her?</p>
      <p>
        She remembered the rumor that the leader of the Black Wind Bandits would
        eat people, and bit her lips tightly in fear.
      </p>
      <p>"I don't want to be eaten."</p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, don't be afraid, with granny around, no one can snatch you
        away!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Silver-haired crone’s voice slightly trembled in the middle, hugging her
        tightly.
      </p>
      <p>Her tone was determined, as if there was some great bottom line.</p>
      <p>
        And just when the black wind bandits appeared in the nearby major
        villages, asking them to give a confession.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the place where the Black Wind Bandits were stationed, on a dark and
        awe-inspiring mountain peak.
      </p>
      <p>A lofty palace stood.</p>
      <p>
        In it, the current Black Wind Bandits' leader was bending down and
        pointing at the unconscious maidens captured below, and reported to the
        young man above with his hands behind his back and said, "Your honor,
        these maidens were all captured from the nearby villages and cities
        according to your orders." UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
      </p>
      <p>"Are you satisfied?"</p>
      <p>"All of them are useless, do not hurt them, and let them go back."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the young man whose back was turned to the Black Wind
        Bandits' leader, did not answer, but shook his head slightly and said.
      </p>
      <p>There was an inexplicable meaning in his tone.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the black wind bandits’s leader was a little puzzled, he
        went through so much trouble, and now he had to send them back?
      </p>
      <p><i>Is he looking for someone?</i></p>
      <p>
        But he also did not dare to ask the reason, and hurriedly said, "My
        lord, please rest assured, we will not hurt their lives."
      </p>
      <p>
        After saying that, he hurriedly took a group of young girls below and
        left, not daring to stay any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some time ago, this mysterious and incomparable young man came to the
        place where he was practicing out of nowhere and asked him to do
        something for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time he was in shock, had not reacted and saw this young man
        beside, the indifferent servant in the middle looked over.
      </p>
      <p>And the mighty pressure of Great Sacred Realm crushed down!</p>
      <p>
        At that time, he was scared silly, he got scared out of his wits, and
        his Dao heart almost shattered.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the outside world, the current rumor that he wanted to eat people,
        the black wind bandit leader also felt helplessness and bitterness.
      </p>
      <p>He could not deny this rumor</p>
      <p><i>Who told this young lord to command such a thing?</i></p>
      <p>
        And now, in the whole Black Wind Bandits, except him, no one knew the
        existence of this young lord.
      </p>
      <p>"Could it be that my location speculation is wrong?"</p>
      <p>
        And in the middle of the main hall, after seeing the Black Wind Bandit’s
        leader leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only then did Gu Changge frown and ponder in his mind if there was
        something wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had narrowed down to such a small range? But he still haven't found
        the baby girl, that's not right.
      </p>
      <p>"Instead, I should wait a bit."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge closed his eyes and fell into deep thought.</p>
      <p>
        These days, the young girls captured by the Black Wind Bandits did not
        have the slightest points of luck, nor was there anything out of the
        ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>But he believed in his deduction.</p>
      <p>And soon, three days passed.</p>
      <p>
        A piece of news made Gu Changge interested, a small team sent by the
        Black Wind Bandits was surprisingly wiped out.
      </p>
      <p>"It seems that I have finally found it."</p>
      <p>
        Almost instantly, Gu Changge thought of it, and he couldn't help but
        have a smile on his face.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky crumbled to reveal an absolutely terrifying rift that seemed to lead toward an eternal unknown land, which contained great worldly willpower.</span><span id="more-34797"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the icily bloodshot eyes stood on the edge of the world like a giant as it swept its gaze across the ruins of Shu Sect with indifference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is that?&#8221; The souls of everyone present shuddered as they involuntarily bowed down to the ginormous eyes under its stare. Everyone felt incredibly terrified. They felt completely bare and exposed in front of this stare.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the likes of the Shu Sect Master and the Snow Sword Immortal couldn&#8217;t help shuddering in fear as they were certain those eyes belonged to what was documented in the ancient altar— the World&#8217;s Will, and also the ultimate trump card for the Profound Sword World to defeat the Otherworldly Sky Demon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Such power… How terrifying. Even an Earth Sword Immortal would be powerless like an ant before it… Is this the Profound Sword World&#8217;s last hope? With this kind of power, defeating the Otherworldly Sky Demons will certainly not be a problem. Looks like heaven is on our side!&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal, also known as the Shu Sect Master, said with visible jubilation as he gazed upon the massive bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His hands, which were hidden within his sleeves, were shaking. He felt as though everything had been hopeless up till this point, believing the World&#8217;s Will to be a mere legend. But now, the being was standing right before his eyes. Certainly, no one would be able to withstand its vast, majestic strength and power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Earth Sword Immortal, he was already one of the most powerful beings in the Profound Sword World. However, he remained immobile and frozen stiff under the bloody eyes&#8217; watchful gaze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such difference was certainly tantamount to an ant standing before a True Dragon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew the legends were real! The World&#8217;s Will will appear at times most difficult…&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal squealed with excitement as she clenched her sleeves. She always believed what the hexagram in the ancient altar said was true, that there would still be hope in devastating times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What in the world is that?&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was originally already on the verge of bursting into bits. But suddenly, an indiscernible Will from above was seeping into his body, heart, and soul. Even his dried-up dantain, from having burned his life away, was also gradually filled up as a stream of ancient and mystical energy surged within it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He widened his eyes with slight incredulity. His body was suddenly beyond his control and filled with terrifying power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, a voice rang in his head, telling him to leave at once.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Who are you!?] Tuo Ba Xiao Yao bellowed in his head as his limbs began numbing. However, the ancient and flat but incredibly magnificent voice only continued to tell him to leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can it be you? Are those your eyes…?] Tuo Ba Xiao Yao suppressed his shock and looked toward the bloody eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, countless people grew fearful, especially those of the Upper Realm. The sensation was even more intense for them, and their movements were nearly beyond their control.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their souls froze under the bloody eyes&#8217; stare, making them immobile as the brilliant other worldly power swept its gaze across the land below like heaven overlooking and determining the fate of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, many Earth Sword Immortals looked up with shock and shuddered ceaselessly as they glanced at the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the unsuspecting cultivators, the bloody eye&#8217;s deterrence was far more intimidating than the Otherworldly Sky Demons, and it was a kind of suppression brought by the difference in the level of existence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, divine rainbows flew across the Thirteen States one after another toward the Shu Sect as they transformed into terrifying silhouettes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had sensed the turbulence coming from the area earlier, but they were clueless about what had happened. Now, they couldn&#8217;t care less about the consequences anymore and wanted to uncover the truth for themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the cultivators of various Upper Realm Forces gathered in the ancient battleships floating in the sky far away. Even several True Daoists were there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their bodies were shrouded in Chaos Mist, while their eyes were as sharp as blades and could seem to see through everything. And right then, the scene at the Shu Sect had their brows locked into a tight furrow as they said, &#8220;This power. It is likely stirred by this World&#8217;s Will…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None dared to descend to the land with their true body, for they feared the World&#8217;s Will. They were worried they would die here accidentally, and the manifestation of the World&#8217;s Will they sensed this time left them gravely dismayed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like this has to do with Gu Changge. Other than him, no one in the Profound Sword World can stir World&#8217;s Will right now… I wonder how he will resolve this.&#8221; commented an Imperial Ancestor of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, who was standing next to Yu Feiya and the others, who were all overlooking the events at Shu Sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though they were unable to personally descend, all that had happened across the Thirteen States of the Profound Sword World hadn&#8217;t gone unnoticed by them. To the many True Daoists, seizing the Profound Sword World wasn&#8217;t as important as finding its World Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, the bloody eyes shifted and concealed the sky right above the Shu Sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, the air cracked bit by bit, releasing boundless and profound darkness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Die!] It announced resoundingly while gazing impassively at Gu Changge, seemingly wanting to prosecute the defiant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a thick haze burst out, and the Principles surrounding the eyes intertwined while zillions of divine light burst brilliantly, heading straight for Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Only parts of the World’s Will and not the whole, huh? Looks like it&#8217;s just as I have guessed. Wonder if I can find the hiding place of the real World&#8217;s Will through this manifestation,] Gu Changge mused, then flashed away, causing the ground beneath his feet to crumble as it dispersed the shockwave with difficulty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World&#8217;s Will of this land had been partially awakened. The power of his attack exceeded the limit this world could bear, and thus, it attacked him, the defiant. However, such power was still unable to harm him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, there was something else in Gu Changge&#8217;s mind at this time, as he was unconcerned with this powerful being. [Let me make use of you to locate where you truly slumber. In turn, lead me to the World Source. Once I get what I want, I can leave your world and return to the Upper Realm to continue with my original plan.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* The next moment, Gu Changge raised his hand, and countless runes coursed through his palms, burning ablaze like a sea of runes as he blocked the attack under everyone&#8217;s horrified gazes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaotic divine light exploded with a rumble, wanting to tear the eyes apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an unimaginably terrifying turbulence. It was so horrific that every single sliver of the exploding ray of light was enough to obliterate everything, and the already destroyed Shu Sect disintegrated further following the attack. Countless shattered like ceramic and turned to dust as soon as the wind blew.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the bloody eyes reacted impassively to the scene. It felt no sadness toward the living beings born in this very place, as if they were nothing but vermins to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene left the Abdunance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and the others in incredulity, questioning if that thing was truly the World’s Will that they had always been placing their hopes on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge charged towards the bloody eyes as his palm glowed while various artifacts came out, with Nirvana Realm Principles interweaved in them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bloody eyes, on the other hand, released ceaseless red rays of light, divine Principles, and Dao sounds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, many Earth Sword Immortals who had come rushing dropped to their knees while their expressions turned awful. They couldn&#8217;t even withstand its godly powers, much less fight it when every single piece of their bones was rattling and on the verge of exploding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, the world was concealed in light as Principles spread everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Die! Die, die, die…] Reiterated one ginormous bloody eye as it stood upright, illuminating the world with absolute indifference. But it still tore apart from the middle in the end. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Gu Changge&#8217;s physical body was beyond terrifying. As the void crumbled and vanished, the large intangible palm landed on the bloody eye, shattering it into bits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene frightened everyone of the Profound Sword World, and the Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and many other Earth Sword Immortals shuddered in fear. They were surprised that not even the World’s Will could defeat Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Gu Changge remained unruffled as his brows continued to furrow after he tore the eyes apart. &#8220;Something&#8217;s not right…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could tell the power of this World’s Will was mediocre. If anything, it was only at the level of an Intermediate True Daoist, far different from the power of a True Immortal, which he estimated it should have.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gone, huh?&#8221; Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t help quirking a brow when he suddenly shifted his gaze towards where Tuo Ba Xiao Yao lay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was surprised to find the man had disappeared. He had wanted to kill Tuo Ba Xiao Yao right after obtaining the Sword of World Domination, but who&#8217;d have thought the man could still run away?!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Gu Changge had a feeling Tuo Ba Xiao Yao didn&#8217;t disappear on his own, as given the latter&#8217;s powers, it was impossible for him to disappear into thin air without alerting him.</span></p>

          caused shockwaves across the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. The
          Black Tortoise War God Clan, Lu Clan, and the Nine-headed Golden Bird

          including blood rain and mourning, which stretched for millions of
          kilometres. These occurrences were caused by the deaths of True
          Daoists who were closely linked to the Fortuity of their respective
          clans.

          to their knees with tear-streaked yet angry or vengeful faces. These
          were members who were the core of each clan; one of them dying would
          be an unimaginable loss. Their mysterious deaths were unexpected since
          they had basically reached the peak of cultivation.</span

          they had eventually followed Gu Changge into the depths of the
          universe. However, Gu Changge had emerged with serious injuries while
          the three of them managed to escape. Many thought they had gone back
          to the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains early because their injuries
          were too grievous, so the sudden news of their deaths was
          unbelievable.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t possibly kill the three of them
          judging by their respective strength, there was only one
          possibility—they had been ambushed by experts from the Upper Realm
          while returning and couldn&#8217;t fight back.

          easily kill a True Daoist, especially when the other party was
          seriously wounded.

          Wastelands and Ten Domains, further fueling their hatred for the Upper
          Realm. Besides, their knowledge of the path through the Aether Abyss
          showed that the other side had put in plenty of possible schemes in
          store, which worried many.</span

          atmosphere, past the sea of clouds like they had torn the universe
          apart. Many clans began to gather in the Eight Domains to chant
          ancient sutras.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >Thus, ancient beings began to appear. They had been sealed away since
          the existence of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. Their Life
          Forces were weak and sputtering at first before eventually awakening.
          Once awake, their auras surged and caused the surrounding countless
          stars in a sight to react, which shocked the whole universe.</span

          awaken their True Blood inside their bodies, attempting to request the
          Souls of their Ancestors to manifest and protect them. The Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains were now on the brink of war, with ancient
          battleships flying across the sky. They gathered and headed to Sky
          Deer City.</span

          >It was raining lightly outside the grand yet ancient pavilion, where
          Lin Wu sat opposite a woman in a white dress. His expression was
          filled with helplessness and bitterness. Numerous young men and women
          who looked like the woman&#8217;s followers stood behind her in
          shimmering clothes, whom she dismissed with a wave of her hand. She
          and Lin Wu were then alone in the room.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If your claims are right, my Master may really be in
          trouble.&#8221; The woman looked beautiful and had an ethereal aura,
          while her expression was filled with pain and confusion.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her name was Song Chan, the new generation’s Sky Deer Goddess. Lin Wu
          had seen her when meeting with the Sky Deer Goddess in Sky Deer CIty.
          She had stood quietly behind the Sky Deer Goddess like a servant, but
          with the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;s disappearance, she became the
          undisputed new Sky Deer Goddess. No one else in the Eight Wastelands
          and Ten Domains knew of the previous Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;s
          disappearance, plus Song Chan didn&#8217;t dare say anything for fear
          of causing an unnecessary upheaval.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I should&#8217;ve told you about it earlier…&#8221; Lin Wu
          sighed, feeling several emotions at once. If it hadn&#8217;t been to
          save Lu Luo, he wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to shoulder the blame or
          betray the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, nor did he want to
          manipulate Song Chan. However, he had no other choice since the time
          Gu Changge had given him was running out.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When fighting between the young generation took place back at the
          Hunting Ground in the Aether Abyss, his opponent had said something
          strange. It had stunned him before he understood that Gu Changge had
          ordered the other man to give him a message. That had sent chills all
          over his body since he could feel himself being manipulated by Gu
          Changge with nothing escaping the other man&#8217;s attention.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He had felt so desperate that he wanted to end it all, but he
          voluntarily made contact with Song Chan for the sake of Lu Luo and the
          others still imprisoned by Gu Changge. After they had become more
          acquainted, he finally informed her about what had happened on the
          shore of the Border Marker Sea, including how the Sky Deer Goddess had
          lost, been tricked by Gu Changge, and eventually taken prisoner in
          order to save them. He didn&#8217;t mention too many details, but it
          was enough to make Song Chan uneasy since her revered Master was in
          danger.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I see. So my Master has been captured by the Upper
          Realm?&#8221; Song Chan quickly calmed herself, recalling how her
          master had told her not to take revenge. Could she just do nothing
          when things had turned out this way? She wouldn&#8217;t have become
          who she was today without her Master.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;To be exact, she&#8217;s been captured by Gu Changge.&#8221;
          Lin Wu sighed. He felt that the sudden appearance of the Upper Realm
          Army from within the depths of the Aether Abyss was linked to the Sky
          Deer Goddess since she didn&#8217;t seem right when he met her back
          then.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Gu Changge…&#8221; Song Chan became pale. She could never
          forget the terrifying power he exuded when she saw him in the Aether
          Abyss. How was she going to rescue her Master when she was imprisoned
          by him?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Do you think the path through the Aether Abyss is linked to
          her?&#8221; Song Chan suddenly thought of another possibility and
          couldn&#8217;t help a shiver.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She couldn&#8217;t believe that since her Master, being the guardian
          of Sky Deer City, would never betray it. She knew the Sky Deer Goddess
          well and knew the other woman would never do such a thing, but there
          was no other explanation. This meant that the Sky Deer Goddess had
          somehow gone over to the other side and become the enemy of the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains. She felt stunned and wondered if she was
          crazy to think of such a possibility.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You should know her better since you are her disciple.&#8221;
          Lin Wu shook his head without saying anything else. He was just here
          to inform her about this and wouldn&#8217;t talk about anything else.
          If Song Chan were really worried about the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;s
          safety, she would know what to do. He could only gain access to an
          Array Core of Sky Deer City via Song Chan since he couldn&#8217;t
          think of another way.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Alright.&#8221; Song Chan&#8217;s voice shook slightly as she
          realised that her Master had betrayed the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. She couldn&#8217;t believe it even now, her mind filled with
          static.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Lin Wu left the place afterwards, planning to return to his clan and
          make internal arrangements. After witnessing Gu Changge&#8217;s
          frightening capability, his clan should know their odds of winning
          this war. If the Upper Realm Army closed in to attack Sky Deer City,
          it wouldn&#8217;t just be Gu Changge attacking them. He had to think
          of his future for his clan.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, Gu Wudi and Xiao Yang were discussing something important
          with many ancient beings. They were both disciples of the Nine Great
          Mountains and besides, Gu Wudi was its Chosen One. However, it would
          be hard for the two of them to contribute any effort in the battle now
          that the Nine Great Mountains were gone.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After some discussion, they decided to find the mysterious Supreme
          Mountain Elder. According to what the other Mountain Elders had said,
          he was terrifyingly strong, with nothing that could bar his way. His
          existence could be traced back to the founding of the Nine Great
          Mountains, plus he was more powerful than the other eight Mountain
          Elders combined. Finding him might yield some surprising results in
          the final battle with the Upper Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Besides, Xiao Yang had other motives. The Second Mountain Elder had
          told him about his background, and he had researched the Family of
          Protectors via various avenues. However, the only thing he discovered
          was a sudden accident twenty years ago, where his family had been
          ruined after being attacked and killed by a mysterious group. A raging
          fire could still be seen in the mountain range where the family had
          lived.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many doubted that the Protector bloodline had gone extinct and this
          shook Xiao Yang somewhat. The only saving grace was that he
          didn&#8217;t have a lot of memories of his family. Besides, he had
          been a baby more than twenty years ago and was still ignorant about
          everything. The family servants had fought valiantly to send him to
          the foot of the Nine Great Mountains, leaving him isolated from the
          world.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, he didn&#8217;t believe that he didn&#8217;t have any other
          blood relatives. According to the Second Mountain Elder, his bloodline
          could only be awakened via a special technique. He would only gain
          unimaginable power after that. If he couldn&#8217;t find any of his
          family members, his Protector bloodline would be useless. That was why
          he was planning to look around and find clues regarding their
          whereabouts. The Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were in an upheaval
          about the invasion of the Aether Abyss.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Great Bone Domain was a dark and barren place with soil which had
          been burned and turned black. The aura of the place was extremely
          ancient, transforming into Mist of Chaos which spread towards every
          direction. It was filled with terrifying energy, so even Sacred Realm
          experts would be wary when entering the place.</span

          Domains, since very few people inhabited the place. It was significant
          in size yet the number of forces it had were extremely few compared to
          the other Domains. Rumour has it that the Great Bone Domain had
          evolved from a piece from the mysterious Gloomy Burial Ground when it
          split apart.</span

          revealing terrifying scenes, including the rising sun and setting
          moon, seas transforming into the land, lightning fading to ash, the
          collapse of the universe, and the sobbing of people. The eyes were
          enormous and seemed to be the only thing in the black fog, their gaze
          cold without any other emotion.</span

          personally twenty years ago.&#8221; The slender figure frowned, her
          voice filled with confusion.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Don&#8217;t underestimate them. I could sense the Fortuity of
          the Protectors&#8217; bloodline growing by leaps and bounds.&#8221;
          The voice came from within the fog. Scenes began to appear within the
          frightening gaze as if about to deduce traces of the Protectors&#8217;
          bloodline. However, a popping sound rang out as a beam of brilliant
          light containing incomprehensible energy shot through time and space
          and struck him down. Blood spattered and made him grunt slightly. The
          place quieted down briefly before a murderous aura shot up into the
          clouds.</span

          >&#8220;That must be someone secretly possessing great Fortuity or
          that someone back then had reappeared.&#8221; He smiled coldly, not
          surprised by this.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I see. The person who had evaded me must have appeared again.
          I&#8217;ll get rid of them.&#8221; The slender figure didn&#8217;t
          seem surprised either and nodded, tone cold and without inflection. A
          crack appeared in the space in front of her and she stepped through,
          disappearing instantly.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The days where we have to lie in wait here are finally about
          to end.&#8221; The figure surrounded by dark mist became silent again.
          The enormous Great Bone Domain was filled with thick fog which was
          impossible to blow away, lacking the sounds of birds or insects
          calling.
        </span>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In contrast to the grave and sombre atmosphere in the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains, the Upper Realm camp was filled with pomp
          and noise. Nearly every force was organising a victory banquet to
          celebrate their overwhelming win, with divine rainbows streaking
          amongst the giant cluster of ancient battleships while carrying dishes
          and alcohol.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the centre of it all, the numerous forces had constructed several
          majestic thrones seemingly made from black and gold divine stones.
          They shimmered brightly with an otherworldly aura and emitted clouds
          of mist, all branded with sacred patterns. This also symbolised
          ultimate power, since even a True Daoist wouldn&#8217;t have the right
          to sit on one. Only those who had contributed greatly to the Upper
          Realm could sit there.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, Gu Changge was undeniably the only one currently qualified
          to sit on one of the thrones. His expression was careless as he picked
          one and sat down, sensing a strange energy which gave him a feeling of
          nourishment. It was clear how extraordinary its material was. Such a
          throne was a rare treasure that the forces had paid a handsome sum to
          construct. Each one contained runes and arrays, which constituted the
          force of the world.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seated beneath him were the experts from each force, even the Dharma
          Body of supreme experts, who weren&#8217;t qualified to sit at his
          level. Nevertheless, no one found anything wrong with this or
          complained about it.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The banquet was filled with song and dance from beautiful female
          attendants from each force, as well as prodigal damsels, showing off
          their skills and charm. Meanwhile, the King with Six Crowns, Chosen
          Monk Jin Chan and others from the young generation sat separately from
          the older generation, drinking amongst themselves while chatting with
          close acquaintances.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The battle hadn&#8217;t satisfied them—not because Gu Changge had
          suddenly interfered, but because the younger generation from the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains didn&#8217;t have many people who required
          their full effort.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the effects of the alcohol began sinking in, many members of the
          young generation stood up to spar, which emitted brilliant light and
          surging energy. Powerful runes flew everywhere as the older generation
          watched this with a smile, hoping that the young prodigies from their
          own force could become famous. After all, everyone gathered here was
          the most powerful or the most talented in the Upper Realm, making it a
          rare opportunity.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After that, many came up to give Gu Changge a toast, including
          attractive women from different forces, who had cultivated for a long
          time and also been prodigal damsels with superior looks and numerous
          admirers. They shot admiring and seductive looks at him, to which he
          responded with a smile and a nod. Other cultivators and beings
          approached him as well, asking him about cultivation. Even those from
          the older generation listened closely, refusing to miss a single
          word.</span

          >&#8220;Xianer, aren&#8217;t you going to give Young Master Changge a
          toast? The two of you are still from the same family and are very
          close.&#8221; An Yan, beautiful and silver-haired, smiled.

          >Gu Xianer, whose gaze had been distant as if she was pondering
          something, quickly recovered and looked towards the throne. She
          gritted her teeth secretly, maintaining her cold demeanour. &#8220;Why
          should I? All these people just want to flatter him. I don&#8217;t
          need to do that.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her mind was still haunted by the memory from yesterday. Somehow she
          had fallen asleep, waking up to see Gu Changge lying on his side on
          the bed, supporting his head with one hand while looking at her
          awkwardly. She was even clinging tightly to his neck while huddling
          close to him. Recalling that scene made her feel embarrassed, and she
          had the urge to bury herself in the ground.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You are still the princess of the Gu Family. Besides, Young
          Master Changge sent a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert to protect you. You
          don&#8217;t have to flatter him but don’t you think you should show
          him some respect?&#8221; An Yan smiled slightly enviously before
          adding, &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity I don&#8217;t have such a good cousin
          like him. Xianer, do you think he would refuse if I go up to him for a
          toast?&#8221;</span

          >Given Gu Changge&#8217;s status, all he had to do was give the order,
          and whoever he wanted to meet would surely go to him. The same thing
          went for Xiao Ruoyin as well. If it weren&#8217;t for Gu
          Changge&#8217;s status preventing her from visiting him as she
          pleased, she&#8217;d have wandered around the man every chance she
          got, lest he forgot about her.</span

          blew the steam from the tea away and smiled, seemingly not noticing
          Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s expression. &#8220;It&#8217;s just that I suddenly
          heard some news about you. Seeing that I have some time and that I
          haven&#8217;t checked in with you for a while, I thought a visit was
          necessary. It&#8217;s nothing major. Nothing to worry about,&#8221; he
          explained.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >That said, Xiao Ruoyin was still touched to know that Gu Changge
          cared so much about her feelings.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Gu, not only have you saved me, given me the
          resources to cultivate, allowed me to join Skyward Schloss, and become
          the disciple of a Sacred King Realm expert. You also care so much
          about me… It&#8217;s all because of you that I&#8217;m where I am
          today. I honestly don&#8217;t know how to repay your kindness,&#8221;
          Xiao Ruoyin thanked Gu Changge with sincere gratitude while her voice
          grew gradually shaky as she spoke. At the mention of repaying his
          kindness, redness tinted her cheeks.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Looking at Gu Changge&#8217;s status while comparing them to hers.
          Their social statuses were of night and day. The sensation, to her,
          was equivalent to an emperor who remembered a common woman, and he
          even actively asked about her well-being. In fact, she felt absolutely
          flattered.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, Xiao Ruoyin also understood that it was because she had
          already adapted to this world&#8217;s cruel, pyramid-like hierarchy
          and, in turn, knew to grow fearful of those with power. After all, Gu
          Changge was the man standing on the apex, overlooking countless Upper
          Realm beings. Such a feeling most likely would not have surfaced if it
          was when she had just arrived in this world. Back then, she was
          practically fearless. So much so that she even dared to chat with Gu
          Changge all night long as though they were old friends.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Do you think I helped you because I want you to repay the
          debt?&#8221; Gu Changge asked with amusement.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;N-No, I don&#8217;t mean that.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin shook her
          head, then put on a determined look. &#8220;I… I honestly feel guilty
          when you&#8217;re helping me out like this. There&#8217;s nothing I
          can repay you with either. I can&#8217;t even make tea by your side.
          After all, there are countless prodigal damsels who would want to make
          you tea. It&#8217;ll be aeons before it&#8217;s my turn. Even if I
          offer myself to you, I&#8217;m probably not worthy, and you
          wouldn&#8217;t make anything of me either.&#8221; As she came to the
          end of her sentence, she pulled a bitter, self-deprecating
          smile.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge, on the other hand, revealed shock, pretending as though
          he hadn&#8217;t expected such words from the young woman. At that, he
          shook his head and said with feigned sobriety, &#8220;Why mope, Lady
          Ruoyin? To me, you&#8217;re very different from the other women. Why
          do you think I&#8217;d go this far to help you?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His question took Xiao Ruoyin aback for a second, and she pondered
          for a moment before shaking her head in distress. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
          know… I always thought you took pity on me.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, she knew why, but if she said it out bluntly at this time,
          she would appear over-ambitious. Being a smart girl, Xiao Ruoyin
          naturally knew what she should say.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge took a gander at her and chuckled, &#8220;That&#8217;s not
          it. I just think you&#8217;re different from all the other women,
          that&#8217;s all. Well, it’s all in my eyes and how I judge things.
          You don&#8217;t have to overthink. I don&#8217;t need you to repay
          me.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sure, Xiao Ruoyin saw that coming, but she still couldn&#8217;t help
          feeling touched after hearing it personally.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t know what to do anymore when you put it
          like that, Young Master Gu. It makes me feel absolutely horrible. I
          can&#8217;t accept your kindness like this,&#8221; the young woman
          mumbled barely audibly while drooping her head.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin wanted Gu Changge to believe she was a simple,
          straightforward girl and hoped that he would never know she had
          agendas. Hence, after saying that, she allowed redness to tint her
          cheeks as a quiver laced her mumbles, appearing totally abashed.</span

          I&#8217;m nothing compared to the women by your side, but I
          don&#8217;t have any other thoughts or motives either. I get it, too,
          if you do mind.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;The way you put it…&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head as he let
          a chuckle escape, and helplessness laced his voice as he looked at
          Xiao Ruoyin. &#8220;Why does it feel like I&#8217;ll let you down if I
          say no?&#8221;</span

          so, why should I refuse? Not like I will suffer any losses.] If Xiao
          Ruoyin was going to act all innocent, then he would just play along
          with her, as simple as that.</span

          already foreseen that Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t turn her down, she
          still couldn&#8217;t help exulting in joy while breathing a sigh of

          and soon enough, the entire Skyward Schloss would know about it. From
          then on, the first impression people would have of her would now be
          that she was Gu Changge&#8217;s woman. If so, who in the Upper Realm

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days had flown by in the blink of an eye.</span><span
                id="more-29437"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole Upper Realm was in an uproar because of Gu Changge&#8217;s dispatch
                of such a huge force to search for possible remnants of Bandit Thirteen. People were discussing this
                matter every day in almost every Ancient City.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bandit Thirteen was notorious for their evil deeds, such as arson, killing,
                robbing. They did all sorts of evil things. However, they were extremely difficult to hunt down because
                of the terrain of the Chaos Star Territory.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After attacking the passing caravans, they would rob the poor forces and
                caravans of their supplies before fleeing.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Chaos Star Territory’s borders various Domains, and it was the only
                way to transport goods in or out of the Heavenly Arms Domain, which was famous for tool refinement. In
                other words, it was a place where every business had to pass by.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bandit Thirteen had plundered many resources from the caravans of the
                Heavenly Arms Domain for millions of years.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Bandit Thirteen was exterminated by Gu Changge, the resources obtained
                had made many forces jealous. Still, many knew that the force that Gu Changge had dispatched to wipe out
                Bandit Thirteen was already enough to wipe out ordinary forces. Still, Gu Changge’s force had suffered
                considerable losses as well. There were as many as a hundred ancient battleships damaged in this
                battle.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the reason many thought Gu Changge had sent such a new and
                terrifying force to completely wipe out Bandit Thirteen. It was a force so terrifying that it alarmed
                many. Not just individual cultivators but other forces as well. With this, they could no longer treat Gu
                Changge like any other young prodigy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had gradually become a full-fledged beast that could bear his sharp fangs
                in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Destroying Purple Mansion was just the start.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It served as a reminder, anyone who made an enemy out of Gu Changge would
                have to consider the terrible consequences they would have to bear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After destroying Bandit Thirteen in the Chaos Star Territory, Gu Changge
                ordered the various Celestial Ancient Races to secretly dispatch experts from their respective clans to
                unify the other scattered bandits around Chaos Star Territory.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, one would have to be a fool to say no to all the goodies just
                laying there for the taking.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was far from being a good person. After he got rid of Bandit
                Thirteen, he planned to support a new force to occupy Chaos Star Territory. After all, Bandit Thirteen
                had been extremely wealthy these years. Regardless of which force it was, they all had high hopes for
                this piece of land. No one dared to say anything about it, but they were tempted to make a move on
                it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither did they say much after Gu Changge secretly created this new force to
                take over the new vacuum left behind. However, bandits backed by power and a stand-alone bandit were two
                different things.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaos Star Territory was vast and wide. Between the borders of many Domains,
                countless caravans and cultivators came and went every day. Not to mention, the many teleportation
                arrays and ancient altars along the way. Any cultivators who wanted to pass through here would have to
                pay a fee.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only natural that if everything was cleaned up and kept safe, it would
                be a land of great wealth for any force. It even attracted Gu Changge’s eye. Fortunately, it
                wouldn&#8217;t be too troublesome for him to take control of the Chaos Star Territory.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before this, apart from Bandit Thirteen, there were hundreds of bandits that
                formed big and small groups within a million kilometre of the area. They might be scattered, but there
                were a lot of them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would even be difficult for such groups to be subdued under Bandit
                Thirteen.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this group of bandits were fierce and vicious people who had been in many
                life-and-death fights. Naturally, their strength far surpassed that of cultivators in the same
                realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the extermination of Bandit Thirteen, these bandits&#8217;
                ambitions grew, and they all wanted to rise and dominate the surrounding area. However, their motivation
                was soon put to a stop when they were suppressed by the terrifying force Gu Changge had sent.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had given them a simple choice to make: obey or die.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Bandit Thirteen as the precedent, these scattered bandits naturally
                didn&#8217;t dare to resist. That was how the many bandits in Chaos Star Territory eventually went from
                small groups to one massive one.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the new group wasn&#8217;t as good as Bandit Thirteen at their
                peak, because it had Gu Changge behind them, the overall strength was countless times greater than the
                previous bandit group.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, many in Chaos Star Territory knew who was the mastermind behind
                the scenes, but they didn&#8217;t dare speak out. They could only silently pray that these bandits,
                under Gu Changge&#8217;s control, could restrain themselves a little bit and stop doing evil deeds like
                Bandit Thirteen did.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge then arranged for Ji Qingxuan to take charge of the
                management there for the time being.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After spending some time to observe her, he had seen Ji
                Qingxuan&#8217;s ability and ambition. It just so happened that this newly combined bandit group could
                be used as a sharpening stone to hone Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s abilities.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge could put up with having one or two women around him whose
                only purpose was to look pretty. Nonetheless, he still appreciated it more if she could help him, and
                was useful to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning, Ji Qingxuan didn&#8217;t expect Gu Changge to trust her so
                much as to let her take on this important task. She was nervous and uneasy for a while, but her inflated
                ambition and excitement eventually took over. She even swore to herself that she would never let Gu
                Changge down. After all, this was also an opportunity Gu Changge gave her to show her abilities. She
                must make good use of it. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing Ji Qingxuan take his keepsake and leave Immortal Academy for
                Chaos Star Territory, Gu Changge finally focused on something else. He silently picked up the tea on the
                table, took a sip, and then picked up the Communication Rune.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On it was Yan Ji reporting the details about Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s cultivation
                process during this period. Still, what Gu Changge cared most was whether Xiao Ruoyin had recovered her
                memory as the High Priestess of Destiny.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it now seemed that it would take a long time for Xiao Ruoyin
                to recover her memory. Other than that, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t care about her cultivation
                level.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, a follower outside the hall suddenly came to give their
                report. &#8220;Young Master, there is news about the remnants of Bandit Thirteen. Do you want to arrest
                him?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he came back to his senses, he calmly asked, &#8220;Mm. Who is
                it?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The mysterious military advisor that runs Bandit Thirteen seems to be
                related to the commotion in the Demon World six thousand years ago,&#8221; the follower respectfully
                began. &#8220;According to the information we have inquired, it seems that the mysterious military
                advisor is related to the Solar Demon Overlord of the Demon World. He was then ordered to be killed by
                Empress Yao Xi, but he went missing after he escaped from the Demon World. No one had expected him to
                sneak into Chaos Star Territory and become the military advisor of Bandit Thirteen.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He is related to the Demon World? He is tied to my karma?] Gu
                Changge couldn&#8217;t help feeling somewhat startled after hearing those words, but he waved the
                follower off. &#8220;Got it. You can leave. Once there are traces of him, immediately send someone to
                arrest him.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Young Master.&#8221; The follower left promptly
                after.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge thought for a moment before he picked up the calligraphy brush to
                write a letter. He had a feeling that this matter might have something to do with the returned Heir of
                the Demon Overlord. According to the information he had learned, there were six Demon Overlords in the
                former Demon World. Among them, the Solar Demon Overlord and Lunar Demon Overlord had the closest
                relationship.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Heir of Solar Demon Overlord, Jun Bufan, was childhood
                sweethearts with Empress Yao Xi, who was now in charge of the Demon World. They were even betrothed to
                each other. However, the marriage contract happened six thousand years ago when there was chaos in the
                Demon World. Solar Demon Overlord&#8217;s children had died in the chaos, and the remaining five Demon
                Overlords had disappeared. Although Lunar Demon Overlord was the mother of Empress Yao Xi, she was
                rarely seen nowadays.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were rumours about how she was in retreat, but no one knew for
                sure whether she was under house arrest by Empress Yao Xi, or if she had been killed long
                ago.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Empress Yao Xi had had a bad reputation as early as
                6,000 years ago in the Demon World. To many, such actions from her were to be expected.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Killing her fiancé, subduing and killing all the demons who resisted.
                Those in the Demon World who died in her hands were too many to count. She was so frighteningly cruel
                that there were even rumours that her voice could stop children from crying at night.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge recalled the triggered prompt when he first entered
                Immortal Academy some time ago. It stated something along the lines of the ‘Heir of the Demon Overlord
                who had returned’. He had reminded Empress Yao Xi of it at that time, but he didn&#8217;t do much else.
                After all, he had something to do then.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems that the Heir of the Demon Overlord has already amounted to
                something. Sure enough, it is a good opportunity for me to start harvesting, since this person is
                involved with the Fortuitous One, he must also carry a lot of Fortuity.] Gu Changge suddenly had such
                thoughts when he thought back on the image of the blind middle-aged man in his wheelchair.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If that is the case, he is most likely to flee to the Demon
                World.&#8221; Gu Changge narrowed his eyes and called his followers again to tell them to always pay
                attention to the teleportation arrays going to the various Ancient Cities in the Demon
                World.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he was done with the arrangement, he began to write letters,
                intending to find out Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s attitude towards him.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though he had flattered Empress Yao Xi the last time he met her
                at Immortal Academy, and even seemed like he had a good relationship with her, he knew that someone of
                her intellect wouldn&#8217;t give him her trust just like that. The most she felt for him was an
                admiration for an old acquaintance. Moreover, he didn&#8217;t know exactly how Empress Yao Xi felt
                towards her fiancé, whom she had poisoned. That was why it was necessary for him to decide the next plan
                according to how she views things.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Empress Yao Xi still felt guilty towards Jun Bufan, Gu Changge
                didn&#8217;t mind helping her destroy such feelings.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Demon World, thick mist shrouded a splendid palace standing on the top
                of a mountain where a magnificent woman in a phoenix dress was writing something in front of a desk. She
                had beautiful facial features, and unlike her deep and calm eyes, the red makeup between her brows gave
                her looks a wicked touch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beside her stood four tall and slender women holding a calligraphy
                brush, ink, paper and inkstone. They each were charming despite their differences. With silky locks and
                beautiful faces, they were either gentle, aloof, cold or quiet.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Majesty, here is a letter from the Young Master of the Gu
                Family from the Upper Realm. It was sent directly from the Immortal Academy.&#8221; A female official
                outside the hall respectfully came forward with a letter. Hearing this, the four female officials beside
                the woman in a phoenix dress seemed a little surprised. Among them, the woman with demure temperament
                came over, undid the letter, and presented it to the woman in phoenix dress.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman in a phoenix dress put down the memorial to the throne in
                her hands when she heard that. She, too, was surprised. &#8220;Gu Changge? Why did he write me a
                letter?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she spoke, she couldn&#8217;t help recalling what he said about her.
                Giving her credit as a brilliant Empress who took on scorn for the betterment of her people.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The memory of that brought a small, rare smile to her face, and she
                gently opened the letter to read its content.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four female officials beside her all looked at this scene unfold
                in shock. As the closest female officials and confidants of Empress Yao Xi, they naturally knew the
                empress&#8217; character very well.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone as stern and unfriendly as her actually smiled because of a
                man!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, they knew who Gu Changge was. They were aware that he was the most
                popular, dazzling, and powerful young prodigy of this era.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time ago, he even destroyed one of the mightest forces. These
                women were shocked and terrified, and they found it unbelievable that this was something that someone in
                the younger generation was capable of. Even the most brilliant prodigy in the Demon World paled in
                comparison to him. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When did Her Majesty know Gu Changge enough to contact each other through
                letters?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He has time to wonder about how I am doing now, hmm?&#8221; The smile
                on Yaoxi&#8217;s face deepened. Even the four female officials could tell that she was in a good
                mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This took them aback. It had been too long since they last saw her
                react this way. The last time she showed such an expression was probably the last time a minister,
                against all opinions in the court, agreed to her reforms, and even explained her intentions on her
                behalf. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, Yao Xi carefully read the contents of the letter again, and only
                then did her slender hand pick up the calligraphy brush next to her to write on the paper.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her action further shocked the four female officials who were usually in
                charge of writing on Yao Xi&#8217;s behalf. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Just how important is he to Her Majesty?] They were all suddenly curious to
                see for themselves what kind of a person the legendary Gu Changge was.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yao Xi didn&#8217;t take long to finish writing the letter. She read through
                it again, and after showing a satisfied expression, she passed it to the female official next to her.
                &#8220;Have it sent to Young Master Changge as soon as possible.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Your Majesty.&#8221; The demure female official took the
                letter and left the palace quickly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yao Xi then calmly instructed the remaining officials, &#8220;Keep an
                eye on the teleportation arrays leading to the Upper Realm for the time being. The remnants from six
                thousand years ago are likely to recover again.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The official with the cold face was startled when she heard that.
                &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;is someone coming back to the Demon
                World?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yao Xi took a look at her. She trusted her female officials enough to
                not hide anything from them, and so she said indifferently, &#8220;Young Master Changge has wiped out
                Bandit Thirteen in Chaos Star Territory recently. One of the remaining evil-doers is Bai Kun, the Demon
                Master, who stood beside the Solar Demon Overlord six thousand years ago. Since he had offended Young
                Master Changge, there is no place for him in the Upper Realm. Young Master Changge speculates that Bai
                Kun will abscond and return to the Demon World.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To think it&#8217;s Bai Kun. I heard that he has the ability
                to discern the secrets of heaven and overturn the world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He was able to escape despite the relentless hunt six thousand
                years ago and he has been missing since then.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To think that he had actually escaped to Chaos Star
                Territory.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The female officers were shocked when they heard that.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only the cold woman, who asked the question just now, had a slight
                change in her expression, as if she was a little nervous, but it was gone before Yao Xi, who was reading
                Gu Changge&#8217;s letter, could notice.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Over the years, the remnants of the rebellion have shown signs of
                resurgence. There should be someone secretly leading the charge. Who could it be, I wonder?&#8221; Yao
                Xi frowned and started pondering over the problem mentioned in the letter.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She constantly felt regretful about how she and Gu Changge could not
                be there for each other. And so, she would always tell him everything in her letters whenever a problem
                arose.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she met Gu Changge for the first time in Immortal Academy, she
                had paid attention to what Gu Changge said, and ordered a search for the remnants of the Demon Overlords
                when she returned to the Demon World.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yao Xi had also been cautious by arresting people with the same name
                as her ex-fiancé in various places in the Demon World. She knew that this was tantamount to finding a
                needle in a haystack, but it was the only way she can think of at present. She knew Jun Bufan well
                enough to know that he would most likely continue to use his original name if he was not
                dead.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason she suspected he was alive was because she discovered that
                Jun Bufan&#8217;s tomb was empty, and at some point, his body had been stolen. Left with no leads, she
                could only hope to find a way to get to the bottom of this from Gu Changge.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge was just a Junior to her, some of Gu
                Changge&#8217;s opinions and ideas had enlightened her. It was to the point she held his views in high
                regard.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Heh, I knew it. The Heir of the Demon Overlord has grown
                considerably. I will have to find time to make a trip to the Demon World. I can&#8217;t possibly spit
                out the honey that is already in my mouth.] Inside the Immortal Academy, Gu Changge stood with his hands
                behind his back, and he had a faint smile on his face. He was not very surprised after reading Yao
                Xi&#8217;s letter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, he had already guessed the questions she was asking in the
                letter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could the returned Heir of the Demon Overlord repeat the same
                mistakes as he did six thousand years ago? As long as Jun Bufan was not stupid, he would choose to grow
                inconspicuously, show his face to Yao Xi as little as possible, and reduce the light shone on him as
                much as possible.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the vast Demon World, it would be more difficult to look for the
                Heir of the Demon Overlord than finding a needle in a haystack. It was no wonder Yao Xi couldn&#8217;t
                find him. She might not even know whether Jun Bufan was dead or not.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But the solution is simple. If we can&#8217;t go to him, make him
                come to us.] Gu Changge soon picked up his calligraphy brush and wrote another letter.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Yao Xi was looking for a solution from him, he could come up
                with plenty of them. In his opinion, Yao Xi was still not cruel enough.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had many ways to make Jun Bufan show up on his own. If Gu Changge
                remembered correctly, Jun Bufan had a sister back then. His elder sister never participated in the chaos
                of the Demon World six thousand years ago. She even made her own land a forbidden zone in the Demon
                World, and no one dared to get near her territory throughout the last thousands of years.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, a young man in disguise was setting up a street
                stall on a remote street in an Upper Realm Ancient City.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man had many fragments of weapons stained with rust and dirt, and
                had many unrecognisable strange ores on display. They looked ancient, but seemed fresh as though they
                had just been unearthed. However, while he was setting up the stall, he would steal glances at the
                passing cultivators from time to time with flickering eyes. As he listened to their conversation, he
                felt his hatred and anger boil. [Unfortunately, neither Gu Changge nor the remaining members of Bandit
                Thirteen have anything to do with me now.] </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man was Jiang Chen. If it weren&#8217;t for Gu Changge, he
                wouldn&#8217;t have been reduced to such a state where he needed to dig graves and sell grave goods to
                make a living. If luck was on his side, he could meet the owner of the tomb who died not long ago, and
                devour the remaining energy in their body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if he was unlucky, he would encounter corpses soaked in the
                essence of the universe. Bodies soaked in Sun and Moon Essense were highly likely to lead to a corpse
                transformation, and a gory disaster.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that, he had to be extremely careful every time before he
                went into a grave, and he had to also watch out, lest he gets discovered by the family of the owner of
                the graves.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had also been a long time since Black-Robed Elder showed up ever
                since he claimed he wanted to train Jiang Chen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not knowing where Black-Robed Elder was now, Jiang Chen could only look for
                hidden graves in mountains, and occasionally do the training Black-Robed Elder wanted him
                to.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He finally showed progress this time when he managed to open up his
                Spiritual Sea.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had planned to go to the major squares and cities to gamble.
                However, he eventually gave up when he thought that he might not be able to leave once he won big. Thus,
                he gave up the thought.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the past few days, he happened to hear the news that there
                would be a new Ancient Divine Tomb. After hearing about this, he decided to go there to try his
                luck.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Qing Yu and Tuo Ba Ling Qiong were trembling in silence. Because of Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s words, their entire bodies were feeling cold and extremely uncomfortable.</span><span id="more-32781"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the enemy they had to face was Gu Changge, it was truly fearful, just like a nightmare. Who wouldn&#8217;t feel apprehensive if they had to face Gu Changge?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, anyone who found out that they had such a nemesis, would definitely panic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo took a long time before they could calm down, but their mouths felt very dry afterwards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not even the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty dared to offend Gu Changge for no reason, let alone them? Their family might be glorious in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, and their father, Tuo Ba Yun Tian was heavily favoured with great authority. But in the face of Gu Changge, they were actually no different from ants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brother, is what you are saying true? Did Gu Changge really arrange the scarred-man to test you?&#8221; Tuo Ba Ling Qiong was still persistent in questioning this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao knew his elder sister&#8217;s personality. If she didn&#8217;t find out the details of things, she would never be at ease. He nodded to her question and vaguely explained the existence of the Seven Tools of World Domination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, that’s the reason.&#8221; Tuo Ba Ling Qiong&#8217;s expression changed a little. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She naturally knew about the Seven Tools of World Domination. When the Tower of World Domination appeared, many Forces of the Upper Realm had moved to send out people to seize it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was said that the Tower of World Domination ended up in the hands of Gu Changge. Furthemore, the other Tools of World Domination, like the Flask of World Domination, Wheel of World Domination had already been obtained by Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since that thing is so troublesome, why don&#8217;t you just give it to him? A farmer is not guilty until he hides jade. We simply aren’t strong enough to keep such a thing.&#8221; Tuo Ba Ling Qiong thought over this in silence before she said in a serious tone. It was obvious that she deeply thought this through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao already knew that she was going to say that. He shook his head and said with a bitter smile, &#8220;Second Sister, it is useless. That thing has already fused with my body a long time ago and vanished from this world. Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t be able to obtain it. It is impossible for me to take it out and hand it to him.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, that’s why.&#8221; Tuo Ba Ling Qiong fell into silence again and felt very helpless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, she had great regards for family ties. Since that thing had already fused with Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, it would probably take his life if it was taken out. She wasn&#8217;t going to allow such a thing to happen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. Qing Yu and I will keep your secret. We will stand by your side.&#8221; Tuo Ba Ling Qiong&#8217;s beautiful face was filled with firm determination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, the trio headed deeper into the ruin, each with their own worries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hunting Event would end tomorrow. Right now, they only wanted to find a safe place to hide and prevent any future mishaps. Once the Hunting Event was over, they would leave this place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place was once a flourishing Force that existed for a long time. But they offended a mysterious expert and were extinguished overnight. Since then, they vanished and were turned into ruins.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and the others knew clearly that the offending of an expert was just an excuse. The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty wasn&#8217;t going to allow an Immortal Force </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to rise in their territory and become a threat to them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place was absolutely desolate. There were old vines crawling all over the mountain ridge. Cries and roars of all sorts of beasts could be heard. Over those long years, it had already turned into a habitat for them. Towering ancient trees and lush plants had covered everything from the ancient times, turning this place into a primitive mountain range.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wonder if anything happened to the Second Prince Yu Lie? In terms of the timeline, he should have been assassinated.] Tuo Ba Xiao Yao looked faraway while in deep thoughts. Actually, he was still waiting. In this Hunting Event, apart from the second prince&#8217;s assassination, there was another major incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the appearance of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom. Many of the Eternal Overcast Creates would walk out from the abyss. Furthermore, a Prince of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom would then propose for an alliance marriage to Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his previous life, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao wasn&#8217;t able to prevent anything, but this life, he had to think of a method to destroy the alliance marriage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwards, the entire wilderness suddenly had a great transformation. There were terrifying whistles while the mountains were shaking. Leaves were falling and it felt like there was a torrent that struck at the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a pitch-black smoke rising up from the deepest part of the wilderness. The smoke felt like it was going to pierce through heaven and was breathtaking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene shocked everyone. Many young prodigies felt awful. It felt as though something terrifying was about to rush out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is inside the abyss in the depths of the wilderness?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So much Eternal Overcast Fog is surging out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu and the others appeared in the skies while looking at the scene in the depths of the place. When looking from their angle, there was a huge black fog that rose up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an Eternal Overcast Fog. One stronger than usual, which could devour the space it took in. Any living being that devoured would be turned into pus, blood, and ashes. It was truly horrifying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could this be caused by the appearance of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom?&#8221; Gu Changge was contemplating as he could already feel some activity from the Eternal Overcast Kingdom within the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hunting Event&#8217;s venue was precisely one of the places that a scourge had broken out because of the Eternal Overcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just an instant, the entire wilderness was undergoing a horrific transformation as the Eternal Overcast Fog swept over. All plants were quickly withering, while the mountain ridges were collapsing into ashes. Many of the beasts couldn&#8217;t escape in time and had been instantly turned into pus and blood as they exploded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the fog, there was an abnormal scene as another world was illuminated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an ancient savage land. The mountains looked like dragons, while the ancient trees soared through the heavens, with old vines covering the mountains. Boundless, ancient, mysterious, powerful&#8230; It exuded an indescribable aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each mountain was massive and majestic. There were plenty of waterfalls that were over a kilometre and were truly magnificent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The palaces and pavilions were simple but amazing. They were like heavenly palaces that stood upright within the Mortal Realm, emitting brilliant radiance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was stunned as they watched. They were completely dumbfounded and didn&#8217;t know what to do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the fog, it was actually the image of another ancient world. Could that be the place where the Eternal Overcast Creatures lived?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon looking at it, they found it to not be any different from the outside world. It was like a solitary ancient world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is someone walking over. It seems like he is related to the Eternal Overcast Kingdom.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes flashed with runes. He could see through the fog and saw the scenery within.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the depths of the wilderness, there was an extremely vast abyss and it was bursting out with dreadful Eternal Overcast Fog. At the same time, several figures were appearing. From their appearances, they looked similar to the outside world&#8217;s human race. But, if one was to look carefully, one would notice the aura of life and death emitted from their bodies. These two kinds of energies weaving and flowing, forming a balance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appearance of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family wasn&#8217;t like the other Eternal Overcast Creatures. They could survive in places that didn&#8217;t have the Eternal Overcast Fog. They could move around as they wished and leave the Eternal Overcast to head for the outside world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, they looked just like normal humans and it was hard to differentiate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu and the other experts were frowning as they could also see the scenery clearly. They obviously knew that those people were from the Eternal Overcast Royal Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After countless years, the Eternal Overcast Royal Family reappeared and they had picked such timing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Majesty&#8230;&#8221; One of the ministers came forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu shook his hand and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s observe first. If the Eternal Overcast Royal Family dared to act recklessly in our Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, this emperor wouldn&#8217;t spare them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eternal Overcast Royal Family has existed since ancient times. There were rumours saying that they existed since the birth of the Upper Realm. Their might and influence was an unknown factor, making most of the Forces apprehensive towards them. No one would dare to provoke them or build ties with them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless it was necessary, Emperor Yu didn&#8217;t want to provoke those from the Eternal Overcast Royal Family at this moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the appearance of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family, it had caused quite a huge commotion. Elders of the various Forces felt extremely unnerved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eternal Overcast represented inauspicious and disaster. Even though they were cultivators with overwhelming strength, they still didn&#8217;t wish to have any connection with someone related to the Eternal Overcast. Especially now that Eternal Overcast Scourges were everywhere, with several areas of the Upper Realm having been devoured. Among those areas, there might be Forces that had powerful experts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When facing something that even True Immortals had difficulty resolving, they felt extremely insignificant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wonder if these people know Jia Lan.&#8221; In Gu Changge&#8217;s hand appeared a black chess piece. He muttered those words as he thought of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Princess, who he had an agreement with</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chess piece was sealed with a strand of Jia Lan&#8217;s divine sense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then she promised Gu Changge that she would deliver Eternal Overcast Sources. However, she apparently encountered some issues and had difficulty preparing the Eternal Overcast Sources that Gu Changge wanted. As such, their deal was put on hold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eternal Overcast Royal Family was searching for the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s Successor, to help them forge the Reincarnation Platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge might have promised them, but he never had the intention to fulfil it. Now that the Eternal Overcast Royal Family had appeared, he was thinking of making use of this chess piece.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there was a horrific outburst of Eternal Overcast Fog at the depths of the wilderness, many young prodigies received the news. They put down the disputes that they had and gathered towards the central area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, Tuo Ba Ling Qiong and the others weren&#8217;t an exception either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As compared to the others who were shocked, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was obviously much calmer. He already knew that the Eternal Overcast Royal Family was going to appear, therefore, he wasn&#8217;t worried.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon enough, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao saw many familiar faces in the central area. They were the famous young prodigies of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Some of them were injured and had unstable aura. It was obvious that they had just experienced a huge battle. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone who saw Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had changed eyes. It was especially so for those that were familiar with him, as they had complicated feelings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of them knew about the terrifying battle that happened a few days back. Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had exposed his incredible strength and was comparable to the Second Prince, Yu Lie.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just a single night, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s fame had surpassed many of the young prodigies. He was now a rising star that was extremely radiant and had a bright future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there were many who were curious as to why Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had maintained a low-profile until now, and how he survived that battle. After all, from the Qi fluctuations alone left behind in the battlefield, was more than what regular young prodigies could handle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even those from the older generation would find it hard to survive. If they didn&#8217;t have any life-saving methods, they would definitely be turned into ash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao didn&#8217;t care about the complicated expressions from others. He remained calm as he walked to a piece of rock at the centre and sat there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone couldn&#8217;t help but open up a path for him due to the awe they felt, as they didn&#8217;t dare to look down on Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This mediocre Third Young Master of the Tuo Ba Family had become famous in a single battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did something happen to Second Prince Yu Lie?&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao frowned as he was searching for Yu Lie&#8217;s figure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he wanted the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty to become his greatest backer, then he had to build a good relationship with the Second Prince, and be heavily favoured by Emperor Yu. If he was able to neutralise the assassination attempt, he would naturally be a hero. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a certain point of view, he would also become Yu Lie&#8217;s life-saver and benefactor. Gu Changge, who had been plotting everything, would naturally become Yu Lie&#8217;s enemy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t think that just because you hid your strength, I will be impressed. You are still not worthy of my elder sister.&#8221; Suddenly, there was a harsh and mocking voice. It was a young man whose entire body was shining with golden light. He was walking pridefully and speaking with disdain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was none other than the Eldest Princess Yu Feiya&#8217;s younger brother, Yu Ming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pushed aside the crowd and walked towards Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, with an unruly look of contempt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after finding out that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was powerful enough to be compared to Yu Lie, he still didn&#8217;t put Tuo Ba Xiao Yao in his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After personally witnessing Gu Changge&#8217;s strength, he naturally didn&#8217;t bother about Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s strength.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao frowned and treated it as though he didn&#8217;t hear Yu Ming&#8217;s harsh and unpleasant words. He was already used to Yu Ming&#8217;s sarcastic words. Whenever Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was hanging around Yu Feiya, Yu Ming would be mocking him from behind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind Yu Ming was a man and woman, walking over as well. The man was heroic and tall like a young god who had 108 divine halos. The woman was wearing a long dress, emitting grace, nobility and absolute beauty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is the Second Prince alright?&#8221; When seeing Yu Lie and Yu Feiya unscathed, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao let out a breath of relief and involuntarily asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when he asked this, Yu Lie was stunned for a moment. His smile had vanished and it was replaced with a confused frown.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he heard Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had been hiding his strength, nurturing himself in the dark for so many years, he was rather happy for Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. Happy that the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty had produced such a prodigy. However, when he heard Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s question, he could not help but be displeased. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his strength, was he supposed to face an accident in this Hunting Event?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya had reacted quickly as she knew that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was inquiring about the assassination. She shook her head and said, &#8220;My brother didn&#8217;t get assassinated. Everything is fine and there wasn’t any major incident.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was astonished and found it hard to believe. He nearly blurted out the word &#8216;impossible&#8217;. However, he reacted extremely quickly and stopped himself in time. Otherwise, if that was said, it would be very hard to explain. It would cause such a huge mess, that even if he were to jump into the Yellow River, he would not be able to clear himself.</span></p>

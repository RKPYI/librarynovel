          >The Bronze Palace was magnificent yet simple. It was filled with a
          faint glow. No one knew when it was built despite the many ancient
          patterns that were carved into the walls. At that moment, many Life
          Forces were gathered from all directions. One by one, they evoLued
          into Life Runes and fell into the pool. Meanwhile, the Immortal Mist
          was dense and bright, just like the Milky Way. </span

          >With her hair stuck onto her face, Chan Hongyi was totally immersed
          in the pool. She wore a Zen Robe that suppressed her terrifying
          hostility. Her eyes that were like obsidian kept a tight watch in the
          direction of the palace doors. After she caught a glimpse of Gu
          Changge remaining there, she seemed to be relieved and smiled happily.
          It was as if seeing him brought her the most joy in the world.

          >“Master… Hongyi will work hard on cultivating. Please… don’t abandon
          me again… ” She murmured. However, everything but her eyes was
          immersed in the pool. Thus, as she spoke, bubbles gurgled *Gulu Gulu*. </span

          >*Boom!* One by one, Life Forces transformed into a faint glow and
          permeated this space. Like moths to a fire, they moved towards Chan
          Hongyi’s body. All those terrifying injuries on her body were slowly
          healed. Especially in her dazed eyes, there was a sense of
          rejuvenation. It was as if the injuries on her soul were slowly
          recovered, as well as her physical injuries.

          >Gu Changge stood outside the doors of the Bronze Palace. His robes
          moved with the wind and he gently closed his eyes to feel the
          direction of the Principles of this place. When he took Chan Hongyi
          away from the Divine City, he purposely avoided everyone just to bring
          her to this Sanctuary for Resurrection that he had long prepared for
          her. Here, there were many Sources scattered all around.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were from the countless battles that took place in the Boundary
          Marker Sea. Dead littered around like the sand from in the Ganges
          River and their Life Forces, which gradually gathered here over the
          years, were countless. After he killed the War Immortal, Li Xiu, he
          had left many Prohibition Arrays here.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On one hand, he was afraid that someone would notice this place and
          destroy this Sanctuary for Resurrection. On the other hand, he wanted
          this place to be under his control through his arrays. If Chan
          Hongyi’s hostility was to resurface, he could use these arrays to seal
          her in his Inner World. However, these were just prevention measures.
          There was no need for it unless it was his last resort.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just as Gu Changge was deep in his thoughts, there was a tremble
          outside the Bronze Palace. Ah Da’s figure emerged with a small
          jet-black flask that bobbed within his palm and had a strong devouring
          force.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Master, it’s full.” He respectfully offered up the flask. Gu Changge
          glanced over casually and nodded.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This was the Grand Flask where Grand Runes gathered. Its capacity was
          as great as the ocean. However, right now, it was already filled to
          the brim with an endless amount of Life Force. The transparent sea of
          blood that floated to its very top even produced crimson mist.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Not enough. But, the Life Force here has already been sucked dry. Go
          to the frontier where the two worlds meet. There are many people
          there. Go kill them and fill up another flask. ” Gu Changge shook his
          head gently. Within his palm, black runes appeared and condensed into
          a black Grand Flask, which he then passed to Ah Da.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Master, should I also kill those that are from the Upper Realm?”
          Within Ah Da’s glowing eyes, a hint of doubt appeared as he asked
          respectfully.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Just kill them, there’s nothing wrong about it.” Gu Changge nodded
          gently, his expression stoic.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Yes.” Space blurred and a crack appeared. At the speed of light, Ah
          Da’s figure stepped into the crack and disappeared. Afterwhich, Gu
          Changge held the Grand Flask and walked into the Bronze Palace. Wisps
          of red light rushed towards Chan Hongyi’s body. The Life Forces that
          had started to thin in all directions, thickened again, like a sea of
          blood that floated in the air.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her face spelled confusion as she asked in a gentle voice,
          “Mas..Master…”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Yes?” Gu Changge glanced at her without a halt in his actions. Black
          Grand Runes fell into the pool. At the same time, he also threw in
          some glowing Heavenly Herbs. There were red agate-like fruits and
          transparent sacred branches that gave off a siLuer glow.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You… you want to cook me… like before?” Befuddled, Chan Hongyi
          watched the pool start to boil due to the horrifying effect caused by
          the Heavenly Herbs.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The temperature of the pool continuously rose to the point where it
          even bubbled with a *Gulu Gulu* sound.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Due to the steam, her small face became a little hot with a natural
          blush. However, this steam was a result of the condensation of Life
          Forces and extraordinary Heavenly Herbs. Each wisp contained an
          astonishing amount of vitality. Even the legendary Human Body Herbal
          Pill was nothing compared to this.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Cook?” Gu Changge flashed through his sea of memories and gently
          shook his head, “How many times have I told you? That’s called
          Building The Foundation And Toughening The Body.”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Oh&#8230;I remember, this is called Building The Foundation And
          Toughening The Body. Then…Master…once I am fully cooked, are you going
          to eat me?” Chan Hongyi was still a little confused. She felt like a
          stranger towards this new phrase. Instead, she remembered something
          else that was very important. With doe eyes, she looked towards Gu
          Changge with caution, hope and excitement.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Eat you?” Gu Changge raised his brows and moved closer to her. Her
          confusion had really gotten a little serious. Chan Hongyi nodded her
          head. Her confused expression revealed a rare seriousness, as if this
          matter was really important to her.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Mm…I’ve already grown up. Master, once you eat me, I…I can marry
          you.” She earnestly explained. It didn’t cross Gu Changge’s mind that
          the ‘eating’ that she mentioned actually meant this. Indeed, he
          remembered Chan Hongyi to be a little foolish, but definitely not to
          this extent.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Where did you hear this from?” Gu Changge asked in a gentle tone.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“From…from the auntie at the foot of the mountain, when I asked when
          I could marry Master. Back then…she…she said unless Master ate me.”
          Chan Hongyi’s voice grew softer and her expression was blank, as if
          she needed a lot of effort to recall.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After she said all that, she couldn’t help but tug Gu Changge’s
          sleeve, “Mas…Master, can you please don’t kill auntie. Aun..Auntie is
          a good person, she even taught me how to cook. I…I want to cook for
          Master…” In her memory, Gu Changge rarely allowed her to interact with
          strangers. Many strangers who tried ways to approach her were killed
          by him mercilessly. Once, an entire Immortal Family was eliminated
          because their Young Master tried to approach her.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I won’t kill anyone this time.” Gu Changge rubbed her head with calm
          eyes, “Focus on healing.”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Okay…Okay…” Chan Hongyi obediently nodded her head.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Over the next few days, the Bronze Palace was filled with a faint red
          mist. Gu Changge paid attention to the happenings of the outside and
          got his subordinates to relay news to him. What interested him most
          was that many forces and people were speculating if he was dead or
          alive. Some said he died from a fall, others said he was kidnapped by
          the Demoness. There were different opinions from all corners. The
          Demon Slaying Event in the Divine City this time, could be said to
          have caused a huge sensation in the Upper Realm. The number of
          cultivators who died was countless, those who managed to escape were
          also with horrendous injuries that needed a very long time to heal.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Naturally, the worst were the monks from Buddhist Mountain, who all
          died tragically, without a single survivor. This caused many people to
          guess Gu Changge’s whereabouts. Regardless of young or old, all eyes
          were on him and everyone wanted to know if he was still alive.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To Gu Changge, this didn’t really matter to him. This was because he
          didn’t need to feign death to trick his enemies. As of today’s Upper
          Realm, there was no enemy that could push him to such an extent. His
          main concern was Chan Hongyi. She was a ticking time bomb. She was
          extremely difficult to control. Her hostility was unstable, it could
          manifest into how it was in the Divine City at any time. As her
          injuries healed, her abilities would just become more terrifying.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge checked her injuries before, her current state was less
          than one percent of her at her peak. Now, he could only stabilise her
          Divine Soul before he planned for anything else. The Upper Realm was
          already in a different epoch, it lacked Immortal materials and it was
          extremely difficult for Chan Hongyi to recover completely. Her current
          dazed state was easy to deal with, once she entered her maniacal
          state, it would be a hundred times more difficult to control her.
          During this period, Chan Hongyi’s injuries gradually healed, this also
          meant that once she entered her maniacal state, her abilities would
          just be more terrifying. However, Gu Changge also made backup plans,
          just in case he couldn’t control her when that time came.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A few days later, the radius of a hundred thousands of kilometres
          around the Sanctuary for Resurrection was sucked dry of all Life
          Force. The faint red glow that once floated above the Boundary Marker
          Sea had subsided, it would take at least tens of millions of years for
          it to reappear.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge left the Bronze Palace with Chan Hongyi, but the outside
          world still couldn’t know about her whereabouts. That was why, after
          careful deliberation, Gu Changge left her in his Inner World.
          Currently, he had no plans to return to the Gu Family, he still had
          some things to deal with in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >According to Ah Da’s reports, the Fortuitous One, Chu Hao, had
          appeared in the Boundary Marker Sea attempting to break into the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains. Gu Changge estimates that after he kills
          Chu Hao, he should be able to breakthrough to the Quasi-Nirvana Realm.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, as time passed, the All-Repelling Force at the north of the
          Boundary Marker weakened and it had attracted many people there.

          >A large black cloud swept across the sky, causing it to shake. It was
          a vast majestic warship with many cultivators. They were like ants on
          a miniature boat. Rays of golden light surrounded their bodies,
          creating a divine appearance. However, it was difficult for the more
          powerful experts to pass through the All-Repelling Force. Though it
          was possible, they would have to pay a huge price. However, to the
          younger generation, this was a great opportunity for a trial. Almost
          all Immortal Forces, which included the Immortal Gu Family, already
          had members of their younger generation here to fight against the
          younger generation of the other world.

          >The previous time, Gu Changge appeared as a Dharma Body made from the
          Power of Faith. To cross the Boundary Marker Sea was very difficult
          for others, but to Gu Changge, who is proficient in the Power of
          Space, it was like walking on flat ground. Although the journey was
          filled with dangers, it was difficult for any of them to injure him.

          he strode on the waves of the Boundary Marker Sea as if there was an
          invisible golden path that stretched beneath his feet, which
          suppressed the strong waves. He was quick and he moved tens of
          thousands of kilometres with each step.

          ahead. It was surrounded by black light and was extremely hideous and
          frightening. It seemed to be as large as a island. It lived in the
          Boundary Marker Sea and wasn’t afraid of the sea’s strong waves. Its
          body was densely covered in black scales that were as hardy as
          Immortal Gold. This Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon noticed Gu
          Changge’s expression and bared its teeth to show a ferocious look
          before leaping at him.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, at the very next moment, when the terrifying and strong
          force of the sea swept towards it, it trembled out of fear. Its soul
          almost flew away from fright and it jumped down into the depths of the
          Boundary Marker Sea.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“How nice. Since I’m in the Sacred Emperor Realm now, it just so
          happens that I lack a mount.” Gu Changge nodded his head gently and
          walked towards it calmly.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">,..</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the banks of
          the Boundary Marker Sea, was just a barren yellow dessert. Endless
          yellow sand rolled and submerged the space between heaven and earth as
          several bones would occasionally be exposed. No one knew how many
          cultivators of the Ten Domains and the Eight Directions died here,
          after all, they died as they resisted the invasion of the Upper Realm.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite being buried by the wind and sand for many years, the bones
          glistened with a white glow. Areas of barren hills and mountains were
          scattered all over the place, some peaks were incomparably strange,
          with brilliant rays of light and shrouded in divine splendour. Some
          desolate forests laid among them and were shrouded in thick chaotic
          fog. From time to time, a beast that was as big as a mountain could be
          seen crossing the sky and stopping here.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Some areas were fortresses built by the cultivators of the Ten
          Domains and Eight Direction a long time ago. They were as big as
          stars. But, they were already damaged. It was obvious that most were
          damaged by objects that fell from the sky, creating multiple large
          craters on the ground. From a bird’s eye, the state of this place was
          devastating, with traces of previous battles all over the place. This
          was a dangerous site with magnificent mountains and yellow sand.
          However, there was a very unusual scene. Hidden in the depths, was a
          group of people trekking.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They passed through ancient trees that seemed to have dried up and
          lost all vitality, but still stayed rooted and grew. Many ferocious
          black birds could be seen resting on them. Their eyes were like cold
          knives and their chirps penetrated the void.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This group of trekkers were all very careful. They weren’t considered
          small in number, about twenty to thirty people, with both humans and
          non-humans. There were many young people, but there were also many old
          people. There was a precious glow on their bodies, hinting that their
          might was of a frightening level.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“It is said that the Spirit Gourd Master of our world once fought
          against an Absolute Being from that world called Tai Shang. It was
          difficult to determine a winner and in the end, they created a space
          to hide in. They both died of overexhaustion, but their inheritance
          and many relics, including their artifacts, were all left in that
          space. However, that space is also very strange, it only appears when
          there are terrifying fluctuations of battle nearby. Otherwise, we
          would never be able to find the entrance on an ordinary day.”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Within this group, a young girl spoke. She was tall and graceful,
          with long, dark green, silky hair, even her eyes were of a dark green.
          She had exquisite facial features and was undoubtedly a rare beauty.
          Her entire body was covered in a fresh plant-like scent, which made
          others feel peaceful. Many young men looked at her with admiration.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her name was Lu Luo and she was of an ancient race in the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains. Within her body, flowed the blood of the
          ancient ‘God of Life’. She was of one with nature, all kinds of Nature
          spells could be cast at her fingertips without difficulty. At the same
          time, she was also a famous goddess of the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. Among the younger generation, she had many suitors.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“If it weren’t for aftershocks from the battle between the two worlds
          reaching here, I’m afraid this space would’ve never appeared. Seems
          like we are going to benefit from the sidelines.” The rest of the
          young men and women nodded their heads as they heard Lu Luo’s words.
          Their eyes flickered and their aura was completely different from
          those from the Upper Realm.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, their statuses were high.
          The powers of their families were ancient and the secrets they were
          privy to were many. That was why they decided to come here in search
          of this mysterious space after a discussion.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“We must not be careless. Since we know about this place, then those
          on the other side may not know about it.” At that moment, a man in
          black who had slightly younger features opened his mouth. His hair was
          really long, but his facial features weren’t the best. His figure
          wasn’t that tall and he was even a little lanky. However, he had an
          aura that was difficult to ignore. His eyes were radiant and his palms
          were covered in faint dragon scales. His knuckles were large and some
          were covered in calluses, it was obvious that he often practised
          various spells and skills. He was calm and composed in how he presents
          himself.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Since Brother Lin said so, I shall be careful.” The expressions of
          the rest of the young men and women all turned serious as they
          listened to his words. They were obviously in awe of the man in front
          of them. Even a goddess like Lu Luo, couldn’t help but admire him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This man was Lin Wu, he was from the ancient Blood Dragon Clan and
          was a legendary genius in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. His
          glamour was dazzling and he was even regarded as a peerless character
          of the younger generation. His birth could only be regarded as humble
          as he was born to a concubine of the Lin Clan. If it weren’t for the
          drunken moment of folly by the head of the Lin Clan, Lin Wu probably
          wouldn’t exist.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before the age of thirteen, Lin Wu wasn’t special in any way. In
          fact, he lagged far behind those who were of the same age and was not
          valued by his family at all. However, in the year he turned thirteen,
          when he awakened his Dragon Bloodline, his abilities were so powerful
          that it shocked everyone.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He could be called a sword that was refined over more than ten years
          due to the dazzling brilliance he gave off. He was talented such that
          there was nothing in this world that he couldn’t learn. No matter how
          difficult the skill, he could master it in the shortest amount of time
          possible. In summary, there were two types of geniuses in aristocratic
          families, one type was Lin Wu and the other type was everyone else.
          After he lagged behind his peers for more than ten years, it was
          simply a miracle that Lin Wu caught up from behind and became a
          dazzling invincible existence. However, the terrors of Lin Wu laid in
          how gifted he was.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In today’s Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, it seemed as if the
          golden age was about to erupt with all kinds of horrors and evildoers.
          Dazzling stars in chaos, only Lin Wu could be regarded as one of them.
          “I just don’t know the probability of us winning this battle. I heard
          a problem occurred on the other side, otherwise, there wouldn’t have
          been so many cultivators heading in this direction…”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As if she thought of something, Goddess Lu Luo sighed. Her expression
          was bitter and helpless, with a hint of deep melancholy and fear. At
          the mention of the great battle, almost everyone’s eyes flashed hatred
          and anger. It wasn’t the first time such a thing happened to the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains. There have been many of such occurrences
          since the ancient times. The damaged war fortresses on the banks of
          the Boundary Marker Sea were the result of the endless years of war.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, everyone cautiously hurried forward again to avoid the many
          ferocious beasts of here.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Goddess Lu Luo saw how Lin Wu was deep in thought and couldn’t help
          but ask, “Lin Wu, are you thinking about what happened in the past?”
          Lin Wu nodded silently.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“My condolences. At his last breath, Brother Qingyang didn’t give in.
          He died as a brave soldier and has definitely lived up to the name of
          the Blood Dragon War God.” Lu Luo sighed. She knew Lin Wu had a close
          relationship with his brother, Qingyang. However, some time ago, Lin
          Qingyang fought against a youth on that battlefield. When he was about
          to end his opponent’s life, he was smacked to death by a horrifying
          existence from behind. Together with an Ancestor of the Lin Clan, they
          died tragically on the spot. Both turned into bloodmist and died
          without a trace. This matter angered Lin Wu for a really long time as
          hatred burnt his eyes red.

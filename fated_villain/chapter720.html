        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among these Fortuitous Ones Gu Changge had personally molded, Wang Qi, who had been betrayed by his childhood sweetheart and had his Dantian destroyed before, was thriving in his original world after getting his revenge. He was a Fortuitous One, Gu Changge had high hopes for. </span><span id="more-36183"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, for Wang Qi, the existence of Dark Heaven was of great importance. It not only helped him get his revenge but also became his biggest reliance on stepping out of his original world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, to Gu Changge, such Fortuitous Ones were nothing more than pawns he nurtured only to be sacrificed. Compared to ordinary cultivators, the Power of Faith that the Fortuitous Ones could provide was more pure and profound, and even contained the Power of Fortuity from their original world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Dark Heaven was like a shadow, constantly seeping into every corner of the vast universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I should go after the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being after dealing with the Eternal Overcast. He should be contemplating over the mysteries of those ancient well fragments.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze turned profound when he returned back to reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn&#8217;t in a hurry to take action against the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, as he didn&#8217;t have complete confidence at the moment. Of course, the main reason was that Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t clear about the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s intentions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days passed, and news of Gu Changge&#8217;s appearance at the Immortal Gu Family quickly spread, causing shock among various parties. Also, the presence of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being remained contained, as instructed by many Gu Family Elders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many were guessing about Gu Changge&#8217;s whereabouts during this time, and they believed rumours about him deliberately hiding and avoiding attention to be true. After all, he hadn&#8217;t made his presence known for such a long time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!* </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the universe roared, and the void tore apart at the edge of the Eternal Overcast, ancient battleships with massive &#8216;Gu&#8217; inscribed banners descended and attracted the attention of all the cultivators in the surrounding area, shocking them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many powerful cultivators appeared with their auras surging on those ancient battleships, as if they were going to penetrate the sky. At the forefront of these ancient battleships was a young man who stood with his hands behind his back. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wore a black robe that fluttered in the wind, and he had a magnificently dashing face with a gentle smile hanging on his lips as if he was an Immortal who had descended upon the world. At the same time, a hazy and blurry immortal light surrounded him, like an ancient world that had levitated for thousands of years, giving off a terrifying and trembling aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment when the cultivators around the Eternal Overcast saw him, they were all shocked and couldn&#8217;t believe their eyes. The surrounding area surged as though a violent wave had swept towards them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge…&#8221; Astonishment enveloped the faces of many young prodigies such as the Phoenix Lady, Jun Yao, Jin Yun, as well as Chosen Monk Jin Chan. None thought Gu Changge would dare appear at the edge of the Eternal Overcast and face the entire Upper Realm at this time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He appeared so casual and indifferent, as if none of the rumours bothered him, despite the fact that he was still falsely accused of being the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They knew that all of it was a plot by various Forces to get rid of Gu Changge. However, ordinary cultivators didn&#8217;t know that. They just followed the trend of the world and regarded Gu Changge as the true Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, who knew just how much danger Gu Changge would encounter here?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;s really bold. Is he not worried about being besieged and killed?&#8221; Said Jun Yao enigmatically while shaking his head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the True Daoist Elders from various Forces stood in the deep void, where a vast and majestic aura filled the air as if it could evolve chaos and open up the world. They appeared slightly grim, for they didn&#8217;t expect Gu Changge to actually show up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To think he actually dares to show up. Is he not afraid of dying here? Looks like he really doesn&#8217;t care about all those rumours.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He really takes us as nothing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They genuinely wanted to eradicate Gu Changge, who posed a threat to them and the Forces behind them. However, the consequences of doing so were enormous and terrifying, and it would involve breaking deep Taboos, even leading to an Immortal Calamity. Hence, they were very cautious and would plan before taking action against Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, they sent their divine sense to several cultivators, commanding them to test Gu Changge&#8217;s current attitude.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this the edge of the Eternal Overcast outbreak?&#8221; Gu Changge mumbled to himself while standing on the ancient battleship and looking at the vast grey mist in front of him, ignoring the gazes of all around him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, he already knew the answer. After all, he knew full well why the Eternal Overcast suddenly erupted and swept through the Upper Realm. He was the reason behind it!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Gu. The Eternal Overcast has been spreading ceaselessly for the past few days, but nothing we did could stop it. As of now, it spans millions of kilometres and is still spreading at a terrifying speed towards the surrounding Star Territories,&#8221; A nearby veteran cultivator spoke up deferentially after hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s mumble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Upper Realm claimed Gu Changge to be the real Successor of Demonic Arts, many who were shrewd knew it was defamation at first glance. They knew it was a common trick used by various Immortal Forces to find a justifiable reason to attack Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any excuse could serve a tyrant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would Gu Changge show himself at this time if he really was the Successor of Demonic Arts?!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that more living beings will perish if this calamity isn&#8217;t stopped. I&#8217;ve been delayed by some matters lately. I hope I haven&#8217;t come too late.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head in an apparent sigh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, Young Master Gu  has been delayed by some matters lately. He hasn&#8217;t hidden away because of the rumours…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What did I tell you? Young Master Gu isn&#8217;t someone to be afraid of these rumours!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. Knowing Young Master Gu, there&#8217;s no way he will back down from such issues. It&#8217;s obvious some people insist on defaming him. I&#8217;m not one to believe Young Master Gu is the Successor of Demonic Arts! This is absolute blasphemy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cultivators in the surrounding area burst into a tumult, and the young ones, especially, were thrilled and saw Gu Changge as a role model.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​Meanwhile, the Phoenix Lady and Jun Yao, among others, also exchanged a silent glance. They believed they knew Gu Changge pretty well and always felt that he wasn&#8217;t as upright and honourable as he presented himself as. His usual gentle and humble appearance was nothing more than a facade. Still, the claim that he was the Successor of Demonic Arts was just too far-fetched, and there was no evidence to support it either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Justice lies in the hearts of the people. I have always acted with a clear conscience and am not afraid of the schemes of some malicious individuals,&#8221; Gu Changge said with a faint smile before descending from the ancient battleship and walking casually into the void.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, majestic Yin Energy rushed towards them and nearly devoured the souls of the cultivators. The surrounding void also began to twist and collapse due to this energy, becoming extremely blurred.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as Gu Changge struck his palm forward, the Eternal Overcast Fog in front of him began to collapse and gradually dissipate, stunning everyone who was looking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the True Daoist Elders standing in the depths of the sky, furrowed their brows in response, couldn&#8217;t shake off the feeling that the young man had a hidden agenda.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This Eternal Overcast Fog appears to be more intimidating than all of the previous ones. No wonder it&#8217;s surging so wildly.&#8221; Gu Changge frowned. He beckoned with his hand, and a strand of Eternal Overcast Fog coiled around his hand, emitting a frightening and terrifying hissing sound.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, his flesh and blood disintegrated with breakneck speed, eaten away by the Eternal Overcast Fog, quickly revealing his ivory bone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t use any powers. He seemed to have done it only to test the terrifying corrosiveness of the Eternal Overcast Fog. However, this was so shocking to others that chills ran down their spines as cold sweats drenched them. It was absolutely unbelievable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I remember correctly, Young Master Gu&#8217;s abilities far exceed that of ordinary True Daoists. To think even his physical body is corroded…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we ventured into it recklessly, we&#8217;d have been swallowed up by that mist immediately, to the point of no return!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;d all die for nothing if it wasn&#8217;t for Young Master Gu.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many cultivators gulped in apprehension and backed up unconsciously, not daring to get any closer to the fog.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is this guy up to? Does he really intend to investigate the Eternal Overcast Fog?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This Eternal Overcast Fog might be terrifying, but it hasn&#8217;t reached a degree where it can corrode the physical body of a True Daoist.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the True Daoist Elders of various Forces were baffled by Gu Changge&#8217;s intentions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge&#8217;s brows remain furrowed. Unsure if it was because of the pain or that he was studying the composition of the Eternal Overcast Fog.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Only by understanding the source of these substances can we completely solve this disaster.&#8221; Gu Changge muttered as if explaining. He willingly touched the energy when not even True Doaists would.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, many cultivators around him stood up solemnly. None of them expected Gu Changge to come all the way here just to stop this calamity, preventing more people from dying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sense of responsibility for the greater good of the people made them revere him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the older cultivators who had some problems with Gu Changge were now surging with mixed feelings. Either way, they wouldn&#8217;t dare touch the Eternal Overcast Fog like the young man just did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this, only the Saintess of Mortal Palace, Jiang Chuchu, had taken the huge risk and ventured deep into it while everyone else watched from the sides, only intervening in the spread of the fog when necessary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can&#8217;t really learn anything like this.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head lightly as a radiant light shone on his corroded finger, restoring it to its original state in two shakes. &#8220;Looks like venturing into it is the only way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, even reforming his whole body from a drop of blood was a piece of cake given his current cultivation level, not to mention when he could heal quickly, even if his physical body was dismantled to nearly the point of no return. He was practically unkillable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No doubt. He has appeared at this time to garner fame by standing by the common people. Given his abilities, there&#8217;s no way he could be corroded by the fog!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The rumour of him being the Successor of Demonic Arts will also be debunked just like that if he successfully deals with this Eternal Overcast Scourge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The True Daoists looked at each other and turned beyond grim. Some began to grasp Gu Changge&#8217;s intention.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, a roar suddenly sounded from the crowd of cultivators in the distance. Then, a terrifying malice transformed into a burst of Sword Qi and slashed towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Successor of Demonic Arts must be killed. Gu Changge, you madman! You shall pay for slaughtering so many Young Prodigies!&#8221; a middle-aged man roared with bloodshot eyes as though he had some deep-seated hatred for Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, other cultivators also charged towards Gu Changge behind the middle-aged man.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their cultivations weren&#8217;t strong—they hadn&#8217;t even reached the Sacred Realm—yet they dared to kill Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kill him! Kill the Successor of Demonic Arts, and bring peace to the world. I will avenge my Junior! Kill Gu Changge; kill the Successor of Demonic Arts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scene alarmed everyone, and many hadn&#8217;t yet registered what was going on. They never thought someone would charge towards Gu Changge and kill him at his time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, some cultivators who were oblivious widened their eyes with confusion as well, unsure of what to do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh, what will Gu Changge do now? If he kills this cultivator even though he&#8217;s not the real Successor of Demonic Arts, then his whitewashing earlier would&#8217;ve been for nothing. But if he chooses not to do anything, he will have to swallow up this insult himself.&#8221; The several True Daoists mocked with great interest, having anticipated the sudden turn of events.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, they had arranged this episode for the purpose of testing Gu Changge&#8217;s reaction while also making his presence more unpleasant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious they&#8217;re not even in the Sacred Realm, yet they&#8217;re determined to kill Gu Changge. If they aren&#8217;t the Death Knights of a certain Force, then I don&#8217;t know what is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This might not be ruthless, but it does leave a sour note in your mouth. If Gu Changge remains impassive, he will only lose the people&#8217;s hearts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some young prodigies, such as Jun Yao and the Phoenix Lady, quickly reacted and wore extremely profound expressions on their faces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the other cultivators watched the group of men charge towards Gu Changge, an emotionless voice reverberated through the space, and an invisible ripple spread the next second. &#8220;Blasphemy! How dare the likes of you insult Young Master Gu?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terrifying aura surged like a raging storm that covered everything, and nearly all the cultivators had trouble breathing and felt as though their bodies would explode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Poof, poof, poof…*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A burst of blood mist collapsed and spread in the void, and those Death Knights couldn&#8217;t even scream before they exploded and disintegrated into nothingness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Ah Er, formerly named Yan Luo. The towering former Fourth Palace Lord appeared behind Gu Change wearing a mask and a battle suit made of Hell&#8217;s Iron. He exuded a terrifying aura that could crush the void.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A Remnant Immortal…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many hidden True Daoists in the shadows turned apprehensive at once as chills ran down their spine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge remained unfazed throughout the episode. He even smiled and looked towards a certain spot in the void before saying, &#8220;Did no one go to explore the source of the sudden Eternal Overcast outbreak? Are all the True Doaoists here, from all these powerful Forces, just going to stand here and watch? I suggest you drop your petty trick of sending your Death Knights to their doom.&#8221;</span></p>

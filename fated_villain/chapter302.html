          highly favoured by the Elders of the Immortal Academy. If something

          protecting his heart, making it continue to circulate, and his soul.

          fell onto the flask-like object glowing faintly within his arms. Its
          markings looked extremely old and the object looked slightly rusted.
          It looked extraordinary even though it had blood on it.</span

          kidnapped Qing Xiaoyi was extremely strong and was at least in the
          Sacred Realm. Even her Quasi-Sacred Grade spear should be able to be
          used in a fight against someone in the Sacred Realm or higher, yet it
          had broken into pieces when the person raised their finger. Such
          terrifying power did not belong to just a simple Sacred Realm
          expert.</span

          Mighty-Transcendent Realm yet. He wouldn&#8217;t be able to stand a
          strand of a Sacred Realm expert’s might, let alone a strike of a palm.
          Thus, it made sense that his body blew up.</span

          definitely not just in the Sacred Realm. He’s most likely an ancient
          monstrosity.] Gu Xianer hypothesised, as no normal Sacred Realm expert
          would possess such might. Besides, she was a little confused as to why
          this expert seemed to avoid her after she attacked. [Was it someone I
          know? But, who would want to kidnap Qing Xiaoyi?]</span

          Qing Xiaoyi will meet an unfortunate end&#8230;] She sighed, more
          confused than anything. She hoped that Qing Feng would know something
          when he wakes up. Otherwise, it would be hard to find Qing Xiaoyi,
          without any more information.</span

          in, planning to heal Qing Feng first. His injury was clearly fatal,
          showing that the attacker had decided to kill him, yet he still had
          some life in him after withstanding a palm strike from a Sacred Realm

          seen many injuries, yet this was the first time they saw someone come
          back from death&#8217;s door. If it wasn&#8217;t due to extraordinary
          luck, then it was just because it wasn&#8217;t his time yet.</span

          notice the flask but did not explore it further. They did not have Gu

          uniqueness.

          unsavoury thoughts towards the flask. Even if she was miserly,
          covetous, and would do anything to win, she still had her principles.
          She would never take advantage of someone while they were down.</span

          by her. Yet, she couldn&#8217;t protect the two of them as their
          Senior. This made the proud girl a little uncomfortable. Had it been
          Gu Changge in her place, this wouldn&#8217;t have happened to them,
          and the mysterious person wouldn&#8217;t have even been able to

          humiliated multiple times in front of him and now unable to capture
          that mysterious person. She suspected that her Master back at the
          Peach Village had lied to her when they said her strength could crush
          all of her peers, and she was peerless. Now, her suspicion has been

          hand when he finished speaking, meaning that he couldn&#8217;t hear
          her neverending ramblings. He glanced at Qing Xiaoyi, unconscious in
          his arms. As the void before him blurred, he stepped into it and soon
          left the territory of the Azure Dragon Empire.

          Qing Feng, partly in concern of killing him by accident. He obviously
          knew that the youth had the Flask of World Domination. After all, this

          >Jun Yao smiled and closed his eyes, not caring about it anymore. He
          had already deduced the truth but didn&#8217;t want to disturb the
          calm yet. The Successor of Demonic Arts, Ying Shuang, had been able to
          collaborate with Zhi Yang in secret. This means that he has been
          underestimating Ying Shuang all this time. Thus, it was no surprise
          that he could escape whole and unscathed at Gu Changge&#8217;s
          hand.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Everyone else is still being tricked. It’s uncertain if Gu
          Changge could see the truth,&#8221; Jun Yao muttered, feeling a little
          excited and holding some expectations. He would be a little
          disappointed with Gu Changge if he couldn&#8217;t even do that. Such a
          powerful enemy was still weak after all.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[The Successor of Demonic Arts? Are they trying to blame me again? No
          way! The King with Six Crowns saw me himself, and he could prove that
          it wasn&#8217;t me!]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ying Shuang, the usual suspect, had heard of the news as well. He had
          felt shocked before finally understanding, and wore an annoyed
          expression on his face. From what everyone&#8217;s saying, they all
          suspected the Successor of Demonic Arts of orchestrating this, meaning
          that he was once again being used as a scapegoat for no reason.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Gu Changge has no grudges against me, so why is he trying to corner
          me like this? So what if the King with Six Crowns knows that I
          didn&#8217;t do it?] Ying Shuang felt frustrated and angry, clenching
          his fists in dissatisfaction. He couldn&#8217;t do anything about the
          situation, though, not even giving his explanation.</span

          >&#8220;You&#8217;ve been following my Mistress for the past few days.
          Just what do you want?&#8221; Suddenly, a cold female voice spoke from
          beside him. He immediately came back to himself and looked towards the
          attractive girl approaching him from the side.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I…&#8221; Ying Shuang got stunned and mumbled, before
          remembering he was beside a street stall. The girl, dressed like a
          maid, was currently looking at him contemptuously. He hadn&#8217;t
          expected to be noticed by Yin Mei when he had been so careful; the
          girl in question was now frowning as she stared at him in suspicion
          and confusion.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;m not a bad person,&#8221; he smiled honestly as he
          rubbed his nose.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You dare say that when you&#8217;ve followed our Mistress for
          so many days?&#8221; The maid&#8217;s gaze was unfriendly. Runes
          flickered as energy flowed through her body, showing she was ready to
          attack him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Please don&#8217;t attack me. I&#8217;m really a good
          person!&#8221; Ying Shuang said hurriedly, not wanting to offend her
          because of such a trivial thing and make her dislike him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Xiao Zhu, let him come here.&#8221; Yin Mei sighed. &#8220;I
          also think he&#8217;s not that bad of a person. I seem to see someone
          familiar in him…&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her voice wasn&#8217;t loud, filled with some helplessness and
          sadness. Yet, Ying Shuang heard it all the same. He froze and his eyes
          widened as he came to the realisation. He had a broad guess about what
          she meant, [did she see traces of her former horse feeder?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He became excited at that thought and was greatly moved by it.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[It&#8217;s been so long, yet Lady Yin Mei had never forgotten about
          me, even though I was just a mere horse feeder.] Ying Shuang had no
          idea what he was feeling when he approached her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What&#8217;s your name? Are you someone from the Immortal
          Academy?&#8221; Yin Mei&#8217;s voice rang out again, getting his
          attention.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He froze and for some reason shook his head. &#8220;No.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was trying to calm his excited heart. The last time she had asked
          for his name, was when he had been bullied by a gang of people and
          nearly died by the street.</span

          proudly before her now. I will let her know who truly holds the best
          of intentions for her.] Ying Shuang felt overwhelmed as he could
          finally speak formally to her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No?&#8221; Yin Mei looked a little disappointed. &#8220;If you
          aren&#8217;t someone from the Immortal Academy, then why are you
          here?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ying Shuang didn&#8217;t know what to say to that. If he wasn&#8217;t
          from the Immortal Academy, then why was he here? Even so, he had no
          choice but to reply, &#8220;I&#8217;m actually someone from the
          Academy coming here for the trial. I&#8217;ve known about Lady Yin
          Mei&#8217;s existence for a while and I was attracted to you,
          so…&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;So you followed me in secret?&#8221; Yin Mei interrupted him
          lightly. &#8220;I won&#8217;t pursue this because of your honest
          attitude, but don&#8217;t let me see you ever again.&#8221;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She turned to leave, but Ying Shuang was rooted to the spot as he
          watched her retreating figure, feeling panicked. He already knew her
          very well from when he had been a horse feeder. He knew she would
          never let him go unharmed if she was really angry.</span
        >

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[This means that she isn&#8217;t actually enraged by my actions.
          Maybe, it’s because I look familiar. That means, I hold some
          importance in her heart…] Ying Shuang suddenly felt that being framed
          as the Successor of Demonic Arts wasn&#8217;t so bad after all. That
          his current situation was no longer dark and gloomy like before.</span

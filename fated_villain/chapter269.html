          front of the Immortal Academy&#8217;s mountain gate, the old man in
          white who was responsible for checking people&#8217;s bone age was
          startled and slightly shocked at first. Nonetheless, he soon

          Dragons, which engulfed all corners, leaving many young prodigies
          stunned with pale faces. They didn&#8217;t expect Gu Changge to have
          such an entourage as the weakest one among the Nine dragons pulling

          allowing Gu Changge to walk out from within. With a gentle face, he
          headed towards the old man in white with a slightly nodding head and
          smile. &#8220;Greetings, Elder Wang.&#8221;</span

          couldn&#8217;t help but widen his smile while the expression on his
          face became even more affable. His status in the Immortal Academy was
          still far away from a true Elder, so the moment Gu Changge addressed
          him in such a way, his heart suddenly fluttered a bit.</span

          status within the Immortal Academy was completely different from the
          others. For example, if he notified them about his arrival in advance,
          some Elders and ancient freaks would definitely show up to personally
          welcome him.</span

          find out that it was Gu Changge who arrived. However, there
          weren&#8217;t many people among the younger generations with such an
          entourage other than him.</span

          don&#8217;t you go into the mountain gate first and rest?&#8221; the
          old man in white said respectfully, which annoyed the young prodigies
          waiting in front of the mountain gate, but there was nothing they
          could do.</span

          been waiting here for a long time? We also want a &#8216;tiring
          journey&#8217; too if it means having the company of stunning beauties
          and sitting within the space of a white jade carriage. It&#8217;s

          asked with a calm face, ignoring the expressions of the young
          prodigies behind him and looking at the ancient mirror in the hand of
          the old man in white.</span

          crystal-clear eyes, giving her the silent look of a goddess. His group

          astonishing.</span

          checking your bone age,&#8221; the old man answered and skipped the
          process while waving his hands hurriedly and chuckling.</span

          Overcast creatures, including the points of Su Qingge and his other
          followers, which were quite significant. Back when he was in the
          Eternal Overcast Battlefield in Southern Flourishing Heaven, he went
          to the deepest part of the land and killed so many Eternal Overcast
          creatures that even if the points of everyone in front were added up,
          they would still be a long way away from him. This was because he
          randomly picked some of the stronger Eternal Overcast creatures’

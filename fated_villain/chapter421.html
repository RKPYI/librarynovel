        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shen Family owned a large, wide land, wherein spiritual springs and
                waterfalls flowing between mountaintops.</span><span id="more-30003"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, in a tranquil courtyard, donning a robe, a chivalric-looking
                young man with long hair was bending over to water the plants before him. Seemingly youthful, somewhere
                in his early twenties, the young man was blessed with perfect features.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There wasn&#8217;t any mystical energy wafting around his body, but between
                every movement of his, he seemed to be merged with the environment of his surroundings as many spiritual
                birds landed upon his gestures, while butterflies danced and stopped on the flowers and grass in the
                courtyard.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Speak no more. I shall leave, naturally, when the time comes, but it
                is not now,&#8221; the young man spoke to the Elder at the doorway of the courtyard with his back facing
                them. His voice was calm, unaffected despite the fact that it was the Second Elder of the Shen Family
                who was standing behind him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, his face was stern as he was attentively watering every
                stalk of flower and blade of grass while bending over to dispose of withered weeds. It was as though the
                person behind him was no more important than the floras in front of him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the Second Elder of the Shen Family was the very Elder who
                was aggressively against the idea of Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s marital arrangement. His face was gloomy
                and his lips were thin, and he was visibly vexed by those words.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Li Xiu, you should know where to draw the line! We are well aware of
                the agreement back then. Why are you being like this now? All these years, when have the Shen Family
                mistreated you? Do you not remember who it is that foraged for the numberless spirit herbs and age
                fruits to treat your fractured Spiritual Sea?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the young man named Li Xiu gently shook his head. &#8220;I did
                not concur with the matter as it was you who imposed it on me. And as I have said, I shall leave the
                Shen Family Residence once the time arrives. By then, I will not remain even if you beg for me to stay.
                Besides, I did not ask for the mending of my fractured Spiritual Sea. In fact, I have explicitly
                remarked that it would only be a waste of time. Yet, you were ignorantly stubborn. Of course, without
                me, Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s grandfathers would have died years ago. I am their saviour. Is this how
                the Shen Family treat their saviours?&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Xiu blandly sneered. His tone was natural, albeit with a hint of mockery,
                as if he was describing a trivial, meaningless matter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, such condescension coming from him deepened the anger within the
                Second Elder of the Shen Family. &#8220;Stop the jest!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a dull face, he continued, &#8220;The marriage will unquestionably be
                voided. In no way is a good-for-nothing who came out of nowhere like you deserving of being with the
                prodigal damsel of the Shen Family! So stop fantasising about Xianer, for she will never marry you! Were
                you wise enough, you&#8217;d leave the Shen Family Residence. That way we&#8217;d part with no bad
                blood. Even if that mysterious Master of yours were to show up now, my words still stand
                regardless.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was aware that Li Xiu&#8217;s mysterious Master was formidable as the
                latter was able to rescue both Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s grandfathers from a hazardous land.
                Furthermore, according to her grandfathers&#8217; remarks afterwards, Li Xiu&#8217;s Master effortlessly
                repelled the Principles of Chaos on Boundary Marker Sea with a swing of one hand, which could only be
                pulled off by someone in at least the Sacred Emperor Realm. Hence they decided to befriend Li Xiu and
                his Master.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, that was also the very factor of the discord among the Elders
                now. After all, since Li Xiu&#8217;s mysterious Master had been missing for the last three years, none
                could fathom whether he was dead or alive. Moreover, a cultivator that surpassed the Sacred Emperor
                Realm was regarded as the mightiest being in Heavenly Tide Realm, whom none would dare to upset.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Li Xiu faintly grinned, feigning indifference. &#8220;As
                I&#8217;ve said, I don&#8217;t have a Master, and if it is Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s will to revoke the
                marriage arrangement, she should speak to me herself. She may be a dazzling, superb damsel in your eyes,
                but there&#8217;s nothing special about her to me. Had her grandfather not pleaded so desperately back
                then, do you think I&#8217;d have agreed with this?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was being truthful. Shen Xian&#8217;er honestly bore no value to him. Yet,
                he was irked by her reluctance to see him and desire to deem the marriage arrangement void on one side.
                Simply, he couldn&#8217;t allow himself to stoop so low as to let another back out on a promise—the
                marriage arrangement—bestowed upon him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Such absurdity! Fine, since you said so, I shall bring Xian’er over
                and have her speak to you about it personally.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Xiu&#8217;s words drew the Second Elder of the Shen Family&#8217;s
                sardonic snicker, as it was the first time the latter encountered such a rampant individual. Prior to
                this, he had never expected Li Xiu&#8217;s high-sounding sentiments. [Does he truly believe that he is
                above us because he has a powerful Master?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Li Xiu merely shot him a glance before bending over and casually
                continuing to tend to his plants.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letting out a scoff, the Second Elder of the Shen Family speedily left the
                courtyard, but right after he walked out of it, the Communication Rune tucked on his chest suddenly lit
                up. At once, an ever so stern expression surged on his face as he was also visibly nervous and anxious,
                after which he pulled out the Communication Rune.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? That young man is coming to the Heavenly Tide Realm?&#8221; The
                Second Elder of the Shen Family was dazed for a moment upon seeing the content within the Communication
                Rune before finding himself dumbfounded as his voice shivered with uncontrollable excitement. He could
                barely hold the Communication Rune, almost dropping it on the ground, and he seemed like a completely
                different person from how he was behaving in front of Li Xiu.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that expression of his, Li Xiu furrowed his brows, seemingly somewhat
                surprised. Although he was aware of the influence and power of the Second Elder of the Shen Family, he
                couldn&#8217;t help but wonder what it was that evoked such reverent attitude, even causing his entire
                body to tremble.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Young man?] As Li Xiu caught the Second Elder of the Shen Family muttering
                those words, he began to ponder and infer, but he wasn&#8217;t fazed by it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, fool that knows not his place, I shall have you behold what an
                absolute being looks like!&#8221; The Second Elder of the Shen Family sneered and after glancing at Li
                Xiu, he hastily departed, intending to inform the rest of the family members regarding the news to
                receive their guest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not many were aware of the fact that the Second Elder of the Shen Family came
                in contact with an individual from the Upper Realm. Back then, he was informed that an unparalleled
                young man, who held absolute dominance, was from a certain family, and was looking for someone who
                carried the surname &#8216;Gu&#8217;. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now that he received the news that this man was coming to Heavenly Tide
                Realm, he was thoroughly stupefied. He quickly figured out that Gu Xianer must be related to it. Thus,
                without any further delays, he hurried to confer with the fellow Elders.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s parents were prejudiced against this
                young man due to a matter in the past, the latter, at the end of the day, carried the bloodline of that
                certain family, which signified an impeccable opportunity to the Shen Family.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, amid a valley, wherein Celestial Mists drifted and reishi thrived
                across the lands filled with radiant mists, pebbles gleamed like gems as traces of purple lights wafted
                everywhere, making the mountains resemble the Celestial Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Mrs. Shen, Mr. Gu, and Shen Xian&#8217;er were still
                expressing their disdain towards Gu Changge over the incident in the past.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xianer, please stop defending him.&#8221; Mrs. Shen looked at Gu
                Xianer sadly.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a cold face, Gu Xianer listened to her mother&#8217;s expression and
                felt helpless, after which she explained, &#8220;Father, Mother, you misunderstand. Gu Changge is really
                not to be blamed for the incident. Even at this second, he is doing all he can to make it up to me.
                I&#8217;m living well with the Gu Family Residence; the Elders treat me well. Some time ago, an Ancestor
                of our branch came out and almost obliterated the Ancient Sea Palace! Please, stop being stubborn. The
                Elders have been missing you.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Mrs. Shen shook her head and sighed. &#8220;Time has been harsh
                on you, Xianer. I understand your desire to protect the family&#8217;s name, but how can such a dreadful
                grudge be dismissed by mere words?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From her perspective, had Gu Xianer not sacrificed herself, Gu Changge
                wouldn&#8217;t have let her off so easily, let alone allow her to return to the Gu Family and willingly
                restore their former positions to them. Essentially, the excruciating pain of having one&#8217;s bone
                removed was indescribable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although we have not returned to the Gu Family Residence for years, we
                are still aware that Gu Changge only agreed with the Elders in bringing our branch members back in order
                to secure his position as the Young Master of the Gu Family. If it weren&#8217;t for this, he
                wouldn&#8217;t have been so kind,&#8221; Mr. Gu then noted as he clenched his fists, abhorring his own
                incompetence to do anything.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Xianer was merely a child when Gu Changge seized her Dao Bone back then.
                No matter how he would explain his side of the story, nothing could ever bury such harsh truth.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mother, Father…&#8221; Unable to find words to rebuke them, Gu Xianer
                was at a loss for words. She understood that her parents were concerned about her, but at the same time,
                she was also worried about the grave prejudice her parents bore towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the incident back then was connected with Gu Changge&#8217;s secret,
                which hindered her from being able to clarify the situation. She told her parents everything that
                recently happened between her and Gu Changge, yet their scepticism persisted.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sister, please speak no further. Now that you are back to the Shen
                Family, all is well. The four of us can live here in peace, together, forever,&#8221; Shen Xian&#8217;er
                softly said. Having been influenced ever since she was a child, she bore hostility towards Gu Changge
                despite never seeing him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are yet too young to comprehend certain things.&#8221; Gu Xianer
                sounded somewhat helpless. She had been repeatedly trying to clarify for days, yet it didn&#8217;t seem
                to have worked the way she wished. Her parents disdain towards Gu Changge was deep to their bone, and it
                would be extremely difficult to change their minds.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nevermind. Please halt the discussion of this matter. We should mind
                Xian’er&#8217;s problem instead.&#8221; As Gu Xianer&#8217;s parents were about to go on, she quickly
                waved her hand in fear that they would bring up more ridiculous matters. The only way she could change
                their opinion on Gu Changge was by making them visit the Gu Family Residence once, as well as Peach
                Village while they were at it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fine, fine. Let us stop, or you&#8217;ll be infuriated again.&#8221;
                Mrs. Shen sounded helpless as well, thinking that Gu Changge must have fed her something that would
                trigger her vexation every time they spoke of Gu Changge. Although Gu Xianer didn&#8217;t reflect her
                feelings on her face, the emotional changes in her heart was blatantly obvious to them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why would I be infuriated…&#8221; Right as Gu Xianer was about to
                refute, a divine rainbow flashed from outside the valley, when an individual approached Shen
                Xian&#8217;er and reported, &#8220;Lady Xian’er, the Saintess Yao Yue wishes to meet with you. She is
                currently by the gate.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saintess Yao Yue?&#8221; Hearing that, Shen Xian&#8217;er tensed her
                brows as an ominously bewitching figure popped up in her mind. It baffled her as to why the guest would
                visit the Shen Family at such a time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she had encountered Saintess Yao Yue numerous times, they
                weren&#8217;t exactly friends, given that they merely had a couple of exchanges. Yet, the latter came
                all the way to the Shen Family Residence and specifically requested to meet with her so
                unexpectedly.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saintess Yao Yue, the Successor of the Blazing Moon Holy Land? Why is
                she here?&#8221; Mrs. Shen, too, was confused. Although she had been living in hiding in the valley
                without stepping out the borders once, news regarding certain talents of Heavenly Tide Realm still found
                their ways to her ears.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saintess Yao Yue, was an amazing, dazzling prodigal damsel, who also happened
                to be the Successor of Blazing Moon Holy Land. She possessed formidable strength and domineering
                eminence, she was admired and pursued by numberless young prodigies. Often, enthusiasts would compare
                Saintess Yao Yue and the Shen Xian&#8217;er, the prodigal damsel of the Shen Family.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, that didn&#8217;t answer why Saintess Yao Yue would visit the
                Shen Family at such a moment, and what business she had come to Shen Xian&#8217;er with.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tell her I&#8217;ll be with her soon.&#8221; In spite of her
                suspicion, Shen Xian&#8217;er responded courteously.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Blazing Holy Land was the force with the longest history in
                Heavenly Tide Realm, which had existed even longer than the Shen Family, hence carrying unfathomable
                heritage. Moreover, there were rumours across Heavenly Tide Realm stating that the Ancestor of Blazing
                Holy Land had entered retreat somewhere in the depths all these years. Thus, they could neither
                ascertain if he had ascended or had died.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, once a cultivator of Heavenly Tide Realm broke through the
                Sacred Emperor Realm, it would be difficult for them to remain in this world. Thus, they would either
                attempt to conquer the world or enter retreat and seal their life force to prevent its deterioration so
                that it wouldn&#8217;t be detected by the World Principles.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancestors of the Shen Family, for instance, resorted to the latter. Thus,
                all this time, they had been in retreat in the ancestral land to seal their life force.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I shall accompany you.&#8221; Weirded out by the matter, Gu Xianer
                suggested, to which Shen Xian&#8217;er nodded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, the two turned into divine rainbows and departed from the valley
                as they headed to the gate of the Shen Family Residence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of the ancient, brilliant gate, grand, giant boulders stood as
                green, glowing mists wafted around them, adding a touch of agedness to its appearance.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many members of the Shen Family who were passing by were dazed by the sight
                upon them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A glamorous, captivating woman in a red dress was standing at the gates.
                Elegant and beguiling, her body ambiguously shimmered and a jade flute was tied to her waist. Behind
                her, there was a great number of followers, regardless of gender and age, including a number of those
                who possessed daunting strength and immeasurable cultivation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saintess, are we to wait here the entire time? What if Shen
                Xian&#8217;er has no intention of seeing us?&#8221; At that moment, behind the woman in red, an Elder
                whose head was filled with white hair impatiently asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman in red, being none other than Saintess Yao Yue herself, remained
                unaffected upon those words. &#8220;Shen Xian&#8217;er will come to us. Just wait a little
                longer.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was quite confident, not worried that Shen Xian&#8217;er would refrain
                from seeing her. As she was speaking, her gaze when she looked at the Shen Family Residence was somewhat
                complicated, though to be honest, she was concealing the awe lurking deep in her eyes, as if some sort
                of terrorising being dwelt beneath the residence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, two divine rainbows glided across the sky to the gate of the
                Shen Family Residence. They were Gu Xianer and Shen Xian&#8217;er.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Saintess Yao Yue was bewildered by the presence of Gu Xianer, whose
                visage was unfamiliar to her despite bearing resemblance to that of Shen Xian&#8217;er, she refrained
                from questioning it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To what do I owe the pleasure, Saintess Yao Yue?&#8221; Shen
                Xian&#8217;er took a look at Saintess Yao Yue&#8217;s party and blandly asked with a calm, unfaltering
                tone as she cut straight to the chase.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As her sole goal was to achieve the Great Dao, without being distracted by
                inconsequential stimuli, she was rather ignorant of sentiments, which led to her somewhat discourteous
                tone of speech.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, those standing behind Saintess Yao Yue were slightly annoyed, given
                that they had been waiting for quite a while. Worse, Shen Xian&#8217;er welcomed them with such
                bluntness instead of receiving them with amiable reminiscence. As one of the most distinguished ancient
                families in Heavenly Tide Realm, it was quite unacceptable for the Shen Family to do such a thing as it
                might suggest their condescension towards Blazing Moon Holy Land.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Saintess Yao Yue wasn&#8217;t bothered by it as she waved her
                hand. Having interacted with Shen Xian&#8217;er prior to this, she was aware that such was her
                personality. Therefore, she, too, immediately got to the point. &#8220;It is said that you are intent on
                voiding your marriage with the useless potential in-law of the Shen Family.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a frown, Shen Xian&#8217;er asked. &#8220;From where did you hear such
                news?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that the matter was only known by the members of the Shen Family, it
                was certainly peculiar for Saintess Yao Yue to be informed of it, unless a spy of hers lay within the
                Shen Family.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221; Seeing her expression, Saintess Yao
                Yue came to a realisation, after which she subconsciously revealed a grin and replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m
                already at your gate, Lady Xian’er. Have you not the intention to invite me in for a seat? The Shen
                Family is one of the top forces in the Heavenly Tide Realm. I am sure you are capable of pleasing your
                guests?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you plan to do?&#8221; Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s tone
                remained discourteous as she expressed her suspicion. [Why would Saintess Yao Yue inquire about that
                useless &#8216;in-law?&#8217;]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, she bore no bias against Li Xiu as she simply had no intention of
                marrying or having a child, given that all she wanted was to achieve the Great Dao. Even if Li Xiu
                wasn&#8217;t the good-for-nothing that he was, she would still disagree with the marriage
                arrangement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am purely curious to take a glimpse at the man whom the Shen Family
                took in, only to have his marriage arrangement with you revoked years later,&#8221; Saintess Yao Yue
                briefly answered with a smile.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, even Gu Xianer felt strange as to why Saintess Yao Yue would
                ask about Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s fiance.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since you insist, let us walk.&#8221; Shen Xian&#8217;er found no
                point in rejecting Saintess Yao Yue&#8217;s request. After all, her guests were only here to meet with
                Li Xiu through her. Although she bore no interest in Li Xiu, she would never limit his actions, nor
                would she interfere with others&#8217; desire to visit him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, Lady Xian’er.&#8221; Growing joyous, Saintess Yao Yue
                retained a decent smile without displaying her glee.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, she followed Shen Xian&#8217;er on her graceful steps; the hem of
                her red dress swayed as they went deeper into the Shen Family Residence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What does she truly want?] Gu Xianer, who had been witnessing from the side,
                felt a heavy surge of doubt in her heart, as though Saintess Yao Yue came with an ulterior
                motive.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, right at this moment, a dense aura arose from the Shen Family
                Residence. From the central palace, a bright light flashed, as a mighty wave of energy thrusted upward,
                engulfing the sky. It was actually just the surge of an ancient and powerful aura. From it came a number
                of figures, as they hurriedly dashed to the gate, seemingly extremely hasty.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, Saintess Yao Yue and the rest, who were hurrying to Li Xiu&#8217;s
                courtyard, grew perplexed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is happening? Are those not the Elders of the Shen Family?&#8221;
                She intuitively asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shen Xian&#8217;er was puzzled as well, as this was her first time witnessing
                a scene of such grand magnitude, wherein Elders were speedily rushing towards the gates, which the
                Elders never did in spite of the arrival of a formidable enemy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Something major must have happened to have all the Elders startled
                like this.&#8221; Shen Xian&#8217;er gently shook her head, quickly becoming unbothered by the sight,
                since it was unlikely for her to be relevant to such an occurrence.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Xianer revealed a glower as the sight reminded her of the day she
                arrived at the Shen Family Residence. Despite her discretion, the Elders of the Shen Family still came
                to welcome her with utmost respect.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Such a sight… He didn&#8217;t come all the way here, did he…&#8221; A
                bizarre sensation suddenly arose in her heart. Although her guess wasn&#8217;t impossible, Gu Changge
                wasn’t the kind who likes to dabble in something troublesome, let alone travelling all the way to
                Heavenly Tide Realm.</span></p>

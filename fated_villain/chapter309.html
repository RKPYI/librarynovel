<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the grey fog surged, the Grand Runes which intertwined in the void that had condensed into a Grand Flask was devouring Prince Shen&#8217;s Source. Many inherited divine abilities from Prince Shen’s bloodline flashed in Gu Changge&#8217;s mind, and caused him to slightly narrow his eyes. He found these divine abilities, which were originally inherited from Sky Emperor Shen, to not be able to even excite him.</span><span id="more-28389"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Sacred Emperor Grade golden magic lamp floated for a moment. A blaze of fire that could burn down the sky instantly made its appearance, but it dimmed just as quickly. The spirit of the artifact let out a roar of unease and fear, but such cries soon disappeared and returned to silence. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if it was just a Grand Flask that took shape from Grand Runes, it currently contained a petrifying power because of how powerful Gu Changge was. Furthermore, a Sacred Emperor Grade artifact with no Master was weak. Even if the Artifact Spirit awakens, it would still be like a rootless floating duckweed, unable to hang on for long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wonder what the Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest will give me this time…] Gu Changge pondered as he stood in the void, his white clothes fluttering. He looked as though he had just completed an easy task.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiftly after, he personally removed many traces of him, and replaced them with a scene that seemed as though a horrible battle had taken place. There, air thick with the aura of the Demonic Arts permeated every inch of the place. It was so thick it would bring a chill to anyone who stepped into this place. A chill made of fear, palpitations and terror!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This whole place seemed to have turned into a hell-like area. Not only was it thoroughly soaked in Yin Energy, there was also a strong and powerful aura of the Forbidden Demonic Arts. It was like a black hole in the universe that could devour anything. Even the Elders would feel like their souls had frozen over and cracked if they were to come investigate right now. Which was exactly why they could not check nor look around!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the most important thing was that anyone here would still feel the ferocity of the battle. It would even give them the feeling that they wouldn&#8217;t be able to escape if they were to involve themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now that I’ve done this, who else will know what has happened here?&#8221; Gu Changge suddenly chuckled, &#8220;Oh right, I’m the only one who knows the truth…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then turned to look at the Golden Treasure Chest in his hands. The System prompt had already popped out the moment he killed Ying Shuang. Not only that, he had also completed the task of killing the Fortuitous One at the same time. Thus, he had an immense gain of Fortuity and Fatums. Though, this did not matter at the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main thing he was curious about was what was in the Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest. He did notice that this chest looked somewhat shabbier than the Treasure Chest that dropped when he killed the Mortal One. However, it was not surprising. After all, not every Fortuitous One was like the Mortal One. The only thing that the Body Possession Fortuitous One had was slightly better luck. Nothing more. In fact, he couldn&#8217;t even showcase the body&#8217;s original owner&#8217;s most basic abilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Open the Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest?&gt;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Open] There was a strange glint in Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Fwoosh* Accompanied by the dazzling golden brilliance blooming in front of his eyes, a crown shrouded in greyish brown divine light hopped out while gleaming and floating mid-air. A wisp of aura that symbolised bad luck started to condense and take shape. It was a strange, yet simple form that signified Dao Energy which twirled around the crown.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A Grey Fortuity Crown?] Gu Changge raised his eyebrows slightly, and he quickly understood the usage of the crown. There was an essential difference from the Amethyst Fortuity Crown that he obtained when he killed the Mortal Reincarnate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Amethyst Fortuity Crown could reverse Fortuity, which could significantly improve the user&#8217;s Fortuity in a short period of time. In other words, the user would be the equivalent of being the son of Heaven.  However, there was a limit to the number of times the Amethyst Fortuity Crown could be used. It would explode and shatter after the limit had been exceeded. Gu Changge also hadn&#8217;t had the opportunity to use the Amethyst Fortuity Crown so far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grey Fortuity Crown in front of him, however, was the opposite of the Amethyst Fortuity Crown. It could lower the user&#8217;s Fortuity to the lowest point within a short period of time. It would work even on the so-called son of Heaven, Fortuitous Ones, without having its effect offsetted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Prince Ying sure was unlucky. He could only blame it on his luck that he, a child of a Sky Emperor, had his body stolen by a horse feeder. And now, I’ve got this little toy in my hand…] Gu Changge let out a chuckle that would have made people do a double take on him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crown might seem rather meaningless, but it wasn&#8217;t something he would get rid of. According to the Grey Fortuity Crown&#8217;s text description, it supposedly worked on any living being. Of course, that would include the powerful experts that had exceeded the Sacred Emperor Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such powerful experts were even more sensitive to the Fortuity of the world, and they could easily influence it. With the Grey Fortuity Crown, he might even be able to cause such experts to develop the Five immortal Decays while they were in retreat. Thus, it was certainly a great tool that would help him take lives and steal properties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Fortuity itself was hard to sense, even those in the Sacred Emperor Realm feared this. After all, they would never know who it was that was stabbing them in the back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiftly after, he kept the Grey Fortuity Crown before glancing at his Fortuity and Fatum. He had gained about 30,000 this time. It was just enough to exchange them for a handful of Absolute Detachment Bone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Gu Changge&#8217;s current level, having Absolute Detachment Bones would automatically provide him with insights into the various Principles and the Great Dao. There was also his Forbidden Demonic Arts, which devoured a lot of Sources. Thus, there was no need for him to worry about cultivating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others had to rely on an epiphany to have a breakthrough. Even Jiang Chuchu, who was known as the reincarnation of an Immortal, and Wang Zijin, a prodigy born in the Sacred Realm, had to breakthrough step by step. Unlike them, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t have to worry about all that. He would go through a breakthrough when he had cultivated enough, and when the time was right.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He predicted that it wouldn&#8217;t be long before he entered the Sacred King Realm at the pace he was going.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now, the different prodigies&#8217; Sources are useless to me, I should consider switching my target to the Elders.] Gu Changge began to think about this. Even an ancient monstrocity like Prince Shen didn&#8217;t have much effect on him, and dealing with Prince Shen wasn&#8217;t as lucrative as killing Ying Shuang, the Fortuitous One. Thus, his cultivation did not rise by much.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He still had not forgotten about the demoness in red, which the System mentioned before. Calculating the time from Yue Mingkong, he could conclude that the demoness should have appeared in this world just recently, from the Demon-Burying Abyss, which not even experts in the Sacred Emperor Realm dared to approach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from Gu Changge&#8217;s memories, his cultivation when he was the Demon Lord was ominous and indescribable. But since his one hand could shatter the Heavens, it was clear he was far beyond the concept of the Immortality Realm. Furthermore, the demoness in red could take a hit from a halberd from him at that time, and instead of dying, was only beaten into the Demon-Burying Abyss. That was already proof of how scarily strong she was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for whether Gu Changge held back or not then, no one could say for sure. However, it was an undeniable fact that the demoness was a fearsome opponent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A deep-rooted hatred that will never diminish even in the deepest depths of Hell…] Whenever he thought about this, he always seemed to see the figure in red in front of him. Even though he had a plan, he couldn&#8217;t say for sure whether it would work. However, he soon put this matter off. He had something else to attend to now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s figure swept away and appeared again on the top of a mountain not far away as he looked in the other direction. Chosen Monk Jin Chan and Prince Shen had separated, and a good amount of time had passed by now. As long as Chosen Monk Jin Chan wasn&#8217;t dumb, he would know to come back in this direction if he hadn&#8217;t caught the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Gu Changge had always felt that Chosen Monk Jin Chan wasn&#8217;t as simple as he appeared to be. In fact, Sky King Zhi Yang, the King with Six Crowns, and others might even be weaker than him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it would be hard to judge purely just from his Fortuity. The most important thing was that Gu Changge&#8217;s intuition had picked up on this information after he fought with Jin Chan at that time. Still, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t have to pay him much heed no matter how good the latter potentially was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Chosen Monk Jin Chan will detect the disturbance here soon enough. He will come rushing in. I might as well prepare a surprise for him…] He couldn&#8217;t help but smile. At a wave of his sleeves, a majestic boundless energy suddenly rose, up to the sky, which entwined with every little bit of sunlight above and shattered the sky. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was confident he would be able to lure Chosen Monk Jin Chan over after causing a commotion like this. Immediately afterwards, intense Demonic Energy started to pervade from Gu Changge&#8217;s forehead, and a small figure could be seen walking out with an indifferent face on. He looked exactly like Gu Changge. However, the tiny figure&#8217;s face was quickly obscured by fog that not even an Sacred Emperor Realm expert could see through.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tiny figure was Gu Changge&#8217;s Primordial Spirit that appeared when Gu Changge used his Supreme Freed Mind technique. It was an indescribable sight!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the next moment, a vague and terrifying figure with unparalleled might emerged from behind him. Four Sacred Lord Realm Puppets in black robes appeared, each with black Grand Runes intertwined in their hands. It finally condensed into a terrifying Grand Flask that hovered in the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Tsk* On the other side, the grey fog thickened and rose up to dim out the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A golden light shot through the darkness as the divine talisman shone. The aura of Buddha started flowing all over Chosen Monk Jin Chan&#8217;s body. On his robes were a number of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas which seemed to manifest themselves, some of which were solemn, while the others were beaming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin Chan&#8217;s eyebrows were currently pulled together into a frown as he was hit by a feeling of anxiousness. [It seems that the Successor of Demonic Arts is in Prince Shen&#8217;s direction. Why do I suddenly feel uneasy… It is about time I head back and have a look.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the Floating Buddhist Temple, wearing a Buddhist robe, and bowing to the Buddha for thousands of years…” Jin Chan let out a sigh. There was a Buddha seal between his eyebrows, which seemed to take the form of a sunflower seed, which illuminated all directions. Even a dark path wouldn&#8217;t be able to hinder his vision and steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were rumours about how he had 108 Buddhist Bones on him, but there were more than that. He was born with the Light of Piousness. After cultivating, he had turned his Light of Piousness into a Karma Seed, which allowed him to bless the vows of Buddha whenever he saw fit. Of course, this was his trump card that he seldom showed to outsiders. He had even kept it hidden when he fought against Gu Changge at the entrance of the Immortal Academy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Something must have happened to Prince Shen. It is obvious why the Successor of Demonic Arts has lured us here…] He let out another sigh while shaking his head. He had a sympathetic expression on his face. It wasn&#8217;t as though he wasn&#8217;t clear about what Prince Shen wanted. He just never exposed him despite knowing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, he knew that the Successor of Demonic Arts was a powerful foe. Jin Chan might have the heart of Buddha, but it didn&#8217;t mean he was stupid. All his words and actions were for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eliminating evil and defending the Great Dao</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had a Buddha&#8217;s heart that could see through anything. Naturally, no evil could escape his eyes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monk Jin Chan&#8217;s figure suddenly paused and he turned into a beam of Buddha light that lit up the sky as he turned back without staying a second longer. [I hope I make it there in time.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after, a surge of energy came from within the fog. He shook his head and rushed along the same path, to the other direction where Prince Shen had gone. He had already noticed a part of the terrifying aftermath of a battle along the way. He also noticed how there was another aura that he was very familiar with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had already memorised Gu Changge&#8217;s aura when they fought in front of the entrance to the Immortal Academy. It was impossible he would get the wrong person now. Not expecting Gu Changge to be one step ahead of him, Jin Chan was caught off-guard when he first recognised it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I can&#8217;t believe Gu Changge has already caught up. Did he leave the Sacred Emperor Grade artifact outside? He actually fell for this scheme as well. The Successor of Demonic Arts deliberately isolated Gu Changge’s Sacred Emperor Grade Artifact just to kill us here. Amitabha, may Prince Shen and Young Master Changge be safe.] Jin Chan came to a brief pause before he had suddenly appeared in a mountain range, where he then traversed across at lightning speed. His surroundings had become a blur with each step he took.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a short silence, he pressed both palms together in front of his chest and sighed, &#8220;It seems I came to the fight too late.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he stood in the mountain range, he could feel Prince Shen&#8217;s energy. But of course, it was only the bit of energy that remained. Other than that, he could also feel that things weren&#8217;t going great. However, despite the compassion in his voice, his eyes had no emotion other than a sense of tranquility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had already guessed the Successor of Demonic Arts&#8217; true goal earlier. Even so, he had never outwardly mentioned it. It made it even harder for him to say anything then when he saw how worried and anxious Prince Shen was. This had also turned out just like how he had expected it would.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Even though you have the intention to vanquish evil, you don&#8217;t have the capabilities to do it. You have overestimated yourself, Prince Shen…] Jin Chan started moving again then, making his robe flutter as he rushed to the mountains ahead.  [If I’m right, the battle had occurred where I am heading.]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm?] However, he was still shocked the moment he arrived and saw the situation. Even his heart, which had been cultivating to be like Buddha, was unsettled for a moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gu Changge… Even he is fated to have such an unfortunate day.] A flash of emotion appeared on his tranquil facade before he regained his calm again. He saw the monstrous grey fog looming in the sky as frightening World Principles fell down and engulfed everything, resulting in a turbulent and tempestuous sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The darkness was as dense and heavy as the galaxy. A pitch-black Grand Flask condensed by the Grand Runes floating in the air as if it was going to take the world into it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a blurry figure shrouded with black mist, with a face which couldn&#8217;t be seen clearly standing under the Grand Flask. Despite not being able to see said person&#8217;s features, Jin Chan could tell that the indifferent face was sneering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worse, the figure wasn&#8217;t alone. There were also four Sacred Lord Realm experts standing beside him, and they each had many runes taking shape in their hands as they firmly sealed off all directions. This causes every inch of this space to be filled with a frightening and bone-chilling aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sight immediately sent a chill up Monk Jin Chan&#8217;s spine as he wondered just what kind of battle had ensued here before his arrival. The aftermath itself was enough to fill anyone with fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, I bet you have never thought you would meet your demise this way after coming after me for so long!&#8221; The figure shrouded in black mist in the air couldn&#8217;t help but sneer proudly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His face was hidden behind the fog, but from his energy alone, Jin Chan could confirm that it was the previous Prince Ying, Ying Shuang.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four Sacred Lord Realm experts had once appeared on the Eternal Overcast Battlefield, and they were suspected to be the subordinates of the Successor of Demonic Arts!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Gu Changge was sitting cross-legged under the mountain range with a Golden Decree unfolding in front of him, protecting him inside it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, anyone could tell that something was wrong with his current condition. from the blood stain on his body and his weak aura.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most terrifying thing was that there was an open wound on his body that reached his Dantian. The multi-colored divine light, accompanied by rays of multi-coloured light, was flowing through his wound in an attempt to repair the injury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as layers of black mist rose, it was like a corrosive that was difficult to get rid of, making Gu Changge&#8217;s complexion even paler and weaker. The glint in his eyes looked like it was about to be put out. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gu Changge&#8217;s life is hanging by a thread because of the damage to the Source, and Prince Shen&#8217;s energy has completely disappeared.] Jin Chan&#8217;s pupils dilated slightly. He didn&#8217;t expect the ending of this incident to be beyond his imagination. The only word he could use to describe what he was seeing was ‘horrifying’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this were to make it out to the public, the world would instantly fall into chaos! [It seems like things are about to change…]</span></p>

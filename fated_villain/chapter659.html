        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great excitement filled the air as everyone gazed at the countless light rays gathering in the Imperial Capital Summit.</span><span id="more-34824"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today is the day you die!&#8221; Yu Tianzheng finally showed up. His eyes were cold as Immortal Ice as his hair danced in the air, all while unparalleled energy floated and occupied every inch of the space around him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The energy was so terrifying when he charged toward Emperor Yu, even space trembled, startling everyone. They felt as though even their souls were shaking with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such terrifying, earth-shaking energy was very much comparable to Emperor Yu. In fact, some ancient beings could tell that Yu Tianzheng was a level more powerful than Emperor Yu. After all, it was mostly thanks to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s Fortuity and Power of Faith, as well as the advantage of being in the Imperial Capital that Emperor Yu could reach this height today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they were to engage in a fair fight, Emperor Yu wouldn&#8217;t even stand a chance against Yu Tianzhieng?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To think you actually dare show up. You will suffer the consequences of disrupting the order of my Dynasty, even if you have the royal blood of the Great Yu running in your veins!&#8221; Emperor Yu couldn&#8217;t believe Yu Tianzheng actually dared to show up. As he declared icily, nine dragons shot into the air. It was an incredibly noble sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he charged towards Yu Tianzheng, rays upon rays of Imperial Qi intertwined and roared intimidatingly as though there really was a mighty True Dragon on the verge of awakening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I dare you to try, then. It&#8217;s high time I seek revenge for when you seized the throne from me with villainous means,&#8221; cursedYu Tianzheng icily as malice and frost enveloped him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the golden sword slashed downwards, it seemed as though a majestic golden downpour splashed towards it aggressively, shrouding everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just a short moment, countless runes and Principles wreathed and exploded, bursting into vast, brilliant light.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it wasn&#8217;t that powerful arrays enveloped the Imperial Capital, the shockwaves from the battle alone would&#8217;ve been enough to wipe out all living beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You insolent fool,&#8221; monotoned Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two looked very alike, and apart from having different temperaments, it was practically impossible to tell the two apart. Yet, they were now fighting to the death, sorting out that grudge from hundreds of years ago. Be it Emperor Yu or Yu Tianzheng, both wanted the other dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Endless light beams wreathed and clashed, creating a dazzling yet terrifying illusion of a meteor shower crash landing into the Capital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Emperor Yu and Yu Tianzheng were serious about killing each other at this point, and both hoped to get it done quickly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have already lost to me in the past. Even if you seized the throne using villainous means, you&#8217;re still but an incompetent clown,&#8221; said Yu Tianzheng impassively as his golden aura burst out, reaching the sky. He seemed like a peerless emperor with his brilliantly edged golden sword condensed with endless runes and Principles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every attack would cause the heavens and earth to shake and seemingly explode. The immensely terrifying energy surged like a tidal wave that would crush the place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Enough talking. I shall kill you here and now,&#8221; said Emperor Yu with a profound and plain countenance. With the Imperial Qi shrouding him, he believed victory was already in his grasp.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endless Imperial Qi rushed toward him and transformed into various godly weapons.  This was a battle that would shake up the entire Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Though neither were True Daoists, the shockwaves created by their clashes were beyond what cultivators of their cultivation level could produce.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area turned chaotic, and the surrounding cultivators were unable to tell what was happening at all. Apart from True Daoists, the others were unworthy of spectating the battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was fortunate that the Imperial Capital was extraordinary, for turbulences of this degree would&#8217;ve stretched beyond the domain and fractured countless stars if it were elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No wonder Yu Tianzheng dared to come and fight Emperor Yu alone.&#8221; Members of various Forces fixed their eyes on the battle, thinking they shouldn&#8217;t take Yu Tianzheng lightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge, on the other hand, smiled subtly and said, &#8220;Looks like we&#8217;re in for a good show soon.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baffled, the ancient being of Sky Emperor Mountain asked, &#8220;What made you say that, Young Master Gu? Even though Yu Tianzheng is powerful, even True Daoists would be handicapped from unleashing their full potential within the Imperial Capital… He&#8217;s certainly no match for Emperor Yu.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; Gu Changge continued wearing his subtle smile as he watched the scene progress while Yin Mei brought him his tea, which he took a sip of and sighed. &#8220;It sure is a tit-for-tat battle.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you think this battle will end with a surprising outcome?&#8221; A chuckle escaped Yin Mei as she massaged Gu Changge&#8217;s shoulders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man shook his head in response. &#8220;Of course not,&#8221; he said as he gazed across the few surrounding ancient beings. After all, how could he tolerate a variant when he deliberately set this scenario up and even lulled so many Forces into it?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, magnificence shrouded the Summit of the Capital as though it would rip the sky apart. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the end of the world!&#8221; screamed many young cultivators with terror and blanched faces, having never seen such a grand spectacle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, the scene was genuinely terrifying. Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s hair danced in the air as he used the stars as his weapon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, stretches of stars showered down unto the Capital, turning the sky into a massive sea of stars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The burning lights ultimately gathered into a river and entered from the top of his head, allowing him to throw the ball of intense energy towards Emperor Yu, whose countenance shifted in turn as the artifacts he unleashed rattled, having a hard time withstanding the attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, he was no common man either. The Imperial Qi surrounding him roared as it seemingly converged and manifested, wanting to shatter everything with a physical form.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, all the stars disintegrated into dust before him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yu Tianzheng is absolutely brilliant. He can already make the stars his weapon before even advancing into the next realm. How astonishing!&#8221; marvelled an ancient being, believing Yu Tianzheng could certainly enter the Nirvana Realm and become an Unparalleled Being given a bit more time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu, on the other hand, relied too much on foreign aid like the Power of Faith of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, voices rang out from within the surrounding darkness out of the blue in the heat of the battle. &#8220;Why waste your energy on such a measly character, Your Majesty? We are more than sufficient to kill him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a few blurry figures in black robes emerged, seemingly hidden within a massive black fog, preventing others from seeing their true appearances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horrific animosity exuded from them as they approached the battle like they were envoys from the depths of the Netherworld.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the True Daoists felt somewhat apprehensive, for they thought these mysterious figures were not simple beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To think you have men hidden in the dark, Yu Tianyong. Then again, it is very much like you to devise such a shameless act.&#8221; Yu Tianzheng turned grim in response, never expecting Emperor Yu to act so sinisterly. [I knew you wouldn&#8217;t stick to your words. Hmph! To think he has so many cultivators overlooking in the dark.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The countless surrounding cultivators, too, burst into a tumult, shocked that others would charge in suddenly and ruin the battle. However, because they were within the Imperial Capital, none of them dared say anything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many ministers of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty were shocked by the turn of events but came around very quickly, believing Emperor Yu had assembled them to make sure victory would be on their side. &#8220;So it turns out that His Majesty has devised a backup plan. Looks like it&#8217;ll be fail-safe. We have worried for nothing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It certainly was no honourable act, but no one would say a word about it since it would bring Yu Tianzheng down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like I&#8217;ve been worried for nothing. His Majesty has already devised a countermeasure.&#8221; The old eunuch, who had been serving Emperor Yu for a long time, let out a sigh of relief. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had even gone all the way to seek advice from the Imperial Ancestors residing in the depths of Imperial Capital for this matter. But who&#8217;d have thought the Ancestors said they shouldn&#8217;t interfere and break royal rules since it was an issue between the Royal Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Yu Tianzheng and Emperor Yu were their descendants. So, it didn&#8217;t matter to them who would reign over the Dynasty. Besides, it wouldn&#8217;t affect their status either way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm?!&#8221; However, Emperor Yu frowned in bewilderment. He might do whatever it took to achieve his goals, but he didn&#8217;t need to go this far to defeat Yu Tianzheng. What was more, he was confident in his powers. Hence, he never arranged for any backup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believing this was the work of the Imperial Ancestors, for fear that something bad would happen to him, he dismissed the unexpected turn of events very quickly and continued fighting against Yu Tianzheng.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the men in black who appeared out of nowhere joined the battle and made the already chaotic scene even more confusing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, the skies turned dark, and a massive fog drifted over from nowhere, swallowing up the Imperial Palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing an ominous feeling, everyone began turning apprehensive and retreated as chills ran down their spines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Where did this massive fog come from? Is someone going to attack us?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many were shocked and baffled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, many ancient beings extended their arms within the highest pavilion to drive the massive fog away. However, brilliant sword light flashed from within the fog the next second and pulverised their hands. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more shockingly, these swords made of light were now flying in their direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How bold!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some turned furious and malicious. None of them believed someone would attack at this juncture. But what shocked them even more was the fact that the blades were flying towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu!&#8221; Yin Mei exclaimed in fear as her face blanched a little. &#8220;No! Someone wants to attack Young Master Gu while he&#8217;s injured!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty sure is bold to pull this stunt in front of everyone…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many ancient beings were stunned. Never did they think there would genuinely be someone bold enough to kill a gravely injured Gu Changge without considering the consequences. Their initial thought went to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty as the men in black not only wanted to kill Yu Tianzheng but also Gu Changge, and they might even get caught up in it if something bad really happened to the latter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To think they really dare to attack me.&#8221; Gu Changge quirked his brow, seemingly also incredibly surprised. As he threw an arm out, the space in front of him quivered, then turned blurry before the blades that were coming at him snapped into pieces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an incredible use of the vast and powerful Space Principles. It could sever the terrain and split heaven apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These people have gone mad! They don&#8217;t care about what happens to them!&#8221; The several ancient beings turned awfully grim, sensing things had gone south.  None could be free of guilt. After all, who could guarantee that the Forces that supported them had no intention of attacking Gu Changge?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, everyone entered the massive fog and seized the group of men in black so as to question them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unexpected event was so shocking that the countenances of many cultivators remained ghastly pale while reeling in fright.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe they would attack Young Master Gu while he&#8217;s injured. Are they really going to kill him at this time?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This incident will certainly stir the entire Upper Realm. Who&#8217;d have thought…&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many cultivators were appalled, sensing something major would happen soon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only was the strange fog incredibly dense, but it also contained terrifyingly powerful Principles that could cut off a cultivator&#8217;s senses, causing many to be blinded in a split second and forced to retreat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I like to see who it is who dares attack me.&#8221; Malice laced Gu Changge as he looked towards the men in black. After a hint of profoundness flashed across his eyes, he took a step forward and entered the massive fog the next second.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Clang!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, chaos had befallen the Summit of the Capital at this point, and though Emperor Yu was shocked, he couldn&#8217;t bother himself with everything else that was going on. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a deep bellow, his forehead flashed and produced a dagger a little over an inch&#8217;s length before attacking Yu Tiangzheng with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an incredibly terrifying blade, awfully sharp and enveloped in countless chaotic Imperial Qi.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far away, Yu Tianzheng roared and cast the secret technique Gu Changge gave him. He began burning up, turning his flesh and bones brilliant as a scarlet star flew out from his forehead, colliding with the Dao Sword. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next second, a blinding light that swept the whole Capital burst out, disintegrating the surrounding buildings. The thick fog remained incredibly stormy as everyone ran further away with reverence for fear of being dragged into it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Dong!* The sound of a bell reverberated across the lands as the intensely glowing scarlet star expanded speedily above Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The star was an incredibly powerful Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact that was even interwoven with runes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Emperor Yu appeared as majestic as a peerless Emperor enveloped in Imperial Qi while holding a Dao Sword. The weapon that came out of his forehead was now over twenty metres tall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dao Sword was forged from a Divine Rock that could attract Chaos Qi. The rock itself was covered in rune carvings and contained the Fortuity of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Now, it was turned into a formidable Dao Sword that could slice through everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a roar, Emperor Yu charged towards Yu Tianzheng while wielding the Chaos Dao Sword. His hair danced in the air right then as his eyes gleamed with malice, and he even looked like an Emperor who could swallow up the universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* The impact threw Yu Tianzheng backwards and forced him to cough up blood. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The star on his head was forged from a large amount of Celestial Slver, and though it wasn&#8217;t as powerful as the Chaos Dao Sword, it was still immensely terrifying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, he was enveloped in a striking and intimidating blood-red glow, having cast the secret technique. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two finally cast their most powerful ability, shattering the space and turning it into a vacuum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Pfft!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s face blanched as his Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact cracked terribly. Even having used the technique Gu Changge gave him, he was still no match for Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chaos Dao Sword was a National Weapon of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. In some ways, it was comparable to an Immortal Grade Artifact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it didn&#8217;t awaken fully, its powers were still boundless, mystical, and difficult to counter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, you see the disparity between us, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Emperor Yu as he gazed impassively at Yu Tianzheng while enveloped in a glow. The Chaos Dao Sword was just hanging right above Yu Tianzheng, and it could kill him at any second.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng was now covered in blood. It was apparent he had lost and was on his last legs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He guffawed maniacally, unable to believe he still lost after giving his all and even using the secret technique Gu Changge gifted him. It actually wasn&#8217;t that he was less powerful than Emperor Yu. Instead, he lost because of the differences in their artifacts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, his eyes shot wide open with incredulity the next second. In fact, he even thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu…&#8221; he called out with hope.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng was already on the verge of giving up when he saw a slender silhouette approaching him from not far away. Though it was concealed within the massive fog, he could sense otherworldly energy from him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What a piece of garbage.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head emotionlessly as he gazed at the defeated Yu Tianzheng.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You… What are you doing here?!&#8221; Emperor Yu&#8217;s countenance turned gravely grim immediately as he gazed at the approaching man.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He honestly never imagined Gu Changge would show up at such a critical time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Isn&#8217;t he severely injured and was being attacked?!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge had no intention of explaining anything to him. Instead, he announced with a profound and impassive gaze. &#8220;It&#8217;s time someone else reigns over the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.&#8221;</span></p>

          I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll find us in no time,&#8221; Solar Demon

          world-shattering plan in order to acquire the World Source of the
          Demon World. Not only did they deceive everyone in the Demon World,
          they also fooled the outside world, making people mistakenly think
          that they were all a part of the chaos of the Demon World six thousand
          years ago. It was because they had such an opportunity to deceive
          others that they could enter this place smoothly. All they had to do
          now was wait for the World Source to mature inside this Mirror World,
          which was created after the fall of the Mirror Demon during the
          ancient times.</span

          Life as the focal point, the purpose of sealing off the existence of

          Principles as well as many innate Dao patterns, were seldom born even
          in worlds of higher planes of existence. For beings at their
          cultivation level, World Sources were like a far-fetched dream that
          would even allow them to step into another world.</span

          epochs had passed. However, they saw their hope of becoming Immortals
          because of the Demon World’s World Source. They would even sacrifice
          their own children to perfect this earth-shattering plan of
          theirs.</span

          behind their own Nirvana Grade Artifacts, and by doing that, made many
          outsiders believe that they were no longer around. However, the Solar
          Demon Overlord kept his guard up and made a lot of backup plans for
          his Son, Jun Bufan, to come to him after six thousand years. That was
          because he knew that the World Source was not enough to support the
          breakthrough of the Six Demon Overlords.</span

          Demon Overlord six thousand years ago. As a battle proceeded to break
          out between them, one of them died, and the other five who were
          wounded fled to various places where they hid to recover. But now that
          his plan had already been laid out, he couldn&#8217;t change anything
          even if the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord saw through it. He only had
          the Lunar Demon Overlord on his side.

          Cloud Demon Overlord initially left the Crimson Cloud Spear in the
          Demon World. Unless he voluntarily left this world, it was impossible

          scale of a Mirror Demon as the key. No one could break through the
          protective arrays here with just external force. If the Crimson Cloud
          Demon Overlord was in his right mind, he wouldn&#8217;t leave this

          trifles. I might be using Fan&#8217;er in this matter, but I believe
          he will understand my efforts. Yao Xi&#8217;s character doesn&#8217;t

          from the young man even though he was in the Nirvana Realm. Gu Changge
          remained calm and nonchalant, and didn&#8217;t act out of the norm

          did not get close to them. Instead, he stood tall on a mountain peak
          in his dark ceremonial robes, sporting a vague smile on his
          face.</span

          after all. The Solar and Lunar Demon Overlords didn&#8217;t expect his
          help. The Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord and the Blood Demon Overlord
          might be surprised to learn of his identity, but they, too,
          couldn&#8217;t care less about him.</span

          Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes seemed to blur as the Power of Reincarnation
          intertwined. It was as if the Six Paths of Reincarnation had emerged,
          and many heavenly palaces, stars, and celestial palaces had evolved
          and collapsed in them. Such a sight was especially frightening, but it
          eventually returned to calm.</span

          quarrelled. All he needed to do now was wait for the fruit to ripen
          before he made his harvest. He was more than pleased with his plan.
          However, he needed to pull some tricks before that.</span

          talismans into the void around him, turning them into Mist of Chaos,
          in which the images of many ancient celestial palaces took shape and
          disappeared quickly.</span

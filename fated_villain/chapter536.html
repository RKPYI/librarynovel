          all across the universe was the special stone from Kun Mountain, with
          Principles that prevented others from spying on what was inside.
          Naturally, it helped that one could nearly always find rarities hidden
          in them.</span

          around in the city in hopes of finding some treasure specialising in
          longevity. Thus, a Source Master was highly respected in Dark Kun
          City. Even a Sacred Emperor Realm expert dared not offend such a
          Master too much, even treating them deferentially when they asked the
          Master to check out a stone.</span

          they were nearly extinct, having emerged from the stones sold in a
          stone-gambling hall of the Alliance of Thousand Merchants spread like

          news, but given how busy Dark Kun City had become today, it was
          already a major event. Naturally, many Forces sent their cultivators

          Ginseng to the appearance of Skyward Schloss disciples and Jiang Chen
          doing wonders by picking out stones with nothing but treasures, the
          whole thing had been documented by photographic stones. They were even

          However, because the two were in disguise—Monk Pu Du was still being
          hunted down by the Godly Illusion Clan because of what happened back
          in the Godly Illusion Tomb—no one recognised Jiang Chen or Monk Pu

          and surreal, they would even doubt if the young man knew the Source
          Techniques at all. After all, from the various images documented in
          the photographic stones, Jiang Chen would many times immediately know
          what was hidden in those stones after taking only a gander.</span

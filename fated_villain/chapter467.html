          appearance. With her ethereal and wise exterior, and her eyes that
          held some kind of transcendent holiness, the Sky Deer Goddess looked
          as though she was untainted by this world, and her beauty only
          belonged in dreams. But at this moment, she was saying with her mouth
          about her being a concubine, in a rather resentful tone at that.</span

          disbelief. However, the Sky Deer Goddess didn&#8217;t look or sound
          like she was lying. To the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, her
          identity was transcendent and noble. She would never say such words so
          easily.

          the Sky Deer Goddess to willingly say such words. Gu Wudi
          couldn&#8217;t help but feel envious. Even the Successor of the Nine

          this,&#8221; she replied with a smile, putting on a thoroughly
          convincing act. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that so, my dear?&#8221;

          Gu Changge seemed a little resigned when he gently wrapped his arm
          around her slender waist. His eyes held the right amount of tender
          pampering. He knew what she was up to. She must have expected that he
          would not ‘eat‘ her because of her Nine Mysteries Yearning Physique
          that was why she was so confident about putting on a show and saying
          something like this in public.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          stick. Even if there was currently no solution to the problem of the
          Nine Mysteries Yearning Physique, he could still easily take advantage
          of her.

          a warm feeling coming from her waist. She could feel a chilly aura at
          the tip of her nose, as if Immortal Ice was placed in front of
          it.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing this, the Third Mountain Elder no longer had doubts. Instead,
          he had a cautious look on his face as he guessed Gu Changge&#8217;s
          identity. After all, he must be someone terrifyingly important for the
          Sky Deer Goddess to say that he was her husband. The news that she
          became someone&#8217;s concubine might cause an uproar in the whole
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains if word ever got out.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          &#8220;You may call my husband Young Master. You don&#8217;t have to
          worry about his identity.&#8221;

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          world. Mighty enough to not care about the rest, no one could say for
          sure if any hidden Families were more ancient than it. Likewise, had
          contact with those in the Immortal Realm, or had the blood of the
          Immortals flowing in their veins.

          despite thinking of all the possibilities, the Third Mountain Elder
          didn&#8217;t even consider the possibility of Gu Changge being someone
          from the Upper Realm. After all, to him, this was impossible. There
          was no way the Sky Deer Goddess would be so close to someone from the
          Upper Realm.

          invade Sky Deer City all this time. As the one responsible for
          guarding Sky Deer City, the Sky Deer Goddess wouldn&#8217;t want to be

          furrowed his eyebrows. He didn&#8217;t know much about the supposed
          grudge between Chen Suyun and the Sky Deer Goddess. All that he knew
          was that the two used to be Senior and Junior Sisters to each other.
          That they were both candidates to be the next Sky Deer Goddess.
          Although Chen Suyun has been a disciple for a long time, her
          cultivation couldn&#8217;t compete with that of her Junior Sister.
          Later, for reasons unknown, Chen Suyun left Sky Deer City and came to
          the Nine Great Mountains to study under the Second Mountain
          Elder.</span

          Mountains, and she is fairly prestigious among the disciples. It would
          be embarrassing for the Nine Great Mountains if the Sky Deer Goddess
          came to seek revenge. However, the Sky Deer Goddess must be aware of
          how much of a problem this could be, which is why she has her husband
          to accompany her. It also seems like it is with her husband&#8217;s
          identity that she has the confidence to come here.]</span

          Elder. You will have to go to the Second Mountain if you want to see
          her. But this must have been a long journey for you. How about resting

          Gu Changge and the Sky Deer Goddess into a magnificent hall and then
          dutifully retreated. With his life in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands, Gu
          Wudi didn&#8217;t dare to have any disrespectful thoughts. He had also
          told Gu Changge all the secrets about the Nine Great Mountains that he
          knew on the way to the Third Mountain.</span

          >After seeing Gu Wudi leave, Gu Changge thought for a while in the
          hall, and then took out his Chaos Purple Scripture to deduce who was
          the Fortuitous One this time. Although he had not seen the Fortuitous
          One with his own eyes, he already knew who it was from Gu Wudi&#8217;s

          tragically in this battle, jointly resisting the invasion of the
          foreign enemies. There was another team that was quietly escorting a

          However, in Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes, this was in line with how there
          would always be building blocks in front of a Fortuitous One.
          Naturally he expected that Xiao Yang had suffered and held a deep
          grudge.</span

          >Generally speaking, the remnant family members of the Fortuitous One
          had to be somewhat special. They either possessed some kind of great
          treasure which could be coveted by all, or they could have some kind
          of special bloodline or physique, and were hated or revered by
          others.</span

          inextricable karma with the Immortal Gu Family. It has been more than
          twenty years now. How wonderful.] Thinking of this, Gu Changge
          suddenly thought of something. [I&#8217;ll need to make time to send a
          message back to my Family and check with them.]</span

          group from the Family to exterminate the Family of Protectors in the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains more than twenty years ago. The
          timeline did make sense if that was the case.</span

          the Masters from different generations. Even if these Souls had fallen

          strike when the Protectors were at their weakest. That was when the
          Head of the Protectors failed to breakthrough and was seriously

          That might be the best time for us to act,&#8221; she said with a
          smile. Her eyes were shining brightly as holiness and demonic nature

          sleeve. Therefore, according to how the story would normally flow, Gu
          Wudi would lose three days later because of his carelessness, and the
          Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains would fall into Xiao Yang&#8217;s

          accumulated the Power of Faith, Fortuity, destiny, and many other
          things of the Nine Great Mountains over the years. It is extremely
          mysterious. It is a supreme treasure beyond the Nirvana Grade. The

          to a former Senior Sister of hers, Chen Suyun, who was now the Eldest
          Senior Sister of the Nine Great Mountains. There was a lot of enmity

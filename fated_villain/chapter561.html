          crafted from what appeared to be immortal gold. The blade hummed with

          in the art of stone cutting.</span

          dark glow as if they were corroded by the cursed energy within it. The
          radiance emanating from it intensified, and demonic energy spread out
          in all directions, exuding a frighteningly corrosive aura that made
          ordinary cultivators hesitant to approach it.</span

          Masters fixed his gaze upon the rock. As an intense dark light began
          flooding, everyone fixed their eyes on it, unwilling to divert their
          attention for even a moment, lest they miss a single detail.</span

          >As the dark light condensed into a cluster of light, a wooden comb
          about the size of a palm materialized and suspended within it. It
          appeared to be crafted from an unknown type of wood. The comb was
          tainted with a very strong ominous aura, its edges appeared slightly
          incomplete and stained with ancient blood.</span

          revelation left everyone in a state of shock. Even Master Elder
          Qinglong, who had been cutting the rock open, was momentarily frozen
          in disbelief.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          that there was some sort of cursed object that could bring misfortune
          upon cultivators hidden in it. However, to their surprise, it turned
          out to be a broken wooden comb. This was truly an unexpected
          outcome.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The luminaries spoke with solemnity, recognizing the profound
          complexity of this wooden comb. They believed it to be intricately
          woven with natural Principles, and in certain aspects, even more
          precious than any innate treasure.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Most importantly, the blood on this wooden comb likely originated
          from an Absolute Being! To think that such a mere streak of blood
          could actually cause a disaster in the Great West Holy Land. One could
          only imagine the sheer terror of this Absolute Being.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          suddenly broke away from the rock, transformed into a beam of dark
          light and flew toward Chan Hongyi, who was deep within the demonic
          cloud.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sight of that stirred up a whirlwind of emotions within the
          onlookers. “Could this wooden comb originally belong to the
          demoness?”</span

      <p>

          >“So, that’s what was in there.” Gu Changge shook his head lightly as
          he recognized the wooden comb. To be precise, it was a gift he had
          personally given to Chan Hongyi.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His memories were too fragmented and scattered for him to recall when
          he had presented it to her. It seemed to be… the very first gift he
          had given to Chan Hongyi after she killed a group of bandits.</span

          >“Long time no see…” Deep in the demonic cloud, Chan Hongyi gazed at
          the broken wooden comb in her hand with fondness before putting it
          away carefully. She then looked out of her carriage, as though she
          could sense Gu Changge’s gaze in her direction.</span

          significant connection with the demoness in red. Could it be that she
          was the one responsible for his death? Her strength at her peak must
          have been unimaginable…”</span

          and fear in each other’s eyes as they speculated about the owner of
          the blood on the wooden comb. It was likely that it belonged to the
          Immortal King who fell on Kun Mountain. Although it was an incident
          from ages ago, conclusive evidence could still be discovered with
          careful examination.</span

          in Dark Kun City caused quite a stir. News that the Cursed Rock had

          of those in neighboring ancient cities.</span

          Immortal Foetus was cut open on the same day as the Cursed Rock, which
          had long been regarded as a symbol of misfortune, at the Divine Rock
          Conference. This was beyond the expectations of many people. Most
          importantly, Gu Changge had expended a hundred Immortal Crystals to
          cut open each rock.</span

          Changge’s Immortal Crystals to get the Cursed Rock cut in front of
          everyone. The impact of this news was just as significant as the
          previous ones.</span

          Changge and the demoness in red. Various theories were circulating,
          but the prevailing belief was that Gu Changge and the demoness
          probably came to some sort of agreement during the battle in Divine
          City. This would explain why the demoness’ attitude toward Gu Changge
          differed from that of others.</span

          conversations surrounding the Heavenly Tome uncovered in the Immortal
          Foetus. While countless Forces were intrigued by the contents of the
          Heavenly Tome, common cultivators recognized that this topic held
          little relevance for them, thus they focused on the rumors surrounding
          the mysterious relationship between Gu Changge and the demoness in
          red. It was not surprising, since there were always people who loved
          to gossip.</span

          powerful man in the Upper Realm, Gu Changge’s every action incited a
          flurry of reactions. His recent interaction with the demoness in red

          Lord Realm, and one in the Sacred King Realm, to execute the task
          today,” Yin Mei replied respectfully. “The guardian accompanying the
          Young War Immortal is only in the Sacred Emperor Realm, but I have
          taken measures to hold him back. The Young War Immortal will
          definitely fall within fifteen minutes.”</span

          >Gu Changge nodded. “Don’t leave any traces behind, I trust you to
          handle things with care.”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the present Upper Realm, many Forces were deeply intimidated by
          him, making it difficult for him to attack the Young War Immortal
          openly. If he were to do so, it would provide other groups with a
          convenient excuse to launch a collective attack against him. The
          option of hiring assassins to assassinate the Young War Immortal in
          secret proved to be a much simpler solution for him.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Judging from what happened at the Divine Rock Conference, the Young
          War Immortal appeared to already be aware of Su Qingge’s true
          identity. As a result, Gu Changge deemed it necessary to eliminate
          this potential threat.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that the Divine Rock Conference was over, everyone would have
          lowered their guard. The Young War Immortal probably did not
          anticipate that Gu Changge would take his life. As for the War
          Immortal Manor behind him, Gu Changge had plenty of means to get rid
          of it.</span

          >Gu Changge then sent someone to track down Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue.
          Jiang Chen could still prove himself useful one last time during the
          upcoming invasion into Kun Mountain. Given Ji Yaoxing&#8217;s
          character, he would not pass up such a good opportunity.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Moreover, Gu Changge also hoped to seize the Celestial Boat of
          Creation from Jiang Chen’s possession. After so long, the Artifact
          Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation should have almost fully
          recovered.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before long, the sound of footsteps echoed outside the chamber. The
          siblings hurriedly approached, their faces filled with apprehension.
          For the Ji family, Gu Changge was now a great benefactor.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Without his help, it was unlikely that so many other Forces would
          have aided the Ji family in the rescue of their Prime Ancestor. Thus,
          upon learning that Gu Changge wished to speak with them, Ji Chuyue
          reluctantly set aside her reservations and made her way here.</span

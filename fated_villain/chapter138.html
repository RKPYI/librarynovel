      <h4>Chapter 138: Damn Others or Die; Just Lending a Hand!</h4>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s plan was simple: ‘he would devour the resources in the
        ancestral tomb and leave first.’
      </p>
      <p>
        He wouldn’t have a problem breaking through to the God King Realm after
        he’s done with the ancestral tomb here.
      </p>
      <p>
        He even felt that by the time he left the Ancient Immortal Continent, he
        would be able to condense the consciousness of the Sacred Realm and
        achieve the Quasi-Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, under the blessings of [Transcendence], his control over
        the Natural Laws would deepen, and he would even be able to use the Laws
        of Heaven and Earth at will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it was based on the fact that he could absorb enough
        ‘resources’ from the ancestral tombs of the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, this place was different from the outside world, so even if he
        was found out, he would still be able to shift the blame on someone
        else’s head and wouldn’t need to worry about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he did something similar in the outside world, then the entire world
        would definitely turn into a frying pan on the verge of bursting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge wanted to develop himself in secret, but it wasn’t all that
        easy. Although he had a scapegoat in the form of Ye Ling, it didn’t mean
        that he could do whatever he wanted — he had to prepare a lot in order
        to keep everything under wraps.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This trip to the Ancient Immortal Continent…I am afraid it’s going
          to end up as a lesson for me on how to rob tombs…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge mumbled to himself.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, a [Divine-grade Aura Concealment Talisman] appeared in his hand
        and a hazy brilliance shrouded his figure as brilliant runes intertwined
        around him.
      </p>
      <p>
        His entire figure disappeared in the Void, and he quickly went towards
        the ruins in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although he had only done something similar once before, he was already
        quite familiar with the entire process…he might just have talent in this
        ‘field.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, he avoided the areas with strong auras and continued
        forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        After arriving all the way in the depths of the ruins, Gu Changge walked
        out of the Void. In front of him were dilapidated palaces and pavilions
        shrouded in flowing, gray mist.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were many mountain peaks of different sizes releasing different
        colors of light.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, the Void trembled!</p>
      <p><b>[Puff!]</b></p>
      <p>Blood splattered everywhere with the sound of two swooshes!</p>
      <p>
        The two creatures responsible for guarding their ancestral tomb widened
        their eyes in horror, and felt a chill between their brows.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, the brilliance in their eyes dimmed, and a hole appeared
        between their brows!
      </p>
      <p>
        A sword light flashed past them and their Primordial Spirits perished!
      </p>
      <p>Instant death!</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge retracted his fingers and walked out of the Void with a
        casual expression and went past them.
      </p>
      <p>After a while, the two bodies fell on the ground with a bang.</p>
      <p>
        With his current strength, he could easily deal with two creatures who
        were only in the Quasi-Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his Void talent, he could approach them in complete silence, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        After devouring the White Tiger Family’s innate talent, he turned it
        into a peerless sword art with the power of Natural Laws using the
        [Infinite Immortal Wisdom]!
      </p>
      <p>
        Even a real Sacred Realm master might not be able to avoid grievous
        injuries if targeted by his sword art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked up at the ancestral tomb in front of him with a
        satisfied expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ancestral tomb in front of him appeared small, but it was kept in
        great shape and the mounds inside it varied in size and shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it was covered in an ancient atmosphere, it still released a
        mighty aura that showed off its prosperity from eras gone by. There was
        no doubt that quite a few strong ones were buried in the ancestral tomb.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the ‘graves’ were cracked open and released splendid brilliance…
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge knew at first glance that the brilliance was the essence of
        the ancient corpses buried inside. At this moment, their essence surged
        like a tsunami.
      </p>
      <p>A slight smile appeared on his face.</p>
      <p>
        There was a huge amount of ‘cultivation resources’ buried inside, and
        even he would salivate over them!
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Hoh! This doesn’t seem to be an ordinary mausoleum — these wouldn’t be
        the tombs of their Heavenly Geniuses, right?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was surprised by the writing on the tomb in front of him; the
        tomb wasn’t an ancestral tomb, but the ancient tomb of one of their
        Heavenly Genius.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he walked past the square stone monument, he felt a monstrous energy
        and fighting spirit left behind by the said Heavenly Genius.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had to accept the fact that even he felt that the group of people
        buried here were strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘There sure are great things in the Ancient Immortal Continent! Those
        who can be called Heavenly Geniuses here are all extraordinary creatures
        for sure. It must be even more so when talking about the people from the
        ancient eras.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt an unyielding fighting spirit from the tombstone in
        front of him — the aura it released seemed to be rushing towards the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>‘Chen Que of the Hundred Forbidden Battle…’</p>
      <p>‘Holy Dragon King, Yuan Xu…’</p>
      <p>‘Bearer of God’s Blood…’</p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge recognized some of the ancient writing as he walked past the
        tombstones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, he held no curiosity towards the origins of the geniuses
        buried here. They were already dead, and it was a fact that they
        couldn’t achieve the pinnacle they would have been destined for
        otherwise!
      </p>
      <p>What use was their overwhelming fighting spirit now?</p>
      <p>‘Damn others, or die.’</p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge’s eyes, they were nothing more than ‘cultivation
        resources.’
      </p>
      <p><b>[Hum!]</b></p>
      <p>After that, Gu Changge sat down cross-legged.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, a black light appeared behind him and turned into a pitch-black
        [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] that dimmed the light of the world around
        him — the sun, the moon, and the stars dimmed in his presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, dark clouds seemed to crack in the corners of the mausoleum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless suns, moos, and stars fell from there and illuminated the
        ground below and covered Gu Changge’s figure!
      </p>
      <p>
        He appeared to have a supreme visage carved out of crystal-clear,
        translucent jade, and his bones appeared to have black light flowing
        through them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was as if he was telling the world that: ‘even if the Heavens
        collapse, I will live as an Immortal! Even if the world collapses, I
        will live as an Immortal!’
      </p>
      <p>
        The tombs were cracked open and the bodies of the ancient Heavenly
        Geniuses floated out of them one after another — both men and women.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of them had sturdy figures, with different shapes, and robes that
        made it clear that they were from different eras…their powerful talents
        were bare for the world to witness as their figures rushed towards the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        They went up and down under the starlight as the [Great Dao] swallowed
        their essence and refined everything in Gu Changge’s body.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Primordial Spirit and Cultivation Base improved at a rapid speed!
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        While Gu Changge busied himself with refining and absorbing the essence
        of the Heavenly Geniuses in the ancestral tombs of the aborigines, Ye
        Ling’s still stood outside the city with frowns as they wondered how
        they could sneak inside without anyone discovering them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling and Yin Mei had instructed their followers to stay there and
        wait for their return.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Ancient Immortal Continent opened up, a massive number of
        cultivators from the outside broke in and caused a great impact on the
        livelihood of the aborigines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, it wasn’t easy for the outsiders to approach their
        territories. Once they were seen, they would find themselves embroiled
        in a life-and-death battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there were quite a few daring young masters who dared to take
        the risks and went to the territories of the aborigines to steal all
        kinds of ancient Mystical Arts and Treasures of the Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Chi Ling, this is too dangerous! Although Ye Lin isn’t weak, you are
          infiltrating the den of the aborigines, and they have countless True
          Gods, God Kings, and who knows, even Quasi-Sacred Realm masters…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“You should reconsider this matter!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Some of Chi Ling’s followers spoke up at this time, and a handsome man
        with peacock feathers couldn’t help but suggest to her with a frown.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was named Kong Yang, a Young Genius of the Peacock Family. He once
        lost to Chi Ling and turned into her follower, but in fact, he was
        actually one of Chi Ling’s admirers.
      </p>
      <p>
        His strength wasn’t much weaker than Chi Ling’s, but he was still
        willing to become her follower, and that showed his thought process.
        [TL/N: foaking Lolicon Pea<b>sized</b>cock.]
      </p>
      <p>Alas! Chi Ling had to pretend not to see through his intentions.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I believe in Ye Lin’s strength, so there’s no need to say any more
          about this matter. You will stay here! If we end up in some accident,
          then you must escape.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Chi Ling said with a shake of her head.</p>
      <p>She trusted Ye Ling and didn’t believe he would do something dumb.</p>
      <p>
        Kong Yang frowned when he heard her words, and said,
        <b
          >“Chi Ling, why does Ye Lin want to go to the ruins out of nowhere
          tonight? He didn’t say anything about it before, but now, he wants all
          of you to believe him? What if he’s trying to harm you?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If I am not wrong, then he most definitely knows what opportunity is
          hidden in there, and that’s why he brought us here! Now that we are
          here, he doesn’t care about the others but wants to bring the two of
          you along…just what does he want?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        He had spoken out before as well and displayed his dissatisfaction and
        contempt for Ye Ling, but Ye Ling slapped him in the face and humiliated
        him in front of Chi Ling…Kong Yang still had that account to settle with
        Ye Ling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, he paid attention to Ye Ling’s actions and behavior, and
        realized that Ye Ling was doing something weird and hiding many secrets
        from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important matter was the fact that Ye Ling seemed to know where
        to seek opportunities and how to avoid dangers; it was as if he knew in
        advance where all the dangers lay.
      </p>
      <p>What did that mean?</p>
      <p>
        It meant that Ye Ling had a goal and had planned for this a long time
        ago! Otherwise, why was he so adept and seemed to be in control of
        everything?
      </p>
      <p>It’s just that Ye Ling kept all of them in the dark.</p>
      <p>Kong Yang didn’t want Chi Ling to be tricked by Ye Ling.</p>
      <p>
        Alas! Chi Ling’s next words made him clench his fists and ground his
        teeth with unwillingness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Kong Yang, your worries are unnecessary! I completely trust Ye
          Lin.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling shook her head and said with an unchanged expression. There was
        no way she would change her mind just because someone asked her to.
      </p>
      <p>After that, she left and went to discuss the matter with Ye Ling.</p>
      <p><b>“Dammit!”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“Ye Lin, damn you! I want to see just what you are plotting!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Kong Yang’s expression turned ugly and livid as he stared in Ye Ling’s
        direction with rage and coldness in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Ye Ling wasn’t plotting anything, then why was he so sure that
        whatever he wanted was in the ruined city ahead?
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side, Ye Ling and the old turtle ghost in his pendant
        discussed the matter for a while, and then came up with an idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘According to the old ghost’s words, there’s indeed a seventy percent
        chance of success. I didn’t even think about the Power of Reincarnation!
        With the mysteries it contains, we will be able to explore the place…’
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling was overjoyed.</p>
      <p>
        The old turtle in his pendant, on the other hand, showed a strange
        expression as it muttered in its heart, ‘Forget it! The Enlightenment
        Platform left behind by the Heavenly Venerate holds great importance,
        and I reckon the original guardians should still be around.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If everything goes well, then they should choose to submit to this
        brat, Ye Ling, but if it doesn’t, then things will get somewhat
        difficult.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The old turtle didn’t know too much about the details of the matter, all
        it knew was that it was some kind of test left behind by the Ancient
        Heavenly Emperor of Reincarnation for Ye Ling.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he could pass this test, he would get an extremely powerful boost.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Ye Ling, let’s go.”</b></p>
      <p>Right then, a charming, mind-numbing voice sounded.</p>
      <p>
        [TL/N: Yin Mei is a top-tier vixen who can play the innocent girl and

      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei also came over with gentle steps that made her resemble a lotus
        — she had already commanded her followers to do other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        On her face she held a smile that could move anyone’s heart, and her
        curved eyebrows gave her an extremely bright appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling lost his bearings for a moment, but soon recovered and smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene didn’t escape Chi Ling’s gaze, and she couldn’t help but
        frown. Speaking of which, wasn’t Yin Mei the fiancee of Ye Ling’s late
        brother, Bai Lie? How come Ye Ling now held such an attitude towards Yin
        Mei?
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she didn’t say anything about it, she couldn’t help but shake
        her head in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the first time she met Ye Ling, the current Ye Ling gave her
        a sense of incomprehension.

        Could Bai Lie’s death be related to Ye Ling? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at

      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, Chi Ling couldn’t help but fall into deep confusion in her
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could it be that Bai Lie was murdered by Ye Ling and Yin Mei together?
      </p>
      <p>Why else would the two sneakily exchange glances along the way?</p>
      <p>
        From what she could see, Ye Ling indeed seemed to have a different kind
        of emotion towards Yin Mei, or he wouldn’t have gone to rescue her from
        danger even at the cost of exposing his identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important matter was the fact that Ye Ling didn’t show any
        concern for Bai Lie, his virtuous brother who always valued him, and
        helped a lot in his cultivation — he seemed to have no respect for Bai
        Lie.
      </p>
      <p>Instead, it was as if he wished for Bai Lie’s death!</p>
      <p>
        This shook Chi Ling’s long-standing trust in Ye Ling, and she couldn’t
        help but give birth to doubts in her heart.

        Ling didn’t seem to have any ill will towards her.

      <p>
        After that, the three of them turned into brilliant rays of light and
        quietly sneaked towards the large ruins ahead.

        At the same time, Ye Ling sacrificed a pitch-black stone that released a
        burst of brilliant runes that wrapped their figures from all directions.

        Ye Ling said to Yin Mei and Chi Ling, who were following behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, he noticed Chi Ling’s expressions from before, but he didn’t
        want to explain anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he was now certain that Yin Mei held feelings of affection
        for him, and he, too, held similar feelings for her.
      </p>
      <p>The two had fallen in love with each other!</p>
      <p>
        He reckoned that even if his Big Bro Bai Lie was alive, he would, at
        most, sigh and not blame them for it.
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling didn’t believe there was anything wrong with his feelings.</p>
      <p>
        [TL/N: holy foak! This dude is more delusional than I imagined him to
        be.]
      </p>
      <p>
        With how awesome he was, wasn’t it only natural for him to attract the
        hearts and minds of favored daughters of heaven?
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling merely wanted to lend them a hand.</p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p><b>[Inside the city.]</b></p>
      <p>
        While Ye Ling and the others sneaked into the ruins, a group of old men
        with strange markings on their bodies gathered inside an ancient,
        magnificent hall with surging Spiritual Qi far denser than the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stars could be seen crumbling in their eyes as seas turned into
        nothingness, and all sorts of terrifying visions flashed past.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of them were mighty, so much so that even the weakest among them was
        a Quasi-Sacred Realm master!
      </p>
      <p>Still, their appearance wasn’t human.</p>
      <p>
        Some had wings, others had vertical eyes on their foreheads, some were
        covered in black pain, others were covered in gold that made them
        resemble immortals made out of gold.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing common about them were the strange ruins flashing in
        their hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one looked closely, they would realize that the ruins were floating
        up and down, and held extremely mysterious appearances…

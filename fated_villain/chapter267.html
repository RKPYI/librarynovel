        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, you&#8217;re joking… How could we ever suspect
                you?&#8221; Feeling an agonising ring in his head, Jun Gou hastily replied as his face turn pale. His
                voice trembled, and he could hardly finish his sentences as he finally got to experience Gu
                Changge&#8217;s spine-chilling, terrorizing intimidation.</span><span id="more-27893"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Qingge, release your Knowledge Sea and let them see whether
                you&#8217;re related to the Successor of Demonic Arts.&#8221; Disregarding Jun Gou&#8217;s response, Gu
                Changge then repeated with an unwavering tone. &#8220;Since they are too much of a coward to check mine,
                I shall visit Confucian Saint School once again someday and have someone more courageous do
                it.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, forget the disciples of Confucian Saint School, even all the
                nearby cultivators were terrified. They felt menaced by his tone of speech, thinking that Gu Changge was
                angered. After all, him coming to Confucian Saint School might indicate that he wouldn&#8217;t mind
                starting an Immortal War with them. This would mean chaos within the trillions of kilometers, every inch
                being bathed with blood.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for scrutinising his Knowledge Sea, not even the founder of Confucian
                Saint School would dare to do so. As a matter of fact, that was the same reason why none dared to
                investigate Ying Shuang when he was suspected to be the Successor of Demonic Arts. After all, all Young
                Masters were the representation of their respective families. Furthermore, Gu Changge&#8217;s identity
                was indubitably more significant than that of Ying Shuang.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jun Gou and the rest were startled and subconsciously shivered.
                Their lips paled and their legs uncontrollably trembled, as though they were forced to insanity. In a
                rather derisive way, although Confusion Saint School was a sect that stood since ancient times,
                possessing endless legacies, they were nothing compared to an Immortal Family, especially the ever so
                enigmatic yet almighty Immortal Gu Family.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Young Master.&#8221; Upon those words, Su Qingge obediently
                closed her eyes and opened up her Knowledge Sea. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, there was nothing but silence. The disciples and cultivators
                were too timid to speak a word as they deliberately lowered the sound of their breath, bearing not the
                courage to search Su Qingge&#8217;s Knowledge Sea.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you mocking me?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s voice, filled with
                coldness, sounded again as he glared at the people of Confucian Saint School. At that moment, terrifying
                anomalies surged in the sky. Even the bystanders who were far away were frightened, so it was certain
                that the dread in the hearts of the people of Confucian Saint School was unfathomable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thump!* The next second, the people of Confucian Saint School, including Jun
                Gou, immediately knelt down despite their reluctance and the humiliation. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are at fault in this matter! We shouldn&#8217;t have doubted Lady
                Su! We beg for your mercy and forgiveness, Young Master Changge! We shall make it up to Lady Su!&#8221;
                Seeing that, the bystanders were confused and nervous. Regardless, it was only deserved that the
                humiliators faced such an outcome. Moreover, compared to a search of someone’s Knowledge Sea, kneeling
                was hardly shameful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After fifteen minutes of silence, as usual, none dared to let out a word,
                while the people of Confucian Saint School were shaking, growing immensely anxious from thinking about
                the other possible outcome.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nevermind. I have my understanding of the Successor of Demonic Arts.
                If Qingge is actually related to it, I&#8217;ll be the first to stop her without any mercy, but if
                anyone dares to mess with her, do not blame me for being ruthless.&#8221; With that, Gu Changge waved
                his hand as he reverted to his calm look.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for your generosity, Young Master Changge!&#8221; The people
                of Confucian Saint School, as if they were just dragged out of the waters, were drenched in cold
                sweat.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, with the misunderstanding settled, the people of Confucian Saint
                School compensated Su Qingge handsomely, offering weapons and Sacred Herbs. Wordlessly, Su Qingge
                followed Gu Changge as they left Confucian Saint School behind. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Successor of Demonic Arts, none had any idea what disguise he was
                now donning. Back in the Celestial Ancient Continent, the Successor of Demonic Arts was spotted
                imitating the appearance of others and hiding among the innocent. As such, the masses had no way of
                dealing with the Successor of Demonic Arts, and all they could do was keep their guards up at all times
                so they wouldn&#8217;t perish like Zhao Xiaoyao, who fell into the hands of the Successor of Demonic
                Arts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, the people of Confucian Saint School were filled with remorse. Not
                only did they embarrass themselves, but they also offended Gu Changge. At once, all sorts of discussion
                and opinions regarding Gu Changge&#8217;s actions surged, whereby many expressed that his actions were
                justified, whereas Confucian Saint School was at fault for drawing conclusions without getting their
                facts straight.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After departing from Eternal Overcast Battlefield, Gu Changge brought Su
                Qingge back to his temporary manor, though he was rather distant with her on the way back. His eyes were
                visibly deep and calm as numerous thoughts flashed across his mind.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My setup this time around is basically flawless in terms of what I did and
                the timing. No matter how smart Su Qingge is, she&#8217;ll never notice that I&#8217;m the one who
                pinned the blame on her. And with me coming to defend her in the nick of time, I&#8217;m sure she likes
                me even more now.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Gu Changge was pretty much certain that Su Qingge was the new
                Successor of Demonic Arts. After all, his Grand Flask was highly sensitive to any traces of the Demonic
                Arts. Although Su Qingge couldn&#8217;t detect his presence, as long as they weren&#8217;t too far
                apart, he would be able to detect her Grand Flask that was condensed by runes. It was as if a genuine
                product met its counterfeit, and a really cheap one at that.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, even Gu Changge was tempted to question her whether she learned at
                least a hundredth of Forbidden Demonic Arts, which he seriously doubted. In fact, succeeding the
                Forbidden Demonic Arts wasn&#8217;t simply condensing the Grand Flask to absorb powers as it involved
                countless other Secret Techniques such as Entanglement Immortal Might, Demonization, Supreme Freed Mind,
                and Against the Heavens Technique, the names of which Su Qingge possibly never heard of, let alone
                learnt about them.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, Gu Changge reckoned that Su Qingge only succeeded barely a
                fragment of the legacy of Forbidden Demonic Arts, which was probably the case for every former Successor
                of Demonic Arts. After all, the creator of Forbidden Demonic Arts was overly discreet. Though, judging
                from the clues Gu Changge could find, he thought that the creator of Forbidden Demonic Arts might have
                created a few inferior copies of himself, given how similar they were, in that they wanted to keep their
                abilities secret.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Gu Changge&#8217;s deep, tranquil eyes, Su Qingge, who was following
                behind, could vaguely figure out what he was contemplating, though she didn&#8217;t quite know what to
                say to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the conflict was dealt with, judging by Gu Changge&#8217;s reaction
                earlier, he only showed up upon obtaining certain information. In other words, he hadn&#8217;t the
                slightest idea that she would be coming to Southern Flourishing Heaven, and him claiming that his mother
                instructed her to look for him was only an excuse he fabricated in order to defend her. Thanks to her
                intelligence, Su Qingge quickly understood Gu Changge&#8217;s motive, to which she tactfully played
                along. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, Gu Changge was clearly waiting for her to start explaining herself.
                After organising her thoughts, Su Qingge subconsciously blinked her eyes as she pulled Gu
                Changge&#8217;s sleeves, after which she spoke in a kittenish tone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, I&#8217;m sorry for lying to you…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, you did what now?&#8221; Withdrawing from his contemplation, Gu
                Changge casually asked without turning back, as if he was awaiting Su Qingge&#8217;s confession.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, I shouldn&#8217;t have lied to you, saying that
                I&#8217;ve come to Southern Flourishing Heaven to look for you,&#8221; she honestly answered, knowing
                very well that lying straight to his face would undoubtedly infuriate him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, since you weren&#8217;t here for me, does that mean you
                don&#8217;t have the intention to see me at all?&#8221; Gu Changge blandly asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re keen to see me anyway. I
                wouldn&#8217;t know what to do if you were to reject my visit…&#8221; Su Qingge sounded somewhat
                frustrated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enthralled, Gu Changge then questioned, &#8220;But why would I do
                that?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ve never paid me a visit ever since you left me in Primal
                Celestial Temple. I&#8217;d thought you had forgotten about me. I&#8217;m sure women are lining up for
                someone like you. Young Master has Princess Mingkong, and the Successor of the Mortal Palace for
                instance, and I&#8217;m aware that I have no place in your heart.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Either way, I&#8217;m only here to kill some Eternal Overcast
                creatures so that I could enter Immortal Academy, instead of meeting with you.&#8221; At that moment, Su
                Qingge was pretty upfront, expressing whatever was in her mind without fearing Gu Changge&#8217;s
                rebuke.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very well, Su Qingge. I see that you&#8217;ve grown a pair, saying
                such indecent words to me.&#8221; Finally, Gu Changge turned around and grabbed her delicate chin. There
                was not a trace of emotion on his face.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only did you not come see me, you even caused such a problem for
                me. I&#8217;ll make you sure you learn your lesson…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Teach me the lesson then, Young Master.&#8221; Su Qingge was strangely
                bold, perhaps because she was touched by how Gu Changge unconditionally chose to believe her. In that
                instant, flickering her eyes, she stared back at him with a provoking look.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, you knew I wouldn&#8217;t, yet you still provoke me that
                way…&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Changge helplessly shook his head.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master…&#8221; Su Qingge deliberately extended her voice,
                smiling delightedly. &#8220;May I ask you a question?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Gu Changge tensed his brows.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What would you do if I&#8217;m really the Successor of Demonic
                Arts?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s with that question? Isn&#8217;t Prince Ying the Successor
                of Demonic Arts? Are you perhaps related to him?&#8221; Gu Changge leisurely asked with an unbothered
                look.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course not. I&#8217;m just simply asking to know where I stand in
                your heart…&#8221; Su Qingge&#8217;s eyes were fixated on him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        </p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that even a question? I&#8217;ll have to kill you, of course. I
                can&#8217;t have you terrorising the people of the world.&#8221; Gu Changge peered at her as if he was
                looking at an idiot.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of silence, Su Qingge replied, &#8220;You&#8217;re so
                heartless, Young Master.&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked somewhat sad. &#8220;But I guess it&#8217;s a blessing to die in
                your hands.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you&#8217;re really the Successor of Demonic Arts, I won&#8217;t be
                able to shake off my connection with you since I&#8217;m the one who brought you to the Upper Realm.
                Thus, after I killed you, it won&#8217;t be long until I come to accompany you.&#8221; Gu changge
                casually smiled as he pinched her nose.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t spout such nonsense, Young Master! You&#8217;re destined
                to be the leader of this world. I&#8217;m not worth dying for.&#8221; Despite knowing Gu Changge was
                only joking, Su Qingge sternly looked at him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s nonsense, as you said. Why are you so worked up?&#8221; Gu
                Changge innocently smiled, though in his heart, he was very fascinated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time rapidly flowed, a few days had passed. Following the hiding of Ying
                Shuang, the occurrence of the Successor of Demonic Arts in Southern Flourishing Heaven grew less.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many youths, be it young prodigies or ancient monstrosities, formed a small
                team to hunt down Eternal Overcast creatures. Since they moved as a unit, they successfully prevented
                many troubles such as encountering the Successor of Demonic Arts. As such, their hunting was quite
                efficient. And for quite a while, the name of the Successor of Demonic Arts was no longer heard.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Immortal Academy, which was located in Hong Yu Sky, began
                accepting disciples across the Upper Realm. Anyone, regardless of their origin and race, under the age
                of fifty, was gladly welcomed. Though, the only condition was that the applicants were obliged to
                slaughter enough Eternal Overcast creatures to exchange for points that could win a seat in the Immortal
                Academy. At once, the youths that accumulated enough points gradually hurried towards Hong Yu
                Sky.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, as of late, daunting ships could be seen soaring through the
                skies, grand and divine. Some cultivators rode on ancient beasts across regions, and their presence was
                absolutely shocking. As if clouds were billowing while stars were gathered, things were highly exuberant
                in Hong Yu Sky.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Yu Sky&#8217;s was named after a formidable cultivator, Hong Yu, whose
                cultivation level was said to have surpassed that of a True Immortal, and achieved an entirely different
                Realm. Though, that was simply a baseless rumour.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terrains of Hong Yu Sky were vast and mysterious, containing massive
                divine mountains and heavenly trees. From high up in the sky, dense celestial energy could be perceived,
                surging across the lands. At the same time, innumerable anomalies appeared, including the hopping Qilin
                and the soaring Celestial Phoenix.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, it wasn&#8217;t without reason that Immortal Academy was
                based in Hong Yu Sky. Be it cultivation resources, legacy of Sacred Emperor Realm experts, extravagant
                manors or rich treasures such as Celestial Herbs and Sacred Trees as well as heavenly lakes and godly
                metals, Hong Yu Sky was one of the rare places that offered abundant quantity of such treasures and
                resources, hence Immortal Academy was regarded as the mandatory Land of Immortalisation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, within Immortal Academy, things weren&#8217;t exactly
                peaceful either. In an ancient palace surrounded by Chaos Energy within the void, a number of menacing
                Elders, whose eyes were filled with Chaos Energy, were reading ancient archives. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documents beside them recorded the details of every young prodigy
                that was less than fifty years old. At that moment, the Elders&#8217; faces were serene, as if they
                wouldn&#8217;t be affected even if they witnessed wonders such as the reincarnation of an ancient
                prodigy, a new-born Sacred Emperor Realm expert, ancient Eye Techniques, Unrivalled Battle Physiques, or
                even the tethering between one&#8217;s heart and soul. Essentially, In their eyes, such shocking
                occurrences were nothing notable but an established norm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, stupefaction flashed across one of the Elders&#8217; eyes,
                and after taking a better look, he was visibly stunned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Elder next to him also tensed his brows, muttering, &#8220;An
                Immortal and a Demon sharing a body could overturn the flow of Yin and Yang and escape from
                reincarnation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Immortal Demon Physique. It&#8217;s been a while since I last saw such
                a physique,&#8221; another Elder joined in and softly said. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t remember how long
                ago it was…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprise surged in the eyes of the Elders. &#8220;It seems another monstrous
                entity is about to spawn. As of now, only a few displayed the might of the Quasi-Sacred Realm. One from
                the Gu Family, one from the Wang Family, one from the Phoenix Mountains, Prince Shen from Sky Emperor
                Mountain, as well as a disciple from Golden Cicada Temple. Anyone of them could possibly be the
                Successor or Demonic Arts. Perhaps an exceptional dark horse is about to rise.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By the way, I figure it&#8217;s almost time for the Wondrous Stone
                we&#8217;ve sealed off for so long to return. With such a great competition, I believe we should start
                with them. Though, there&#8217;s no telling what will happen to the Successors from the Demon
                World.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As &#8216;Demon World&#8217; was mentioned, the Elders intuitively grew stern
                and fearful, not because they were scared of Demon World, but because there was an ancient being in the
                Demon Race in the Immortal Academy who came from the Demon World. His disciple was now the empress who
                ruled Demon World, Empress Yao Xi.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, he never accepted another disciple after Empress Yao Xi,
                causing a rather awkward situation, wherein no other Elder of the Immortal Academy dared to accept a
                Successor from the Demon World as their disciple, and that included the Elder from the Demon Race, who
                would reject all applicants despite their aptitude and Talents.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, since it wasn&#8217;t quite appropriate for the other Elders to
                take over his responsibility, the number of Successors from the Demon World coming to the Immortal
                Academy gradually decreased. Hence, the Elders were wondering if anyone from the Demon World would
                come.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right as the Elders were discussing, in a region within Demon World that was
                millions upon millions of kilometres away…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a traditional-looking room, a man of the Demon Race suddenly woke up from
                his dreams and screamed. His face was blanched and his forehead was drenched in cold sweat. With a
                devastated look, he painfully shouted, &#8220;Oh, Yao Xi, my true love, how could you kill
                me?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, a young maid of the Demon Race that was in charge of taking care
                of the man was startled as she was shocked stiff, baffled by how her young master suddenly passed out
                and blurted nonsense once he regained his consciousness.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yao Xi? Is he referring to Empress Yao Xi, who is the ruler of the Demon
                World?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, what are you talking about? We shouldn&#8217;t be
                yelling Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s name out loud. We&#8217;ll get our heads severed!&#8221; Understandably
                dumbfounded, the young maid stuttered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What…&#8221; Hearing that, the Demon man on the bed was
                stunned, as his eyes were filled with disbelief. After some time, he finally recovered his
                senses.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was the heir of the Solar Demon Overlord, who was once one of the Six
                Demon Overlords, while Yao Xi, his best friend growing up, was the daughter of the Lunar Demon
                Overlord</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Didn&#8217;t I drink Yao Xi&#8217;s poison right before she killed
                me with her blade? Why am I still alive? And Yao Xi… is now the Empress?]</span></p>

          its diameter was more than several meters thick and grew in every
          direction. Its leaves and branches shimmered with a green light which

          his star-like gaze contained a sense of dominance within its depths.
          It was the Sky Demon Sovereign, and he couldn&#8217;t hide the

          came from the Sky Demon Cloud Tomb, which was the final resting place
          for the most powerful demons in all under heaven. Those ancient demons
          would quietly leave their clans when they had very little time left to
          live and find a place to meditate and pass away, and the Sky Demon

          straight onto the ancient vine.

          space surrounding the place. However, everyone could sense a faint
          celestial light shimmering from the Intangible Demonic Rock. The
          blinding light surging from it seemed like an ethereal demonic fairy
          dancing slowly around the rock. The sight astounded everyone and they
          couldn&#8217;t look away, feeling that the dance steps contained some

          Demonic Rock like it was hypnotised and its spirit had been drawn into
          the rock, remaining frozen. The colours of its feathers were becoming
          more vibrant though, with new feathers growing from several bald
          spots.</span

          powerful primordial demon. Could it be that this bird is not as simple
          as it looks?] Gu Changge was taken aback and pondered this. As a
          Fortuitous Lady, it was understandable that Gu Xianer&#8217;s
          possessions would have unusual origins.

          ugly. He had prepared for this by reading multiple classical
          scriptures and was confident in himself. Besides, he was also
          recognised by the Demon Race as a young prodigy and unrivalled among
          his peers. [Do I really not have an opportunity with this Divine

          change. He did not mind that, looking at the big red bird beside Gu
          Xianer. After a moment&#8217;s thought, he did not put it on the rock.
          If the Intangible Demonic Rock really had a connection with the bird,

          Sovereign had those thoughts in mind when they saw the Young War
          Immortal. The Successor of Demonic Arts was everyone&#8217;s common
          enemy, and if they managed to acquire knowledge of his current
          strength and abilities, it would help in formulating a counterattack
          if they encountered him.</span

          >&#8220;Greetings, fellow brothers.&#8221; The Young War Immortal
          looked charming and had long hair, with golden cross-shaped runes
          flashing across his eyes. This was a mysterious and terrifying Talent
          of his Eye Technique, which made many afraid to meet his eyes.

          >He greeted the Phoenix Lady, King with Six Crowns, Yu Feiya and the
          other young prodigies with a smile after his arrival, while An Xi and
          the rest looked completely at ease as if she had already forgotten her
          humiliation.

          >&#8220;It&#8217;s fine now. Thank you for your concern.&#8221; The
          Young War Immortal shook his head and looked towards Gu Changge. His
          pupils contracted and his entire body shook when he noticed Su Qingge
          beside the other man; while he quickly recovered, his reaction did not
          trick the young prodigies present. Several Sect Masters as well as
          ancient beings looked confused as well. From what they saw, it was
          clear he hadn&#8217;t reacted this way because he saw Gu
          Changge.</span

          >&#8220;Why are you staring at me for? Do you want to avenge your War
          Immortal Manor’s previous War Immortal?&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at
          Su Qingge secretly before smiling at him.</span

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shit! She actually wants to kill me. Shit!” Wang Xiao, who was activating his artifact, was struck by the blow. Yelling in agony, he spewed a mouthful of blood as his mind collapsed upon the backlash. His face turned pale as he was in dismay. Ji Qingxuan, who only dared to raise her voice but not her hands, suddenly mustered the courage to kill him.</span><span id="more-28054"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Old Xuan, save me!&#8221; At that moment, Wang Xiao could no longer care about his pride, shouting at the sky to call for reinforcement. Indubitably, with his own strength, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to defeat Ji Qingxuan, and at such a moment, no one could save him except his guardian.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Screaming for help?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan tensed her brows and her voice remained freezing cold. Once again, she drew her delicate hands and her sword flew and bloomed in the sky, releasing thousands of sword-like beams that then barraged downwards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, all those on the streets were dumbfounded as the disturbance was simply too frightening. Many of them turned into divine rainbows and rushed to the sky to observe what was happening, only to find themselves stupefied as buildings and pavilions immedaitely turned into ruins upon the shockwave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one expected anyone to be so bold as to starting a fight in the Capital of Vermilion Bird Empire. As of late, the imperial palace had declared the forbidding of death battles in the empire so as to allow a peaceful environment for its people. And it was known from the rumours that the Young Master of the Immortal Gu Family was now in Vermilion Bird Empire, so the imperial palace’s decision was understandable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who are those two? How dare they fight here? What a startling shockwave…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They don&#8217;t seem old. Perhaps young prodigies from the Immortal Academy?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Compared to them, I, having cultivated for so many years, am nothing but dogshit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re called young prodigies. They are in no way the same as us normal people.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many cultivators were astonished as their hearts palpitated, but they also felt bitter realising the disparity between them and these young prodigies. Instinctively, many assumed the ones fighting it out were young prodigies from the Immortal Academy. Otherwise, no one other than those young prodigies would possess such terrifying powers at such young ages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiftly, the terrorizing disturbance was relayed to the depths of the palace, after which young prodigies who had yet to depart from the place were surprised before turning in to divine rainbows and hurried over to witness the battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This voice… belongs to Junior Brother? Why is he shouting?&#8221; Chu Hao, who was discussing empire affairs with the Vermilion Bird Emperor, revealed a frown. Since he had reached the Sacred King Realm, he instantly heard Wang Xiao&#8217;s scream for help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Chu Hao didn&#8217;t quite like his rebellious, boastful Junior, he and the Vermilion Bird Empire couldn&#8217;t afford to have Wang Xiao fall into trouble in the empire. With that in mind, Chu Hao heaved a sigh, and his only choice was to check out what happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father, I shall go check the disturbance out.&#8221; Having said that, Chu Hao took a step forward and departed, appearing outside the palace as he advanced towards the noise.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Halt at once!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, Wang Xiao, who was fighting Ji Qingxuan, heard the voice and immediately grew gleeful, yelling, &#8220;Save me, Old Xuan! Ji Qingxuan has gone insane! She actually tried to kill me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the air, Old Xuan, with a vexed face, appeared. He was in the Sacred Lord Realm, which was only one level below the Sacred King Realm. The second he landed, his aura of Sacred Lord Realm quickly surrounded the area, carrying the vast intimidation of an enraged ancient god. The colour of the sky changed as the winds and clouds were reversed, while a terrifying anomaly formed in the sky of the Capital of Vermilion Bird Empire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a small nation like Vermilion Bird Empire, someone in the Sacred Lord Realm was considered as a crucial being akin to an ancient Ancestor, who would only show up whenever the empire was in grave danger. Therefore, the arrival of the being in not just any Sacred Lord Realm, but Peak Sacred Lord Realm, came with a repressing aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a Sacred Lord Realm expert!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even a Sacred Lord Realm expert is getting involved. How terrifying…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many dropped their jaws as their souls trembled in fear. They even almost knelt down towards the direction to worship the Sacred Lord Realm expert.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Old Xuan, take her down! She&#8217;s gone mad!&#8221; Relieved at Old Xuan&#8217;s presence, Wang Xiao revealed a menacing expression, and a sinister grin as he glared at Ji Qingxuan as though she was as good as dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his eyes, Ji Qingxuan must have gone deranged. Otherwise, she wouldn&#8217;t have pulled off such a crazy stunt by trying to kill him. Nevertheless, now that Old Xuan was here, he no longer had to be afraid of her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Ji, are you aware of what you are doing?&#8221; However, instead of charging at her right away, Old Xuan coldly stared at Ji Qingxuan and questioned. At a swing of an arm, a bright yet ambiguous yellow shine erupted around him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, a yellow gourd covered in Chaos mist appeared from his sleeve, possessing the force to split the world in half. If Ji Qingxuan failed to give a satisfactory answer, he would subdue and trap her in the gourd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And who are you? Another bully?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan retained the iciness on her face, and as though she felt no fear, she countered, &#8220;I have no idea where your bravery to attack me came from, but if Young Master were to know this, even you, a Sacred Lord Realm expert, will die.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master… Ji Qingxuan, what are you talking about?&#8221; Old Xuan furrowed his brows. His first instinct was that Ji Qingxuan must have gone insane to speak of such nonsense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the cultivators and young prodigies that hurried over were stupefied. [A Sacred Lord Realm expert will die? That woman in white is quite a bold one, isn&#8217;t she? Who is she, really?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many were thoroughly dumbfounded, one person recognised Ji Qingxuan and with a shaky voice, he stated, &#8220;This woman seems to be someone who was by Young Master Changge&#8217;s side?” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person speaking was a muscular man covered in scales. He was also a young prodigy from the Immortal Academy, who had not yet rushed into the Eternal Overcast Battlefield here to slaughter Eternal Overcast creatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He once saw Gu Changge from afar, and standing beside him was this woman in white. Thanks  to the woman in white&#8217;s stunning beauty, the man in scales took a few more glances, hence his memory of her existence. Nonetheless, his words were drowned in the befuddled chatters of other cultivators, so none of them heard him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh no, this is bad.&#8221; The young prodigy&#8217;s face paled as he knew of the consequence of the battle, after which, he hastily moved and left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, on his way out, he suddenly remembered something, so he decided to rush to the palace as he thought such an event should be reported to the higher-ups. Or else, if Gu Changge needed someone to blame, the young prodigy, who was at the scene, would possibly be roped into this incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Old Xuan, stop jabbering with her! She is intent on killing me!&#8221; At the scene, Wang Xiao exclaimed with an extremely gloomy voice, and he was significantly injured when he fought her earlier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have got the wrong person. I am not Ji Qingxuan.&#8221; Hearing that, Ji Qingxuan claimed with a glower, and her voice was as cold as the sharpest icicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Still pretending at this point, huh? I guess you&#8217;ll only surrender at the brink of death. Old Xuan, finish her!&#8221; Wang Xiao commanded as he scoffed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* As soon as he voiced his command, Old Xuan nodded, and without speaking anymore, the guardian decided to engage. At a swing of an arm, the yellow gourd glowed, drawing raging winds and surrounded by Chaos mist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the terrifying aura of a Sacred Lord Realm expert, Ji Qingxuan was nothing but a leaf on a tide that could be swept away anytime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Zap!* The next second, the opening of the gourd let out Sword Qi that grew into the size of a mountain. This horrifying energy surged to the sky, harbouring immense murderous aura that could shatter it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s dangerous! We need to back off!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Sacred Lord Realm expert is making a move. How chaotic! No one will be able to defend against this!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone had their expression drastically changed. They speedily turned into divine rainbows and fled, not wanting to be touched by even the slightest trace of the shockwave. Otherwise, their bodies would disintegrate into ashes and disperse with the wind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thump!* In that instant, Ji Qingxuan grew visibly anxious, as she didn&#8217;t expect Old Xuan to be so merciless that he would resort to such an overpowering move. Fortunately, possessing numberless protective tools, she instantaneously broke a jade disc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, white ambiguous lights surged, shielding her from the strike of the Sword Qi. Nonetheless, she wasn&#8217;t fully protected as she was sent flying away, crashing into massive buildings and pavilions. As all of her organs were ripped apart, she coughed out pieces of her organs as her face grew bloodless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Strange. She doesn&#8217;t seem scared, feigning not even the slightest concern. Does she actually wish for death?&#8221; At that moment, Old Xuan thought something was off given how Ji Qingxuan wasn&#8217;t affected by his fatal blow. It was as though he fell right into her trap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did something happen that drove her to seek death?] Bearing this in mind, Old Xuan immediately withdrew his hands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Does Ji Qingxuan actually want to die?&#8221; Wang Xiao muttered with a scowl as he suddenly felt uneasy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* All of a sudden, a golden divine rainbow appeared from the sky, resembling a pathway to heaven, and the one descending from it was none other than Chu Hao himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Junior Brother Wang, what has happening here?&#8221; He questioned Wang Xiao with a bewildered frown as he hurried over upon hearing Wang Xiao&#8217;s scream for help. Though, it seemed that he was too late.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his eyes, Wang Xiao appeared rather intact, without any problem since he had a guardian in the Sacred Lord Realm by his side. [Who&#8217;s trying to harm Junior Brother Wang?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eldest Senior Brother, for some reason, Junior Sister Ji seemed to have gone insane today. I merely stopped her to ask some questions and she responded by trying to kill me. If it weren&#8217;t for Old Xuan, I would have died by her hands!&#8221; Wang Xiao explained as though he was the victim, speaking with a puzzled voice and an oblivious expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Junior Sister Ji has gone insane?&#8221; Chu Hao was dazed hearing that, instantly knowing that that was nothing but utter nonsense.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a master of fact, he was quite familiar with Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s personality. Wang Xiao’s provocation drove her to attack, and what Wang Xiao said was nothing but an excuse. After all, Ji Qingxuan was indeed in a bad position in her family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, Chu Hao heaved a sigh, realising how burdensome things were, yet blaming Wang Xiao at such a moment would be impractical.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eldest Senior Brother? What happened? Why are all of you here?&#8221; Out of nowhere, a cool, confused voice was heard as a beguiling woman walked over from afar with a face full of perplexion. Her face was snowy like jade, alluringly glowing; her skin was paler than snow, as if she was the perfect creation of the gods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant the woman appeared, be it Chu Hao, Wang Xiao, or Old Xuan, everyone was completely stunned, dropping their jaws out of speechlessness. Even the cultivators nearby that were observing were dazed.  Some were even rubbing their eyes thinking that they were under some sort of illusion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wasn&#8217;t that the woman blown by the Sword Qi, and had crashed into the ruins? How did she reappear without any signs of injuries, and in another garment? No! That&#8217;s not the same person; they simply look the same!] In that instant, many realised what happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Junior Sister Ji, you&#8217;re fine! That&#8217;s great! I was worried that you were in danger or something.&#8221; Seeing &#8216;Ji Qingxuan&#8217; who walked over, Chu Hao let out a sigh of relief, comforted by &#8216;Ji Qingxuans&#8217;s&#8217; safety. Though, he had yet to notice the shocked look on the faces of Wang Xiao and Old Xuan, thinking that only the disturbance was alarming since Ji Qingxuan appeared unharmed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Junior Sister Ji… Who was that woman that looked exactly the same as you?&#8221; Taken aback, Wang Xiao subconsciously asked as he couldn&#8217;t process what just happened. [Why are there two Ji Qingxuans? Who&#8217;s that woman we attacked? I&#8217;ve never heard of Ji Qingxuan having a twin sister.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A woman looked exactly the same as me?&#8221; Hearing that, &#8216;Ji Qingxuan&#8217; was surprised, after which she asked back, &#8220;How do you know I&#8217;m looking for this other person?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That…&#8221; Upon those words, Wang Xiao&#8217;s face froze as he felt threatened upon connecting &#8216;Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s&#8217; question and the words of the woman in white earlier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, distress and insecurity overwhelmed his mind. Apparently, the woman wasn&#8217;t Ji Qingxuan in another outfit, but an entirely different person who looked the same as her. He just mistook her for Ji Qingxuan. Swiftly, Wang Xiao came to his senses, realising what was going on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, something is wrong. We might have really gotten the wrong person…&#8221; Old Xuan muttered with a stern voice. Recently, countless young prodigies from the Immortal Academy were gathered in Vermilion Bird Empire. And the young woman they just attacked must possess remarkable background judging by her formidable strength.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Honestly, what&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Chu Hao questioned with a scowl. At that moment, he somewhat grasped that Wang Xiao and Old Xuan mistook a person, a female stranger, as Ji Qingxuan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, where is that woman?&#8221; &#8216;Ji Qingxuan,&#8217; who was actually Su Qingge, asked with a startled face, seemingly nervous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, to be honest, she witnessed everything Ji Qingxuan did earlier, and she felt perturbed by it as she didn&#8217;t expect Ji Qingxuan to be so reckless that she would resort to self-harm. After all, that blow of Sword Qi was indeed a devastating one. Evidently, it was clear how much Ji Qingxuan resented Wang Xiao that she opted for such a method.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Zoom!* Right as the crowd was in a turmoil, talking about the incident, a number of divine rainbows speedily surged high up in the sky, carrying tremendous power that even caused the sky to tremble. The man who was leading the large group was a young man who seemed other-worldly. His swaying white robe was covered in godly beams, as if the entire universe was revolving around him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s Young Master Changge!&#8221; A cultivator with keen eyes instinctively exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To think that this incident even made Young Master Changge move… This is going to be good.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Regardless, why is Young Master Changge here? Did he come to watch as well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were totally stupefied, not expecting the battle would draw Gu Changge&#8217;s attention.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Gu Changge&#8217;s recent arrival at Vermilion Bird Empire was widely known as almost everyone knew that he was temporarily staying in the depths of the palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, this is Young Master Changge… It&#8217;s my first time seeing him…&#8221; the real Su Qingge turned over with a surprised look, as though she didn&#8217;t notice Old Xuan and Wang Xiao&#8217;s agonised faces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is this guy here?&#8221; Chu Hao tensed his brows. For some reason, he could sense that Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t as amiable as he looked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, is it possible that…&#8221; Old Xuan&#8217;s voice grew even deeper as he felt distraught.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Impossible. Judging by Gu Changge&#8217;s identity, he must only be passing by. If he is really related to that woman in white, why doesn&#8217;t she have a guardian by her side?&#8221; Wang Xiao denied as he shook his head. His explanation felt more like self-assurance. Although he was from the Hidden Wang Family, he was nothing but a speck of dust compared to Gu Changge. It was even possible for one of  Gu Changge&#8217;s followers to hold even more influence and power than him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next second, Wang Xiao&#8217;s heart palpitated as his face gradually blanched, peering at how the nearby cultivators and young prodigies promptly made way for the golden divine rainbows that descended from the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a calm voice, Gu Changge stared at the real Su Qingge the moment he landed and nodded. &#8220;Glad that you&#8217;re fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly dazed, Su Qingge asked out of confusion, &#8220;Young Master Changge, are you talking to me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite saying that, she felt a gush of warmth flowing in her heart. In her eyes, Gu Changge must have hurried over upon hearing that she was in a battle with a Sacred Lord Realm expert, only to mistake her for the &#8216;Ji Qingxuan&#8217;, who she was pretending to be. Regardless, it was clear that even Gu Changge was unable to distinguish her from Ji Qingxuan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Gu Changge squinted his eyes. He could see that although Su Qingge was donning a different garment and accessories, her Fortuity remained unchanged. Thus, the woman before her was indeed Su Qingge herself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is she trying to do?] Nevertheless, Gu Changge quickly remembered the Fortuity Mission that pertained to Su Qingge, which seemed to be related to her background.  Furthermore, since it was related to her background, it must also involve her close ones. In other words, Su Qingge was trying to switch things up and get away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems that Su Qingge must have met her sister, who looks exactly the same as her, in the Vermilion Bird Empire. So, you came up with this to escape from scrutiny.] Instantly, Gu Changge figured out Su Qingge&#8217;s plan, but he didn&#8217;t plan to expose her. Since she had her own plans, he couldn&#8217;t bother to interrupt it. Since she was the Successor of Demonic Arts, he couldn&#8217;t have her stay by his side all the time, or she wouldn&#8217;t be able to achieve her maximum value.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It amazes me how similar you look to my female servant. I must have mistaken you for her.&#8221; With that, Gu Changge revealed a subtle smile, and without saying anything more, he turned around and left in another direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, upon those words, Wang Xiao and Old Xuan&#8217;s face immediately paled without a trace of blood to be seen as their bodies were drenched in cold sweat. They heard it right. Gu Changge himself claimed that he was amazed by how Ji Qingxuan looked the same as his female servant.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

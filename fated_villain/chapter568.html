          >*Swoosh!* In response to Ji Yaoxing’s command, a group of armored
          knights rushed into the banquet hall and surrounded Jiang Chen. The
          air was thick with murderous intent which seemed to chill the room,
          making everyone tremble.</span

          >Jiang Chen appeared to be completely bewildered, as if he had been
          caught off guard by a sudden deluge of icy water. He stood there,
          frozen in shock, unable to process what had just happened. Despite his
          burning desire to seek justice on behalf of Ji Chuyue, there was
          simply no time for him to be upset about her situation right
          now.</span

          swiftly rose to their feet and positioned themselves protectively in
          front of Jiang Chen.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They couldn’t comprehend why Ji Yaoxing would attempt to seize Jiang
          Chen, who possessed the Legacy of a Divine Source Master and limitless
          potential. This seemed like an unnecessary and unjustifiable
          disturbance. Furthermore, Jiang Chen had been brought along by them,
          so if he was taken away by Ji Yaoxing, it would be a blatant insult to
          them.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Brother…” Ji Chuyue paled as she quickly understood Ji Yaoxing’s
          intentions. Her mind raced with worry. Ji Yaoxing knew the truth about
          Jiang Chen’s identity. If his real identity were to be exposed in
          front of everyone, Jiang Chen would likely become a target for endless
          pursuit, forced to live as a fugitive and as an enemy of all.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Lady Chuyue, you seem rather concerned for this Divine Source
          Master’s safety,” Gu Changge remarked with a curious tone.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Chuyue reacted swiftly, her heart growing increasingly uneasy. She
          shook her head and quickly clarified, “No, you’ve misunderstood me,
          Young Master Changge&#8230; I simply…”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge interrupted her with a small smile and said, “It’s
          admirable that Lady Chuyue holds friendship and righteousness in high
          regard, but I hope you still remember your status and his. Do you
          truly wish to bring unnecessary disaster upon your family?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing those words, Ji Chuyue’s delicate face turned even
          paler. She discreetly clutched her sleeves, attempting to articulate a
          response. However, the words faltered on her tongue, and she swallowed
          them back down. She could only hang her head sadly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was well aware that Jiang Chen had offended many Forces. Many
          even believed that he had murdered many Sect Masters within the Godly
          Illusion Tomb. Though Jiang Chen claimed he was falsely accused by Gu
          Changge and the Godly Illusion Clan, there was no concrete evidence to
          support his claims.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Given the circumstances, any assistance she provided to Jiang Chen
          would undoubtedly bring dire consequences to her family, especially so
          when Jiang Chen remained steadfast in viewing Gu Changge as his
          archnemesis.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Observing the perplexed expressions on everyone’s faces, Ji Yaoxing
          cast a glance at Gu Changge standing behind him. Upon receiving his
          subtle nod of approval, he continued to speak calmly, “It seems like
          you still don’t know this person’s true identity as he has chosen to
          keep it concealed, Young War Immortal and Lady An Xi.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“True identity?” The word surprised the King with Six Crowns and the
          others. They all looked at Jiang Chen in confusion, wondering if he
          indeed had another identity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen realized what Ji Yaoxing was going to say next. His face
          contorted with rage as he clenched his fists tightly. “Gu Changge, you
          sanctimonious hypocrite! You’re insane! Karma will bite you in the ass
          one day!”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite the potential consequences, Jiang Chen couldn’t hold back his
          fury any longer as strings of curses escaped his lips. He never had
          anything to do with the incident that occurred in Godly Illusion Tomb.
          In fact, he was falsely accused by Gu Changge and the Godly Illusion
          Clan for the murder of the Sect Masters. Jiang Chen’s eyes were ablaze
          with fury when he realized that Gu Changge had ordered Ji Yaoxing to
          capture him right now.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What…? He has another identity?” An Xi and the Young War Immortal’s
          hearts skipped a beat, sensing that Jiang Chen’s true identity was
          about to be exposed. They very quickly regained their composure and
          pretended to be shocked and confused, acting as if they had no prior
          knowledge of Jiang Chen&#8217;s true identity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Previously, Jiang Chen had confided in them about the animosity
          between him and Gu Changge, which of course, included the events that
          took place in the Godly Illusion Tomb. Even so, they could only feign
          ignorance as any action on their part could implicate them and even
          the Forces behind them might not be able to protect them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Niu Tian was about to speak up in defense of Jiang Chen, but
          ultimately he let out a heavy sigh and remained silent. Anyone with a
          sound mind could see that no one could possibly save Jiang Chen today
          and he was not foolish enough to act recklessly when faced with such
          insurmountable odds.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unfazed by Jiang Chen&#8217;s outburst, Gu Changge simply smiled and
          gracefully rose from his seat. “If you had concealed yourself better,
          perhaps I wouldn&#8217;t have discovered you. Yet you have the
          audacity to strut around right under my nose. Are you underestimating
          me or are you simply very confident in yourself?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen’s eyes burned with fury as he glared at Gu Changge and
          spat, “You despicable hypocrite. You’re a beast disguised as a
          human&#8230; One day, someone will make you pay for the things you’ve
          done…!”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before he could say more, an elderly man, dressed like a butler,
          suddenly appeared beside him. He elegantly flicked his sleeves,
          unleashing a powerful force that made Jiang Chen gasp in pain. His
          complexion turned ashen, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood before
          collapsing onto the ground, unable to even attempt to resist. The
          overwhelming pressure felt like an immense mountain bearing down on
          the top of his head.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“How dare you disrespect the Young Master. Do you have a death wish,
          young man?” the old man spoke nonchalantly, then waved his hand. A
          group of knights approached and quickly detained Jiang Chen. The
          atmosphere grew tense as the young prodigies watched, realizing that
          the elderly man was indeed a True Daoist. With someone like him
          around, it would be difficult for Jiang Chen to escape even if he were
          to grow a pair of wings on his back.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“It appears that further explanation is unnecessary. All of you
          should be able to tell that this man has disguised himself and
          infiltrated our midst with nefarious intentions. It would be wise to
          apprehend him before any harm is done,” Ji Yaoxing said.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone was silent as they surmised that there was likely some
          animosity between Jiang Chen and Gu Changge. They were not foolish
          enough to stand up for Jiang Chen and potentially incur the wrath of
          Gu Changge.</span

          >“Damn it, I can’t believe that Brother Jiang would deceive us when we
          genuinely treated him as a good friend of ours,” the Young War
          Immortal lamented in disappointment as he watched Jiang Chen being led
          away.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >An Xi shook her head and let out a sigh of disappointment too. “It
          seems we’ve misjudged Brother Jiang all along. Perhaps his intention
          was to deceive us from the very beginning. Thanks to Young Master
          Changge’s keen insight, we were able to see through his true
          intentions and prevent any potential disaster from occurring.”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that, the Young War Immortal and An Xi managed to sever all ties
          with Jiang Chen cleanly. They even wore a pained expression,
          pretending to be saddened by the fact that they had been deceived by
          him for such a long time.</span

          Young War Immortal and An Xi, he remained composed and smiled
          gracefully. “He is indeed a sly man. He actually managed to hide in
          Dark Kun City for so long. It was only recently I discovered his
          presence.”</span

          Kun Mountain. Sister, join me later and offer some wise counsel to

          world, so it would be indecipherable to the common folk. He believed
          that once Xiao Ruoyin read the letter, she would know that it was from
          an old friend.</span

          standing guard at the entrance immediately shifted. Without a moment
          of delay, he quickly left to deliver the letter.</span

          skyrocketed, with even the Elders showering her with flattery. Her
          reputation had become so illustrious that even most of the disciples
          dared not meet her gaze in her presence.</span

          realized the mixed emotions he felt. He could tell that Xiao Ruoyin
          was probably leading a good life here.</span

          or authority, could not only become a member of the prestigious Force

          distinguished position within it.</span

          he would have been far inferior to Jiang Chen. Even so, Jiang Chen was
          not worthy of gazing upon Xiao Ruoyin. She was able to acquire all
          this thanks to the support of the man she relied on! It was clear that
          Xiao Ruoyin and the both of them were now living in two separate

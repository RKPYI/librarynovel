<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it? Are you feeling sick?&#8221; </span><span id="more-28051"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the ancient battleship heading to the Vermilion Bird Empire, there was a palace with dense spiritual energy. Rays of light shone so bright it shot to the sky. Gu Changge had asked the question absently as he seem to be in a good mood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No. I just have a strange feeling for some unknown reason.&#8221; Lying in his arms, Su Qingge shifted to a more comfortable position and shook her head. &#8220;Do you remember what happened in the Lower Realm?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What happened in the Lower Realm?&#8221; He raised his eyebrows before recalling that she had mentioned. [She wanted to look for her mother when I sent Yan Ji to search for her whereabouts after she left the temple. Is she asking me this question before of that?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you talking about your mother and your background?&#8221; It had been a long time since then, but Gu Changge still remembers. Su Qingge&#8217;s mother was from the Upper Realm and she held a noble status. She somehow went to the Lower Realm and was taken back to the Upper Realm after giving birth to Su Qingge. Su Qingge&#8217;s father had always hoped that Su Qingge would search for her mother when she went to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You still remember.&#8221; She sounded delighted. &#8220;I thought you already forgot about that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t remind me, I would have forgotten all about it,&#8221; he replied carelessly with a strange expression on his face as he heard a sudden notification from the System.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Activate Su Qingge&#8217;s Fortuity Mission? I would only encounter a random mission like this when I meet a Fortuitous One. Is it because I might meet one on my trip to the Empire? Someone that might be connected to her or her background? She had two souls within her body. Even so, her other soul had not taken over, which means she has a exceptionally strong will.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[However, the System hadn&#8217;t said anything about that, so I can’t tell conclude anything from this notification at the moment. Su Qingge deserved her reputation as the Fortuitous Lady though. Her Fortuity would increase drastically every day. I have watched her improve from around 300 Fortuity in the Lower Realm all the way to nearly 10,000. Who would have thought that the most beautiful woman in the Eastern Barren would become the Successor of Demonic Arts, greatly feared by the Upper Realm?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She really is one of a kind.] Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t help but smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, why are you smiling?&#8221; Su Qingge gazed at him, feeling he was more human now unlike the distant untouchable person he had been before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve arrived at the Vermilion Bird Empire.&#8221; Gu Changge did not answer her question but instead rose to his feet. His enormous and powerful divine sense descended and he noticed the majestic capital below. As nearly half of the Empire had fallen, just like the other Empires that the other disciples were heading to, he felt that the trial would going to be  much more interesting that he had thought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He held no certainty in resolving the Eternal Overcast crsis. Likewise, he did not want to do it either. After all, the fall of the Vermilion Bird Empire would actually be beneficial to him. Muddled waters would enable him to carry out his plan for Sky King Zhi Yang, and it would be even better if Jiang Chuchu could find him a Eternal Overcast Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge.&#8221; As Su Qingge and Gu Changge exited the palace, Jiang Chuchu opened her eyes from where she had been meditating. She seemed humiliated and angry, her expression rude and cold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did you rest well, Saintess Chuchu?&#8221; Gu Changge walked over and greeted her lightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221; Jiang Chuchu forced the word &#8216;bastard&#8217; down as they were in public. Her expression smoothed out without showing any suspicious signs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You must have rested well then.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled again. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to cooperate with me during the trial. Since you are the Successor of the Mortal Palace, you probably have many abilities that can eliminate Eternal Overcast creatures.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. We&#8217;ll have to trouble Saintess Chuchu. From what I&#8217;ve seen during our journey, the crisis caused by the Eternal Overcast doesn&#8217;t seem that simple…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So many Eternal Overcast creatures have appeared. We&#8217;ll need help from Young Master Changge and Saintess Chuchu.&#8221; The other disciples chimed in with agreement as they did not notice any strange interaction between Jiang Chuchu and Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge is extremely capable. With him around, I may not even have the chance to intervene as I have some knowledge of my own limitations.&#8221; Jiang Chuchu shook her head while replying with a calm voice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other disciples felt that she was being humble as her strength had already been publicly recognised. She had shown might comparable to those in the Sacred Realm before and furthermore, the rumours all aligned that the strength of the two Successors of the Mortal Palace would be much superior to their peers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can&#8217;t say that, Saintess Chuchu. You are really humble; I have already experienced your power plenty of times.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other disciples thought it was them just being courteous, but some even began to wonder whether the two had fought before. Jiang Chuchu might have said those words because she knew she couldn&#8217;t win against him. At that thought, their admiration towards Gu Changge grew since he already defeated the Successor of Mortal Palace without anyone else knowing. He was undefeatable!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu didn&#8217;t think that though. She had the feeling that he meant something else with his words and gritted her teeth. [Experience my power? He really dared to say that in front of everyone? How shameless!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the gates which leads to the Vermilion Bird Empire capital, many who already heard the news gathered in masses. They were all representatives of their respective faction inside the Empire, who had known of the Eternal Overcast crisis and were discussing how to resolve the situation. They had never thought that the Third Prince would return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Third Prince. The Third Prince has really returned. That&#8217;s amazing news.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Third Prince arrived just when we are in danger. We might be saved now! We won&#8217;t need to flee our home.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many came to the gates to welcome him, and became excited as soon as they saw the handsome man standing at the gates. Anyone who had lived in the Empire would have heard of the extraordinarily gifted Third Prince Chu Hao. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was said that on the day of his birth, the sound of Dao chimes could be heard as golden lotus flowers bloomed. Spring water had emerged from the ground, celestial plants grew in abundance, and a manifestation of Buddha’s resting place had appeared above the palace. After that, cranes had flown from every direction accompanied by mist. Although there were no Immortal riding on the cranes, one crane held an Immortal Herb that was at least a million years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This event had caused great shock in the Empire and caused a lot of heated commotion. Many felt that the Third Prince was the reincarnation of an Immortal, and he would become one upon his death, achieving immortality. After all, even the other prodigies, born at the same time as him, were outshone by him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s unimaginable that Eldest Senior Brother was born here. It&#8217;s so remote. The Fortuity of the Empire is declining as well. It&#8217;s hard to believe how it has supported the growth and development of such a person.&#8221; Said the young woman was tall and slender, with pale skin, fine features, and a cool aura. She was clad in a long dress made of silk from a fire silkworm more than a million years old, which currently shimmered with interwoven Principles and runes. It looked extremely mysterious and ancient. She sounded surprised and disbelieving at the fact that such a talented man had been born here. In their view, natural talent such as his should be developed by someone at least of an Immortal Sect or Immortal Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chu Hao did not mind her words, only smiling. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already told you to not be surprised when you come with me. My family and the land we reside in is certainly not strong, but I&#8217;m still grateful to the Empire that had raised me. My father had provided me with ample cultivation resources even when the treasury was empty. It still wasn&#8217;t enough for me, so I left the Empire and travelled about. If I hadn&#8217;t met the cranes who had appeared when I was born, I wouldn&#8217;t have found the sect.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, that&#8217;s the reason. I&#8217;ve never heard you mention this before. Your father must be a respectable man.&#8221; The young woman was stunned by this, her gaze full of admiration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s why, if you see anyone in the Vermilion Bird Empire, you should not act pretentious, especially not in front of my father.&#8221; Chu Hao became serious, becoming worried that his Juniors would consider themselves superior and act condescendingly towards those from  the Empire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry Eldest Senior Brother, we’ll never do that. We aren&#8217;t here to inconvenience you…&#8221; The frivolous-looking youth immediately smiled and made the promise. He was still reverent towards his Seniors after all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman only glanced at him without speaking. Chu Hao knew their personalities well and so could guess what they were thinking respectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman&#8217;s name was Ji Qingxuan of the Hidden Ji Family, an extremely ancient yet mysterious and low-profile family. Everyone had heard of Immortal Sects and Families but not the Hidden Families. Such Families were a mix of powerful and weak families as any family who had existed for at least one era, could call themselves a Hidden Family. The Ji Family was different, though, as its origin could be traced back to the beginning of human existence. They had Ancestors that were venerated as ancestors of the Human Race. Furthermore, they were still venerated not based on strength nor cultivation level, but of the great things they did for the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other youth&#8217;s name was Wang Xiao, a prodigy of the Hidden Wang Family. Compared to the Hidden Ji Family, it was an inferior but powerful force to be reckoned. Even the Vermilion Bird Empire could not afford to offend it. He was slightly egoistic, so it was normal for him to be condescending towards the Empire. The only reason he had followed them was because of Ji Qingxuan. Naturally, Chu Hao knew of this. Regardless, he brought him along as his status as Wang Xiao’s Eldest Senior Brother still restrain Wang Xiao to behave better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hao! Hao!&#8221; On the central street of the capital, the Vermilion Bird Emperor, clad in a bird-patterned robe, led his advisors towards the gates in excitement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father.&#8221; Chu Hao smiled and immediately approached.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The emperor of a bunch of mortals…&#8221; Wang Xiao twisted his mouth scornfully.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You really think he can&#8217;t hear you?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan frowned coldly. &#8220;Idiot.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He immediately smiled and moved closer to her. &#8220;Eldest Senior Brother won&#8217;t mind, as his Master still needs my family&#8217;s support to become the sect leader. So, he will close an eye&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She glanced coldly at him without saying anything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Suddenly, a terrible vibrating sound came from above.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An ancient battleship is here…&#8221; Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s gaze shifted as she looked up. Terrifying phantoms that blocked the sky were descending towards the Empire from the distant horizon. It was a grand display that left all within the Empire stunned, while the Vermilion Bird Emperor looked delighted at this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father, what&#8217;s this?&#8221; Chu Hao sounded surprised and looked towards the scene after he noticed the waving flags on the ancient battleships. The grand yet simple words of &#8216;Immortal Academy&#8217; waved in the air and exuded an ancient aura. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the Upper Realm knew of the Immortal Academy. Chu Hao was no exception and felt curious as to how it took notice of a place such as the Empire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s probably the young prodigies from the Immortal Academy,&#8221; explained the Vermilion Bird Emperor. &#8220;The Immortal Academy sent its disciples to stop the the Eternal Overcast crisis as soon as it heard about that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, that&#8217;s why. Was this a trial the Immortal Academy set up? To the Immortal Academy, the only use of this crisis is to train their disciples. The survival of this place is inconsequential to them.] Chu Hao frowned at that thought. He had been curious about this, but he only felt distaste now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal Academy was aloof and otherworldly. It was genuinely detached from the world.. The young prodigies cultivating in it were all of unique backgrounds, so the Empire couldn&#8217;t offend even an Outer Disciple from the Academy. Holding the trial made it seem like the Immortal Academy was being considerate of the Empire by resolving the crisis caused by the Eternal Overcast, but if any of the young prodigies ran into danger here, their families would not hesitate to blame the Empire instead of saying anything to the Immortal Academy. Even if the crisis has been resolved, the Empire wouldn&#8217;t fare any better. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the young prodigies could leave whenever they encountered danger but the Empire couldn&#8217;t do so. Instead, they might have to allocate military and human resources to protect them. After considering these factors, Chu Hao felt that these prodigies were merely here to cause inconvenience, as these young prodigies were such respectable individuals that the Empire might have to protect them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s really hard to express one&#8217;s woes.&#8221; Chu Hao sighed as he looked at his father&#8217;s helpless look. He knew that this wasn&#8217;t something which the Empire could decide upon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Immortal… That&#8217;s strange.&#8221; Ji Qingxuan frowned deeply. For some reason, she had a strange feeling when she saw the ancient battleship. There was a familiar feeling running through her veins, as if there was someone important to her was on that ship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did the current young prodigies of the Immortal Academy actually come to such a place to undergo their trial?&#8221; Wang Xiao was surprised as he had noticed the extremely old and enormous battleship which had Chaos Qi clinging to. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his background, it wouldn&#8217;t be hard for him to enter the Immortal Academy. However, he had cultivated an ancient sect called the Absolute Cave Heaven. It was very mysterious and rarely recruited disciples. Only those who had been fated could go there. Besides, the location of the Cave Heaven was extremely obscure and very few could find it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hadn&#8217;t actually qualified to enter the Cave Heaven, but a member of his family who had been banished due to a grave mistake somehow became a powerful Elder in the Cave Heaven. The person’s greatest wish had been to return to the Wang Family, which was then granted when Wang Xiao was able to become a disciple in the Cave Heaven.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that there are many geniuses and prodigies in this generation. Many strong ancient monstrosities have re-emerged as well, all of them extremely powerful.&#8221; Ji Qingxuan muttered, her eyes looking wishful. The Absolute Cave Heaven wasn&#8217;t exactly weak but it had too few disciples. The young prodigies she had encountered, except for members of the Hidden Ji Family, were the disciples of the Cave Heaven. Wang Xiao&#8217;s strength wasn&#8217;t considered weak among the disciples but he was so much more inferior compared to the famous young prodigies. The only one she respected was Chu Hao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chu Hao looked extremely normal but there was one strange thing about him. He kept feeling like he wasn&#8217;t strong enough, cultivating himself in isolation even though he was already so much stronger than the other disciples of his generation. It was a lengthy one as well and it was rare to see him. An Elder had said that unless the Cave Heaven was in danger of being destroyed, he would never emerge from isolation. If the Vermilion Bird Empire hadn&#8217;t been in danger, she believe that he would&#8217;ve continued his cultivation as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to this opportunity, she now had the chance to leave the Cave Heaven, to see the outside world and meet many other younger prodigies. There was a reason for the Hidden Ji Family was so mysterious and low-profile. It was rare to see even a single member of the Ji Family in the outside world, and there were only several times when she had the opportunity to leave the Cave Heaven.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Big Brother Disciple, you don&#8217;t like these young prodigies?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan quickly noticed Chu Hao&#8217;s expression and felt confused.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He may seem humble but he still has an ego. He definitely has a dislike for these young prodigies.&#8221; Wang Xiao had a transcendent look on his face, his tone was one of deep intrigue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shut up.&#8221; Ji Qingxuan coldly snap at him. She did not hide her disdain of him at all, as her voice felt freezing. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Xiao felt irritated even though he knew that this was how she behaved. He had been scolded and ignored far too many times. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ji Qingxuan, don&#8217;t you forget. That old patriach of yours only had one more decay to go out of the Five Immortal Decays. Once he dies, those that whole a grudge against your family… Hmmm.&#8221; He grinned wolfishly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re asking for it!&#8221; Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s anger nearly boiled over but she forced it down. Wang Xiao smiled in victory, not surprised by it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hao, you don&#8217;t have to come with me to welcome these prodigies. I know your temper and you may clash with them or something.&#8221; The Vermilion Bird Emperor understood the situation and smiled openly. He definitely had to humble himself and flatter these young prodigies when he meet them, and his son might not be able to stand the sight of it. If any quarrels happen, it would be the Empire, who was at a disadvantage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay, Father,&#8221; Chu Hao muttered, fists clenched. He felt angry at his helplessness; he really needed to continue cultivating in isolation. No one would dare underestimate the Vermilion Bird Empire once he had broken through to the Sacred Emperor Realm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I will be able to enter it soon.] If anyone knew Chu Hao&#8217;s thoughts, they would be too shocked to speak. Sacred Emperor Realm? It was a level that an Elder cultivating for millions of years might not be able to reach, but Chu Hao was about to enter this realm soon How old was he? Merely a few hundred years old! Such talent was indescribable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the palace first.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Chu Hao led Ji Qingxuan and Wang Xiao towards another direction, purposefully avoiding the ancient battleship that was about to descend on the Vermilion Bird Empire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought that the Vermilion Bird Empire was linked to the Vermilion Bird Clan while in reality, it&#8217;s just a small kingdom.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve actually wondered what drastic event had happened here but this Empire doesn&#8217;t even seem to have someone in the Sacred King Realm. The most powerful one may be at most in the Sacred Lord Realm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s no surprise that half of the country had been invaded and taken over…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young prodigies looking down from the ancient battleship sounded a little disappointed. With their backgrounds, coming to the Vermilion Bird Empire was like a king arriving in a small mountain village. It was clear why they were so disappointed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This amount of Fortuity… it hasn&#8217;t been this way when I check from the sky. Is the so-called Fortuitous One closely connected to the Vermilion Bird Empire?] Gu Changge narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, young prodigies of the Immortal Academy. I&#8217;m the current Vermilion Bird Emperor.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below the battleship, the Emperor stood at the head of his advisors and several young beautiful princesses. They were all anxious; their heads were lowered uneasily without any sign of happiness or pleasure. Even the key advisors and generals, who held great power within the Empire, were extremely wary, not even daring to exhale loudly.</span></p>

          passed. This six thousand years feel like a dream, but now that
          I&#8217;m awake from this dream, I&#8217;m still Jun Bufan, and Xi Yao
          now stands above all, becoming the current empress of the Demon World.
          However, I will not forget my revenge. One day, I will come to her and

          the past remnants of the Demon Overlords before being Crowned as the

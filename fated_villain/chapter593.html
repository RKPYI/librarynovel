<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s guarantee wasn&#8217;t enough to gain Gu Changge&#8217;s full trust. He had a premonition that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s appearance as the Fortuitous One wasn&#8217;t just an accident. He had a feeling the assassination during the Hunting Event wouldn&#8217;t be successful.</span><span id="more-32776"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How many men have you arranged for the Hunting Event?&#8221; Gu Changge stayed silent for a moment before asking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng thought that Gu Changge was still worried. He let out a smile and explained, &#8220;Young Master Changge doesn&#8217;t have to worry. I have been planning for this day for nearly a century. Nothing will go wrong during the Hunting Event. My men are not only amongst the Forces participating in the Hunting Event, they are even mixed among the Second Prince&#8217;s protection team. Apart from that, I have specially stationed people outside the Hunting Event&#8217;s venue. Those are deathsworn warriors that are loyal to me. As soon as I give the order, they will rush towards the Second Prince and die together with him.&#8221; Yu Tianzheng spoke with great confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had been deducing multiple scenarios to prevent any mishaps, therefore, he plotted many other countermeasures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Double the number of men. I will also secretly send others to assist you.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded as he added on. Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s existence was an anomaly to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s calculated assassination would probably face an accident because of Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.] Gu Changge was planning to secretly send the Nephrite Breeze Pavilion&#8217;s assassins and act accordingly to the situation. He wasn&#8217;t going to allow any accidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I shall listen to Young Master Changge.&#8221; Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s expression turned slightly solemn while his eyes flashed with radiance. He didn&#8217;t dare to defy Gu Changge. Assigning more men might risk exposing the assassination, but it would increase the success rate. There were pros and cons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, Yu Tianzheng vanished into the void. He was worried if he stayed any longer, it might create unnecessary trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The imperial palace had plenty of hidden talents and experts, it wasn&#8217;t a place where he could stay for long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge informed the Alliance of Thousand Merchants to contact Yin Mei. She was to look for Bai Lian&#8217;er and arrange for an assassin to assassinate the Second Prince Yu Lie during the Hunting Event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nephrite Breeze Pavilion might be a rising Force specialised in assassination, but during the recent years, they were starting to suppress the other assassin factions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bai Lian&#8217;er possessed the Killing Emperor Legacy from ancient times, and had great proficiency in training assassins.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Gu Changge&#8217;s support during this period of time, the Nephrite Breeze Pavilion was developing at a rapid speed. Gu Changge had assigned many exterminations to Bai Lian&#8217;er, therefore, he wasn&#8217;t worried about the assassination on the Second Prince.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As for Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, let&#8217;s test him with his younger sister. I don&#8217;t believe he can continue laying low.&#8221; Gu Changge already had plans to test the connection between Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and the Sword of World Domination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon enough, it was the day of the Hunting Event. There were plenty of flying boats, flying artifacts and mounts in the air. There was a massive crowd, so many it was hard to make out anyones face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge, Emperor Yu, and the others were all situated in a luxurious and ancient battleship. They were looking down at the scenery. Behind them were members of the youth generation. They were the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s princes, princesses, and their subordinates. They were all conversing in soft voices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situated further away were the aristocratic Families and Forces, their battleships were also filled with people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of them were led by their Elders, who were at least in the Sacred King Realm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side were the experts from the Immortality Forces, which had friendly ties with the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venue of the Hunting Event was naturally not inside the Imperial Capital. It was located in an area where there was an outburst of Eternal Overcast Scourge. It was located in ruins of a certain Force. They were turned into ashes because they offended a powerful foe, and only a small number of members managed to escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It just so happened that there was an Eternal Overcast outbreak, causing a scourge in the vicinity. As a result, the venue of the Hunting Event was chosen to be at the ruins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Open!!&#8221; The minister who was the host of this Hunting Event let out a deep yell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surrounding void turned hazy as there was a burst of space fluctuation. The Origin Stones that were stacked into a small mountain were about to be liquified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the opening of a large-scale teleportation array. All of the participants from the various Forces were going to be teleported. Naturally, just the Origin Stones used would cost an astronomical amount. Apart from the Immortal Forces, no other Force would be able to afford it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!!* In the next instant, an ancient array seal appeared in the sky. It looked as though a passageway was ripped open, which pierced through the universe. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all of the flying boats and battleships gathered there, it was a truly huge commotion, stretching across the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the cultivators and citizens of the Great Yu Imperial Capital personally witnessed the scene as the flying boats and battleships vanished in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travelling across countless mountains, lakes, rivers, everyone&#8217;s vision suddenly cleared up again as they appeared at the border of a wilderness. This place was desolate and there were no signs of life within hundreds of thousands of kilometres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking from high above, one would be able to see that the mountain ridges were split out by strange marks. It looked like a dragon rising up to the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can see why they named the place the Soaring Nine Dragons. It is indeed incredible. It is a pity that the peak of this region has long been over. Otherwise, it would definitely be a settlement for a mighty Sect.&#8221; Gu Changge spoke with a little amazement</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is truly a pity for this prized land. This is originally a settlement of a great sect that flourished a long time ago. Had they not offended a great foe, they would have continued to exist now. Now that the ‘Nine Dragons’ have been beheaded, it is hard for it to rise up.&#8221; Emperor Yu sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge let out a noncommittal smile. When a Force suddenly appeared and could threaten the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, the first reaction would surely be to eliminate them. Therefore, the story of offending a great foe and being extinguished overnight was just a rumour spread out by the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth was probably known by the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty alone. Of course, Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t be bothered to uncover it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The venue of the Hunting Event is right in front. That place has been enveloped by dense Yin Energy from the Eternal Overcast. This emperor suspects that Eternal Overcast Creatures have appeared there. I have sent people to investigate, but they all have died.&#8221; Emperor Yu pointed at the wilderness and explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded and looked over while asking with a smile, &#8220;Then this Hunting Event is to hunt them down?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu looked at Gu Changge and replied, &#8220;Precisely. But other beasts could also be a target. Of course, disciples of the various Forces are also targets themselves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking, Emperor Yu had doubts in his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Gu Changge&#8217;s behaviour and tone, it didn&#8217;t seem like he had malicious intentions towards the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. But why would Yu Feiya warn him to be wary of Gu Changge? She even asked him to assign more men to protect the Second Prince Yu Lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was something that Emperor Yu couldn&#8217;t understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as compared to Gu Changge, he was definitely more willing to trust his daughter. Therefore, he had actually assigned more men to protect Yu Lie, who was also the future Successor for the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. No accidents must happen to Yu Lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems like there will be a chaotic battle at the venue.&#8221; Gu Changge let out a faint smile as he looked down from the ancient battleship. The ancient battleship was among a gathering of battleships and flying boats. All of them were filled with people and they were talking about the Hunting Event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many young prodigies were rubbing their fists, looking forward to the Hunting Event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Second Prince Yu Lie was a man with a graceful appearance. He was wearing green robes and it seemed like he had 108 divine halos behind him, making him like the son of god.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His innate aura of nobility made it hard to ignore his existence. He was standing together with Yu Feiya and the others while speaking softly to each other. From time to time, he would send radiating glances towards the direction of Emperor Yu and Gu Changge&#8217;s group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this Hunting Event, the princes and princesses were naturally going to participate as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to maintain the imperial family&#8217;s prestige, they had to obtain high rankings so as not to shame themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Elder sister doesn&#8217;t have to worry. I will be cautious.&#8221; Yu Lie didn&#8217;t know why his elder sister would repeatedly remind him to be careful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the future ruler of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, he was naturally confident in his own strength. He might have promised in speech, but he didn&#8217;t in his heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya knew that Yu Lie didn&#8217;t wholeheartedly bother about her reminders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She let out a soft sigh before taking a glance at Gu Changge. Seeing that Gu Changge was having a pleasant conversation with her father, it was hard for her to think that Gu Changge would arrange someone to assassinate the Second Prince or wanted to take over the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, an expert from the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty appeared and brought out a colourful and exquisite tower. It was flowing with mystical yellow Qi. It was extremely ancient and was floating in the sky, with radiance cascading down from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an artifact that could enveloped this venue and could also present images of what was happening within.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Emperor Yu stood out and waved his sleeve. The sky suddenly turned dark. A blurry image of the emperor appeared and was branded into the sky. It seemed like a supreme ruler patrolling the area, emitting a terrifying pressure and deterrence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes narrowed a little as he realised that Emperor Yu might have noticed something was up. Otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t manifest his Dharma Body to ensure the safety of the venue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Emperor Yu beside him was only a Spiritual Manifestation and wasn&#8217;t the real Emperor Yu. Even so, his aura was profound and extremely terrifying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as Emperor Yu was within the domain of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, he would be innately undefeatable. This was unrelated to his cultivation realm. Be it the citizen’s belief or his imperial Qi, they were all free for Emperor Yu to use and they were nearly limitless. Unless the opponent cultivated the same technique as Emperor Yu, he would be unmatched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gu Changge thought to this point, he looked towards the Tuo Ba Family. He saw Tuo Ba Xiao Yao lowering his head and still had that dumb-witted expression. It felt as though nothing in the surrounding was affecting him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the minister hosting the Hunting Event explained the rules, the prodigies of the various Forces flew down like divine rainbows and headed for the wilderness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miasma was everywhere and it was extremely hazy. There were roars of ferocious beasts and it felt like a single roar could smash the heavens. It truly made one&#8217;s blood tremble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Hunting Event, even participants of the same Sect might become enemies. Therefore, the young prodigies had scattered themselves, heading for different regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the Successors of those major Forces, no one would be willing to work with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Lie, Yu Feiya, Yu Ming and the other imperial descendants had also quickly vanished into the depths of the wilderness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High up in the sky, the Elders of the various Forces were fully concentrating on the colourful treasure tower, trying to find scenes of their disciples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For this Hunting Event, I wonder if Young Master Changge is paying attention to any candidate?&#8221; On the ancient battleship, Emperor Yu stood with his hands behind his back and was smiling slightly as he asked Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess Feiya&#8217;s strength is immeasurable. In my opinion, she is definitely going to be in the top three.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled as he answered with an elegant and transcending aura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu laughed heartily and said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think that Young Master Changge would have such high expectations of Feiya. This is her honour.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind Emperor Yu were all the ministers who were also trying to find scenes of their descendants in the colourful treasure tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge withdrew his gaze and calmly looked far away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hunting Event&#8217;s venue was being heavily guarded in the surroundings. It might not be flawless, but if there was an attack, it would have an immediate response. It was difficult for Yu Tianzheng to successfully assassinate the Second Prince Yu Lie at this moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems like we have to wait for the correct timing.] Gu Changge thought to himself. He leisurely sat there and enjoyed the tea. From time to time, he would whisper something to Jiang Chuchu, which would make her blush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time passed quickly as the young prodigies were all in a madness of killing the beasts and Eternal Overcast Creatures in the wilderness. There would be a dreadful Qi or blood that pierced through the sky randomly. There were even smoke signals, which would spread to all directions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the Elders were starting to get worried as the situations became intense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might be the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s tradition, but after each Hunting Event, less than 50% of the participants would return alive. It was enough to show the brutality of this tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The people I have arranged should be making their move soon.] Gu Changge looked up and saw that it was gradually turning dark. The moon could be seen rising up from the horizon, but it was still very faint. He looked towards the colourful treasure tower with a little interest and found Tuo Ba Xiao Yao in one of the scenes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third child of the great general.. He wasn&#8217;t famous in the Imperial Capital and was extremely low-profile, therefore, not many people were paying attention to him. Even his father, Tuo Ba Yun Tian, didn&#8217;t bother about him. Instead, he was searching for his second daughter and youngest daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Gu Changge’s eyes, he could only considered Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s performance to be mediocre. He had encountered some ‘dangerous’ situations, but had ‘narrowly survived’. The opponents he met weren&#8217;t considered strong either, they were disciples from those minor Forces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was indeed hard to see through anything under these circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the General Manor&#8217;s Fourth Young Lady? Did you lose your elder brothers and sisters?&#8221; In the depths of the wilderness, there was a young lady sitting under a withered tree while trying to adjust her breaths. She suddenly opened her eyes when she heard someone talking. Her eyes appeared with shock and chill as she was facing multiple individuals in front of her.</span></p>

          its source, like stars glittering in the sky. From there, a gigantic
          purple palm descended down, as if it was the hand of God. This palm
          contained terrifying Sacred Principles and looked like it could crush
          everything. All divine abilities and techniques would be easily
          crushed into dust under its might. </span

          struck Song Fan and made him spit blood. The force sent him flying
          backwards, which destroyed several buildings. His expression had
          completely turned into one of shock as his whole face turned pale, as

          friends. The force made them spit blood and scream in pain, deeply
          humiliating them. The accumulated momentum from the strike immediately
          exploded forward, sweeping away trees and cracking the ground open

          How should I address you? With your powers, I don&#8217;t think you

          prostrating themselves while shivering in fear. &#8220;If I
          hadn&#8217;t happened to be passing, you wouldn&#8217;t be so lucky.

          his natural behaviour or it was for some other reason. [I’d never
          expect him to say that. How is he so confident that they’d never be

          apologised to her fearfully, as if they were extremely scared of the
          Sky King. She frowned at this, but decided not to pursue the matter,
          as she felt that she was not such a stubborn person. They have already
          paid the price after getting such serious injuries and also
          apologising to her. Since someone had come in to punish them, she saw
          no need to further pursue the matter.</span

          satisfaction and waved a hand to dismiss them. [This whole heroic
          rescue might be a little old-fashioned, but it is good enough for a
          first meeting between us. It seems extremely natural and a reasonable
          coincidence. In fact, since very few people know that Song Fan is my
          follower, Gu Xianer would never suspect this has all been staged by
          me.]</span

          prostrating themselves. Wang Zhongyong had informed him of Gu

          as the mistake did not amount to a death sentence. However, it was
          something that he would do, and an act which made her touched yet
          helpless. After all, not everyone could act and care for someone else

          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, this punishment is too severe. They were
          rude but did not cause any harm to Lady Xianer. They had been ignorant
          of the fact that she is your sister, so their mistake is not so
          serious.&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang spoke up, frowning. Gu
          Changge&#8217;s extreme and cruel behaviour made him frustrated [Why
          does he just kill others for the simplest of reasons? I never expected
          things to progress like this. Still, on the account that I am a Ranked
          Disciple speaking up for them, even Gu Changge would be merciful
          towards them.]</span

          slightly in response. He then continued, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
          so. Letting them die this way is too easy for them. That girl&#8217;s
          slightly stupid, but others should not even think of tricking her.
          Anyone who does so should pay the price. All of them combined is
          nothing compared to a strand of her hair. No one, let alone some
          unknown people, can bully a member of the Gu Family, especially my
          sister!&#8221;</span

          >Gu Xianer froze at that, looking suspiciously at Gu Changge. [I’ve
          been tricked? Was all this staged by the Sky King himself? What is his
          motive? We’ve never met before, right?]</span

          >Immediately after that, she recalled his next sentence. Her brain
          turned into static and her face went red. [Why did he say that out of
          nowhere? All of them combined are nothing compared to a strand of my
          hair? Who praises others like that? How corny. He really has become
          more disgusting.]</span

          give Lady Xianer a satisfactory apology for everything today. We are
          all disciples of the Immortal Academy, after all…&#8221; Zhi Yang
          spoke calmly in a deep voice. A hint of fury had flashed across his
          face once he saw Gu Xianer&#8217;s expression, but he soon returned to
          his prior expression.</span

          were interrupted by Gu Changge at once. He looked icy yet undisturbed
          by the whole incident. &#8220;Are you brave enough to accept it if I
          gave it to you?&#8221;</span

          >A resounding silence followed his words, so much that a needle
          dropping could be heard. Song Fan and his friends were so shocked they
          were shaking in terror.</span

          >Gu Changge struck at once after finishing his sentence, showing his
          aggression. A palm extended down from the sky, accompanied by a
          colourful divine light. It resembled the technique of the Sky King and
          looked to be as powerful as a milestone grinding the world to
          oblivion.</span

          with anger as he clenched his fists. He hadn&#8217;t expected Gu
          Changge to say that without giving him any courtesy, and now Gu
          Changge had attacked the group to kill them. He had to swallow down

          meet with my old friends,&#8221; the Supreme Elder looked at Xiao Yang

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          shivered. The Supreme Elder didn&#8217;t seem as extraordinary as they
          expected. However, the aura he carried was immensely
          spine-chilling.</span

          mountains, lakes, valleys as well as the nearby tribe bases in front

          grew speechless. [Is everything we have seen during our journey merely
          an illusion, or are they a creation of Supreme Mountain Elder? How
          terrifying! Just what immeasurable cultivation realm has he

          leader of the Luo Clan was stunned, confused as to why Yan Ming would
          attend the banquet. Theoretically, Yan Ming shouldn&#8217;t care about
          an insignificant family such as the Luo Clan, let alone coming all the
          way to them.</span

          Senior during their time cultivating in Thousand Dao Academy. Perhaps
          he has come for her?] Despite making such guesses in his heart, the
          leader of the Luo Clan hastily sprung up from his seat and rushed to
          the doors to welcome the unexpected guest. No matter what, Yan
          Ming&#8217;s arrival could only be advantageous to the Luo Clan.</span

          remained to be concealed under her red veil, she could still hear the
          noises outside the grand hall. As such, she couldn&#8217;t help but
          tense her brows in bewilderment. She still remembered that Yan Ming
          once confessed to her his admiration for her, which was then
          unfortunately rejected. As such, she felt faint restlessness arising
          in her heart, worried that the wedding might not run smoothly.</span

          strange, given that his eyes weren&#8217;t as unfocused as they were
          before. Rather, it was somewhat exuberant, and there were even faint
          godly lights flowing within. Though, delirium still seemed to
          remain.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that, Luo Ying grew curious and wondered whether Luo Feng was
          merely pretending to be a fool or that his idiocy was caused by some
          other factor. [But Luo Feng right now does seem very different from
          how he is known by everyone else.]</span

          as though it was a feeling wherein fragments of memories were
          reawakening and fusing together in a fractured conscience.
          Nevertheless, the number of memory fragments were too great, as if
          they were overwhelming his mind like a raging torrent, causing him to
          be in a dumb, semi-conscious state for over twenty years.</span

          retained the memories of everything Luo Ying had done all these years.
          Essentially, he was nothing but a fool to Luo Ying, so she never hide

          could indubitably detect the Bloodline power flowing within Luo Ying.

      <h4>
        Chapter 204: Gu Changge loves Yue Mingkong; The Mortal Seizing the
        Strong.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong knew Gu Changge was just probing her to see if she had any
        information on those Ancient Freaks and if they were any potential
        targets he could use.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she did not expect him to be so blunt about it, asking directly
        for her opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the future development she was familiar with, the descendants
        of Human Ancestral Hall would soon leave their seclusion and walk around
        the world, trying to find the Reincarnation of the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        While also trying to find a way to kill the current Demonic Arts
        Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she did not actually know what happened to the heirs of the
        Human Ancestral Hall that visited Gu Changge in her previous life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, though many things had changed during this life, the only
        thing that didn’t change was Gu Changge's sinister personality and
        deeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire Upper Realm had been completely trapped within the palm of
        his hand in both of her lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she really decided to play it off as a joke and not be honest with
        him, she might really become a widow as Gu Changge said.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at that time, Yue Mingkong would undoubtedly choose to commit
        suicide and follow Gu Changge to the afterlife.
      </p>
      <p>But she obviously did not want to see that situation come to pass.</p>
      <p><b>“It seems that you don't know about Wang Zijin's origin.” </b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled in intrigue, before casually continuing,<b>
          “If I plan against her, the risk will be great. But it’ll be different
          if you help me.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Hm? Where does Wang Zijin come from? What do you mean?” </b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong was taken aback. Gu Changge actually felt that she could
        help him?
      </p>
      <p>‘Did he notice something?’</p>
      <p>
        But she didn't want to think too much about it, as she had sensed
        something unusual about Gu Changge’s sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Wang Zijin’s origin…? Isn't she an Ancient Freak of the Wang family?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Judging from Gu Changge’s previous actions, it’s obvious that he’s
        going to use Wang Zijin as a pawn.’
      </p>
      <p>Seeing Yue Mingkong's expression, Gu Changge now understood.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Sure enough. In the timeline where Yue Mingkong was killed by “Gu
        Changge”, the transmigrator, Wang Zijin, did not exist.'
      </p>
      <p>
        There were so many unknown variables in this life. It truly looked like
        God was deliberately targeting him.
      </p>
      <p>But Gu Changge didn't care.</p>
      <p>
        As a transmigrator, Wang Zijin did not pose much threat to him. It was
        just a coincidence that she was also a descendant of the Human Ancestral
        Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if Gu Changge did not care about her Fortune Value, the huge
        benefits she could bring to him just because of her identity were worthy
        of him taking action against Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge pretended to be thinking about something, before
        speaking out once more,
        <b
          >“Wang Zijin… is actually a descendant of the Human Ancestral
          Hall.’</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“The descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall?” </b></p>
      <p>Yuemingkong was stunned and seemed in disbelief.</p>
      <p>
        Then she reacted, her brows dipping as her expression changed slightly,
        feeling unpleasant in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall who visited Gu Changge in her
        previous life was not Zijin, but instead, a mysterious person shrouded
        in mist, their gender unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        This meant that Wang Zijin, who had approached her Gu Changge, was a
        character that had never appeared in her previous life.
      </p>
      <p>‘Once again, things have deviated greatly.’</p>
      <p>
        This was proof that everything she experienced in her previous life was
        unlikely to happen in this life too.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong seemed to suddenly harbour some hopeful expectations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Mingkong, it seems that you didn't know about this.”</b> Gu
        Changge's eyes narrowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, he looked at Wang Zijin who was talking with the Wang family in
        the distance, and his expression became interested.
      </p>
      <p>It seems that there were still some things that he didn’t expect.</p>
      <p>
        There was no doubt that Wang Zijin was the descendant of the Human
        Ancestral Hall, but by looking at Yue Mingkong, it was obvious that the
        descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall she knew was someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It means there is another descendent of the Human Ancestral Hall.’ Gu
        Changge quickly thought of such a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The other descendant obviously should be a character who should have
        existed in the original timeline.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘But Wang Zijin, whom Mingkong don’t know, must be a variable added in
        this timeline.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Changge, you have to be careful with the Ancestral Hall.”</b> Yue
        Mingkong's face had a rare, cautious expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong’s regression and her identity as a regressor would have no
        effect on this Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Mingkong, you don't have to worry about it. You can make your own
          decision for your husband.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled faintly. He had already thought it through.</p>
      <p>
        According to Yue Mingkong's words, another descendant of the Human
        Ancestral Hall was likely going to come and trouble him, or she would
        not be reminding him like this.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was not worried at all.</p>
      <p>
        This gave him another plan. Just before deciding on the most suitable
        target, he could first stage a masterpiece.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, being unable to help himself, he shook Yue Mingkong's
        hand, and a black rune vanished in it.
      </p>
      <p><b>“What's wrong?” </b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong was a little puzzled, noticing the abnormal changes in Gu
        Changge's hands.
      </p>
      <p>At what point would he be overwhelmed?</p>
      <p>Obviously when he was worried and afraid.</p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, Gu Changge has always been strategizing and controlling
        everything.
      </p>
      <p>It's hard to see what he cares about or was worried about.</p>
      <p>Such a move showed that he was not sure in his heart.</p>
      <p>
        It seemed that the Reincarnation of the Human Ancestor did put a lot of
        pressure on Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Yue Mingkong felt that she should put the matter of
        going to Tianchen Realm first on her priority list.

        </script>
      </div>
      <p>The Human Ancestor must not appear this soon!</p>
      <p>For Gu Changge, she must find a way to delay all this!!</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong looked at him deeply, as if to see through Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“It's alright.”</b> Seeing this, Gu Changge shook his head slightly.
        ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Why do you have such an expression, don’t you believe in me?”</b> Gu
        Changge asked with a faint smile as if he didn't know what she was
        thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        He naturally did this on purpose, just to make Yue Mingkong mistakenly
        think that he was worried about the imminent return of the Human
        Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        So that Yue Mingkong would rush to the place where the Reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor was.
      </p>
      <p>
        The black rune was, naturally, to determine the whereabouts of Yue
        Mingkong when she finally arrived there, allowing him to steal any
        opportunities that might arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        After plotting against her a little, Gu Changge didn't feel guilty at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not a simple task to poke news from Yue Mingkong's mouth, while
        also being unable to reveal her identity as a regressor.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge was willing to do this and accompany her to stage
        this kind of resentment scene.
      </p>
      <p>Life would be too boring otherwise.</p>
      <p>
        [Kshn: Yeah, life is too boring unless you keep fucking your wife, oh
        mb, I meant keeping fucking up with your wife]
      </p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge's view, while going against one of these Favoured
        Daughters of Heaven with their overflowing Fortune Values like Mingkong…
      </p>
      <p>
        To truly get her surrender, it was obvious that he needed her to reveal
        the secret of rebirth personally to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he wanted a lot of Fortune Values and Destiny Points, he naturally
        would’ve to start with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, a big part of it was because he really loved Yue Mingkong… as
        his belonging, totally different from romantic love.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If using Wang Zijin doesn't work, then you can consider picking one
          from those Ancient Freaks, such as the Gadai Tianjiao of the Immortal
          Lake, the Vermillion Bird Clan’s sealed Huo Daozi or the Golden Qilin
          Clan’s…”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Yue Mingkong was also seriously thinking and making
        suggestions for Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        She certainly couldn't tell Gu Changge directly that the various
        DaoistSsects would build a True Immortal Academy, but she could still
        reveal the names of some of the more famous Ancient Freaks and sealed
        Heavenly Princes that appeared after the establishment of the True
        Immortal Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, if Gu Changge really wanted to ask where she got this news,
        then she might as well explain and muddle the past and present.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing her serious look, Gu Changge couldn't help but smile.</p>
      <p>‘Feels like I've influenced her a bit…'</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Mingkong, I'm really starting to like you more and more
          nowadays.”</b
        >
        Gu Changge said with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong's eyes glimmered.</p>
      <p>
        Although she liked to hear Gu Changge say such things, she also
        understood that at this time, the most important thing was to properly
        hide away Gu Changge's identity first.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person next to them didn't even know what the two were discussing
        right now, otherwise, they would definitely be horrified, and their
        souls would almost disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong worried that the identity of Gu Changge's Forbidden Demonic
        Arts’ Inheritor would soon be exposed, and he was also starting to
        figure out how to throw this black pot on others.
      </p>
      <p>She could do this kind of thing without any guilt.</p>
      <p>
        After all, for Gu Changge's sake, even if she ended up standing on the
        opposite side of the entire Upper Realm, it would not make her hesitate
        one bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The other descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall… It’s just that I’m
        not sure how the relationship between them or Wang Zijin is…’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at Wang Zijin in the distance, and there was a flash
        of profound meaning in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of the identity of a transmigrator, it was likely
        that Wang Zijin also possessed a dismissive attitude towards the Human
        Ancestral Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this premise, he could arrange some things and make a better plan.
      </p>
      <p>Wasn’t it a waste if he didn’t use Wang Zijin?</p>
      <p>
        ‘Speaking of which, I think the time for me to use the puppets left by
        Ancient Deity of Reincarnation might come soon.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge thought of the Great Sacred Realm puppets in his Inner Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of their special material and forging method, as long as they
        were not destroyed completely, one could still restore them in the
        portable Immortal Cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing was that the strength of these puppets were
        pure Cultivation Base strengths, with each having different Formation
        Cores.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, Gu Changge could use these puppets to forge the
        so-called Forbidden Demonic Art’s Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, all he needed to do was create a situation where he
        “accidentally” encounters the Forbidden Demonic Art’s Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could use the aura of Immortal Devouring Demonic Arts to conceal the
        puppet's original Formation Core.
      </p>
      <p>Like this, he started brewing another one of his plans.</p>
      <p>As a result, he'll be able to remain hidden for a long time.</p>
      <p>
        After all, before this, for the outside world, he was the only one who
        had fought against the real Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts and
        the only witness was Yin Mei.
      </p>
      <p>Although it was persuasive, it was obviously not enough.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge must at least let some cultivators witness all this with
        their own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>As for how to do this? Gu Changge already had a plan.</p>
      <p>
        Wasn’t the other descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall on his way to
        him? This was a beautiful opportunity!
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, if he turns lies to truth and truth to lies, who’ll be
        able to distinguish between them?
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Gu Changge smiled deeply.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, before, he considered creating a clone to pretend to be the
        Forbidden Demonic Art’s Inheritor, but he rejected it later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless he has a problem in his head, why would he disguise another
        identity by himself rather than making someone else a scapegoat? Wasn’t
        that superfluous?
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn’t it normal put the black pot on the enemies and let them bear the
        misfortunes and blame for him?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >[Ding! A Favoured Son of Heaven is detected. A mortal seizes the
          strongest plotline.]</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge, who was thinking about his next plan,
        suddenly heard the sound of the system’s message prompt.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was taken aback for a moment, and his expression was a little
        inexplicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to what he knew about the system, it was obviously talking
        about the emergence of a new Favoured Son of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>And the system even gave him a hint…</p>
      <p>‘A mortal seizes the strongest?’</p>
      <p>This time the prompt sound came a bit unexpectedly.</p>
      <p>
        ‘There was no system prompt before, is there any reason for it to pop up
        now?’ Gu Changge thought about it but didn't take this issue to heart.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>After all, the system didn’t ever do anything unnecessary.</p>
      <p>
        Even when Wang Zijin appeared last time, it gave him a hint telling [A
        fellow from another world].
      </p>
      <p>His fellow, didn’t that mean a transmigrator?</p>
      <p>‘So this time, it’s the plot of a mortal who seized the strongest?’</p>
      <p>
        It was one of those trash routines in his previous world where an
        ordinary mortal suddenly gets put into the body and identity of a
        powerful man, replacing him.
      </p>
      <p>Although panicking inside, he’d have to pretend to be calm.</p>
      <p>It was also king of interesting.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had seen this kind of routine a lot, even if they pretended
        to resemble the original owner of the body, some flaws and weaknesses
        would be revealed inevitably.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's eyes slowly swept across every inch of the Great Hall.</p>
      <p>He looked at everyone, not leaving even Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>
        Looking from his position, there were many Young Supremes who were
        talking and drinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, his gaze fell into the area where many masters of Daoist Sects and
        Immortal Clans were located.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to this kind of routine, the most normal thing was to suddenly
        take away a figure of a powerful Cultivation Base.
      </p>
      <p>For example, someone like the Emperor or Heavenly Deity…</p>
      <p>
        But soon, Gu Changge's brows couldn't help but frown. Things didn't seem
        to be what he thought and they didn't suddenly take over someone in the
        Great Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding this routine of mortals seizing the strong, it was most
        unreasonable. If there was no system for a mere mortal, how could they
        seize the strong?
      </p>
      <p>‘It seems that the person in question is not here.’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge still intended to use the old method to identify this new
        Favoured Son of Heaven based on his Fortune Value.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system suddenly prompted that the new Favoured Son of Heaven was not
        far away from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        So as long as he paid attention to the Fortune Values, he could easily
        identify them.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘According to the things till now, whether it is a Favoured Son or
        Daughter of Heaven…’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘They are also related to me in some way or are on the opposite side of
        me. Now, this Favoured Son of Heaven… what conflict does it have with
        me?’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was suddenly interested.</p>
      <p>
        If this mortal's Fortune Value was enough to satisfy him, then he could
        take this opportunity to implement his plan.
      </p>
      <p>Finding a new scapegoat? Wasn’t it already here?</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“At this time, outside the Main Hall, suddenly a clan member came
          running quickly to Gu Changge's side and whispered, “Young Master,
          Holy Maiden Yin Mei of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family is
          here.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        It was already halfway through the banquet, Yin Mei was too embarrassed
        so she had to bother them to only say tell this to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Yin Mei?”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge hasn't said anything yet.</p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, Yue Mingkong who was next to him heard it at once and
        looked up outside the Main Hall. There was a shocking chill in her
        phoenix eyes.
      </p>
      <p>A dangerous aura emerged around her.</p>
      <p>‘This Fox Spirit! She dared to come even after my warning?!’</p>
      <p>Many Young Supremes looked over at this time, being curious.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge seemed to be taken aback when he heard the words, a little
        surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he reacted casually, with a gentle and natural smile on his face,
        and spoke.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Let Junior Sister come in.”</b></p>
      <p>
        He was already thinking about who the new Favoured Son of Heaven would
        be just now, so he wasn't surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he was even more sure that this new leek was inseparable
        from Yin Mei.
      </p>
      <p>In this way, they also indirectly became related to him.</p>
      <p>‘This Favoured Son of Heaven…is someone around Yin Mei?’</p>
      <p>Gu Changge had an intrigued look on his face.</p>
      <p>And soon, under the leadership of this Gu family member.</p>
      <p>
        A woman in a red dress came from outside the Main Hall, her face was
        captivating and enchanting.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was very beautiful, this kind of beauty was different from before.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed to be able to even charm sentient beings.</p>
      <p>
        Her face was glittering white like jade with a faint smile, nine
        snow-white fluffy fox tails behind her were held in the arms of several
        maids.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, a group of powerful Nine-Tailed Celestial Foxes and the
        older generation, carrying gifts, came to the Main Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        A little white servant named Chu Fan was also following behind, lowering
        his head.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        Many big people who were talking about Yin Mei and stealing glances
        quickly withdrew their gazes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It's her! The Holy Maiden of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family.
          Young Master Changge saved her life from the hands of the Forbidden
          Demonic Arts’ Inheritor.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The Young Master of the White Tiger Clan, who was murdered by the
          Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritor seemed to be her fiancé, but the
          marriage contract has been cancelled.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Many Young Supremes, who recognized Yin Mei, were not surprised.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge was her Senior Brother and even saved her life.</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei coming to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family for Mother Gu’s banquet
        was quite normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, many powerful people from the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family
        gave a congratulatory gift and began to take their seats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it was late after all, she did not miss the birthday banquet
        after all.
      </p>
      <p>And Yin Mei walked up to Gu Changge and smiled slightly.</p>
      <p><b>“Yin Mei greets Brother Changge.”</b></p>
      <p>
        As for the indifferent and deep Yue Mingkong next to Gu Changge, she
        didn't seem to have seen her, regardless of her terrifying aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of everyone, Yin Mei naturally went straight to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>It's just that Yin Mei was a little surprised.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's gaze was strange and inexplicable.</p>
      <p>
        It seemed that from the moment she entered the Main Hall, he was looking
        not at her but at the little boy behind her.

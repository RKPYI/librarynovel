          There was never a time she wouldn&#8217;t be emotionally stirred when
          she was with Gu Changge, and like this day, she would be bullied to

          safety and harmony of the world?&#8221; Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t help
          shaking his head in righteousness, then sighed, &#8220;Besides, how
          can I relax after knowing a dumb girl like you still wants to head
          over there despite knowing full well how dangerous it is?&#8221;</span

          soon, he needed a reason to head over. His identity as the Mortal One
          now became the perfect excuse, or many forces would draw the
          connection to him if anything happened to him when he rushed towards
          the Demon-Burying Abyss at this time. However, with him being the
          Mortal One as the reason, the nature of things would become

          being stumped for a split-second, believing the only thing true in
          that entire bull was the latter part. After all, there was no way
          someone like him would care about the well-being of others, much less
          the world.</span

          him.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Right then, she felt all warm and fuzzy. Although Gu Changge said he
          wouldn&#8217;t give a damn about her, he would still show up every
          time she was in deep trouble, and it hadn&#8217;t happened only once
          or twice.</span

          >&#8220;No need for that. You do you. I won&#8217;t stop you, much
          less blame you for anything. If you&#8217;re asked not to save a dying
          man, given your nature, you&#8217;d probably feel bad even if you
          agreed to ignore the man.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To her surprise, Gu Changge sympathised with her instead of
          chastising or ridiculing her, and it led her to gaze stupefyingly at
          him until he looked at her. She drooped her eyelids and hummed a
          response softly.</span

          a heads-up. I actually won&#8217;t turn you down,&#8221; said Jiang
          Chuchu as she looked up at him again, seemingly having mustered up all
          her courage.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          that.</span

          >&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Jiang Chuchu replied with a
          quivering voice while quickly turning her head away, unable to stand
          his gaze anymore. [You bastard! How can you still knowingly ask when
          it took me everything to say that out loud?!]</span

          isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Gu Changge teased, causing Jiang Chuchu to
          blush again. She had a feeling Gu Changge would chuck her into his
          Inner World again. After all, she said it herself—she wouldn&#8217;t
          turn him down. Thus, she hurriedly stood up and ran away, and the way
          her dress fluttered along her movements looked exceptionally
          alluring.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          disappear from the main hall.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very quickly, news of Gu Changge being at the Mortal Palace spread,
          shocking many in Mortal Palace, who all later went to meet him. After
          all, he was the Mortal One. As for whether the fact stood true or not,
          it didn&#8217;t matter. What was important was that he could sort out
          their current dilemma.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many guessed that Jiang Chuchu played a major part in Gu
          Changge&#8217;s visit to Mortal Palace, and she acquiesced to their
          guess as she couldn&#8217;t really explain anything.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Mortal One.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          deferential Mortal Palace cultivators. However, it was what it was
          now.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just as Gu Changge had said, what the Mortal Palace needed
          wasn&#8217;t the person himself but a figure. Anybody could be the
          Mortal One as long as they could properly hold the position. As for
          where the true Mortal One was, it was no longer an issue those in
          Mortal Palace would concern themselves with after it was declared.

          wanting to kneel and worship. Everyone felt as though they were

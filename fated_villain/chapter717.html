        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Eternal Overcast collapsed, the sky broke into large pieces like a fragmented mirror. Countless streams of fire soon rained down from beyond the sky, and a dense and overwhelming grey mist engulfed everything. </span><span id="more-36180"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a devastating scene as the earth cracked and terrifying fissures stretched for thousands of kilometres. Seeing this, all the Eternal Overcast Beings howled and fled, desperate to escape this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disregarding their life and death, the Five Great Ancestors were locked in a fierce battle with the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being. Since they had destroyed the ancient wells, they had no hope of being revived once killed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place seemed to have returned to the dawn of creation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aftereffect was so horrifyingly turbulent that the Chaos Qi soared to the heavens, spreading in every direction of the world. The Five Great Ancestors did everything in their power to hold back the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being and make him pay a heavy price.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was too strong. The ancient array he took out shone with dazzling radiance as they evolved into countless stars and constellations, trapping the Five Great Ancestors within. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flames surrounded by Chaos Qi, rolled in to burn them from all directions. Soon, countless large stars materialised, refined into innumerable beams of Sword Qi that slashed them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a lethal move that the Five Great Ancestors could neither resist nor evade. If the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was in his peak state, he could have easily slain Immortals after he used his ancient array. Although the Five Great Ancestors possessed immense Spiritual Energy that far exceeded their current realm, there was still a significant gap between them and True Immortals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arrays turned into countless bursts of Sword Qi, wiping out the Five Great Ancestors, who then let out unwilling roars when their entire body was set ablaze. They were ready to fight back in any way they could. Yet, it was not enough. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed as if countless stars were simultaneously exploding. The energy from the explosions raged and surged, engulfing everything, wiping them out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the aura within the ancient array gradually subsided and went silent. The Eternal Overcast Beings could no longer sense the presence of the Great Ancestors. The Great Ancestors, who they thought were immortal and undying, had all fallen today before their homeland after being completely eradicated by the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why did you all have to go this far, my Fellow Daoists? Why choose death rather than living on, even if it will just cost you the wells?&#8221; The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s face had a faint hint of compassion as he gently shook his head and kept the ancient array. The moment he took out the array, the Five Great Ancestors were already fated to perish and become one with the way of the universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining Eternal Overcast Beings watched this scene in horror, and they began to tremble uncontrollably. Not only did Eternal Overcast collapse, but the Great Ancestors had fallen, and even the ancient wells had blown up. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Doesn&#8217;t this mean that the Eternal Overcast will cease to exist in this world from now on?] Everyone immediately sported a look of grief and sorrow at this thought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had no time to spare for them. His figure proceeded to move and head towards the deepest part of the homeland. He wanted to know how many fragments had Gu Changge collected. According to his divine sense, the aura of the three ancient wells had completely vanished. In other words, those three ancient wells had completely shattered and disappeared from this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With how dense and boundless the grey mist concealed everything, even the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being found it difficult to see what was going on inside. However, he could tell that the three ancient wells were extraordinary. He actually felt his heart thump hard against his chest when they exploded just now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being found Gu Changge in the heavy fog. He hurriedly approached the latter and asked with great interest, &#8220;How much did you manage to collect?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was currently holding a jade jar crafted from a special material. The jar sealed off the surrounding void to prevent the fragments from dispersing. Upon hearing this, Gu Changge seemed to come back to his senses and replied to the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, seemingly slightly confused. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This object is not made of ordinary materials; it is refined with a certain type of rune. It began to decay and dissipate the moment the wells shattered. Although I arrived in time, I haven&#8217;t collected much.&#8221; As he spoke, he appeared regretful and handed the jade jar to the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am aware of this,&#8221; the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being hummed without a doubt. He had long known that these three ancient wells were refined with mysterious runes instead of built from ordinary material. The reason he called Gu Changge to collect these fragments was, precisely, because of this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, who no longer held much hope, suddenly swept his gaze over the numerous specks of light from the fragments within the jade jar. A hint of joy then appeared on his face, reflecting his pleasant surprise. &#8220;But you&#8217;ve collected so much!&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had initially thought that Gu Changge had only collected some of it. However, judging from the numerous specks of light in the jade jar, Gu Changge had managed to collect fragments equivalent to one-third of an ancient well. This was truly beyond his expectations, and it definitely brought him great delight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Perhaps I could have collected even more if I had arrived earlier,&#8221; Gu Changge lamented regretfully and shook his head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being only smiled and reassured him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. This is already unexpected good news. As long as I can gain insight into its mysteries, whether there&#8217;s more or less doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he said that, he suddenly felt a little satisfied with this disciple of his, who came from a mysterious background, had terrifying power, and possessed formidable skills. Although Gu Changge appeared somewhat devious and self-righteous, it suited the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s preferences. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had always disliked those who were narrow-minded and foolish. For Gu Changge to disrupt his original plans, kill his intended Successor, and seize his legacy, it could only mean that Gu Changge possessed extraordinary qualities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In that case, I congratulate you on further advancing in your Dao cultivation, Master,&#8221; Gu Changge replied with a faint smile while cupping his hands in a gesture of respect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is all thanks to you today. Anyway, I&#8217;m not someone who doesn&#8217;t give out a reward or punishment when I have to. I&#8217;ll bestow this remnant array onto you. Don&#8217;t underestimate it. It is something I stumbled upon in the cave of an Immortal King. If your cultivation is sufficient, you can activate it to fight back against a True Immortal. In fact, this array alone is more than enough.&#8221; The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being offered cheerfully. As his sleeve shook, he took out a remnant array, sealed with a jade talisman to give it to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Celestial Ancient Times when the Great Dao had not yet collapsed and the World Principles hadn&#8217;t broken apart, this remnant array could even trigger a bloody storm. It was something that numerous True Immortals fought over. However, the Immortal Path was blocked, and the World Principles were incomplete in the present day. Not even the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being knew the remnant array&#8217;s true power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing this, Gu Changge had a hint of curiosity flash in his eyes. He accepted the remnant array and expressed his gratitude. &#8220;I thank you for this precious gift, Master.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, out of caution, he scanned it with his divine sense and only accepted it when he found nothing unusual about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being seemed to possess quite a number of treasures. When he dealt with the Six Great Ancestors, he also took out a big seal to defend against numerous attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes, that item was undoubtedly an Innate Artifact which defensive power was not inferior to the Supreme Dao Diagram he possessed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to that, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s ancient array used to subdue and annihilate the Five Great Ancestors was also extremely remarkable. It encompassed the evolution of the myriad stars of heaven and possessed almost immeasurable power. In fact, this array bore a striking resemblance to the Immortal Annihilating Formation that Gu Changge had heard about from Yan Luo while he was exterminating Neraka.</span></p>

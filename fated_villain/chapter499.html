          to never cower in the face of battle were to no avail, since these
          fleeing people belonged to their own clans, and weren&#8217;t under
          the supreme experts&#8217; control. Instead, the opposite effect
          occurred where the number of fleeing cultivators increased. They all
          left the city behind as if the Upper Realm wouldn&#8217;t attack as
          long as they were gone.

          several clans remained, including the four War God Clans. They were
          like the backbone of the entire Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains,

          the city, each one possessing ancient auras. They all glowed brightly
          with strength. One of them had spoken, looking wizened yet possessing
          a bright and determined gaze like that of the sun. His energy was such
          that it was hard to look at him directly.</span

          extremely sombre as they listened. The feeling of reverence rose
          inside them. Compared to the abandonment of the city by the other
          clans, the behaviour of the four War God Clans was admirable and had
          moved them immensely. Even now, these four clans hadn&#8217;t given up
          on the city and its people. Their actions truly befitted their

          doing this and surrendering to the Upper Realm? Just for false glory
          and honour?] In the crowd below, a determined-looking figure looked
          stunned. It was Lin Wu, who looked extremely conflicted as he clenched
          his fists. He hadn&#8217;t been part of the retreating group and now
          felt lost after hearing the figure speak.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >That figure was a True Daoist who held great authority in his clan.
          Lin Wu had heard his clan discuss how they were going to survive this
          disaster unharmed a few days before; they weren&#8217;t thinking of
          uniting the people to fight the Upper Realm. Rather, it was how they
          were going to escape unscathed without risking the clan&#8217;s
          reputation. Everything that had transpired had been led on by them,
          plus the news of the clans abandoning the city had been spread by them
          as well.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          understood why the forces of the Upper Realm looked down on the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains. The relations between every clan had
          become so rotten that they could be easily torn apart by rumours
          without any intervention from the Upper Realm.</span

          when it has become this rotten?] Lin Wu laughed bitterly then became
          determined, his mind now clear after recalling everything he had done
          to survive and save Lu Luo.</span

          acquire one, I&#8217;m going to leave this city to see Gu Changge. He
          may not break his promise at such a moment, since he does not need to
          anymore] Lin Wu looked towards the depths of the city with hope
          shining in his eyes. He no longer held any hope for Sky Deer City or
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span

          were merely watching something entertaining. The experts from the
          various forces had already noticed the army and experts leaving the
          city, which intrigued them since the other side had already begun
          abandoning the city even before they could invade.

          Domains? They are descendants of exiles and have sin flowing through
          their veins.&#8221; An ancient being as tall as a tower sneered as he
          stood on the horizon. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we need to attack
          them any longer since the city will fall apart on its
          own.&#8221;</span

          he had guessed that people would flee the city by some point, he
          didn&#8217;t anticipate that the other side would be so panicked and
          start running away. However, that would make invading the city much
          easier.</span

          >&#8220;What do you think of this?&#8221; He turned to the Sky Deer
          Goddess and raised his eyebrows. She had been silent in the past few
          days, not saying anything even after witnessing everything unfold in
          Sky Deer City.</span

          has nothing to do with the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.&#8221;
          Her bright gaze landed on his face as she shook her head. She
          wasn&#8217;t sure how she felt right now about the many clans since
          she hadn&#8217;t known many of them. They had been united against the
          Upper Realm but had ultimately abandoned the city. Nevertheless, this
          scene still disappointed her, making her sigh.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She didn&#8217;t blame them, since the fate of the city didn&#8217;t
          matter to them. They still had somewhere to go after escaping as they
          could just move the entire clan to a new place, but the inhabitants of
          Sky Deer City could not do that. When the city gets breached, those
          inside would die. Conversely, the city would be breached if everyone
          fled.

          only fight against several Upper Realm beings who were at the same
          cultivation level. Once the city was conquered and the clans of the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains left, she would be in an awkward
          position. Either she was going to stand with the city and die with it,
          or she was going to abandon the city as well. However, judging by her
          personality, she would choose the former.</span

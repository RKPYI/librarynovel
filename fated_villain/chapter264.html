      <p>
        Thinking like this, Gu Changge sat down and communicated with the system
        at the same time, intending to make a refining attempt with Destiny
        Point.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        At this time, black light began to emerge on the top of his head and
        strands of black light hung down.
      </p>
      <p>
        One after another, the runes of Dao were intertwined and then fell
        towards the black substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dao treasure bottle began to rise and fall, like a black hole that
        was terrifying to the extreme, and then swallowed it down.
      </p>
      <p>It's initiative was far better than ever.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge underestimated its desire for this black substance, even when
        it devoured the Reincarnation Seal of Human Ancestor, it didn't feel
        that way.
      </p>
      <p>"It seems that there is no need to use Destiny points."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge sat quietly cross-legged in the empty space, a jade-like
        black light began to appear on his face, and there was a sense of
        solemnity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ancient world’s sacrificial sound seemed to be echoing here in the
        dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him, the demonic energy was overwhelming, and there was an
        unparalleled demon lord, whose eyes were indifferent and ruthless,
        intimidating the heavens and the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, in Gu Changge's mind, something cracked like a click and
        began to break.
      </p>
      <p>Some of the deepest memories came to his mind.</p>
      <p>
        In front of the top of the mountain, the clouds and mist were rolling,
        and a very simple hut was located on the side.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the bluestone, the little girl in red was dancing with a sword, her
        sleeves were rolled up, and the sword light was like silver, splashing
        across the sky and the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of the hut, he stood with his hands behind his back, his red
        coat fluttering, and his silver hair flying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything in this world seemed to be changing rapidly because of the
        sword in her hand.
      </p>
      <p>After she finished dancing.</p>
      <p>The little girl in red ran happily in front of her,</p>
      <p>
        "Master, today I met the disciples of Jiutian Peak. They robbed me of
        things, and they said that my talent was mediocre, and at most I will
        only reach the realm of true god in this life."
      </p>
      <p>"But they were all defeated by me, one by one."</p>

            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "Who told you to defeat them?" His expression was calm, and his voice
        did not fluctuate much.
      </p>
      <p>
        The little girl in red smiled stiffly and lowered her head, "I was
        wrong, Master."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The sword that I taught you is not for you to defeat the enemy." His
        voice remained unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The little girl in red went down the mountain and came back with scars
        all over her body and a bunch of heads in her hands.
      </p>
      <p>"Master, I'm back."</p>
      <p>Although injured, she was still happy.</p>
      <p>
        "This is your favorite roast chicken." He patted her head, "Jiutian
        Peak, together with Jiutian Continent, will no longer exist from today
        onwards."
      </p>
      <p>"No one can bully my apprentice."</p>
      <p>"Master, I made a friend at the foot of the mountain this time."</p>
      <p>"Oh? Male or female?"</p>
      <p>"Woman, but she's not human."</p>
      <p>"Then what is she?"</p>
      <p>"She is a little peach tree."</p>
      <p>
        He smiled to himself, "Then the teacher will dig her out to accompany
        you."
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, on the top of the mountain, there was another slender and clean
        little peach tree.
      </p>
      <p>Then his memories came to an abrupt end.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge was lost in thought.</p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>In a blink of an eye, several days passed in the outside world.</p>
      <p>
        "The Heavenly Extinction creatures and Heavenly Extinction aura are
        greatly reduced. Is it possible that Gu Changge really has a way to stop
        this?"
      </p>
      <p>Wang Ziji looked at the abyss in the sky in surprise.</p>
      <p>
        In her perception, the monstrous gray fog in the abyss had become much
        thinner as compared to the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>What did this mean?</p>
      <p>It meant that Gu Changge was really certain to go there.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge actually solved the Heavenly Extinction aura that was
        extremely difficult for all ancient existences. It was simply a fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since time immemorial, only Human Ancestor has a way to solve the
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction…"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, shouldn't he be the reincarnation of Human Ancestor,
        right?"
      </p>
      <p>Wang Ziji was a little puzzled.</p>
      <p>
        She looked at Jiang Chuchu next to her, but there was not the slightest
        abnormality on Jiang Chuchu's face.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was calm and composed, in addition to stillness, one could not see
        other emotions.
      </p>
      <p>In the past few days, Jiang Chuchu's injury had almost recovered.</p>
      <p>
        In addition to her initial concerns, she noticed that Heavenly
        Extinction aura was decreasing, and she understood that Gu Changge was
        not a big problem.
      </p>
      <p>So she just relaxed.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, for all sentient beings, Gu Changge was able to solve the
        extremely difficult aura of Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for knowing that Human Ancestor had been assassinated by Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even she would suspect that Gu Changge was the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        At this time, Jiang Chuchu suddenly remembered what Gu Changge once
        said, that what the Human Ancestor Hall lacked was not the Human
        Ancestor himself, but the identity of the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Human Ancestor was dead, no matter what, if the Human Ancestor
        Hall wanted to continue to stand, it must find the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, did she really have to find someone to pretend to be the
        human ancestor?
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu had never thought about this, after all, doing so would
        mean betraying her teacher sect.
      </p>
      <p>But at this time, she couldn't stop thinking about it.</p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Chuchu, tell me honestly, what happened between you and Gu
        Changge?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Wang Ziji suddenly opened her mouth and asked what she was
        most concerned about these days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu had regained her composure at this time, and naturally, it
        was impossible for her to tell Wang Ziji all this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tell her that, in fact, Gu Changge was the inheritor of demonic arts,
        and the current Prince Ying was actually just a hapless bastard who was
        taking the blame for him?
      </p>
      <p>
        Then tell her, that Gu Changge had imprisoned him for a long time? In
        the past, that person, the descendant of the human ancestor hall, was
        just a fake?
      </p>
      <p>
        Although these were facts, she would definitely not believe it in terms
        of Wang Ziji's temperament.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, she would think that why didn't Gu Changge kill herself who
        knew these secrets?
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Jiang Chuchu just said calmly, "You don't need to worry about
        this, Gu Changge is not a good person, you have to stay away from him."
      </p>
      <p>"That's it?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Wang Ziji rolled her eyes, "It's a shame I treated you as
        a best friend, so I didn't even tell me this."
      </p>
      <p>"I naturally know that Gu Changge is not a good person."</p>
      <p>She felt that Jiang Chuchu was thinking carefully now.</p>
      <p>
        In the past, when she asked about men, she was always disgusted, and she
        almost had disdain on her face.
      </p>
      <p>How could it be like this?</p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge is really dangerous, you'd better not get too close to him…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu sighed softly, her calm tone contained something that only
        she herself understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Forget it if you don't want to talk about it. Originally, I had a good
        impression of Gu Changge, but since you have an inexplicable
        relationship with him, then I'll forget it now…"
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Wang Ziji also sighed, looking a little sad.</p>
      <p>Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu froze a little.</p>
      <p>
        What did it mean that she had an inexplicable relationship with Gu
        Changge?
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, Wang Ziji said that she had a crush on Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>"I don’t!"</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji noticed her expression and smiled speciously, "That's good."
      </p>
      <p>
        That was, at this moment, there was another movement from the crack,
        which had been calm for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately afterward, Gu Changge's figure walked out of it, and on the
        surface, it didn't seem to be much unusual from before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu and Wang Ziji simultaneously looked at it, and their
        expressions changed.
      </p>
      <p>"Are you okay? Brother Gu?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu wanted to ask, but she didn't want Wang Ziji to speak
        first.
      </p>
      <p>
        She glanced at Gu Changge, moved her lips, lowered her head, and
        swallowed what she was about to say.
      </p>
      <p>"I’m fine."</p>
      <p>
        "The matter of Absolute Heavenly Extinction here is temporarily
        resolved, but with my ability, I can only do this at most…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shook his head, glanced at the two of them with a slightly
        strange expression, and said nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had indeed refined the source of Absolute Heavenly Extinction here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only could he control the power of Absolute Heavenly Extinction, but
        even his Dao treasure bottle had undergone a mysterious change.Ch𝒆êck

      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge didn't intend to make people pay attention to these
        things so quickly, so he didn't completely solve the remaining Heavenly
        Extinction aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        After having the experience here, finding a new source of Absolute
        Heavenly Extinction and refining it would definitely be faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother Gu, I sometimes suspect that you are the reincarnation of Human
        Ancestor, and you have done what no one else can do."
      </p>
      <p>Wang Ziji said half-jokingly, with a smile in her bright eyes.</p>
      <p>
        "What kind of reincarnation of Human Ancestor? I believe that the
        reincarnation of Human Ancestor is not an existence that a little
        cultivator like me can presume."
      </p>
      <p>"As for this Absolute Heavenly Extinction, I just got lucky…"</p>
      <p>
        "In the future, it is estimated that I will not have such good luck."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge sighed slightly, but at this time, he didn't seem to be
        hiding anything.
      </p>
      <p>With a screeching sound, his sleeves were torn open.</p>
      <p>
        Then, from the position where his arm was, wisps of gray mist began to
        permeate, including bones and skin, showing a state of corrosion, which
        looked extremely terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>It was shocking!</p>
      <p>
        Of course, this injury must have been intentional and was not caused by
        it.
      </p>
      <p>"This……"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Wang Ziji's expression couldn't help but change, and she
        was frightened by the shocking injury, "Brother Gu, are you corrupted by
        the aura of Heavenly Extinction?"
      </p>
      <p>"Let me see."</p>
      <p>
        As she said that, she didn't care about the difference between men and
        women, and she was not afraid of the corrosion of the Heavenly
        Extinction aura, so she grabbed Gu Changge's arm and wanted to
        investigate the injury.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's expression changed slightly at this time, and she was a
        little worried.
      </p>
      <p>But she could only stay out of it, like an outsider.</p>
      <p>It was clear that Gu Changge's injuries were caused by her.</p>
      <p>This made her feel a little guilty and uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>
        And Gu Changge didn't even look at her, as he said before, she seemed to
        be an eyesore.

      <p>
        "Brother Gu's injury, it should be injured by some creature, right? The
        general Heavenly Extinction aura will not be mixed with the laws of the
        sacred realm…"
      </p>
      <p>Wang Ziji frowned after checking the injury.</p>
      <p>
        As she spoke, in her palm, a dazzling immortal light emerged, containing
        amazing vitality.
      </p>
      <p>Chi……</p>
      <p>
        This immortal light was slightly triggered by the aura of Heavenly
        Extinction and made a screeching sound, almost like water was poured on
        boiling oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge couldn't help frowning, but he remained silent, seemingly
        trying to endure.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This injury was indeed caused by my careless at the time and was caused
        by a sneak attack by a Sacred realm creature, but I didn't expect it to
        be so difficult to expel…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, his face became a bit paler, but his expression was
        still calm.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge…"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing his appearance, at this time, Jiang Chuchu felt a little
        uncomfortable and wanted to say something.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after calling out Gu Changge's name, she didn't know what to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that she hadn't spoken to Gu Changge properly other than
        calling him a despicable, shameless bastard.
      </p>
      <p>"Holy Maiden Chuchu, is something wrong?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge glanced at her and asked casually, without
        mentioning anything about the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu felt the coldness in his tone, and grievances rose in her
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>But on the surface, she still showed calmness.</p>
      <p>"Thank you for your help earlier."</p>
      <p>"Since you're fine, then I'll go first."</p>
      <p>
        "I'm fine, so I won't bother the holy maiden. If you have time, you
        should be concerned about the safety of the world."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Otherwise, more creatures will suffer the poisonous hands of the
        inheritor of demonic arts."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's tone revealed disapproval.</p>
      <p>Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu's face turned pale.</p>
      <p>However, she didn't say much.</p>
      <p>
        Then, she glanced at Wang Ziji, turned into divine light, and left this
        place first.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Gu seems to be in conflict with Chuchu?"</p>
      <p>Seeing this, Wang Ziji couldn't help asking with interest.</p>
      <p>
        "It's just that I can't get used to her splendid and upright look, and
        she looks at the world more than anything else…"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge shook his head and said casually.</p>
      <p>Afterward, the two of them also left the place and did not stay.</p>
      <p>
        In this Heavenly Extinction battlefield, the sudden decrease in the
        Heavenly Extinction energy and the number of Heavenly Extinction
        creatures had attracted the attention of many cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the deep place was like a forbidden area for everyone, no one dared
        to explore at will, so not many people paid too much attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither Wang Ziji nor Jiang Chuchu liked to make things known to
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was even more eager for this kind of thing to be low-key. At
        present, Absolute Heavenly Extinction had not really entered the eyes of
        some old monsters. If they knew that he had a way to solve the Heavenly
        Extinction aura.
      </p>
      <p>That would surely come to him.</p>
      <p>
        This was a major event that concerned the entire Upper Realm. Even if he
        was the young master of the Ancient Immortal Gu family, he would have to
        be arrested at this time, and he would have to go deep into the Absolute
        Heavenly Extinction with them.

          });
        </script>

      <p>
        Gu Changge naturally didn't want to encounter such a thing, it was
        troublesome after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, after parting with Wang Ziji, he returned to his temporary
        residence in Southern Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt the strangeness of the power of Heavenly Extinction
        aura. He compared it inside his inner universe and found that this power
        had a particularly strong ability to swallow and cover space.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, many formations were like paper paste in front of it
        which could be corroded casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, although he had only refined a piece of Absolute Heavenly
        Extinction Origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the power of this source of Absolute Heavenly Extinction was enough
        to cover the territory of 100,000 miles!
      </p>
      <p>
        That was to say, Gu Changge had now controlled the Absolute Heavenly
        Extinction in the range of 100,000 miles.
      </p>
      <p>The size of 100,000 miles was enough to cover some smaller realms.</p>
      <p>
        And during this time, Gu Changge also got the news from Yan Ji, about
        the things he asked her to inquire about became obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sure enough, you weren't in the Divine Sect of the absolute beginning?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge whispered to himself, somewhat understanding.</p>
      <p>
        He asked Yan Ji to go to the Divine Sect of the absolute beginning to
        ask about Su Qingge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of them were from the lower realm, so Yan Ji would not be
        unfamiliar with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result was that Su Qingge had already left the Divine Sect of
        Absolute Beginning some time ago.
      </p>
      <p>About Su Qingge's two souls.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, Gu Changge had always been paying attention to it, because Su
        Qingge's luck point was not fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to her own confession, every once in a while, some memories of
        the Upper Realm would appear in her mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge noticed at the time that when Su Qingge's memory woke up, her
        luck point would rise.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a great connection between the two. Regarding Su Qingge's
        other soul, he had also investigated and even asked his mother to check
        it out.
      </p>
      <p>But nothing was found in the end.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge also let Su Qingge stay in the Divine Sect of the absolute
        beginning, and let her mother teach her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's just a guess. If I want to prove it, I have to find the trace of
        Su Qingge."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge then instructed to go back, and let his subordinates pay
        attention to the recent movements of the major battlefields in Southern
        Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Su Qingge was the inheritor of the mysterious demonic art that Ye
        Langtian's brothers and sisters called, then she would definitely come
        to Southern Heaven during this time. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new
        updates
      </p>
      <p>
        The existence of True Immortal Academy was naturally a perfect breeding
        ground for the true inheritors of demonic arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that Southern Heaven was in chaos now, and Prince Ying
        was wearing the blame of the inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>For her, this was the perfect time to fish in troubled waters.</p>
      <p>
        With Gu Changge's current power, it was too easy to find someone who
        hadn't hidden deliberately.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If it's really Su Qingge, then she’ll have to thank me. At least so
        far, the only people who know that there is a second inheritor of
        demonic arts are Ye Langtian and Ye Liuli."
      </p>
      <p>"But speaking of it, will she covet my origin?"</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Gu Changge's expression became a little intriguing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she was in the lower realm, Su Qingge showed extraordinary
        intelligence and reason. At first, she surrendered to Gu Changge out of
        fear of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>But after a long time, if she changed her mind, then who knows?</p>
      <p>
        It's not that Gu Changge didn't believe in Su Qingge, it's just that he
        didn't believe in her other soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no other soul, he did not believe that Su Qingge could
        inherit the forbidden demonic arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, several days passed, and Gu Changge also got news about Su Qingge.
      </p>
      <p>As he expected.</p>
      <p>She did come to Southern Heaven.</p>

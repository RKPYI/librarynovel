        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is there anything special about that place?&#8221; Gu Changge stood in the compound with his hands behind his back, hair as shiny as black jade. It shimmered with faint light, making him look otherworldly as if he might float up and turn into a celestial being at any time.</span><span id="more-33879"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stared at the two Forbidden Areas deep inside the Shu Sect while he directed the question towards a Shu Sect disciple, who had brought him spiritual fruits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, that is where our Sword Pavilion and Sword-Forging Pool are located. Usually, only the Elders and core disciples can go in and out as they pleased. If the other disciples dared to set foot there, they would be stripped of their cultivation and kicked out of the Sect,&#8221; explained the female disciple from the sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sword Pavilion had records of countless Sword Techniques, while the Sword-Forging Pool contained many Divine Swords. Their characteristics complemented each other and thus contributed to the dominance of the Shu Sect in the Profound Sword World. However, they were usually both sealed off and did not allow trespassers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see.&#8221; Gu Changge looked thoughtful before he remembered something. [Since Tuo Ba Xiao Yao used to be a Core Disciple of the Shu Sect, the mysterious technique he had used to forge the Sword of World Domination into the Primordial Foetal Sword of World Domination most likely came from the Shu Sect. If he wants to save his sister, he would have to come to the Sect once again.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge&#8217;s target was just the Sword of World Domination and he could care less about Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s life. From what he saw, the Sword of World Domination would soon dissociate from Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s body and it would be handed over to him. All he needed to do during the process was take notice of any of Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s tricks, while he paid more attention to the World Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything was progressing just as he expected. Due to the increasing brutality of the war, all Forces of the Profound Sword World had come together to fight the Otherworldly Sky Demons in the Southbarren State. Many Forces had also sent their disciples to investigate and explore in an attempt to search for signs of the World&#8217;s Will. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was good news to Gu Changge since he could use them to find the World Source as soon as World&#8217;s Will was found. However, he had the feeling that the Will of the Profound Sword World was deliberately avoiding discovery and would not appear so easily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Besides this, the Tree of Epoch is maturing soon. It&#8217;s time to release some information.] Gu Changge&#8217;s consciousness slowly sank into his Inner Universe. He could see the tall flourishing ancient tree with wisps of Chaos Fog falling from it. Stars and constellations seemed to be condensing within it. A river crossing infinite epochs could be seen flowing indistinctly below the tree, while shards of Time fluttered about and reflected scenes from primordial times &#8211; such as the birth of thunder and lightning, the decay of Chaos, the world falling apart, the collapse of the universe, and many more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tree of Epoch had been nearly withering to death, but now it had vibrant signs of life. The ripening Epoch Dao Fruit was like a magnificent and dreamlike galaxy which hovered among the branches and seemed to hold up the billion-year-old sky. It contained fragments of Fortuity as well as pieces of broken Principles belonging to the Upper Realm from the past billions of years. If it melded together with the Upper Realm, it would cause an instant yet drastic change in the environment and return the Upper Realm to its most glorious era.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was basically impossible to become an Immortal in the Upper Realm right now since the Immortal Path couldn&#8217;t be opened. The major cause of which was the war after the Forbidden Epoch, which shattered the Principles and stole it away so the environment couldn&#8217;t mend itself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, while the Epoch Dao Fruit was about to ripen, Gu Changge could just preserve it within his Inner Universe. That way, no one could penetrate it unless he allowed it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had been planning to use the Epoch Dao Fruit to set up a trap since the average Source of a True Daoist showed little effectiveness at his current level. His targets were those beings who were trapped in the Nirvana Realm for many years and got stuck at the bottleneck. They could enter the Immortal Realm anytime when the world allowed them to. If those beings knew the Epoch Dao Fruit had ripened, they would go insane trying to find it, causing violent wars to break out. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These beings already stood at the top of the Upper Realm. They could be described as Remnant Immortals. Their every move could collapse universes, tear apart galaxies, and easily destroy worlds. A normal large world could explode with just a hint of their aura and it didn&#8217;t require the presence of their true bodies. Thus, how could one set up a trap to capture them before hunting them down? It should have been impossible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing a location for the trap was an issue for Gu Changge and after some investigation, he felt that the Profound Sword World wasn&#8217;t really suitable since the presence of the Worldâ€™s Will would be a disruptive factor. So, he temporarily abandoned the plan. There was still some time until he broke through to the Immortal Realm, where he could strategise again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days passed and the outside world was still engaged in war. Four out of the Thirteen States had fallen to the Upper Realm. The Profound Sword World&#8217;s dominance was fading and there was no chance of turning the situation around on paper. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Gu Changge had encountered someone he expected within the Shu Sect, though he still feigned surprise and smiled. &#8220;You are very punctual.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His visitor was Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, but he had come as an alien visitor and not a Shu Sect disciple. Thus, many disciples and Elders did not dare neglect and quickly led the way to Gu Changge when they knew Tuo Ba Xiao Yao wanted to visit him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the deadline which Gu Changge and Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had agreed upon, and if the latter didn&#8217;t hand over the Sword of World Domination, his sister, Tuo Ba Qing Yu, would disappear for eternity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao would never take his sister&#8217;s life lightly but fortunately, he had discovered the relevant jade scroll in the Sword Pavilion when he had infiltrated the Shu Sect earlier and found the solution to the Primordial Foetal Sword of World Domination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to know about my sister&#8217;s safety.&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s expression slightly darkened as he went straight to the point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hand over the Sword of World Domination first,&#8221; Gu Changge replied carelessly, rising from his seat. &#8220;You are in no place to negotiate with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princess Xuan Dea, Ah Qing, and several others who had received the news, all stood outside the compound uncomprehendingly. While they could recognise that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao also came from outside their world, he didn&#8217;t seem to be on the same side as Gu Changge since the hatred within his gaze was difficult to conceal despite his maintaining his calm demeanour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Sword of World Domination?] The Snow Sword Immortal frowned. The term sounded familiar, as though she had heard of it before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, don&#8217;t step over the line.&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s expression remained stormy while his fists cracked from how hard he was clenching them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smiled and suddenly waved a sleeve. The void before them rippled before showing a scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the silent residence, a young woman was being guarded by many experts and couldn&#8217;t move a step. She looked extremely frustrated and angry, with fear and uncertainty deep within her eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Qing Yu?&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao immediately recognised the girl as his sister Tuo Ba Qing Yu, who had been captured by Gu Changge&#8217;s subordinates. Seeing that she was unscathed, he sighed in relief while his anxiety lessened slightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you satisfied now?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled with an unreadable look in his eyes.</span></p>

          faintly as he waved his hands, shooting out a hazy layer of green
          light that shrouded the surrounding area. The light could prevent any
          expert&#8217;s divine sense from sweeping over and spying on their
          discussion. Other than them, there were also experts from the Three
          War God Clans in this palace, whom the Supreme Mountain Elder could
          fully trust.</span

          they knew where Luo Feng and the others were being held. By the time
          he rescued Luo Feng, he would directly tear apart Space and leave. The
          world was a vast place, and there were endless universes out there. No

          Supreme Mountain Elder looked serious as he glanced at the many
          experts in front of him and ordered.</span

          >Immediately afterwards, the Supreme Mountain Elder waved, and simple
          but mysterious runes emerged in the void and turned into a misty
          brilliance that hid everyone&#8217;s figures. He seemed especially
          cautious as he sensed the movements of the people monitoring the place
          around him.</span

          direction. Even though it was nightime, Sky Deer City was still
          brightly lit, and silhouettes could be seen coming and going in the
          palaces and pavilions.</span

          >Soft sounds of singing could be heard coming from the boats in the
          distance where bean-like night lights shone, adding liveliness to the
          night. Be it the stone-gambling stalls, teahouses, shops, or brothels,
          people could be seen almost everywhere. Except for the patrolling
          soldiers passing by in the sky from time to time, the entire Sky Deer
          City seemed peaceful, which was completely different from the
          extraordinary and heavy atmosphere in times of war.</span

          >Xiao Yang, Gu Wudi, and the others carefully concealed their auras
          and followed behind the Supreme Mountain Elder. Although the Supreme
          Mountain Elder was personally protecting them, they couldn&#8217;t
          help feeling nervous at such a crucial time. However, they did feel
          reassured and confident about their plan when no one noticed them
          despite having left the palace and traveling quite a distance on the
          streets.

          there was no flaw in his concealment technique.</span

          stone-gambling stall in front, we will reach a dilapidated house in
          the southwest. That is the suspicious place we found.&#8221; He looked
          at the brightly lit stone-gambling stall in front and pointed to a
          road behind it leading to a house with a courtyard. Everyone&#8217;s
          eyes followed the direction he was looking, and all they could see
          were dimmer lights. It was as though no one lived there.</span

          >&#8220;There is indeed a subtle aura fluctuation there. We need to be
          careful when we get there. Gu Changge is a cunning man. He might have
          some traps laid there for us,&#8221; the Supreme Mountain Elder
          reminded them with a nod, his face glum.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A pale golden light emerged in his initial pitch-black eyes then. The
          aura and Principles of the whole world began to change, and even the
          fluctuations of the Dao manifested in his mind. Such a mysterious
          technique seems to have touched upon the Source of this world.

          palaces not far away with thoughtful eyes. Ni Shang soon appeared
          behind him and respectfully reported, &#8220;Master, as you
          speculated, Supreme Mountain Elder and the others have quietly left
          the palace where they rested for the past few days… According to our
          spies&#8217; report, they should be heading southwest of
          here.&#8221;</span

          didn&#8217;t spend all this time planning it in vain after all.&#8221;

          away.</span

          think that he has everything under control, but he doesn&#8217;t know
          that this is all part of your grand plan!&#8221; A smile appeared on
          Ni Shang&#8217;s cold and beautiful face as she looked at Gu
          Changge&#8217;s back, with a glint in her eyes.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If the Bone Ancestor hadn&#8217;t mentioned it, she wouldn&#8217;t
          have known that Gu Wudi, who seemingly was on the Supreme Mountain
          Elder&#8217;s side, was a chess piece that Gu Changge had planted a
          long time ago. In other words, Gu Changge had made prior arrangements
          for Gu Wudi to be there because he had long anticipated this day to
          come. She couldn&#8217;t help but be surprised by the entire plan. She
          would never have figured out what went wrong if she were the Supreme
          Mountain Elder.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The rescue plan that the Supreme Mountain Elder thought was foolproof
          was actually already under Gu Changge&#8217;s control. Gu Changge had
          even told Gu Wudi the place where Luo Feng, Second Mountain Elder, and
          others were imprisoned. He also taught Gu Wudi how he could tell the
          Supreme Mountain Elder in a way that would lower his guard.</span

          So, we should also reel in the net.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled, and when
          he moved, invisible stairs seemed to emerge and condense in the void
          in front of him as he took a step that sent him thousands of
          kilometres away.</span

          >At the same time, there were several incomparably terrifying auras
          emerging from the darkness of Sky Deer City. Vast fluctuations flashed
          by like a raging wave that swept across and crashed into the sky,
          causing the world to tremble. Many who didn&#8217;t know what was
          happening almost fell to the floor when the pressure hit them.</span

          discussing about the truce, and have to give their answer by tomorrow,
          were alarmed. Their faces quickly fell. They almost thought it was the
          work of an expert from the Upper Realm. At this moment, inexplicable
          terrifying energy descended and covered the entire Sky Deer
          City.</span

          >On the other side, Xiao Yang and the others who carefully avoided the
          many patrolling soldiers along the way finally found the extremely
          worn house. From the outside, it looked like the owner of the house
          had abandoned the house and fled in a hurry before the outbreak of the
          war. The few items left behind made the house look extremely desolate.

          also growing in the corners of the wall, and they looked extremely
          scary at night. This place is quiet because there weren&#8217;t any
          patrolling soldiers. But it was precisely because of this that Xiao

          the White Tiger War God Clan, and the Vermilion Bird War God Clan kept

          Elder, Xiao Yang, and everyone else who came from outside the dungeon.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There were strong chains made of special materials wrapped around Luo
          Ying and the Second Mountain Elder. They could hardly move.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Luo Feng, who was on the other side, was in the same state right now.
          However, he was unconscious, and others could only detect a faint aura
          from him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang&#8217;s group was pleasantly surprised when they saw the
          people in the dungeon. Even the corners of the Supreme Mountain
          Elder&#8217;s mouth curled into a smile as he heaved a sigh of
          relief.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang took a look around. Except for a few people being held
          captive, he didn&#8217;t see anyone in charge of guarding this place.
          [It seems that Gu Changge is so confident about his arrangement that
          he didn&#8217;t bother sending any experts to guard this place.]
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This somewhat surprised him, but he thought it was likely that Gu
          Changge was in over his head, thinking that no one dared to break into
          this place to rescue the Second Mountain Elder and the rest.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang didn&#8217;t think too much about it as he stepped towards
          Luo Ying and the Second Mountain Elder, who were held in chains and
          tried to save them as runes rose from his body. &#8220;Master, Sister,
          I&#8217;m here to save you!&#8221; he reassured them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >But what made him feel a little strange was how Luo Ying and the
          Second Mountain Elder were looking at him with fear, helplessness, and
          pain written all over their faces. Luo Ying&#8217;s eyes were
          especially wide as if some great horror was hidden within them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Something&#8217;s wrong… I have a bad feeling about this.] The smile
          the Supreme Mountain Elder had on abruptly froze as he let out a
          frown. A sense of impending doom had hit him all of a sudden. At the
          same time, the sound of unhurried footsteps could be heard in the
          silent dungeon as it gradually closed in on them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >No matter how slow Xiao Yang&#8217;s group&#8217;s reaction was, they
          could sense that something was off when they heard the sound. Their
          hearts seemed to stop as their faces fell, and they took out their
          weapons almost immediately.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Their plan to rescue the Second Mountain Elder and the others
          didn&#8217;t go smoothly after all.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Who goes there!?&#8221; The Supreme Mountain Elder promptly
          turned around when he felt the cold air hitting the back of his torso.
          His angry voice possessed special power that could injure even someone
          in the Sacred Emperor Realm.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >But the moment he opened his mouth, there was a buzzing sound, and a
          bright and dazzling brilliance suddenly lit up the four walls of the
          dungeon.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Grand Runes appeared one after another like bright lights so piercing
          they brought tears to everyone&#8217;s eyes. It only took a second for
          the dark depths of the dungeon to be illuminated.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Boom!*</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >These Grand Runes contained terrifying power as they floated like a
          galaxy and evolved into a myriad of sceneries. At the same time, some
          kind of powerful Principle also emerged and rushed forward in all
          directions, leaving their marks in the void.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Standing in the middle of it all, Xiao Yang&#8217;s group could also
          hear the sound of ancient chanting. They even saw a majestic and vague
          figure that could only be described as an ancient god or demon capable
          of subduing the entire world. Such a scene caused their expressions to
          change dramatically as horror and disbelief replaced the looks on
          their faces previously.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was obvious that a trap had been planted, and they were now
          completely isolated from the outside world.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang paled, and even his voice shook when he saw the man clad in
          white striding in from outside the dungeon. &#8220;Gu Changge! How did
          you know we&#8217;re here…&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for you for a long time,&#8221; Gu
          Changge announced with a light-hearted smile. He shook his head
          without offering much explanation. And as he finished speaking, a huge
          wave suddenly came from behind him. It was like a stormy sea that
          rushed forward and tried to submerge Xiao Yang&#8217;s group.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many True Daoists had appeared, but the Bone Ancestor and a few
          others gave off the most terrifying feeling. Just by standing there,
          they seemed to be able to force Xiao Yang&#8217;s group to bend their
          knees to show their respect. This kind of aura made their faces pale
          with fright, and it was difficult to hide their fear. They
          couldn&#8217;t even stand still as they looked at the Supreme Mountain
          Elder for help.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even though the Supreme Mountain Elder was a lot calmer than the rest
          of them, he couldn&#8217;t hide the sombreness he felt.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Have you expected we would come and save them?&#8221; He
          asked, eyes fixated on Gu Changge.</span

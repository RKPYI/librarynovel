          >&#8220;Master, our aim this time is the Vermilion Bird Empire.
          We&#8217;ll head in the direction of the Vermilion Bird Empire. Much
          of its territory has been overtaken by Eternal Overcast
          creatures.&#8221; On the ancient battleship was a stunning woman in
          red. She was in the midst of reporting to Gu Changge. The faction
          behind her has strong ties with the Vermilion Bird Empire. A faction
          that was itself strong. Nonetheless, she became one of Gu
          Changge&#8217;s followers.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Vermilion Bird Empire? Then, where are all the other teams
          headed to?&#8221; Gu Changge nodded with a slight squint as he rested
          comfortably against the furniture that was made from vines that were
          over 800,000 years old.</span
        >

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the other side of him was Su Qingge, who peeled the spirit fruit
          before popping it into his mouth.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The ancient battleship was filled with the disciples from the
          Immortal Academy whose origins were shocking. Each disciple&#8217;s
          capabilities had surpassed those of the Vermilion Bird Empire.</span
        >

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

          and clouds with just their aura alone. They were Successors or Heirs
          of their respective factions.</span

      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

          >&#8220;Lady Xianer will be heading to the Azure Dragon Empire while
          Princess Yue Mingkong is moving to the White Tiger Empire and Sky King
          Zhi Yang will be in the Black Tortoise Empire…&#8221; The woman in red
          was concise with her report.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Black Tortoise Empire.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded with interest.
          The names of the empires had little to do with the Ancient Immortal
          Races when they were founded. They were just named that way for the
          sake of convenience many eons ago.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that time, he had been keeping tabs of Ying Shuang&#8217;s
          whereabouts as he suspected that Ying Shuang would look for Sky King
          Zhi Yang. After all, the enemy of one&#8217;s enemy was always a
          friend. As long as the man was intelligent enough, he would know what
          to do.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Naturally, Gu Changge expected all these to occur. [Now, Ying Shuang,
          the current Successor of Demonic Arts in the eyes of others, will be
          mingling with Sky King Zhi Yang. There is no need to rush their
          meeting. The most important part is arranging it and keeping up the
          performance. Once that is over and Purple Mansion finds out, Sky King
          Zhi Yang would definitely bring great shame to them. At that point, if
          Purple Mansion still moves to protect him…] Gu Changge continued to
          think over this. He felt that making pivotal moves was the best.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Qingge, it looks like your cultivation level has improved
          drastically.&#8221; After that, he gestured to the woman in red to
          leave and couldn&#8217;t help but comment.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The Immortal Academy is indeed a great place to cultivate.
          Such an improvement is something I wouldn&#8217;t dare to think
          about.&#8221; She gently placed her hand on his shoulder and nodded.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I see. So, how about the Seven Tools of World Domination?
          How&#8217;s the investigation going?&#8221; Gu Changge continued to
          ask, without probing more and making things too difficult for her.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;We are getting close to seeing results. If my guess is
          correct, Qing Xiaoyi and Qing Feng, the two siblings, should have a
          Tool of World Domination,&#8221; She answered.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Another one, huh?&#8221; Gu Changge raised his eyebrow
          slightly as he unearthed an ordinary-looking jar on his palm. As the
          jar floated above, the body of the jar was obviously slightly rusty
          with a simple texture. Although the Jar of World Domination in his
          hand looked strange, he felt that it contained an oppressive power
          comparable to a Sacred Emperor Grade artifact. However, if it were to
          be compared to the rumoured mystical items hidden in the Immortal
          Palace Treasury, it was not worth much.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, this answered his question. Qing Feng&#8217;s Fortuity
          had been steadily increasing, which could now be attributed to him
          having a Tool of World Domination. The Jar of World Domination that Gu
          Changge had resembled an inferior version of his Grand Flask. When he
          uses it to devour, its effects were subpar compared to the Grand Flask
          he created from runes. Thus, Gu Changge only saw worth in them after
          he had collected all seven and converted them all into something like
          a key.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I think the young man named Qing Feng has it. Qing Xiaoyi
          doesn&#8217;t look like she&#8217;s keeping it, whereas her brother
          seems to be more than meets the eye.&#8221; Gu Changge said.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge nodded upon hearing this. The Tools of World Domination had
          the ability to locate each other. That was the reason why she did not
          bother to take the initiative to search for Qing Xiaoyi and Qing Feng.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before she gave the Jar of World Domination to Gu Changge. She had
          used it as a weapon and even used it to devour Sources. Even divine
          soldiers could be devoured by using it. Thus, its power need no
          explanation.</span

          accord.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled when he saw the confusion in Su
          Qingge&#8217;s eyes, but he didn&#8217;t bother to further
          explain.</span
        >

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was a given that he would strike sooner or later, but it was not
          the right time yet. After all, Qing Xiaoyi had a soft spot for him, so
          there were some things that he did not need to intentionally
          arrange.</span

          One’s reincarnation. This is out of character for you.&#8221; When Gu
          Changge left his palace, space blurred as soon as he made a move. It
          was not long before he appeared at a nearby palace.</span

          When she heard the noise, her eyes shot open as she glared at Gu

          for being ugly. A dog will never abandon its owner when he is poor.
          One can never forget our roots. I was brought up in the Vermilion Bird
          Empire and if something as serious as this happens, I naturally have

          20s, his biological age was actually more than a hundred years old.

          looked like he was wearing something both ancient and contemporary

          middle of his eyebrows. On the other hand, the female was slightly
          younger as she looked like she was 16 or 17 with a complexion that was
          as fair as a creamy jade. She possessed both beauty and charm as she
          glowed from such lustre.</span

      <h4>
        Chapter 214-1: The person who pretended to be the descendant of the
        Human Ancestor Hall, Does not cry without seeing the coffin (1)
      </h4>
      <p>"All of you can go back."</p>
      <p>
        The smile on Gu Changge's face finally disappeared, and he waved his
        hands to let all the dancers retreat.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge…"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu frowned, not understanding Gu Changge's actions, and was
        vigilant.
      </p>
      <p>
        What she was not sure about now was Gu Changge's identity as the
        inheritor of the demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Did the Ancient Immortal Gu Family know? What is their attitude?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's been so long, so don't pretend to be stupid. It's really boring
        like this."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge spoke lightly, with a bit of mockery.</p>
      <p>Compared to just now, his expression was completely different.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu was stunned, it was difficult for her to keep
        calm.
      </p>
      <p>Listening to Gu Changge's words, was it a showdown?</p>
      <p>Her back was cold, and she suddenly felt a sense of danger.</p>
      <p>
        But before Jiang Chuchu could react, she felt Gu Changge make a move on
        her as he waved his sleeves.
      </p>
      <p>Terrible spatial fluctuations appeared!</p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, Jiang Chuchu's eyes flashed and a space crack
        suddenly appeared from her side as it expanded rapidly and shrouded her
        in an instant.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Her figure disappeared out of thin air, being dragged into the inner
        world by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space crack quickly healed and disappeared, as if it had never
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>"It's stupid for the prey to enter door on your own initiative."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge couldn't help laughing out loud, and then in the void in
        front of him, a beautiful figure emerged.
      </p>
      <p>It was Yan Ji.</p>
      <p>"How is your Aura Imitating skill?" Gu Changge looked at her.</p>
      <p>
        Within the inheritance of the Ancient Heavenly Lord of Reincarnation,
        there were many methods of disguise that could even help one cover up
        their origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu usually wore a veil in front of people, and even hid her
        true face with fog.
      </p>
      <p>It was really easy to imitate her aura and body shape.</p>
      <p>Yan Ji didn't even need to change her appearance.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, she nodded and said, "The secret method bestowed by the
        young master is really mysterious. After observing it for a short time,
        I can already imitate an aura by eighty or ninety percent."
      </p>
      <p>As she spoke, a layer of radiance appeared on her body.</p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji's figure started to change, and soon it looked no different from
        Jiang Chuchu from just now.
      </p>
      <p>Even the tone of her voice was no different.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, her own cultivation was in the Great Sacred Realm, and
        ordinary people couldn't see through it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if it was a Quasi-Supreme existence, it was impossible to see
        anything abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Gu Changge nodded with satisfaction, "In this way, the
        descendant of Human Ancestor Hall will now be your new identity in the
        future."
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        The reason why he talked so much nonsense with Jiang Chuchu was to give
        Yan Ji a chance to watch from the sidelines, so as to reach the point
        where the truth could be mixed with the fake.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But young master, can I really hide from the Human Ancestor Hall like
        this?" Yan Ji was a little puzzled, and she firmly believed in Gu
        Changge's plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if she really faced any cultivator of Human Ancestor Hall, she felt
        that she would still be exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It’s nothing, you don't need to return to the Human Ancestor Hall, just
        walk outside and let the world know. As for the rest, leave it to me."
        Gu Changge smiled calmly.
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, Yan Ji nodded.</p>
      <p>
        She was not good at acting and disguising herself. Gu Changge was a bit
        hard on her, but Jiang Chuchu's character itself was easy to imitate,
        because she had always spoken very little and had a flat personality.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as she didn't meet those familiar people from the Human Ancestor
        Hall, Yan Ji didn't think that she would reveal any flaws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, Gu Changge's figure disappeared and appeared in the inner world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji wanted to pretend as a descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall, but
        there was still one thing missing, and that was Jiang Chuchu's Ancestral
        Order.
      </p>
      <p>This was a must.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, in the inner world, Jiang Chuchu's expression was no
        longer as calm as it was at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge suddenly attacked, using his terrifying space power, then a
        space crack appeared in an instant, and engulfed her.
      </p>
      <p>Then he trapped her in this mysterious and unknown world.</p>
      <p>It all happened so fast that she didn't even have time to react.</p>
      <p>
        When the scene in front of her was clear again, she was already standing
        in a vast ancient forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking around, it was full of majestic mountains and ancient trees,
        blue lakes like diamonds, and emeralds were inlaid everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>Aura was like fog, green like a tide.</p>
      <p>
        In the distance, there seemed to be an ancient and majestic Heavenly
        Palace standing on the horizon. It looked extremely huge and sacred. The
        pillars alone could hold up heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>Like an ancient sky tower, it stood tall in the world.</p>
      <p>"What on earth is this place? How did Gu Changge get me here?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu frowned, and it was difficult for her to calm down for a
        while.
      </p>
      <p>Here, she could not perceive a single aura from the outside world.</p>
      <p>
        What was going on in the magnificent and sacred Heavenly Palace in front
        of her?
      </p>
      <p>Could it be the remains of the ancient immortal garden?</p>
      <p>Gu Changge actually had such a ruin?</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu knew that there were many small-world-like instruments in
        this world, which could be carried around, and some supreme beings could
        even develop and refine them, which was mysterious.
      </p>
      <p>One flower, one world, one grain, one cycle.</p>
      <p>She accidentally followed Gu Changge's words.</p>
      <p>
        Now Jiang Chuchu was very sure that she was trapped in such a space
        instrument by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If Gu Changge did this, it means that the Ancient Immortal Gu Family
        does not know his true identity, and he could not attack me in the Gu
        family… He is probably keeping everyone in the dark… .."
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu frowned and whispered in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, she found a place to sit cross-legged, and dazzling runes
        began to appear on her body. The brilliance was bright, simple and
        atmospheric, like a large area drizzling with ??light rain.
      </p>
      <p>
        This place seemed to have become a land of flying immortals for a while.
      </p>
      <p>Thousands of immortal lights shone like runes in the sea.</p>
      <p>
        There was even a terrifying sound of thunder, crackling, and it turned
        into a haze in it, and various shapes appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Axes and forks, swords, spears, swords, halberds, real dragons probing
        their claws, divine phoenixes shaking their wings, basalt ground
        splitting, and white tigers roaring, all kinds of visions intertwined
        and surged.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        These terrifying offensive forces, constantly deduced and evolved,
        trying to tear this space apart.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu's Quasi-Sacred Realm’s aura began to surge out.</p>
      <p>
        She knew that there was a limit to the power that this space could
        withstand, and as long as she broke that limit, this space would
        definitely shatter in response, and he wouldn't be able to trap her at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>This was obviously the same as those space barriers.</p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, when some of her attacks fell into the void,
        they were like mud cows entering the sea, unable to generate even a
        single wave.
      </p>
      <p>"How is this possible?" Jiang Chuchu couldn't believe it.</p>
      <p>
        Under her all-out attack, she already had the power of the Sacred Realm,
        and even the barriers of many lower realms would not be able to bear it
        and would be torn apart.
      </p>
      <p>But in this space instrument of Gu Changge, it had no effect?</p>
      <p>"Could it be that his spatial divine weapon is of a high level?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu tried again, but it was still fruitless, not to mention a
        trace of turbulence. She even felt that the space of the outside world
        was actually inferior to this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't believe it, am I really going to be trapped here by Gu Changge
        for the rest of my life?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu sacrificed a crystal clear mirror and was about to make a
        move.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong></p>
      <p>The void in front of her suddenly became blurred, and then cracked.</p>
      <p>
        "Don't waste your time, unless I let you out, you will die of old age
        here."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's figure walked out of it, sensing Jiang Chuchu's actions, he
        couldn't help frowning as he said lightly.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge…"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu stared at him, with infinite vigilance and fear in his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, she suffered a big loss and took the lead in taking
        action against Gu Changge!
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the barrier of this space could not be broken, as long as Gu
        Changge was killed, she would naturally be able to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, a mighty purple aura appeared behind Jiang Chuchu, and
        there was a faintly dazzling priest who shone with immortal light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Holding the whisk in hand, sweeping it forward, the world seemed to be
        split open!
      </p>
      <p>The strength of the Quasi-Sacred Realm was undoubtedly revealed!</p>
      <p>"Who gave you the confidence to attack me?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge let out a sneer and didn't care.</p>
      <p>
        He waved his sleeves, and a clear light shone down, turning into a
        surging moon wheel and crashed down.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the cultivation of the Sacred Realm was impressively
        displayed, so powerful that Jiang Chuchu's complexion changed suddenly,
        and it was difficult for her to maintain the calm just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moment Gu Changge smashed the moon wheel, the power of the whisk was
        shattered and the moon wheel remained unchanged, falling towards her!
      </p>
      <p>"You have already broken through to the Sacred Realm…"</p>
      <p>"You hid it!"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's back was full of cold air, and it was a terrifying
        movement technique to use extreme speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultivation to the extreme could travel through countless spaces in one
        step, intending to quickly avoid Gu Changge's random blow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her talent was already so powerful that it was unknowable, and she
        thought she could stabilize Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she didn't expect that the gap between the two people's cultivation
        would be so big!
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 214-2: The person who pretended to be the descendant of the
        Human Ancestral Hall, Does not cry without seeing the coffin (2)
      </h4>
      <p>At the same time, Jiang Chuchu sacrificed a Dao seal.</p>
      <p>
        There was light in the middle, there was a chanting sound of Dao, and
        the mighty purple aura covered the sky and blocked the sun, turning into
        a big seal with an extremely ancient word "Dao" on it!
      </p>
      <p>
        The laws and rules were intertwined, densely packed, this blow was
        enough to kill a normal Sacred Realm cultivator!
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, Gu Changge shook his fingers at will, and a wisp
        of sword energy rang out, wrapped in the aura of laws as it turned into
        a bronze immortal sword and fell towards Jiang Chuchu!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Dao seal she sacrificed was instantly pierced under this sword and
        turned into powder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu also spat out a mouthful of blood because of the backlash,
        and her blood tumbled for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of strength, she was not Gu Changge's opponent at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it was at the same level, she might have a chance, but Gu Changge was
        a lot stronger than her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, from the beginning to the end, Gu Changge did not use his full
        strength, just like a cat playing a mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        "At this time, don't you still understand the gap between you and me?
        Holy Maiden Chuchu?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said lightly, showing disdainful contempt, not in a hurry to
        suppress Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the inner world, unless the cultivation base was too much higher than
        Gu Changge, it was impossible to escape from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the next moment, a black and white divine light burst out from Gu
        Changge's eyes, time passed and new life shattered, the void distorted
        and turned into a sword of reincarnation!
      </p>
      <p>"Reincarnation power…" ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's expression changed slightly, and she sacrificed a sacred
        vestment, but it was soon torn apart by this black and white divine
        light, and she couldn't resist even a single wisp of its aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        She vomited blood again and flew upside down, and at the same time, Gu
        Changge reached out with a palm, covering the world, surging with great
        strength, making Jiang Chuchu's expression change rapidly.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        From between her brows, the brilliance suddenly exploded, and a
        mysterious palace appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        A strange Dao sound appeared, as if there was an unparalleled female
        immortal, sitting cross-legged in it, radiant and dazzling.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was the reincarnation of the Ancient Immortal, this statement was
        not groundless.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge also sensed a hint of danger.</p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        A mouth of the treasure bottle appeared, and the dark black brilliance
        hung down, trying to shock the gods from Jiang Chuchu's eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        That god was about to open his eyes, and there was an infinite divine
        light condensing in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Eight Desolate Demon Halberd suddenly appeared in Gu Changge’s hand.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Demonic!</strong></p>
      <p>
        His eyes were cold, and he slashed straight down, splitting the divine
        light of the god in an instant!
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene made Jiang Chuchu's face pale, and blood dripped from the
        corner of her mouth, as she apparently hurt her consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was too strong. The blow just now had obviously surpassed the
        level of the Sacred Realm, and even reached the level of a Great Sacred
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>His murder weapon was very strange.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu knew that with her own strength, she could not be Gu
        Changge's opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Calm down, let me plant a slave seal that way you might still have a
        chance to live." Gu Changge's voice was flat.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't think about it, unless I die. But if you kill me, the Human
        Ancestor Hall will surely notice, and your identity will definitely be
        exposed."

      <p>
        She opened her mouth and said, knowing this time, as long as Gu Changge
        was not stupid, he would not kill her.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the life stone she left in the Human Ancestor Hall broke, it would
        inevitably attract the Human Ancestor Hall to investigate. At that time,
        they would know that she had come to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.
        Even if Gu Changge tried to hide it, it would be difficult to do so.
      </p>
      <p>"You are smart, knowing that you still have value."</p>
      <p>"Don't worry, I won't kill you now."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge said lightly, not taking Jiang Chuchu's words seriously.</p>
      <p>"Hand over the token of your Human Ancestor Hall."</p>
      <p>"Human Ancestor Hall’s token?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu looked stunned, what did Gu Changde want this for? Did he
        want to find someone to disguise as her?
      </p>
      <p>
        It had to be said that she was very smart, and guessed Gu Changge's
        purpose so quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Impossible, the Human Ancestor token is of great importance, there is
        no way I can give it to you."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu calmed down and sat in place, and from her ring, a
        lingering small tower appeared, a layer of golden light faintly
        surfaced, and enveloped herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Although I will not kill you, I can let you know that some things are
        more hard to bear than death."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said indifferently, intending to force Jiang Chuchu.</p>
      <p>
        It was indeed not good for him to kill her at this time, and there was
        still a use in keeping her alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing he had to do was to plant a slave seal or a demon
        bottle, which would definitely touch her sea of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now Gu Changge had sensed the mysterious palace within Jiang
        Chuchu's consciousness that was considered forbidden.
      </p>
      <p>There was a vast and dangerous power hidden in it.</p>
      <p>
        Although Jiang Chuchu couldn't use it, it didn't mean it was useless to
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge rashly invaded her sea of consciousness, he might touch
        that palace, resulting in Jiang Chuchu's death.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a troublesome process and he could not kill nor plant a slave
        seal, even the treasure bottle was useless.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, once Jiang Chuchu died, it would inevitably cause a lot of
        trouble for Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Yan Ji could not continue to disguise her identity,
        affecting Gu Changge's follow-up plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge planned to retreat to the second best, the so-called warm
        water boiled frog. Letting Jiang Chuchu understand the huge gap between
        her and her own strength, removing her thought of escaping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, while being trapped in his inner world, there was nowhere she
        could go.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing she had to do was get out of this world and letting her
        out or not was just a matter of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words, Jiang Chuchu's eyes became very cold and she looked at
        Gu Changge, knowing what he meant by this.
      </p>
      <p>She didn't think that Gu Changge wouldn't try this kind of thing.</p>
      <p>
        "You have three breaths of time to think about it." Gu Changge said
        indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu herself definitely didn't want to die or submit to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But before that, as the Heavenly Maiden of the Human Ancestor Hall, she
        was bound to value her reputation and chastity over everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the first two, this was also the least likely that she would
        touch that forbidden palace within her sea of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, Gu Changge could start with this aspect and force out what he
        wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, you're too despicable!" Jiang Chuchu could hardly keep
        calm, her eyes were incomparably cold and she was gritting her teeth
        with hatred.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>Gu Changge slashed down his halberd without saying a word.</p>
      <p>
        The golden circle of light in front of her suddenly made a light
        trembling sound, followed by layers of cracks that instantly exploded.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu's face instantly turned pale.</p>
      <p>"My patience is limited." Gu Changge said indifferently.</p>

      <p>
        "I can’t give you the Human Ancestor token, you trapped me here and want
        to find someone to disguise me so as to hide it from the world, Gu
        Changge there’s no way I am going to let you do that!"
      </p>
      <p>"I won't help my enemy."</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu looked at him coldly, with a look as if she was ready to
        die.
      </p>
      <p>Even if she broke her own body and died here.</p>
      <p>
        She would not let this devil Gu Changge achieve his goal and thus wreak
        havoc in the world.
      </p>
      <p>"Stupid, you asked for this."</p>
      <p>
        At these words, Gu Changge's eyes deepened, his big palm rushed down,
        the devilish light was monstrous, and the divine talisman was concealed,
        like a huge millstone of extinction it suppressed down on Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In this instant, the entire void seemed to be suppressed by the power of
        billions of tons, turning stagnant, as if it was frozen and solidified
        there.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, I won't let you get away with this!"</p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu's face turned icy cold.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, all her power began to converge toward her Spirit Sea,
        brilliant runes appeared, rules intertwined, as she was intending to
        self-destruct her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, her only move to bring trouble to Gu Changge was suicide!
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way to get the attention of the Human Ancestor Hall was to kill
        herself, so that they could investigate and find out that something was
        wrong with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ridiculous, in my world, how can your life be controlled by yourself?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Gu Changge could not help but let out a cold laugh, looking
        contemptuous.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this kind of person who wasn't afraid of death, there were ways to
        deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu might not have understood that Gu Changge was only afraid
        of the forbidden palace within her sea of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fear of accidentally touching her sea of consciousness, triggering
        that forbidden palace to riot, thus leading to Jiang Chuchu's death.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was obvious that Jiang Chuchu's own strength was unable to bear the
        power of that forbidden palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless she could break through that palace and shatter her True Spirit,
        it was useless.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was really a case of not shedding the tears until seeing the coffin.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this palm fell, Jiang Chuchu's face directly changed, and she
        discovered that it was hard for her to condense her own power, and it
        scattered immediately!
      </p>
      <p>Even her death…… seemed to be out of her control!</p>
      <p>"I'll give you the Human Ancestor token, stop ……"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing Gu Changge seemed to be telling the truth, at this time, Jiang
        Chuchu’s expression changed greatly, she turned very pale, and could not
        be as calm as before.
      </p>
      <p>"It's too late……"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge looked cold and indifferent.</p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>Outside the palace, Gu Changge's figure walked out from the void.</p>
      <p>"Is the Human Ancestor token such a thing?"</p>
      <p>
        He surveyed the golden token in his hand, which seemed to have the aura
        of all beings converging on it.
      </p>
      <p>Then, he handed it to Yan Ji beside him.</p>
      <p>"Master, did you kill that heir of the Human Ancestor Hall?"</p>
      <p>Yan Ji was a little curious about what happened to Jiang Chuchu.</p>
      <p>"No, she can't die yet."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shook his head, "A person who doesn't see the coffin, keeping
        her is still useful."
      </p>
      <p>Inside the inner world.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu hugged her knees, her expression was cold with a bit of
        bewilderment.
      </p>
      <p>
        She looked at her right arm to see that the guardian sand, which she had
        kept for more than twenty years, had now disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The successive generations of holy maidens of the Hall of the Human
        Ancestors must all be pure.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge……" She was gritting her teeth.</p>

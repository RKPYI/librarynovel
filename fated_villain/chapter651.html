        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who ordered you to lure us here?&#8221; All the experts from the Upper Realm on the ancient battleship felt their bodies turn cold as a horrified look appeared on their faces. Their eyes when they stared at Yu Feiya were filled with murderous intent and anger.</span><span id="more-34816"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, even the most foolish among them had realised that the rescue of their Ancestors was a mere facade to lure all of them here. It was to prevent them from returning to the Upper Realm before the Space Rift closed. At this point, it was obvious everyone would be buried here with those of this world. Everything would be sacrificed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya, who had an elegant, beautiful face and a slender figure, stood on an ancient battleship. But at this moment, there was an extraordinary tranquillity about her. With her hair aflutter and a face as smooth as jade, she was a truly beautiful sight to behold. She looked into the depth of the darkness and softly smiled. &#8220;Do you people still not see who is leading all this behind the scenes even now?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, many ancient Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts were stunned for a moment before their complexions changed drastically as fear and disbelief became evident.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You mean… it is Gu Changge?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s him!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No one other than him would pull a gutsy move like this and bear such immense karmic hell and sin!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They concluded almost instantly that Yu Feiya was working for Gu Changge. Even if there was a heaven-defying person in Profound Sword World, they would not dare to plot against everyone like this. After much deliberation, they finally thought of Gu Changge &#8211; because he hadn&#8217;t appeared since the Ancient Arcane Ruins disappeared. They didn&#8217;t know whether he had returned to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one other than Gu Changge could achieve all this!</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why did he do this? Is he not afraid of the karma he would have to bear?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How dare he!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the ancient battleships, many young prodigies, who had yet to leave this world, had panicked expressions on their faces. They don&#8217;t want to die here. There was still a bright future ahead of them. They wanted to become unbeatable True Daoists who stood on the very top. But now that this world would be destroyed because of a catastrophe, they, too, would perish and turn to dust here despite having great talents.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya only shook her head lightly and looked at the group of young prodigies with pity in her eyes. [They still don&#8217;t understand that this has nothing to do with how brave Gu Changge is. They are on completely different levels from him. Gu Changge thinks of everyone as mere ants. Tools to go further ahead on his path. He might have stayed hidden when he was in the Upper Realm, but there is no reason for him to hold back now that he is in the Profound Sword World.] </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Does this mean that Gu Changge was also the person who killed the missing Ancestors?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Imperial Ancestor from the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was also killed by him! Why would you work for your enemy?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many were furious, and their words were full of fear and despair. They couldn&#8217;t understand Yu Feiya&#8217;s actions at all. Not only did she disregard the deep resentment she should have towards Gu Changge, but she even obeyed him and lured all the Forces to this place. They couldn&#8217;t make sense of what exactly was her intention.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Yu Feiya was no longer in the mood to answer everyone&#8217;s questions. She raised her beautiful face and gazed at the sky as the terrifying and vast world-destructing aura slowly descended. Even if countless bright runes rushed up from the many ancient battleships around this place, turning into a surging energy that tried to resist the pressure, it was simply futile. Everything was rapidly collapsing and disintegrating while countless runes were obliterated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frightening Great Millstone of World Destruction was a gigantic force that stretched across the sky and earth. It was entwined with billions of red rays of light as it slowly fell and crushed everything underneath. The void collapsed, and stars burned as they fell like rain, burning everything into ashes. One after another, the ancient battleships tried to escape, but they were soon swept away by the fluctuations.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was terrified and in despair as their bodies continued to crack when the bright glow of the flames washed over them, burning their bodies and souls to ashes. Even Profound Sword World was collapsing. Space was cracking inch by inch, and the earth was overturned as volcanoes erupted.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No living being could even dream about surviving this.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ancient sacrificial scriptures marking every inch of the world lit up one after another. Vaguely, there were ancient gods and demons sitting cross-legged at the ends of the world, chanting a prayer for the deaths of all living beings. Dark fog soon fell, obscuring all sources of light. The scene was simply aghast.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ignite the sacrificial scriptures, sacrifice everyone, and then refine the Source in this world. It seems that this is his ultimate goal.] Yu Feiya sighed softly while watching the ancient battleships beside her rapidly sink. The reticles cracked and shattered like eggs. This kind of power wasn&#8217;t something a mortal could stop. True Immortals might be the only ones who stood a chance to fight back.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-What is this place?&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the mighty army of the Profound Sword World, who descended in that deep and dark space, broke through all obstacles and finally came to this place. However, everyone felt a chill all over their body, and they stopped in their tracks while they unconsciously trembled from intense fear when they saw those terrifying dark cages. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking around, the dark cages seemed to be suspended in the deepest layers of hell. The place was surrounded by the energy of destruction. The black mist that surged made it impossible to see the ends of this place. Everyone couldn&#8217;t help feeling on edge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is my Senior from Kong Mountain. So she was caught and brought here… Senior, I&#8217;m here to save you!&#8221; Standing among the army was a middle-aged man in a Daoist robe who exclaimed in a shaky voice when he recognised the figure imprisoned in the cage not far away. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a Senior who was taken away by the red chains that fell from the sky a few days ago. His cultivation had entered the Earth Sword Immortal Realm for many years now, and he hadn&#8217;t been able to get out of his imprisonment. However, the figure was now as thin as a stick while he was surrounded by black flames. As he quietly moaned to himself, his eyes were filled with despair and fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that Senior, everyone gradually saw a few familiar figures in the surrounding cages. Even the Abundance Sword Immortal and the others&#8217; faces fell when they saw many old acquaintances here who weren&#8217;t in their right mind after being tortured.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place was like the legendary Nine Nethers. The despair and destruction overflowing from this place was enough to make everyone shudder.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These cages cannot be broken, and there are extremely powerful protective arrays on them&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone saw this and tried to go forward to rescue the Earth Sword Immortals who were imprisoned in the cages. But before they could get any closer or even let out a scream, they turned into ashes when bolts of silver lightning struck them from the depths of the darkness. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal and the others felt their hearts drop to their stomachs, and they hurriedly told everyone to stop. No one dared to touch the cages again after that. There was no way the ones who came from the outside world could do anything when even the Earth Sword Immortals imprisoned in the cages had no way to escape.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princess Xuan Dea found an Imperial Ancestor from her Family among the many prisoners. Seeing them in such a horrible state, she couldn&#8217;t help asking as she couldn&#8217;t bear seeing them in such a condition. &#8220;What are we supposed to do then? Are we just going to watch our trapped Seniors continue to be tortured?&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Forcibly opening it definitely won&#8217;t work. Since they were captured here by the World&#8217;s Will, there must be a way to rescue them. Our priority now is to find the World&#8217;s Will. We either destroy or seal it,&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal explained as she gently shook her head signalling Princess Xuan Dea, Ah Qing, and the others not to be hasty.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since her Master had spoken up, Princess Xuan Dea didn&#8217;t continue asking. But for some reason, she had a lingering feeling of uneasiness. Although all the power and experts of Profound Sword World were gathered here, she couldn&#8217;t get rid of that anxious feeling in her chest that there was danger lurking. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, an indifferent voice that was frighteningly powerful suddenly sounded from the depths of this deep space. &#8220;I heard that you are looking for me.&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The void immediately trembled, and a mighty bolt of silver thunder struck from the sky like a dragon capable of destroying the world swooping down. A tall and emotionless figure with thick black hair and deep eyes then emerged. Like a god respected by all, he was surrounded by a misty light as he stepped out of the silver sea of thunder, while exuding a terrifying aura that suffocated everyone here, turning them pale.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The World&#8217;s Will?&#8221; Abundance Sword Immortal had read many ancient books during this period, which was why he concluded at first glance that the figure in front of him was definitely the World&#8217;s Will they were looking for. At the very beginning, they put their hope of fighting against the Otherworldly Sky Demons on him. No one would have thought that the World&#8217;s Will was even more indifferent and frightening than the Otherworldly Sky Demons. He actually intended to destroy the world and everything on it!</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the being who tried to ruin this world that once was the birthplace of countless living beings.&#8221; The rest of the Earth Sword Immortals also turned solemn as they stared at the figure who manifested in front of them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything can be restored to its original state as long as he is wiped out or sealed away,&#8221; someone growled with deep hatred in his eyes. In fact, everyone here had hate-filled gazes. The murderous intent seeping out of them could shatter this world. They didn&#8217;t know the reason the World&#8217;s Will wanted to destroy everything, but they weren&#8217;t interested in knowing either. To them, the person in front of them wanted to destroy their homeland and those close to them. He was the culprit who put Profound Sword World in its current state.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You puny ants, it is your last honour to be sacrificed as nourishment for this world. And yet, you still resist?&#8221; The World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s true body glanced at everyone with an impassive look on his face. It was a completely different expression compared to his fearful one in front of Gu Changge. He didn&#8217;t think much of True Daoists, to begin with. The army of Earth Sword Immortals in front of him now was no different from ants to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If our Ancestors could seal you away, so can we! Don&#8217;t even think about looking down on us. Evil has never prevailed over good. Man can triumph over nature!&#8221; A veteran Earth Sword Immortal hissed. His body was glowing as his Sword Qi buzzed. There were tens of thousands of bursts of that Sword Qis shooting in World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s direction to fight him. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge!&#8221; The rest of the Earth Sword Immortals here also shouted angrily as they turned into streams of light, and attacked. A mighty murderous aura swept across this space and towards the World&#8217;s Will like the gushing waves of a vast sea.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a special power in our bodies. We can defeat the World&#8217;s Will as long as we work together.&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal was also glowing all over. The crown of his head was also shining as sharp Sword Qi came out of him. A green Dao Sword that seemed capable of destroying everything was radiating endlessly in his hand. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, a huge army of billions enveloped in terrifying rays of light charged ahead. There was a large number of runes intertwining as they exuded an extremely powerful aura. Their blood and bones were shining brightly. Their essence, Qi and Soul had been aroused in order for them to fight the World&#8217;s Will to the death.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This energy was like a torrent bursting from its embankment. Mountains and rivers were overturned, covering all corners of the world and breaking all Principles. The dark cages levitating here were also constantly trembling as if they were about to fall.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That damned Ancestral Symbol again&#8230;&#8221; Seeing this, World&#8217;s Will had a slight change to his expression. He no longer looked as nonchalant as before. In fact, he had fallen victim to the same thing a long, long time ago.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every living being from Profound Sword World had an Innate Spirit Sword in them. Innate Spirit Swords were actually transformed from an Innate Ancestral Symbol from an extremely ancient period. That Innate Ancestral Symbol was an unknown mystery to the world. Some people said that it was the gate of all wonders and the image of all living beings. Supposedly, it could evolve into everything and anything. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for unknown reasons, that Ancestral Symbol shattered one day, turning into countless fragments that flew everywhere in the world and merged into the blood of all living beings of this world. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it was the Prime Ancestor of the Ancient Arcane Empire who happened to discover this secret. Back in the past, he gathered and joined all Forces to take down the World&#8217;s Will and sealed him off.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is the point even if you can seal me off again? You will only fall into deeper despair when you find out the truth. Everything is written in the stars. There is no possibility of anything changing. Even I am nothing more than a chess piece. All that I have done ends up to benefit someone else,&#8221; World&#8217;s Will stated. A big black hand waved in the air and a terrifying giant millstone appeared behind him. The millstone then shone with brilliance as infinite profoundness emerged.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the manifestation of the Heavenly Dao Authority. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Great Millstone of World Destruction crushed ahead, all the World Principles that rushed towards it were quickly shattered. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the crowd here couldn&#8217;t quite make sense of the World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s words, they couldn&#8217;t care less about what he meant. At this very moment, the only thing keeping their hearts beating was their intention to kill him! </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal and the others were all attacking the World&#8217;s Will to the point of insanity as hatred filled their eyes. No matter what, they were determined to fight the World&#8217;s Will to the death today. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an absolutely overwhelming gap in strength. The big black hand swung downwards like a colossal wave slamming over from the deep sea. Large groups of cultivators couldn&#8217;t even muster a sound before they exploded into pieces and turned into Bloodmist. As their bodies and souls were both destroyed, they turned into majestic energy that blended into this space.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a tragic battle that lasted for a long time</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was charging at the World&#8217;s Will without fear, but they couldn&#8217;t even touch the hem of his robe. It went on until a majority of them had lost hope. They saw no chance of them surviving this. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; The eyes of the Abundance Sword Immortal and the others had already turned red from the bloodlust, and their bodies were covered in scars and blood. They roared and rushed ahead without any regard for their life. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, there was a faint resonating sound in their essence, Qi and Soul, as if there was a mountain torrent flowing and the sea crashing. Everyone&#8217;s aura seemed to be connected together as the combined force ran through the sky like a galaxy. It was a magnificent sight to behold.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ancient deity wearing clothing made of animal skin and holding an ancient stone tool precipitated and vaguely emerged at this moment. It was extremely tall as if it was standing on top of the dark clouds, wanting to fight against the World&#8217;s Will.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A manifestation of the Ancestral Symbol?] The World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s face fell when he saw this familiar figure. It was one who defeated him before.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal and the others were also stunned. They didn&#8217;t expect to be able to summon such an unrivalled figure at a time like this. The figure’s aura that seemed to engulf the world was enough to make everyone&#8217;s hearts tremble in fear. However, they didn&#8217;t have time to think too much. The figure that appeared in front of them was already clashing with the World&#8217;s Will.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just a split second, fluctuations more terrifying than before swept across and pierced through this space, allowing them to see the tragic scene in the Profound Sword World outside. Countless sacrificial scriptures everywhere were ignited, and all the living beings who lost their lives were turned into surging energy that eventually became sacrifices for this world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge stood in the deepest part of this space and gazed at all this from a distance without a change in his expression. [So, this was the power that sealed the World&#8217;s Will back then. It originally came from this. It seems that this is the key to the World Source. The so-called sacrifices are only a means to simulate it to appear.] </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his opinion, this unrivalled figure was clearly the Source that pervaded this world. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, he raised his palm and lowered it, and suddenly. there was a loud sound echoing across the world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Hum!*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eerie and thick chains that looked like mountains stretched across the air and passed through this universe. They seemed to be rooted in the deepest part of this world. Eventually, dazzling and bright runes began to appear on these chains. Clusters of World Principles turned into lights that were wrapped inside the chains as the chains absorbed energy from every part of the world. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a cloud of light dragging along above all the chains. Even though it was only the size of a fist, it had an aura as massive as a world floating around that seemed to be able to crush anything.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The World Source Prototype is still not enough, perhaps I need to…] Gu Changge looked at the misty light above the chains and shook his head lightly before he stepped out of this space. With each step he took, a deep and dark path stretched out and engulfed the dark cages on both sides. The figures who were imprisoned were swallowed up in an instant, leaving nothing behind.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vast energy was guided here to gather by the sacrificial scriptures. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the depths of space, the unrivalled figure who was fighting against the World&#8217;s Will was also affected by this dark energy at this moment. Its figure became blurry as it was difficult for it to maintain a physical form.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it&#8230;&#8221; The World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s expression turned into one of anger and indignation the moment he sensed the approaching energy. He immediately knew what Gu Changge was up to. His face was twisted in horror and rage when he stared into the dark and hissed, &#8220;You promised you won&#8217;t wipe out my consciousness if I helped you.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone from Profound Sword World, the Abundance Sword Immortal and the Snow Sword Immortal included, watched this scene in shock. They couldn&#8217;t understand what was going on when the World&#8217;s Will, out of nowhere, spoke in such a desperate and unwilling tone in the middle of his battle with the unrivalled figure. Hearing how thick with emotions his voice was made everyone shudder in fear. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I never said that I will let you off the hook. You seem to be thinking too much. What&#8217;s more, you should bear the karma you deserve. There is no value in keeping you alive now anyway.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head with a regretful look on his face as he slowly walked out from the darkness. He spoke so casually it was as if he was just explaining a simple fact. However, the message in his words made everyone feel cold all over. They were so terrified that even their souls seemed to be frozen. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, Princess Xuan Dea and the rest were completely stupefied. They couldn&#8217;t believe their eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I captured everyone and bore all the karma for you. But now that you have crossed the river, you are tearing down the bridge? You are so cruel&#8230;&#8221; Seeing that Gu Changge had no intention of letting him go, the World&#8217;s Will bitterly scoffed. He was oozing with resentment and indignation as his body constantly collapsed before turning into a shower of light that dispersed. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His life and death were initially under Gu Changge&#8217;s control, and Gu Changge only needed to will it to destroy him. Even if he held the Heavenly Dao Authority of this world, everything was useless in front of Gu Changge.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the crowd, there was a young man with a slender figure in ebony armour.
                His eyes flashed with a thought. When he saw Gu Changge, he was visibly vexed, exasperated, but he
                quickly suppressed those emotions. And as those emotions vanished, he finally regained his calm. At that
                moment, even the people closest to him could tell that he was Prince Ying Shuang. Right now, he was
                donning a new appearance, that of an unknown young prodigies.</span><span id="more-27914"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; Beside the young man in ebony armour was an
                Elder in a loose robe, whose face was glowing, possessing the resemblance of n Immortal. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elder, whom Ying Shuang referred to as Mo Lao, was a mysterious old
                being. Back when Ying Shuang was in the Eternal Overcast Battlefield, he was taken away by the three
                Sacred Lord Realm experts and abandoned in an isolated area. The Sacred Lord Realm experts then told him
                someone would be coming for him. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Ying Shuang did not believe them, knowing they were Gu
                Changge&#8217;s henchmen. To him, those words were only Gu Changge&#8217;s lies to make him continue to
                be the scapegoat that held the identity of the Successor of Demonic Arts. Nevertheless, Ying Shuang
                found himself surprised to see that someone actually came looking for him and claimed to be a fellow
                member of the Cult of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, Mo Lao, a follower of the Demon Lord, was most mysterious, possessing
                terrifying strength.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Ying Shuang’s desire to clarify that he was framed to be the
                Successor of Demonic Arts and confess that the real Successor of Demonic Arts was someone else, he was
                aware that the revelation would bring him inevitable death even though he was in possession of the
                Golden Ancient Bell, his Sacred Emperor Grade Weapon.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, Sky Emperor Mountain no longer welcomed him as he was turned into
                a widely despised public menace. Thus, as long as his tracks were discovered, countless cultivators
                would definitely storm to hunt him down. As such, he was extremely exasperated, and none could rival his
                hatred for his nemesis, Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You were tricked by Gu Changge the last time around, but things will
                be different now as you return to Immortal Academy. With us backing you up, even Gu Changge himself
                would have to learn his place.&#8221; Looking at Ying Shuang&#8217;s expression, Mo Lao subconsciously
                smiled out of realisation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, other than being a Demonic Cultist, Mo Lao also possessed another
                identity, an Elder of the Immortal Academy. And that was not known even by the other Elders of Immortal
                Academy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Ying Shuang composed himself and nodded. &#8220;I
                understand.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, he kept feeling as though Gu Changge, who was standing at
                the entrance, was constantly observing him. Nonetheless, since he dared to show up at Immortal Academy,
                he clearly was confident that no one would be able to see through his disguise.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I heard Mingkong is coming over, so I came here to wait for
                her,&#8221; Gu Changge answered the Elder in white with a smile.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see, what a lovely couple you two make, Young Master Changge.&#8221;
                The Elder in white responded with a sentimental smile, while the rest who overheard the conversation
                felt envious, especially the prodigal damsels.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, the &#8216;Mingkong&#8217; Gu Changge mentioned was
                undoubtedly his </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fiancée, the Sucessor of the Unrivalled Celestial
                Dynasty, Princess Yue Mingkong.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t have a choice. She told me to come get her. how
                could I ever say no to her?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s smile was benign and courteous as ever. Although
                he sounded somewhat helpless, his voice carried a hint of intimacy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for some reason, the surrounding young prodigies, especially the
                prodigal damsels, felt highly sour and envious as they were irritated by Gu Changge&#8217;s affection
                for Yue Mingkong. In fact, they were immensely jealous of Yue Mingkong since no other women ever
                received such treatment from Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, Gu Changge words were only perfunctory as the purpose of his
                visit to Immortal Academy, upon his detection of Ying Shuang&#8217;s aura, was to study who were on Ying
                Shuang&#8217;s side.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Gu Changge could feel that the Organisation of Demonic Arts
                wasn&#8217;t formed by an individual, but its members were gathered to worship one significant being.
                Though, the identity of the being remained a mystery to Gu Changge as the only possibility he could come
                to was the Founder of Demonic Arts. Therefore, he wished to find out the purpose of the Organisation of
                Demonic Arts as soon as possible.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Judging by the attitudes of these people of Immortal Academy, that old man
                must be an Elder of Immortal Academy, and his cultivation level is at least in the Sacred King Realm. In
                other words, Ying Shuang has a Sacred King Realm expert as his pillar.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s face
                grew fascinated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, he wondered whether he should keep Ying Shuang alive. Since
                the latter had a makeover and drew a member from the Organisation of Demonic Arts, he was basically
                useless now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, if Ying Shuang were to die, Sky Emperor Mountain might be able
                to detect it, which would be a minor setback to Gu Changge. Thus, he was contemplating how he could
                execute Ying Shuang in the open, without leaving the impression that the Successor of Demonic Arts was
                dead to the public. And it would require delicate preparations to make it seem like the Successor of
                Demonic Arts escaped death.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, he intended to have Su Qingge contact the organisation
                beforehand since she was the ‘true Successor of Demonic Arts’, which would require some more
                effort.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge was testing his attitude toward her, not confident where she stands
                in her heart. Likewise, Gu Changge could not disclose the truth to her, not because he didn&#8217;t
                trust her, but matters related to him being the Successor of Demonic Arts must not be revealed to
                others.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except for Yue Mingkong, Jiang Chuchu, and Hei Yanyu from the Celestial
                Ancient Continent, no one else in the world knew he cultivated with the Forbidden Demonic Arts. And
                these women were troubled by various problems that forbade them from exposing him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Soon, Su Qingge will surely cultivate the Demonic Arts behind my back, and
                with so many young prodigies in the Immortal Academy, the Elders won&#8217;t be able to attend to her
                when she loses control. That will be the perfect opportunity.] At that moment, as Gu Changge was deep in
                his thoughts, a high-pitched screech of a phoenix was heard. From the eastern sky, a nine-headed black
                Celestial Phoenix was seen dragging a carriage, soaring towards Immortal Academy in the sky at lightning
                speed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yue Mingkong is here. Just as I was thinking about her.] In the meantime,
                from another direction, a giant nine-headed golden lion that seemed to be made of gold, was also
                charging in the sky. The sound of chanting could be heard as the light of Buddha brightly illuminated
                the sky. A handsome young monk in a white robe with an odd tattoo on his forehead was seen riding on the
                golden lion, appearing grand yet stern.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the people of Immortal Academy were blown away as young prodigies
                were dumbfounded when they identified who the monk was.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nine-headed lion? Is he from Golden Cicada Temple of Buddhist
                Mountain?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I heard the name of the new Chosen Monk was Jin Chan. Could that be
                him? For Buddhist Mountain, who have been keeping a low profile, to send their Chosen Monk, they must
                have plenty to Talent there! They must be in their golden age!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If that&#8217;s really him. He must be exceptional. According to
                rumours, the Chosen Monk possesses a total of 108 Buddhist Bones in his body. And at his birth, the
                silhouette of Buddha appeared in the Nine Heavens, compassionately smiling at him.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Plus, this Chosen Monk was said to have ventured into Demon-Burying
                Abyss and walked out alive. Is that true?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn! He went to Demon-Burying Abyss? That&#8217;s
                scary…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, young prodigies began discussing as they were all astounded by the
                young monk. In fact, Buddhist Mountain had once survived without a Chosen Monk for quite a while. Given
                that Buddhist Mountain was in no way inferior to the Mortal Palace and Sky Emperor Mountain, it was
                clear how mysterious and powerful the current Chosen Monk was.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He&#8217;s been to the Demon-Burying Abyss?] Overhearing the conversations,
                Gu Changge subconsciously squinted his eyes. He was planning his journey to where the demoness in red
                would surface, but the Chosen Monk showed up out of nowhere.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Changge…&#8221; Suddenly, a strangely familiar timbre entered his
                ears.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightly walking, Yue Mingkong came to his side, while the Elders in charge of
                checking bone ages dared not to question her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As ever, she was impeccably beautiful. Even without makeup, her face
                resembled a flawless painting. Her body was slim and her hair was silky smooth, and her eyes were calm
                and deep. Her glowing dress, emitting intertwining Divine Chains of Order, was weaved with silk spat out
                by silkworms in the Quasi-Sacred Realm, and its preciousness was indubitably as its value was out of the
                world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a big group of her followers were following behind her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge turned over to her and subtly smiled as he smoothly grabbed her
                petite hand. &#8220;You&#8217;re here.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm…&#8221; Yue Mingkong stood right beside him, seemingly somewhat
                puzzled. &#8220;Did you come here just to wait for me?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn&#8217;t believe that Gu Changge would be so nice to her that he
                would personally come just to wait for her. Nonetheless, as she saw him the moment she arrived at
                Immortal Academy, she couldn&#8217;t help but feel moved and happy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you think? Everyone here can vouch for me.&#8221; Gu Changge
                laughed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, every single young prodigy was overwhelmed with envy seeing
                that, but they could say nothing about the destined relationship between such a ravishing couple.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as scepticism arose in Yue Mingkong&#8217;s eyes, she scanned across
                the faces of the young prodigies, only to see nothing off about them, and she was comforted by
                that.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, very soon, she turned to Jin Chan, who was riding on the
                nine-headed lion, and revealed a pondering look. It was the first time the mysterious Chosen Monk
                revealed himself to the world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her memory of her previous life, Jin Chan helped an ancient
                freak remove the suspicion of him being the Successor of Demonic Arts, which drew Gu Changge&#8217;s
                anger. Later, upon the disturbance in Demon-Burying Abyss, Jin Chan hurried over and faced trouble
                within, and since then, there was no longer news about him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even till now, she couldn&#8217;t fathom why Gu Changge chose to seal off
                Demon-Burying Abyss in her previous life. Although he failed to do it, he managed to achieve his goal to
                buy himself some time. Furthermore, some time ago, Gu Changge asked her some questions, to which she
                indirectly told him numerous pieces of information regarding Demon-Burying Abyss.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, there was one thing that remained an enigma to her, many incidents
                that were meant to take place later in time were, for some reason, brought forward, including the
                occurrence of Immortal Academy that appeared ten years in advance. And of course, the disturbance in
                Demon-Burying Abyss.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brother Jin Chan?&#8221; With a leisurely look, Gu Changge approached
                Jin Chan who just landed, as if he was about to greet him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, the crowd was rather confused. As the Chosen Monk, Jin
                Chan&#8217;s cultivation level was not known, but the nine-headed golden lion was in the Quasi-Sacred
                Realm. And for Jin Chan to ride on it, he must be at least in the Quasi-Sacred Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Gu Changge&#8217;s strength needed no clarification as
                even the Elders of Immortal Academy still needed to treat him with respect. There was even a rumour
                where Gu Changge sparred with someone in the Quasi-Sacred Realm, which eventually ended in a tie. With
                countless similar events, he grew more and more mysterious.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Will the two of them clash at their first meeting?] Thinking that, the crowd
                couldn&#8217;t help but feel excited.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge.&#8221; Jin Chan hopped to the ground
                and composedly greeted Gu Changge with his hands clasped together. However, the nine-headed golden lion
                growled behind him as its hair raised, seemingly distressed and intimidated by Gu Changge&#8217;s
                presence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it doing?&#8221; Gu Changge asked out of fascination.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shan Jing is very sensitive to all kinds of aura. Perhaps it
                was either that of Young Master Changge or Princess Mingkong has startled him,&#8221; Jin Chan calmly
                answered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Jing was the name of the nine-headed golden lion. At its will, it could
                shape shift into a human, fulfilling the roles of an assistant and a mount. It also possessed a Talent
                that granted him incomparable sensitivity to auras, which allowed him to instantaneously tell good and
                bad apart. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason it was rather hostile towards Gu Changge, was because it detected
                a suffocating sensation from him, as if a bloody wave of corpses was storming at it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underneath Gu Changge&#8217;s amiable facade, there was nothing but
                spine-chilling terror. And that was Jin Chan&#8217;s first impression of him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Jin Chan had just left Buddhist Mountain recently, he had heard
                innumerable rumours about Gu Changge, and all of them were praises for him. However, judging by the
                situation, those praises were all for what was on the surface. After all, the Successor of the Immortal
                Gu Family must be more than meets the eye.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Weird. I barely did anything. Brother Jin Chan I reckon this mount of
                yours clearly bears some grudges against me and Mingkong. Gu Changge casually smiled. &#8220;But a
                mount&#8217;s a mount. We can never compare it to a human.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyway, ever since I heard about the mysteries of Buddhist Mountain,
                its superb divine abilities, and its unparalleled might, I&#8217;ve always wanted to see it myself, but
                sadly, I never had the opportunity to. But since I&#8217;ve coincidentally bumped into you, Brother Jin
                Chan, perhaps you could teach me a thing or two?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge&#8217;s tone was natural and his voice wasn&#8217;t that
                loud, everyone at the gates could hear him speak.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What!?&#8221; The crowd was thoroughly shocked. As they regained their
                senses, they realised that Gu Changge was offering to have a spar with the mysterious Chosen One of the
                Buddhist Mountain in front of him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Zoom!* Right then and there, besides stupefaction, there was only excitement
                and thrill on every face. After all, the crowd barely had the opportunity to witness Gu Changge engaging
                in a fight, and many were curious as to his true strength. And now, right in front of everyone, he
                declared a challenge to the mysterious Chosen Monk before him. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, such an exchange was truly shocking. Even Yue Mingkong
                herself was dazed and bewildered by Gu Changge&#8217;s intention.</span></p>

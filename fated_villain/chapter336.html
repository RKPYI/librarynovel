          suspect who made the move was hypothesised to be in the Nirvana Realm,
          and was currently guarding Gu Changge. This was enough to see the
          Immortal Gu Family’s overbearing stance on this matter. After all,
          what was someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm to each force? Yet, the
          Immortal Gu Family had no regard for them, and directly killed him.

          with the Successor of Demonic Arts. Thus, many from the orthodox

          the faces of all those in the orthodox faction, leading to great

          its disciples gaining experience outside, to return back to the
          academy so that they would not be swept up into this. Naturally, that
          means the trial in those Ancient Kingdoms had ended, and those
          disciples were evacuated. After all, the Immortal Academy saw that no

          fiery pit and leading us towards ruin. There’s a lot of anger directed
          towards Purple Mansion right now, those in the orthodox faction are
          discussing how to suppress us, but you don’t want to resolve this
          matter and you’re even talking about taking revenge? Are you really

          enigmatic. He was exuding a heavy and boundless aura. Capable of

          Mansion, we can’t lose him. If something happens to him, the Fortuity
          of my Purple Mansion will also be cut off within a hundred years or
          so. Right now, my Purple Mansion’s only opportunity lies with him. The
          fish that will turn into a dragon in the next hundred years.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing this, Liu Ziyan clenched her teeth and said, “even so, why
          did Great Elder confine my father? Anyone who voiced the slightest
          disagreement were all confined by you. Is this all there is? This is
          all you can give as your reason?”</span

          >Her words resounded powerfully, full of righteousness and indignance.
          She didn’t expect to see such a thing after returning to Purple
          Mansion. All the disciples and Elders who voiced any complaint were
          detained in the dungeon.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, the Great Elder’s cultivation was immeasurably deep. Back
          when her father was merely an ordinary disciple, he already held the
          position of Great Elder. Basically, he had been overlooking the world
          for who knows how many tens of thousands of years. In fact, if the
          Great Elder made a move, even if her father, who was the Sect Master
          of Purple Mansion, wouldn’t have a chance to contend against him..

          continues acting like this, forget a hundred years, it would be hard
          for us to last a single year…” Liu Ziyan gritted her teeth, her eyes
          unreconciled. [Why? Why can’t you just understand this simple
          fact?]</span

          time, the Saintess should just focus on cultivating. As for matters

          didn’t finish listening to Liu Ziyan before waving his hand for
          someone to escort her. His expression was as tranquil as before.

          taken away, an imposing figure with a blurred face tentatively asked
          this from the side, with each blink of their eyes, millions of various
          Daos seemed to come to life. The mountains and sea sank, and day and
          night collapsed.

          unfathomable. The power they hide cannot be taken lightly. Still,
          since the founding of my Purple Mansion, there have been trials and
          tribulations but when have we ever been afraid? Gu Changge framed us.
          There’s no way the Immortal Gu Family is not privy to it, yet they
          still protect him all the same. What qualifications do they have to
          reproach us for doing the same? The blood of our Sacred Emperor Realm
          Master can’t be spilled in vain.” The Great Elder, hearing this, had
          his expression become darker. When he opened his mouth, he decided to
          bring justice to their Sect’s Scared Emperor Realm Master.</span

          solemn. They were clear on the Great Elder’s stance. A Space Tunnel
          was opened and in a flash, and the figures had left.
        </span>

          the one sent to rescue Sky King Zhi Yang, they were much more
          powerful. Now that the Great Elder had given his orders, they must
          start making preparations. At the same time, they also needed a way to
          ensure Sky King Zhi Yang’s life. Otherwise, everything would have been
          for naught.

          inside a dark cave mansion. The place was surging with divine mist, a
          mix of white, black, and grey. The three colours surges boundlessly
          and looked exceedingly mysterious.

          Mansion?” When the Great Elder arrived, his expression became somber
          and apprehensive. He was afraid he would be contaminated. However, he
          seemed to have thought of something. He muttered to himself, and in
          the end, he still asked this question.</span

          man’s divination, to find opportunities, where he could attain
          enlightenment and went on to establish Purple Mansion.

          to spy on the Heavenly Way be used so easily with a price? The
          backlashes on his body is the best proof of it…] Thinking of this, the
          Great Elder couldn’t help sighing again.

          >Back then it was through this strange man’s divination and many
          mysterious methods that he obtained the souls of experts from the
          Forbidden Epoch. After paying a huge price for it, and even
          sacrificing some of Purple Mansion’s Fortuity, Sky King Zhi Yang was
          finally born. He was born with memories of his previous life and the
          Chaos Dao Bone.

          >The Great Elder had spent too much on Sky King Zhi Yang, and poured
          too much painstaking care onto him. Not only was it for Purple
          Mansion, it was also for himself. If Sky King Zhi Yang could achieve
          the Great Dao before he dies, then Purple Mansion would remain
          prosperous for ages to come, and he could rest in peace.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, if Sky King Zhi Yang could not do so… Then before he died,
          the Great Elder could only use a forbidden art to steal Sky King Zhi
          Yang’s life span, and everything else to live for another generation
          and continue Purple Mansion’s legacy.</span

          >If the strange man did not owe the Purple Mansion’s founder a favour
          back then, he wouldn’t have provided help so many times. It was
          precisely because of this, Sky King Zhi Yang could not be lost, even
          if he had to collude with the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span

          >“Ten…” At this time, the Purple Mansion’s Great Elder furrowed his
          brow as he listened to the strange man speak. It was very indistinct,
          and he had to listen carefully to make out what he was saying.

          and quiet location within a palace, Gu Changge stood by the window. He
          had his hands behind his back, as his robes gently swayed. He looked
          into the distance, where the mountain range was like an ink-colored
          ribbon, and his face carried a small smile as he thanked, “Thank you
          for today.”</span

          peerless grace. Her appearance couldn’t be seen clearly, as if she was
          in another dimension.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Wearing azure clothes, strands of her hair fluttered in the wind. Her
          eyes were serene, like warm and clear jade, or like the bright and
          flawless moon.

          >“Some lowly man in the Scared Emperor Realm hardly has the right to
          be acting so arrogantly.” The aure-clothed woman shook her head, her
          voice sounded like the sounds of nature, and had a soothing quality.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“We haven’t met for many years and Aunt Qing is as peerless as
          before. Killing someone in the Scared Emperor Realm is merely the work
          of snapping your fingers.” Gu Changge laughed and chatted
          light-heartedly with her.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Aunt Qing’s original name was Gu Qinyi. Based on seniority, strictly
          speaking, she was not part of this generation’s Gu Family. Her origins
          would need to be traced way back. She was one of the Immortal Gu
          Family’s ancient monstrosities. However, she was from the same
          generation as Gu Changge’s father. In fact, when she was born, she was
          many years younger than Gu Changge’s father.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Due to this, Gu Changge’s father viewed her as his younger sister,
          and looked after her. This was why Gu Changge called her aunt. As for
          why she was willing to become Gu Changge’s guardian, that would be
          quite the long story.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When Gu Changge revealed his Talent at the age of three, his
          brilliance overshadowed all his peers in the Gu Family. Even those
          slighter older than him paled in comparison. During that time, many Gu
          Family Elders had their eyes on him, thinking if he was so excellent
          already at a young age, he potentials were sure to be limitless in the
          future.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, picking a guardian for him was naturally a very important
          matter. However, to everyone’s surprise. At that time, Gu Changge said
          that he didn’t need a guardian and would conquer the world by himself.
          A three-year-old child, saying these words, had shocked the whole
          family.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many people thought Gu Changge was being too conceited for someone so
          young, After all, no matter how great one’s talent was, they were
          vulnerable before they could fully grow. Furthermore, the tallest tree
          was also the one that snaps from the howling wind.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, Gu Changge was stubborn on this matter and even his father
          could not convince him otherwise. Then, in the end, out of everyone’s
          expectations, Gu Changge suddenly requested Gu Qingyi to be his
          guardian. Gu Qingyi was excellent, be it in terms of Talent or
          cultivation level. But, no matter what, she couldn’t be the guardian
          of a three-year-old child.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even so, she unexpectedly agreed to it.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This matter had caused many waves back then and it made many youths
          in the Gu Family envious. After all, Gu Qingyi completely deserved the
          title of being unmatched in her generation. In fact, rumour has it
          that she had even achieved the Great Dao before Gu Changge’s father.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, at that time, Gu Changge was merely greedy for her Sources,
          and was planning to slowly steal it.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for why Gu Qinyi agreed, it was most likely because of Gu
          Changge’s father. Another reason was that Gu Qingyi had detected
          something. After all, she possessed the Innate Nine Orifices Immortal
          Heart, that was well known within the Gu Family.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You haven’t called for me in so many years. I almost thought you had
          forgotten about your guardian.” Gu Qingyi heard his words and replied
          calmly, as if the passage of time and the transformation for the world
          appeared to be inconsequential in her eyes.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          shadow; she was actually in a very far away location.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Is Aunt Qing complaining to me?” Gu Changge still had a smile on his
          face. To be honest, Gu Qingyi was the first person he could not
          completely see through; not through her thoughts nor her cultivation
          level.
        </span>

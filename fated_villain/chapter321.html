          King Zhi Yang, so she asked without hesitation. Judging from their

          &#8220;Of course not. In fact, I already know what you might share
          with me, in relation to Sky King Zhi Yang. I&#8217;ll also know his

          Purple Mansion would rather offend many forces than hand over his
          whereabouts. And you, as Purple Mansion’s Saintess, will definitely be
          immediately contacted if something happens to Sky King Zhi
          Yang.&#8221;</span

          right. Purple Mansion attached great importance to what had happened
          in the Black Tortoise Empire. Even in this situation, Sky King Zhi
          Yang was still under the protection of Purple Mansion. In fact, the
          Sect was more than willing to fight against the other forces for Sky
          King Zhi Yang’s sake.</span

          public’s anger. Especially if Sky King Zhi Yang really had something
          to do with the Successor of Demonic Arts and Purple Mansion still
          wanted to protect him.</span

          Successor of Demonic Arts, they cut off contact with him straight away
          and claimed that Prince Ying had been expelled from the sect, in fear
          of getting into any trouble. They did so even though it was obvious
          that Prince Ying was of great importance. However the threat of being
          labelled as the enemy of the whole world was not without consequences.

          its anger. They were just missing out on an opportunity that would
          justify their actions. Furthermore, there were also Purple Mansion’s

          was not right. But now, she felt even more certain what they were
          doing was wrong, after being consoled by Gu Changge like this. [If
          Purple Mansion continues to act like this, it will be walking down the

          as the Saintess, my words are of little importance and is weak in the
          vast Purple Mansion. Even if I explained the advantages and
          disadvantages to them clearly, it won&#8217;t be of much

          received his guidance. Thus, she initially had confidence that she
          knew him well. But, after hearing what Gu Changge said, the idea that
          she firmly believed in, that Sky King Zhi Yang had nothing to do with
          the Successor of Demonic Arts, began to waver.</span

          waterfall, brilliant enough to reflect one&#8217;s image; and her
          waist was slender, like an hourglass. Even if she was wearing a veil,
          her skin was as white as snow and flawless as if it was the surface of

          unable to bear it, but Gu Changge could.</span

          this out of consideration for the future of Purple Mansion, and
          I&#8217;m doing it for the Successor of Demonic Arts. In fact, our

          Yang to appear. However, he had refused to do so yet, nor tell her
          how. Instead, invited her out to have tea, and let her notice how

          would be more or less be cautious when taking action after finding out
          that his daughter was in Gu Changge’s hands. He would then seriously

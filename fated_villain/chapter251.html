      <h4>
        Chapter 251-1: The emergence of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction, Even
        the people from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain do not dare to be reckless
        (1)
      </h4>
      <p>"How is the investigation of the matter?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded slightly and asked in a calm manner.</p>
      <p>
        "Reporting to master, Absolute Heavenly Extinction has already emerged,
        it’s just that we do not know its exact location. The Absolute Heavenly
        aura has swept through many regions in this period of time with a
        decisive force, annexing the territories of many powers."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now Southern Heaven has been converted into an Absolute Heavenly
        battlefield. A large number of Heavenly Extinction beings have emerged
        from within and many cultivators have rushed there."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I even heard that this time the quota for the True Immortal Academy is
        closely related to the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield. Only by killing
        a certain number of Heavenly Extinction beings will one be qualified to
        enter the True Immortal Academy."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Night Fork Clan's living spirit, the one named Ye Han was considered
        Gu Changge's confidant as he respectfully reported.
      </p>
      <p>Many of Gu Changge's important matters were entrusted to him.</p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators in the outside world knew that this Night Fork clansmen
        was one of his people and did not dare to easily provoke.
      </p>
      <p>"So many things have happened when I was in seclusion?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge raised his eyebrows slightly and appeared somewhat puzzled.
      </p>
      <p>
        The early appearance of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction did not affect
        him much. After all, not many people dared to risk their lives and
        venture into the area enveloped by the Absolute Heavenly Aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than himself, it was unlikely that anyone would know why he was
        looking for the Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people would even think that he intended to stop the Absolute
        Heavenly Extinction from spreading.
      </p>
      <p>And this was the benefit that came with fame.</p>
      <p>
        The construction of the True Immortal Academy was almost complete, but
        no one had heard the news regarding the selection of a candidate. It did
        seem to be related to the Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        "When the time comes, as long as the young existences want to enter the
        True Immortal Academy, they will all rush to fight against the Absolute
        Heavenly Extinction."
      </p>
      <p>
        "After being a shrinking turtle for so long, there is no way that
        horse-feeding boy will still be sitting still at this time."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking about this, Gu Changge couldn't help but reveal some intriguing
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>"Let’s go to Southern Heaven." He said, waving his sleeves.</p>
      <p>
        A huge ancient warship suddenly ascended into the air, rising against
        the wind, with the huge word "Gu" engraved on it. The warship looked
        ancient and atmospheric as it was waving in the air.
      </p>
      <p>And then, with a rumbling sound, it moved, crushing the sky!</p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        Southern Heaven was located in the extreme south of the Upper Realm.
        Near the Upper Realm was an extremely prosperous and boundless realm,
        the Demon Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Demon Realm was home to the unique Demon Race that inhabited large
        ancient worlds. Its existence was very long, even tracing back to the
        most ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the beginning of time, many Demon Emperors and Demon Empresses had
        been born within the race.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the many Immortal Techniques and their Supreme Dao system the demon
        world was also a well of water. No one was foolish enough to offend the
        Demon Race.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the most impressive thing to the cultivators of Southern Heaven was
        still the nine suns that hung in the sky. Nine suns hang in the sky,
        burning with the most horrible True Fire from the sun, causing the
        extremely hot weather in Southern Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        For cultivators who were a little weak, the True Fire was also likely to
        damage their soul if they stayed under it for a long time. Legend had it
        that in ancient times, Southern Heaven was the land of the Golden Crow
        Clan in the Demon Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for some unknown reason, the eight most powerful existences of the
        Golden Crow Clan were killed by a certain unknown existence. Then they
        were refined into eight suns with great divine power, hanging in the
        air, as an example to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Golden Crow Clan had almost become history. Barely could anyone find
        anyone from that clan. Though the authenticity of this rumor could not
        be verified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Southern Heaven had also become a place where fish and dragons were
        mixed, many Dao Sects and Clans had cultivators here. Nowadays, this
        place had become even more lively, and almost every day one could see
        cultivators arriving from everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either they arrived as divine lights, riding fierce beasts, or driving
        ancient warships and flying boats. It was just that the largest number
        of them were still from the younger generation, from the major Immortal
        sects, the Supreme Dao sects, or some Forbidden area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contemporary heirs, sealed ancient young emperors, ancient freaks,
        and so on, had amazing strength and cultivation. And their origins were
        even more terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        If ordinary cultivators saw them, they would become pale and retreat,
        and did not dare to easily provoke them. From the Golden Age, various
        young existences were present in Southern Heaven, and everyone knew
        their purpose.
      </p>
      <p>Heavenly Extinction Battlefield!</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, in the pavilion of an ancient city, Ye Langtian and his
        sister Ye Liuli were also there with a large number of people. On the
        opposite side of them was the young supreme of the Ancient Immortal Wang
        Family, Wang Wushuang.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the other direction were the rest of the people, such as the heir of
        the Vermilion Bird Clan, Chi Ling, and others. All familiar faces that
        were once on the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, they all had a chance to improve their
        cultivation rising to the True God realm. Now that they were gathered
        here, it was obvious that they were here to discuss a certain matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The appearance of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction during this period
        of time has surpassed the expectations of many forces, and many
        frontiers and Dao sects have been affected. The appearance of the
        Heavenly Extinction Battlefield in Southern Heaven is an excellent
        opportunity for us to sharpen our skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Except that you all should be aware that we belong to the contemporary
        geniuses, and in terms of cultivation, we are naturally a chip weaker
        than those ancient freaks."
      </p>
      <p>
        "When we clash with them, we won't be able to take advantage of them in
        the slightest."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If we miss the big event because of this, it would be even more
        regrettable."
      </p>
      <p>
        The one who opened his mouth to speak was Wang Wushuang, who had golden
        lines emerging from his eyes, looking extremely divine.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        As he opened his mouth, the rest of the people's faces showed different
        expressions and they all nodded. After all, they were all here for the
        Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, so they were naturally clear about its
        importance at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Wang Wushuang said was exactly what they were worried about,
        otherwise, they wouldn't have come to this place to discuss and think of
        countermeasures. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on

      <p>
        “Brother Wang’s words are our concern as well. After all, this Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield involves the True Immortal Academy quota. Even if
        we have a strong background behind us, the True Immortal Academy will
        not give any face……"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian said with a sigh, and everyone including him had a heartfelt
        yearning when he mentioned the True Immortal Academy.
      </p>
      <p>A chance to become an Immortal!</p>
      <p>
        That was the realm that countless cultivators could only dream of. And
        the True Immortal Academy existed to cultivate a True Immortal in this
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the True Immortal did not come into existence, the spread of the
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction would be unstoppable. At that time
        countless Dao sects and living beings would suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since everyone knows this, it's good that now the True Immortal Academy
        has appeared, it's an opportunity for us."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Entering the True Immortal Academy is the only way for us to have a
        chance to catch up with that group of ancient freaks, who have been
        cultivating for longer than us, and whose heritage and cultivation are
        even deeper than ours."
      </p>
      <p>
        "For us, the only way to be qualified to compete with them is to get a
        spot to enter the True Immortal Academy."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang said slowly, he had a bearing that displayed the
        confidence that was bound to win the quota for the True Immortal
        Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way to obtain a spot in the True Immortal Academy was to enter the
        Heavenly Extinction Battlefield and kill Heavenly Extinction beings to
        obtain points.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was also the requirement provided by the True Immortal Academy for
        all the young generation. If they didn't even have the guts to step into
        the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, was there any need to compete for
        any True Immortal's position?
      </p>
      <p>
        "So when the time comes for us to enter the Heavenly Extinction
        battlefield, we have to find a way to walk together and help each other.
        I think you all already know something about the powerful and difficult
        nature of the Heavenly Extinction beings."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang continued, his gaze slowly sweeping over the crowd as he
        proposed his solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If Young Lord Changge were around at this time, things might be a lot
        better……"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Even those ancient freaks would be scandalized if they encountered him,
        right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, there were two young supreme beings, but they were
        speaking softly.
      </p>
      <p>These words received a lot of approval and recognition for a while.</p>
      <p>Even Wang Wushuang was nodding.</p>
      <p>
        Other than his sister, only Gu Changge, as well as that inheritor of
        demonic art, was capable of resisting the ancient freak in this
        generation.
      </p>
      <p>"Speaking of Brother Gu, he should be arriving soon as well……"</p>
      <p>
        And at this time, Ye Langtian could not help but reveal a smile and
        said, "It just so happens that after Brother Gu emerged from seclusion,
        I sent a message to him, and by all rights he should be almost here at
        this time."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing him speak, the Vermilion Bird Clan heir, Chi Ling, who had not
        spoken, could not help but have her eyes light up slightly, revealing a
        sense of surprise.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Changge is also coming?"</p>
      <p>
        Many young supreme beings also appeared happy, and awe rose in their
        hearts.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 251-2: The emergence of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction, Even
        the people from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain do not dare to be reckless
        (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was like the backbone for the younger generation from the
        current era.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it was status or the strength of cultivation, he stood at the
        top of his peers, but only a few people could compare with him. With Gu
        Changge around, they would have less pressure while facing many ancient
        freaks.
      </p>
      <p>"You said Gu Changge is coming here?"</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, at the corner of the ladder in front of the building, a
        crisp and clean sound suddenly sounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        A tall and beautiful girl with shoulder-length silver hair was standing
        there. It was Ying Yu who came to ask for news after arriving at the
        Southern Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were many young people next to her, and they were very different
        from the human race in terms of appearance. They either had horns on
        their head and looked like a dragon, or they had wings on their back,
        like a phoenix. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
      </p>
      <p>
        All enveloped with brilliant aura, walking like a tiger, looking around
        as they oozed with a powerful momentum and amazing aura. This was a
        group of young supreme beings from Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them was a black-clothed man with slightly closed eyes, with a
        scale pattern on the center of his eyebrows, and his aura was much
        stronger than the rest. He was an ancient freak who had been in
        hibernation since ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
        His father was a follower of Emperor Ying, so he had also been sealed up
        to the present, becoming a follower of Emperor Ying's son. Although he
        was not as good as the Emperor's heirs like Ying Shuang, the strength of
        his cultivation base was much stronger than that of the young supremes
        of this generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, hearing Ying Yu's question, the expressions of many
        young supreme beings in the pavilion changed slightly, and they
        apparently recognized Ying Yu's identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her brother Ying Shuang was suspected of being an inheritor of demonic
        art; she was secretly attacked by many cultivators due to this. But with
        her strength, they were not her opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu's own strength should not be underestimated. It showed that she
        had surpassed many young supreme beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, the expressions of the young supreme beings, including Wang
        Wushuang and Ye Langtian, became unattractive.
      </p>
      <p>"What's the matter with you, miss?"</p>
      <p>"Why don't you answer?"</p>
      <p>
        The man in black who had been dropping his eyes abruptly shouted.
        Terrifying pale golden lines flashed between his eyebrows, followed by
        wisps of laws and order, bursting out of the void!
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Just like a dragon exploding. The terrifying fluctuations seemed to roar
        in their ears, and many people turned pale as they took a few steps
        back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people felt even more unbearable, bleeding directly from their
        facial orifices, and were severely injured by this voice.
      </p>
      <p>"The pinnacle of the God King Realm!"</p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian and Wang Wushuang were protected by a secret technique, and
        they were fine for a while, but their expressions sank. The strength of
        this man was by no means comparable to the two of them.
      </p>
      <p>"Don't be ignorant."</p>
      <p>
        The man in black sneered again, despising the group of young supreme
        beings in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Agu, don't be rude. Will Gu Changge come here?" Ying Yu frowned at this
        time and spoke again. First, she questioned the man in black and then
        asked the people in front of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She still remembered the last time she went to the Ancient Immortal Gu
        family to visit Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the other party made her wait for more than half a month in
        front of the Gu family's gate on the grounds of cultivating in seclusion
        and finally made her leave in anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu still remembered this humiliation. If Gu Changge were to come
        here today, she would have to ask him for an explanation with regards to
        pouring dirty water on her brother and framing him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother Changge did say that he would come, but I don't know exactly
        when he will come."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian frowned slightly and was a little dissatisfied with the
        other party's attitude, but she still said the same because of the other
        party's power.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, I'll wait here for him to come. I don't believe that it will be
        the same as last time, I won't be able to see him." Ying Yu nodded and
        said lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        She knew that Gu Changge was very strong, so she didn't intend to
        provoke him. She just wanted to ask him something, and clear her
        brother’s suspicions along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today's younger generation, aside from Gu Changge, only the
        descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall had such a right to speak to her.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",

          });

      </div>
      <p>
        Although the rest of the ancient freaks and ancient young emperors who
        appeared were powerful, they were far inferior to Gu Changge in terms of
        power.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You don't have to wait. This Gu is already here." Just then the voice
        of Gu Changge sounded as he appeared accompanied by a faint smile.
      </p>
      <p>Ying Yu's expression changed.</p>
      <p>
        The man in black beside her also had a sudden change in expression. His
        face was very pale, and did not dare to be so arrogant and strong as
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly everyone looked at the large group of people that appeared
        outside the pavilion. The leader was Gu Changge who had just arrived in
        Southern Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him were a large number of followers with such shocking auras
        that the cultivators that saw them along the way couldn't help but turn
        pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        So powerful, needless to say, they also knew who this person was. His
        expression became extremely frightened.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Changge…"</p>
      <p>"Brother Gu…"</p>
      <p>
        The arrival of Gu Changge made the young supreme beings in the pavilion
        overjoyed and they hurried forward to greet him. It was like finding the
        backbone, sweeping away the fear and humiliation from just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother Ye, Brother Wang, Lady Chi Ling…" Gu Changge's eyes were
        slightly different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he greeted everyone with a smile like a spring breeze on his face,
        which seemed to be more otherworldly and rich than jade. As for Ying Yu
        and others on the other side, they were generally ignored by him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I haven't seen you for a long time. Brother Gu is so handsome, even
        more than in the past. Even his cultivation is even more unfathomable."
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Changge came at the right time."</p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian, Chi Ling, and the others also opened their mouths one after
        another, with happy expressions on their faces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although everyone was of the same generation, in front of Gu Changge,
        they couldn't help but bow their heads a few times.
      </p>
      <p>This made them very emotional.</p>
      <p>
        Even the man in black who was very arrogant and strong just now, after
        seeing Gu Changge's arrival, his face went pale. His forehead was oozing
        with cold sweat, and he didn't dare to speak a single word.
      </p>
      <p>It could be seen how powerful Gu Changge was.</p>
      <p>
        Even if someone from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain saw him, he would not
        dare to be presumptuous.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instant, the Second Mountain Elder was in an abysmal state. His aura
                was weakening as he was carrying a spine-chilling wound that almost tore apart his entire body. Within
                the wound, there was a destructive force that was constantly chipping away at his lifeforce. Given that
                he was a True Daoist, his vitality was so vigorous that no words could describe it. After all, one drop
                of his blood could reanimate a body and even recreate a world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        </p>
        <p></span><span id="more-30675"></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, at this moment, his injury was so critical that he couldn&#8217;t
                recover from it. In fact, he had been witnessing Gu Changge&#8217;s evolution for the past fifteen days,
                and his feeling towards him drastically changed from shock to dread upon the realisation that even
                someone of his age could attain such terrifying powers.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching as Gu Changge approached him, the Second Mountain Elder was clearly
                in fear, though he remained wordless. He wasn&#8217;t certain why Gu Changge slaughtered everyone else
                except him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the disaster Nine Great Mountains encountered, almost all disciples
                died. Given that the other Mountain Elders, who were also True Daoists, were annihilated, there was no
                way the other disciples could have survived this invasion. At this point, the Second Mountain Elder
                could already foresee Nine Great Mountains&#8217; obliteration, as well as how the buildings, mountains
                and islands they harboured were brought to ashen ruins.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, he felt agonised and infuriated, but mostly remorseful for being
                extremely helpless. If only he had noticed Gu Changge&#8217;s ferocious ambition, he might have been
                able to turn things around. Were the Celestial Seal of Nine Mountains in his hands, Nine Great Mountains
                would have been turned into an unwavering fortress, which Gu Changge would find a hard time attempting
                to invade.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, the Second Mountain Elder was by no means pleasant towards
                the Sky Deer Goddess, who was behind Gu Changge. As a matter of fact, what baffled him the most was why
                the Sky Deer Goddess, who was in charge of protecting Sky Deer City, would tread so close with Gu
                Changge and would even side with him against Nine Great Mountains. If it weren&#8217;t for this, Nine
                Great Mountains wouldn&#8217;t have fallen for the ruse.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8#8220;As the Sky Deer Goddess, you&#8217;re working with the people of the
                Upper Realm to attack Nine Great Mountains. Do you feel no shame?&#8221; The face of the Second Mountain
                Elder was filled with coldness and rage, so was his voice.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, the Sky Deer Goddess disregarded his remark, as if she
                didn&#8217;t hear what he said. With a light smile, she then said to Gu Changge. &#8220;Young Master Gu,
                do you believe him now?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;d be so heartless for the sake of Sky Deer City, huh?&#8221;
                Simply chuckling, Gu Changge refrain from answering her question.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since Master entrusted the city to me before he passed away,
                I&#8217;ll protect it no matter what the cost is.&#8221; Retaining her faint grin, the Sky Deer Goddess
                stared at Gu Changge, as though she was trying to catch the change in his facial expression.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there wasn&#8217;t any significant change in his face, so she was
                unable to discern anything, which somewhat disappointed her. As ever, he was still an unpredictable man,
                whose mind was ever so enigmatic.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with Gu Changge was a task of great risk, but she was left with no
                choice. Given that Gu Changge was capable of obliterating Nine Great Mountains, which was filled with
                numberless True Daoists, there was no way Sky Deer City could fend him off.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your mind has been corrupted! If you intended to protect Sky
                Deer City, you would have worked with us to resist the invading forces from the Upper Realm instead of
                siding with them! Open your eyes, will you!?&#8221; Thanks to the Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s
                intellect, he instantaneously figured out the true story and furiously yelled. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, he grew even more enraged, crushed by his own incompetence. [Sky
                Deer Goddess has obviously joined their atrocious ranks! Working with the Upper Realm against Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains in order to protect Sky Deer City? How does that plan even make sense? With
                the greed of the Upper Realm, it is impossible for them to forgo Sky Deer City!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you know?&#8221; In response, the Sky Deer Goddess furrowed
                her brows as a trace of iciness flashed across her eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s bewildering how you think the Nine Great Mountains is
                capable of combating the Upper Realm Army. You&#8217;ve all been hiding timidly amid the clouds, not
                daring to show yourselves. You attempted to seal the mountains on the last invasion of the Upper Realm,
                not caring about the survival of Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and Sky Deer City. What gives you the
                right to judge me?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be frank, she wouldn&#8217;t have resorted to this if she had any other
                choices, and her actions were nothing but a result of taking a desperate glimpse into a miniscule chance
                of survival.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the Second Mountain Elder was visibly dazed. Indeed, he once
                intended to give up Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and Sky Deer City by sealing the mountains in order
                to secure stability and safety of the Nine Great Mountains, but before he could do so, he was
                unfortunately attacked by Gu Changge&#8217;s army.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, that was not the exact reason as to why the Sky Deer Goddess betrayed
                Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and Sky Deer City.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems even at this point, he has yet to realise that the Nine Great
                Mountains is now basically a ruined land, forgotten by the entire world. The Sky Deer Goddess, on the
                other hand, is much smarter than them.] Looking at the Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s expression, Gu
                Changge subconsciously shook his head as he revealed a remorseful expression.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As long as the disciples of Nine Great Mountains live on, its legacies
                shan&#8217;t vanish. There is not a chance that the Nine Great Mountains would be obliterated!&#8221;
                Upon those words, the Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s face turned into a grimace, but remembering Xiao
                Yang and Gu Wudi, whom he sent away at a crucial time, he felt somewhat relieved.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Nine Great Mountains are the final embers of hope! As long as they
                are able to locate Supreme Mountain Elder, then the Nine Great Mountains shall have the chance to
                restore its existence in the world. Even if I die now, I won&#8217;t feel guilty towards my
                Ancestors.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, really? You&#8217;re still praying for your useless disciple, Xiao
                Yang? Even now, do you still not realise why I killed everyone except you?&#8221; Hearing that, Gu
                Changge let out a chuckle and he wasn&#8217;t even trying to hide the scorn in his tone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew what the Second Mountain Elder was thinking, but the latter actually
                thought that everything would be fine once he sent Xiao Yang away. Nevertheless, Gu Changge predicted
                everything the Second Mountain Elder would have considered, and used it against him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is he talking about?] Upon those words, the Second Mountain
                Elder&#8217;s face froze as those words felt peculiar. Once again, the familiar sensation of
                perturbation took over him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a remnant of the Family of Protectors, why do you think I have
                allowed him to leave?&#8221; Gu Changge blandly smiled, and in the depth of his eyes was unrelenting
                coldness.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What!? He let him go on purpose?] In that instant, the Second Mountain Elder
                couldn&#8217;t believe his ears. His face dramatically changed as he was thoroughly dumbstruck.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gu Changge knew Xiao Yang&#8217;s identity all this time? But how? This
                matter is known by no one in the entirety of the Nine Great Mountains except for me!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Was Gu Wudi your arrangement as well?&#8221; Eventually, he came to
                this possibility with a face filled with pessimism and regret, wondering why he would agree to Gu
                Wudi&#8217;s request of sending the latter and Xiao Yang away, only to be slapped by the hard truth that
                everything was pre-planned by Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Family of Protectors…] Hearing that, the Sky Deer Goddess was taken
                aback, after which she intuitively looked at Gu Changge. If it weren&#8217;t for Gu Changge&#8217;s
                revelation, she wouldn&#8217;t have known that Xiao Yang was a remnant of the Family of Protectors. As
                the guardian of Sky Deer City, naturally, she was aware of the tragedy that happened to the Family of
                Protectors twenty years ago.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allegedly, it was said that the entire Family of Protectors was annihilated,
                involving the deaths of hundreds and only a handful managed to survive from it. Since the Protectors
                Branch had always consisted of a small number of people, the tragedy almost made them extinct. For the
                past twenty years, they were almost non-existent in Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains as not one member
                of this Family could be found.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Xiao Yang is a remnant of the Family of Protectors? But how did Gu Changge
                know that? Does the Purple Scripture in his possession have something to do with it?] Suddenly recalling
                the Purple Scripture Gu Changge conjured back then, she reckoned that Gu Changge deduced Xiao
                Yang&#8217;s identity by using that secret treasure. Besides, there was no telling what else the secret
                treasure could perceive, and she began wondering if Gu Changge had a hand in the misfortune that was
                inflicted upon the Family of Protectors.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Was the massacre of the Family of Protectors 20 years ago your doing”All of
                a sudden, the Second Mountain Elder shot Gu Changge a dead stare as blood surged in his eyes, seemingly
                savage.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Naturally, I have nothing to do with what had happened 20 years ago.
                But the family the behind me had a hand in it.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head. He didn&#8217;t mind
                answering the question.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as he was speaking, in the distant sky, a gargantuan battleship was
                descending, covered in dense Celestial Mist that was stained by blood. It was as though it just arrived
                from another massacre. There were many frightening auras of the army on the battleship that resembled a
                demon&#8217;s silhouette which carried aggression that rose through the clouds. Undoubtedly, it was the
                army that besieged the Deep Cloud Graveyard.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, as you ordered, Nine Great Mountains have been
                completely destroyed, and every one of the survivors have been executed.&#8221; Possessing a tall,
                muscular body, a Sacred Emperor Realm expert in golden armour had turned into a divine rainbow and
                rushed towards where Gu Changge was and reverently reported.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the Second Mountain Elder, who was still clinging to a sliver
                of hope, was devastated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the Second Mountain Elder of Nine Great Mountains. Imprison
                him and keep a close eye on him.&#8221; Unsurprised, Gu Changge slightly nodded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indubitably, words regarding Gu Changge&#8217;s destruction of Nine Great
                Mountains would speedily disperse, which would definitely leave a substantial impact on those of Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains. After all, in their eyes, Nine Great Mountains was of an untouchable
                existence, It was infinitely superior to Sky Deer City.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, at this moment, should the news of the ruination of Nine Great
                Mountains spread, all forces of Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains would be intimidated and fall into a
                state of immense panic.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the forces of the Upper Realm, they would surely take the opportunity
                amid the chaos to send their army to the outside of Sky Deer City to attempt to break through the Aether
                Abyss. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge had expected, news of the Nine Great Mountains&#8217;
                obliteration would leave the whole Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains in turbulence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the disturbance from the battle between the Mountain Elders and Gu
                Changge was so alarming and great that the universe, wherein Nine Great Mountains were based, was
                shattered, fragmented, and in ruins. There were fractured imprinted marks of Dao and its Principles as
                Chaos Qi engulfed the region from all directions. All those with insufficient cultivation level were too
                afraid to enter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the terrifying battle, the bits and pieces of artifacts and bones
                lying around also harboured horrifying disturbances, a slight touch of which could turn a living being
                into a pile of dust. And so, due to the havoc, the region was turned into a forbidden wasteland.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the Deep Cloud Graveyard, wherein lay the Nine Great Mountains, were
                destroyed, leaving many formidable cultivators to notice the existence of the legendary Nine Great
                Mountains. Alas, when they hurried over, all they could see was the aftermath of a traumatising war,
                whereby mountains collapsed, rivers were split apart, and a frightening rift was left all over the
                place, along with corpses and bones, ruins of wrecked palaces. The mysteriousness and extraordinariness
                of the Nine Great Mountains were nothing but gone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nine Great Mountains were completely wiped out.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, the news swiftly scattered across every corner of Eight Wastelands
                and Ten Domains as though it was a terrifying earthquake. Upon the news, all were thoroughly dumbfounded
                and dismayed as their bodies were trembling.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their eyes, the Nine Great Mountains, Sky Deer City, and the Aether Abyss
                were the very shields of Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. Among them, the Nine Great Mountains was
                known to be the most extraordinary, mysterious and powerful. Yet, it was devastated without anyone
                noticing, and no living beings or cultivators were able to accept the news.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, many grew dejected as the invasion of the Upper Realm this time
                would be the most terrorising and aggressive yet, and it was most likely that Eight Wastelands and Ten
                Domains would soon be under siege. As the news caused a great turbulence across Eight Wastelands and Ten
                Domains, everyone was now frantic with anxiety.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, forces began making guesses and inferences in an attempt to
                recreate what happened back in the Nine Great Mountains. They were curious about how they were destroyed
                and how many formidable cultivators the Upper Realm sent for the invasion. Judging by the disturbances
                that quaked the sky and earth back then, the number of True Daoists involved in that war was definitely
                a massive one.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Boundary Marker Sea had yet to dry up. So, how the True Daoists
                of the Upper Realm managed to infiltrate the Nine Great Mountains became a mystery, Naturally, any
                investigations, without no doubt, were to no avail, given that the disturbances were dreadfully chaotic
                and they even disrupted the World Principles, leaving nothing to be discerned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the ringing of horns and the striking of drums thundered
                through the vast sky as Families and Sects of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains hurriedly dispatched
                their armies to the Aether Abyss, which was outside Sky Deer City, sending the elites of their
                respective forces to retaliate against those send by the Upper realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, the area of the war was remarkably wider than that of the last
                war, which took place at Boundary Marker Sea.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, it was the most dangerous and
                riskiest time of their lives as they acknowledged the severity of the situation. Since the Aether Abyss
                wouldn&#8217;t be able to fend of the Upper Realm Army, who would eventually find the correct path, the
                Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains had decided to bring the war to the Upper Realm Army and take down
                their leading forces before the Boundary Marker Sea completely dries up.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, opposite the hazardous Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the
                countless forces from the Upper Realm that were stationed by Boundary Marker Sea were shocked by the
                news regarding Nine Great Mountain&#8217;s destruction, but they were soon enlivened by
                that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and the Nine Great Mountains
                were equivalent to a beast and its claws, and now that the claw was removed from the beast, it was,
                naturally, good news for the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge and the Immortal Gu Family, who were responsible for
                the destruction of Nine Great Mountains, broke through the peak of glory that had never been achieved.
                Prior to that, no one had expected that Gu Changge would take the opportunity to lead the Immortal Gu
                Family to the Nine Great Mountains and take the charge to crush them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, the power of Nine Great Mountains was not to be taken
                lightly as hardly a handful of forces could rival them in terms of strength and number of True Daoists.
                Typically, the power of Immortal Forces was only a third of that of Nine Great Mountains. Yet, the
                Immortal Gu Family merely sent an army and was able to wipe out the Nine Great Mountains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, the disturbances caused were much more flabbergasting than that
                of Purple Mansion&#8217;s fall back then.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the might of the Immortal Gu Family remained ever so horrid.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, in this battle, forces could only estimate that the Immortal
                Gu Family must have sent a significant number of True Daoists. After all, from what they knew, Gu
                Changge alone wouldn&#8217;t be able to achieve a triumph of such magnitude. Although he was recognised
                to be a daunting man whose strength greatly exceeded that of his peers and was enough to drop the jaws
                of the older generation, there was no way he could have pulled this off alone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, the forces of the Upper Realm, who were informed of the news,
                sent even more of their men across the Boundary Marker Sea in preparation for an all-out invasion.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the opportunity, influential figures of the younger generation,
                including the Phoenix Lady, the King with Six Crowns, and the Successors of Mortal Palace, were also on
                their hurried way with their affiliated forces to attack the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, quite a number of incidents took place in the Upper Realm
                as countless unknown prodigies, including ancient monsters and the sealed descendants of Ancient
                Immortal Races, emerged in the world. Despite their glory and fame, they appeared rather dim compared to
                Gu Changge, as though they were born in the wrong era.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, at the peak of Endless Sea that neighboured the infinite
                Lower Realms, the demoness in red appeared, gathering gangs of demons from all over the world to
                establish a Devil Mountain. Their presence was extremely overbearing, leaving all in dread.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon Gu Changge&#8217;s words, Xi Yao and Lao Shi remained calm, as if they
                weren&#8217;t at all interested.</span><span id="more-27897"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although words regarding the incident six thousand years ago were widely
                spread as many different factions were all resentful about it, no one knew what exactly happened except
                for the powerful figures in Demon World. Thus, rumours and defamation towards Xi Yao were only evitable.
                To them, Gu Changge&#8217;s words weren&#8217;t unheard of.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, so what do you think about these rumours, Young Master
                Changge?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her glistening, crystalline eyes, Xi Yao looked at Gu Changge. Although
                she was currently only a Dharma Body, she managed to retain her noble, almighty qualities as the Empress
                of the Demon World, who none dared to disobey. Any other young prodigy would be panicked being stared at
                by her that way.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As I said, they are merely gibberish. That&#8217;s my opinion.&#8221;
                However, Gu Changge spoke with his subtle smile as usual, looking back at her without giving further
                explanation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean, Young Master Changge?&#8221; Xi Yao was somewhat
                taken aback.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puzzled, she recalled Gu Changge&#8217;s words. [Gibberish? If it was some
                common young prodigy saying those words, I&#8217;d be assuming that they are only trying to please me,
                but it&#8217;s a totally different story with those words coming out of Gu Changge&#8217;s mouth. He
                seems rather mysterious. Did he figure it out, or could he understand my frustrations?]</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truth be told, she couldn&#8217;t help but be enthralled by Gu
                Changge. If it were someone else going on about how great she was, she would have lost her patience
                before they were finished and might even slaughter them instead of questioning about it further.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the Great Elder and Lao Shi, interested, peered at Gu Changge.
                Xi Yao&#8217;s reputation was universally deplorable, which had already grown into common knowledge
                especially among the younger generation who had indubitably heard about the chaos in the Demon
                World.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, most of the rumours about Xi Yao claimed how despotic, ruthless,
                and savage she was. Agonised, the people of Demon World formed an alliance and aggressively rebelled
                against her, thereby raising individuals such as the Lord of Chaos who was said to be the unwavering
                executioner of Empress Xi Yao. And so, the rumours went on and on.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, with all three pairs of eyes on him, Gu Changge slightly
                smiled and serenely confessed, &#8220;To be honest, I was one of those who thought Empress Xi Yao was a
                despicable tyrant who caused excruciating disasters to those living in the Demon World.&#8221;</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was looking Xi Yao straight in the eyes, he caught a faint change in
                her expression, after which he smilingly continued, &#8220;However, after thinking about it, I realised
                that no matter how long a sect, a force, a country, or a continent had stood, one thing will never
                change.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Never change?&#8221; Staring at him, Xi Yao muttered as she was
                stunned. She was in dismay, wondering if Gu Changge&#8217;s opinion was the same as hers back
                then.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge then nodded. &#8220;Yes, one thing will never change. their
                awareness of how they would have to sacrifice something should they intend to change, and that is the
                unchangeable price.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Six thousand years ago, the Six Demon Overlords rose to power. Wars
                after wars, those were the true torment to the people, to the extent where exchanging their children for
                sustenance had become a norm. Since Demons aren&#8217;t the same as humans, prenatal development was
                pretty much non-existent in the regions ruled by those Overlords.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I recall correctly, in the Demon World, Demons of each region
                dictated by the Overlords spoke completely different languages. And in order to survive, cannibalism had
                also become a norm. With all sorts of adversities, it wasn&#8217;t difficult for Demon World to survive,
                but if they wished to thrive, they would be dreaming.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As the Six Demon Overlords persisted in the old ways, all they cared
                about was cultivating instead of making a change and taking care of their people. And as time went by,
                the entire Demon World inevitably deteriorated.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thankfully, after six thousand years of chaos, Demon World finally
                prospered. As all regions were united, there was nothing but harmony. Demons learned the same language,
                practising the ways humans do and so on. So, what are these if not the effort of Empress Xi
                Yao?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The world is foolish, focusing only on the flaws but not the
                contributions, and I think that is unfair to you, Empress.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        </p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge was speaking, his voice was consistently calm and steady all
                the way, giving off a sensation as though he was a dependent, reasonable man that was unbiasedly
                describing an idea.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The world is foolish… Master too mentioned this once…&#8221; Upon Gu
                Changge&#8217;s speech, Lao Shi was left dumbfounded and speechless as Gu Changge&#8217;s words were
                still echoing in his mind. He was a formidable expert with countless years of experience and he had
                provided remarkable assistance to Xi Yao amid the chaos of the Demon World.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, he was bewildered by Xi Yao&#8217;s actions, and despite years of
                contemplation, he could never understand her. And although Xi Yao frequently visited him, she never once
                discussed her motives, and that too baffled him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, all thanks to Gu Changge, he finally found the feeling of how his
                Master would enlighten him upon a bottleneck during his cultivation. It was a feeling of
                epiphany.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So that’s how it has been… I would never have guessed. How blind have
                I been?&#8221; At once, complex emotions gushed in Lao Shi&#8217;s eyes. No one other than Gu Changge
                could ever consider this conclusion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This young man&#8217;s thoughts are very different from that of
                ordinary men, but I reckon such an explanation hits very close to Xi Yao&#8217;s heart…&#8221; The Great
                Elder, too, seemed complicated, expressing his astonishment. Seeing how Xi Yao was absolutely stunned,
                as though she was finally understood, the Great Elder immediately knew Gu Changge spoke out her
                affliction.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Focusing only on the flaws but not the contributions, such is the
                foolish world…&#8221; After a long silence, Xi Yao suddenly revealed a smile towards Gu Changge as a
                different sensation surged in her eyes. In that instant, as though her sky was brightened up, hers
                wasn&#8217;t a courteous smile, but a genuine one.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Young Master Changge, are you criticising the world for its
                ignorance in my stead?&#8221; She gently smiled and affectionately continued, &#8220;All these years,
                I&#8217;ve never expected you to be the first person to understand me, and I&#8217;ve never expected
                anyone to have the same mind as me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, she felt as though looking at Gu Changge, a Junior by
                multiple millenniums, was like looking into the mirror. For more than six thousand years, he was the
                first to recognise her heartache. Deeply touched, she was in disbelief, as if she was living in a dream,
                as if her encounter with Gu Changge today was predestined.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even her closest subordinates couldn&#8217;t comprehend her actions and
                strategies. The people of the world perceived her as cruel, but they never once thought about the
                numberless contributions she made for the Demon World and the effort she put into restoring the
                boundaryless peace and prosperity in the Demon World today.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, after Gu Changge straightforwardly laid down the facts and
                cursed at the people of the world in her stead, Xi Yao could no longer bring herself to calm
                down.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaining his smile, Gu Changge continued, &#8220;Perhaps it was due to your
                position as Empress that none dared to misbehave. At the end of the day, your contributions aren&#8217;t
                invisible. However, the discussion of it comes about after the fact, without consideration of the
                situation at the time.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come after the fact?&#8221; Xi Yao was stunned once again. Peering at
                Gu Changge, she curiously asked, &#8220;Oh? What do you think then, Young Master Changge?&#8221;</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon asking the question, she immediately regretted it since opinions varied
                by different people. She could have asked someone else, her Master for instance, yet she decided to ask
                Gu Changge. After all, at their first encounter, it might be rude for her, as the Empress, to speak
                mindlessly and thereby stain her elegance. Nevertheless, for some reason, Gu Changge&#8217;s perception
                towards her suddenly meant a lot to her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, honestly, not just Xi Yao, but Lao Shi and the Great Elder was
                curious about how Gu Changge thought of her as well. Judging by his words, he should be able to
                understand Xi Yao&#8217;s intentions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, what do I think?&#8221; Gu Changge seemed rather taken aback, but
                instead of rejecting, he started to ponder.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, he turned over to the rest and gave a clear answer. &#8220;In my
                regard, Empress Xi Yao&#8217;s actions are legendary, and I believe Demon World perceives it that way
                too.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Legendary?] In that instant, Xi Yao, Lao Shi, and the Great Elder were all
                stupefied and shocked. &#8216;Legendary&#8217; was quite a notable praise, as they were aware that Gu
                Changge meant it figuratively rather than literally. Be it &#8216;legendary&#8217; or
                &#8216;prestigious,&#8217; those words meant a lot to Xi Yao.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Legendary…&#8221; Xi Yao muttered. The word thundered in her mind like
                the strike of a giant bell, leaving a petrifying ring in her head.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, she was no ordinary woman as she developed her mind to the
                perfect state along her six thousand years of cultivating. Therefore, she quickly regained her
                composure.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re flattering me, Young Master Changge.&#8221; Despite
                saying that, she carried a beaming smile, feigning her delight.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to that, she faced countless bootlickers who would gratify her with
                cringey compliments. Besides, she was aware that those compliments were only said out of fear, unlike Gu
                Changge who leisurely voiced his opinions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, he had no need to fear her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, you asked for it, Empress,&#8221; Gu Changge replied with a
                smile.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he was a Junior to her, he wasn&#8217;t exactly behaving like one.
                There wasn&#8217;t the slightest trace of dread on his face, as if he was already good friends with the
                Empress.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Xi Yao was used to ingratiating words, she wasn&#8217;t at all bothered
                by Gu Changge&#8217;s speaking mannerisms. Instead, she found a relaxing sensation from him, as if she
                was looking at her own reflection in the mirror.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Legendary, huh? To think that I hold such significance in your
                mind, what a surprise.&#8221; Xi Yao chuckled.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casually, Gu Changge replied, &#8220;To be frank, I always wanted to see a
                wondrous woman like you, Empress. But now that I have, I figure it&#8217;s not too late after
                all.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, if pleasing words could build fondness, Gu Changge, naturally,
                wouldn&#8217;t refuse to say them. Regardless of their positions, everyone loved hearing praises. As he
                possessed an extraordinary identity and an appropriate way of speech, all it took to move
                someone&#8217;s heart was a few compliments, and even the Empress herself wouldn&#8217;t be able to
                resist the sentiment.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, judging from Xi Yao&#8217;s luck, she must possess abundant
                Fortuity. Her actions six thousand years ago left him wondering whether her large amount of Fortuity,
                which made her a Fortuitous Lady, stemmed from her relationship with him. Regardless, he should be wary
                of any possible occurrence of the ‘killing-the-fiance’ cliches.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is it not late?&#8221; Xi Yao was dazed, peering at Gu Changge with an
                inexplicable expression. No matter what, he was merely a Junior of hers, and she was at least six
                thousand years older than him. Although age didn&#8217;t matter in the world of cultivation, she
                couldn&#8217;t help but feel disappointed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these years, she finally found someone who could understand her, only to
                discover he was a Junior. As such, she felt as though her destined other half was out of her time.
                Nevertheless, the feeling swiftly disappeared.</span></p>

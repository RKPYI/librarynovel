      <h4>
        Chapter 223-1: Master has the power to support you, That Immortal has
        come to Immortal Lun Sect (1)
      </h4>
      <p>Gu Changge's plan was actually very simple.</p>
      <p>
        Judging from the current situation, Yaoyao still trusted and relied on
        her Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Dao Fruit of that mysterious Peach Tree, the energy she possessed
        far exceeded her imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        And during this time, what happened to Yaoyao was just as Gu Changge had
        expected.
      </p>
      <p>She really couldn't cultivate.</p>
      <p>
        This made this little girl, who had always been obedient, depressed, and
        she even began to worry about gains and losses.
      </p>
      <p>"Master, did I disappoint you?"</p>
      <p>
        In an ancient city in the Heavenly Domain, Yaoyao looked at Gu Changge
        with a contemplative face, and said with guilt and anxiety on her small
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        So much so that the silver haired granny next to her started to feel
        uneasy, and she didn't even dare to take a breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, although she was in contact with Gu Changge,
        it was discovered that this Immortal was not as indifferent as rumors
        had suggested.
      </p>
      <p>But it was hard to hide how high he truly was.</p>
      <p>
        It was just that while facing Yaoyao he always showed a gentle
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the few things he discussed with her were all about things related
        to Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        It could be seen that this Immortal really valued ??and loved Yaoyao a
        lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had taught her many cultivation techniques, all kinds of divine
        medicines, precious elixirs, and a lot of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usuallys, countless cultivators and creatures were afraid of the Sacred
        Mountain and the forbidden area, which had changed in color, were like
        walking on the ground at the feet of this Immortal, and even invited
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Lords of the Divine Mountain and the Lords of the Restricted
        Areas, he asked for the precious bloodline to refine it specifically for
        Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of treatment made her envious, and she was even amazed, and
        found that he did all of this only to forge her body.
      </p>
      <p>It was really her cultivation that limited her vision.</p>
      <p>
        She even watched the scene of an Ancient Sacred Mountain, being
        destroyed by his servants with her own eyes because of their rebellion
        against this Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        That scene could be called shattering the heaven and earth, and that
        momentum shook the whole world. n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sacred Mountain that was standing tall, had an ancient existence,
        which would occasionally wake up, unleashing dark turmoil, powerful and
        terrifying to the point of indescribable.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, in front of this Immortal, he couldn't even resist, and was
        annihilated in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more she knew about the power of this Immortal, the more terrifying
        and unfathomable she felt!
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, the silver haired granny discovered a very bad thing, which
        made her worry secretly.
      </p>
      <p>It was Yaoyao's body‚Ä¶ There seemed to be a problem.</p>
      <p>No matter what kind of technique Mr. Immortal used, it was useless.</p>
      <p>
        He even personally killed an ancient being in the Sacred Realm,
        extracted his true soul, and refined the Realm Breaking Pill to help
        Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she still couldn't cultivate, and many resources went down, but
        there was no improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        One must know that during this period of time, Mr. Immortal put a lot of
        thought and effort into it, but in the end it was all in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
        To put it a bit harsher, at this time, even a pig could transform into a
        divine beast.
      </p>
      <p>But Yaoyao did not move at all.</p>
      <p>
        So this incident made Granny Yinhua uneasy, and she also felt that Mr.
        Immortal seemed to be in a bad mood, and she frowned and fell into
        contemplation.
      </p>

          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        In this world, there was no such thing as being nice to others for no
        reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, Mr. Immortal helped Yaoyao and accepted her as his
        apprentice because he valued her talent and thought that she was not
        simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now after so many days, the conclusion that he got was probably that
        he would be hit hard in the face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Yaoyao looked very extraordinary, it was a fact that she could
        not cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this huge gap, it was estimated that no one could fill it,
        especially Mr. Immortal, who had invested a lot of resources and hard
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Granny Yinhua was very worried, afraid that Mr. Immortal would be
        angry because of this, and feel that he had been deceived.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was very sensible, and she also knew that she had let her Master
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        So many good things were used on her, but she still couldn't cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>This made her uneasy, and her little hands were pinching her dress.</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, she was accustomed to the Master teaching
        her to cultivate, and caring for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        If her master abandoned her because of this matter, although she would
        be very sad, she would not blame her Master for this.
      </p>
      <p>She would only blame myself for being so useless.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge seemed to have recovered from his thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked at Yaoyao with an uneasy face in front of her, as if he didn't
        know, and smiled, "What did Yaoyao do to disappoint the teacher?"
      </p>
      <p>Of course he knew what Yaoyao and Granny Yinhua were thinking.</p>
      <p>It was that Yaoyao couldn't cultivate.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, he had already expected it, and it was not surprising at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he still had to show a heavy, somewhat sad look on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, no matter how you look at it, one would feel that this Master
        was too fake.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't even care that his disciple couldn't cultivate.</p>
      <p>
        And at this time, in Gu Changge's view, it was also a crucial moment for
        Yaoyao to completely trust him as a master.
      </p>
      <p><i>Isn't it because you couldn't cultivate?</i></p>
      <p>
        <i
          >It doesn't matter, your Master is rich and powerful, so he can
          support you.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, Yaoyao is a waste. You wasted so much of your resources and
        time, and I still can't cultivate. You must be disappointed."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's question, Yaoyao lowered her head and said in a
        very low voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        With guilt and anxiety, she didn't even dare to look into Gu Changge's
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the beginning of being happy, thinking that she was really a
        peerless genius, to discovering that she couldn't cultivate, and was
        completely useless, a complete drag.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Lun Sect‚Äôs cultivator who took her brother away was right.
      </p>
      <p>This cliff-like transformation process made Yaoyao feel very sad.</p>
      <p>"That's it?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge looked a little stunned, then he laughed and
        said, "So you are worried about this? Even if you can't cultivate now,
        you are still your Master's disciple."
      </p>
      <p>"How can you worry about these things at such a young age?"</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"Yaoyao, have you forgotten what the teacher told you before?"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was stunned for a moment, and her small face, which was
        originally full of worry, suddenly appeared deeply moved.
      </p>
      <p>This answer was completely out of her expectations.</p>
      <p>She thought she would be abandoned by Gu Changge because of this.</p>
      <p>"Master‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        "Master told me before‚Ä¶ Said that sometimes, a master is a person who is
        more intimate than relatives."
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, she had always remembered this sentence, and felt very touched
        at that time.
      </p>
      <p>"Little girl, just remember and don't think so much."</p>
      <p>
        "Even if you can't cultivate, your teacher can support you for the rest
        of your life, just think of it as a few little followers."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled gently, and reached out to squeeze Yaoyao's nose.</p>
      <p>
        "Master, you are so kind to me." Yaoyao's nose suddenly turned sour when
        she heard the words.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Silly girl, meeting is fate. Since I accept you as a disciple, it is my
        fate as a Master. You don't have to blame yourself. Cultivation is
        actually very troublesome‚Ä¶" Gu Changge smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since you can't cultivate, you can save the teacher from worrying about
        yourself. After all, teaching people is a very troublesome thing."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Mmmm. Yaoyao knows, so you don't need to worry about it in the future."
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was very moved in her heart and nodded, looking very
        well-behaved.
      </p>
      <p>
        She knew that Gu Changge's words were actually only to comfort her.
        After the Master accepted the disciple, the disciple couldn't cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was obviously something the Master said in order to prevent her
        from blaming herself and worrying about it.
      </p>
      <p><i>Master is so kind to me!</i></p>
      <p>
        At this moment, in Yaoyao's heart, Gu Changge's status was no different
        from that of her brother and grandma.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Very good, it seems that I was wrong to blame Mr. Immortal!" Seeing
        this scene, the silver haired granny also sighed with relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's words surprised her, but she also understood the character
        of this immortal.
      </p>
      <p>Yaoyao worshiped him as her teacher, it was really her blessing!</p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, why don't you come with me to the Upper Realm with the teacher
        now? This time I came to the Lower Realm, I have paid back my favor, and
        by the way, I will accept you as a disciple. After calculating the time,
        it is time to go back."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge suddenly opened his mouth with a smile and
        mentioned the matter of returning to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        He intended to deal with the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, but at
        this time, he must not show any abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he had to be a little more euphemistic and let Yaoyao take
        the initiative to ask him about her brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a master, for the sake of her safety, in desperation, he would
        accompany her.
      </p>
      <p>Wasn't this a logical thing to do?</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, when Granny Yinhua heard these words, she suddenly
        looked shocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Return to the Upper Realm? If Yaoyao was taken to the upper realm.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Then Yaoyao will be able to access that mysterious and vast world,
          and maybe she will be able to unravel the secrets hidden in her
          body.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >After all‚Ä¶ Upper Realm, that's where legends say that there are
          Immortals, and even beyond Immortals.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Granny Yinhua herself, she actually didn't have much thoughts
        about the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mainly for Yaoyao's sake, she hoped that she could go to the Upper Realm
        with Mr. Immortal.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 223-2: Master has the power to support you, That Immortal has
        come to Immortal Lun Sect (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        <i
          >Well, this girl probably misses her brother a lot, so she doesn't
          want to leave this place like this.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>She sighed in her heart, vaguely knowing what Yaoyao was thinking.</p>
      <p>"Master, are we going to leave this world now?"</p>
      <p>Yaoyao looked at Gu Changge. V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî</p>
      <p>
        Her thoughts were actually just as the silver haired granny had guessed.
      </p>
      <p>Her little face was very confused.</p>
      <p>On one side was her Master.</p>
      <p>On one side was her brother.</p>
      <p>
        A year ago, her brother was taken to the Immortal Lun Sect for
        cultivation, and now there was no news. Some time ago, the Northern
        Mountain Village where she was located was attacked by bandits.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no sudden arrival of the Master to rescue them, she and her
        grandma might not be able to survive, and they would have died at the
        hands of the bandits.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, she had always hoped that her brother would come to rescue
        her and her grandma, but he did not come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao felt that he should be cultivating in Immortal Lun Sect, but
        something happened, so he couldn't escape, and he couldn't return to the
        village to visit her and grandma.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, there was an incomparably powerful Master behind her, and her
        identity was not the same as before.
      </p>
      <p>
        She could go to Immortal Lun Sect and take the initiative to visit her
        brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he was in a bad situation in the Immortal Lun Sect, he could help
        her.
      </p>
      <p>Yaoyao had a good heart and was very sensible.</p>
      <p>"Is there anything else, Yaoyao?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge was stunned for a moment, then seemed to think
        of something, and asked with a smile, "Tell me, I can take you back to
        the Upper Realm after your matter is resolved."
      </p>
      <p>"Master, I want to go see my brother." Yaoyao replied.</p>
      <p>"Oh? Your brother?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge was slightly stunned, as if trying to recall.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao also knew that in the eyes of her Master, her brother was
        probably nothing, as insignificant as dust and impossible to be
        remembered.
      </p>
      <p>"Since it's your brother, then we can go to see him."</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Gu Changge seemed to remember and said with a smile.</p>
      <p>And agreed to her request.</p>
      <p>"Thank you, Master." Yaoyao's face was filled with joy.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Gu Changge smiled and touched her head, but said nothing.
      </p>
      <p>He was just waiting to say this.</p>
      <p>
        "That brother of yours has been practicing in the Sect for more than a
        year, and he didn't go back to see you? As a cultivator, he can't
        protect his family‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge shook his head slightly, as if he was not
        very optimistic about Yaoyao's elder brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was almost impossible to directly say that your brother was not a
        good person and abandoned his relatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        If ordinary people said that about her brother, Yaoyao would definitely
        refute it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this person was her Master, and what he said was very reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>She was also a little underwhelmed for a while.</p>
      <p>"Brother must have his own hardships‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge said nothing more.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Yue Mingkong, who was struggling to find the
        reincarnation of the Human Ancestor in other Domains, also brought
        people to Heavenly Domain at this time.
      </p>
      <p>"That Immortal also came here? And with a little girl?"</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>Yue Mingkong frowned.</p>
      <p>Hearing this news, her first reaction was to feel strange.</p>
      <p>
        At that time, she thought that the Immortal would leave the Heavenly
        Star Realm and return to the Upper Realm after resolving the matter in
        the Xuan Domain.
      </p>
      <p>But he didn't.</p>
      <p>He even came to the Heavenly Domain.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the matter of recruiting disciples in the Xuan Domain‚Äôs Taixu
        Sect seemed more like a matter of accepting disciples to her, as if he
        was looking for someone.
      </p>
      <p>After no one was found in the rest of the domains.</p>
      <p>This Immortal came to the Heavenly Domain.</p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that he actually came to find the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor? Or is it someone from the Human Ancestor Hall?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Various thoughts flashed in Yue Mingkong's heart, and there was some
        faint worry and unease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the most critical moment, she actually didn't want to reveal her
        origin of the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>"I have to find a way to find out who that Immortal is."</p>
      <p>On Yue Mingkong's beautiful immortal face, her eyes were very deep.</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, her cultivation base had been upgraded to
        the late stage of the God King Realm, which was not much worse than the
        Quasi-Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Empress, there doesn't seem to be anything unusual about that little
        girl. She came from a place called Northern Mountain Village. She was
        attacked by bandits at the time, and was rescued by the Immortal who was
        passing by‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong's brows furrowed even tighter when the confidant behind him
        reported it.
      </p>
      <p>Things were beyond her control.</p>
      <p>
        "If I can't find the reincarnation, then I have to go and cut off his
        Nirvana Green Lotus‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, Yue Mingkong had already narrowed down the
        area where the Nirvana Green Lotus was about to appear, and finally
        settled on a certain peak!
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor rushed there, she must
        snatch that Nirvana Green Lotus!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Without the Nirvana Green Lotus body, there will be problems when the
        Human Ancestor returns to this one, and he will not be able to last
        long‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that the Human Ancestor has already made a plan. He even
        expected the birth of the Nirvana Green Lotus in this world, so he
        appeared here."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If there is no accident, Changge should be calculating a new candidate
        to take the blame. All of the people on the list I left him are very
        suitable targets."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of Gu Changge who was in the Upper Realm now, a softness
        appeared in Yue Mingkong's eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for Gu Changge, she wouldn't take such a big risk and rush
        to this world to stop the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Changge shouldn't know everything I've done for him now. If he knew,
        would he trust me a little more‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong sighed faintly, and then began to take command.</p>
      <p>
        A large number of power houses headed towards the Heavenly Peak she had
        identified.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        Immortal Lun Sect, as the most mysterious and powerful force in the
        Heavenly Star Realm, had been standing for the longest time, even after
        a million years, it still did not fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Heavenly Domain, there had never been a force like the Immortal Lun
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it was also related to its patriarch who was a Supreme being.
      </p>
      <p>
        But no matter who it was, when they came to the foot of Immortal Lun
        Sacred Mountain, they had to be respectful, and they did not dare to
        show any lack of reverence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, the center of the Immortal Lun Sect was magnificent and majestic.
      </p>
      <p>Inside a splendid palace.</p>
      <p>
        Holy Master Xian Lun was pacing with his hands on his back, his eyes
        opened and closed, and the light appeared, and there was a wisp of
        divine light, which seemed like he was concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below him stood many powerful inner sect elders, as well as the saintess
        of the Xianlun Sect and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Reporting to the Holy Master, what I saw that day is indeed the case.
        Below many altars, there are ominous auras rushing out, and even black
        blood rises into the sky, and the surrounding mountains make loud
        noises, like dragons roaring in pain‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"At that time, it was said that when the dragon vein was dug up‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        A creature that looked like a blue ghost was reporting in the hall,
        talking about things.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the Green Ghost who was also responsible for casting the Immortal
        road for the Immortal Lun Sect in the Flying Immortal Mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he was talking about the events of the day with a heart
        palpitating expression on his face.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        During this time, Holy Master Xian Lun was in retreat and did not know
        about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was only today that all the elders were summoned to inquire about
        this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        "All the elders saw the scene like this. It seems that something
        unexpected happened at that time, and something ominous was dug up. The
        act of cutting the sky was already dangerous, and the good road to
        immortality broke like this?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Holy Master Xian Lun frowned and said, his figure looked stalwart,
        vague, and his cultivation realm was extremely high.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was unknown how much stronger he was as compared to the Holy Master
        of the other sects.
      </p>
      <p>And he was a man of great talent.</p>
      <p>It was also his plan to create the Road to Immortality.</p>
      <p>
        Some time ago, there was an accident in the Flying Immortal Mountains,
        the altar collapsed, many slaves suddenly died overnight, and even black
        blood was dug out of the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a radius of ten thousand miles, a group of beasts crouched down,
        making a panicked sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a change shocked the entire Immortal Lun Sect, so everyone was
        called for a meeting, and the matter of forging an Immortal Road was put
        down first.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry about it beforehand. After finding out the truth, you can
        decide. It was a disciple who had a vision in his body and alarmed the
        patriarch. Is it true or false?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Holy Master Xian Lun opened his mouth and asked about
        another thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Green Ghost was a little puzzled, but he said
        respectfully,
      </p>
      <p>"Reporting to the Holy Master, this is absolutely true."</p>
      <p>
        "At that time, all the slaves died suddenly, and only one disciple
        survived and was safe, so the subordinates felt that there should be
        something special about him."
      </p>
      <p>"So I brought it back to the Holy Land."</p>
      <p>
        "I never thought that he suddenly triggered a vision, and the Immortal
        light reflected in the sky, causing the shadow of the patriarch to
        appear, shocking all the disciples and elders. Even many very old
        existences appeared, and they personally investigated."
      </p>
      <p>"The curse seems to have been removed from that guy's body‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        The disciple he was talking about was Jiang Yang who had the Desolate
        Holy Body.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he brought him back to the Sect from a small village, he was very
        disappointed when he found out that there was something wrong with his
        physique, and he threw him to the Flying Immortal Mountains as a slave.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the end, he didn't expect that by chance, when he returned to the
        Immortal Lun sect and he was valued by many old antiques.
      </p>
      <p>This made Green Ghost feel a little embarrassed.</p>
      <p>
        It could only be said that that guy had a really big life and was really
        lucky?
      </p>
      <p>"Is it a blessing in disguise?"</p>
      <p>
        Holy Master Xian Lun frowned and felt incredible, how could the curse of
        the Desolate Holy Body be so easy to solve? Did it really collide with
        the ominous aura and thus eliminate it?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Impossible, the patriarch is the Supreme being, overlooking all life
        and death, a Desolate Holy Body, in my prime, it could grow up to be
        comparable to the Great Sacred at most. How could it be possible to
        arouse the shadow of the patriarch? This child is definitely not
        simple!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Maybe it will be the hope of flying into an Immortal in my immortal Lun
        Sect!"
      </p>
      <p>Holy Master Xian Lun suddenly showed excitement in his expression.</p>
      <p>
        The elders and others below had different expressions when they heard
        the words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the status of that disciple named Jiang Yang was not the same, and
        it had long been precious, in the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Saint Son, Saint Daughter, and others were a little weak in
        front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several ancient beings in the Sects had personally thought that their
        status would inevitably rise, and these elders were only in the
        Quasi-Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>They couldn't compare at all!</p>
      <p>
        Especially now that even the Holy Master Xian Lun was very optimistic
        about him.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at this moment, a disciple suddenly rushed over with shock and
        excitement outside the hall.
      </p>
      <p>His voice was trembling and stuttering.</p>
      <p>He was obviously trembling to the extreme.</p>
      <p>
        "Report to the Holy Master, on the mountain gate‚Ä¶ Outside, the Immortal
        is here!"
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In an instant, the entire hall of Immortal Lun Sect turned silent and
        one could even hear a needle falling!
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone's expressions were stunned for a while, apparently not
        responding yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, everyone's expressions, including Holy Master Xian
        Lun, changed drastically.
      </p>
      <p>"Immortal?"</p>
      <p>
        "Could it be‚Ä¶ Could it be the Immortal from the Upper Realm who
        destroyed the False God Mountain with one palm?"

      <h4>
        Chapter 243-1: Gu Xianers inexplicable jealousy, She is the younger
        sister, okay? (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        In the inner part of the Upper Realm, the realm where the Ancient
        Immortal Gu family was located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge took Yaoyao away from the Heavenly Star Realm, breaking
        through many realms along the way as he finally brought her to his
        mountain gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        What she saw along the way made Yaoyao widen her eyes in shock, seeing
        many sights that she had never seen or heard of before.
      </p>
      <p>The universe was vast and extraordinary.</p>
      <p>
        Especially after experiencing the sight of being picked up from the
        temple, traveling through the universe and the chaotic world.
      </p>
      <p>This could no longer be explained as a miracle.</p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for Gu Changge's patience in explaining it to her, she
        probably wouldn't have figured out that there was such a Divine weapon
        in this world, with which she could traverse the world at will.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Star Realm was located in an extremely remote location. It
        was countless billions of miles away from the prosperous area that Gu
        Changge mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she finally understood why there were so many
        cultivators trying their best to ascend to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period, Gu Changge also told her a lot about the Upper
        Realm, so as not to be unfamiliar after coming here, she would feel
        uneasy.
      </p>
      <p>"Master, will you be very busy after returning to the Upper Realm?"</p>
      <p>Yaoyao asked in a low voice. FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm</p>
      <p>
        Through this period of understanding, Yaoyao also understood Gu
        Changge's identity, in the entire Upper Realm, was also indescribably
        precious.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had to deal with a lot of things every day, and it was impossible to
        be the same as in the Lower Realm, and he couldn‚Äôt accompany her all the
        time.
      </p>
      <p>She could still clearly distinguish the other side of these things.</p>
      <p>"it does not matter."</p>
      <p>
        "Master won't be very busy. You are special. It is during this time that
        we can use someone to check it out. Maybe we can find out some clues."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge smiled slightly and naturally knew what Yaoyao
        was worried about.
      </p>
      <p>Although she was young, she knew things far beyond her peers.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge even felt that even Gu Xian'er was not as sensible as her.
      </p>
      <p>
        After receiving Gu Changge's answer, Yaoyao couldn't help but smile.
      </p>
      <p>And soon, Gu Changge took her all the way back to Gu family house.</p>
      <p>Seeing Gu Changge quickly disappear with a little girl.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        The clansmen patrolling at the mountain gate couldn't help but stare at
        each other, and were confused.
      </p>
      <p>"When did the young master leave the mountain gate?"</p>
      <p>"I don‚Äôt know."</p>
      <p>"Why did he bring a little girl back this time?"</p>
      <p>
        "What kind of identity this little girl has? She deserves to be treated
        like this by the young master?"
      </p>
      <p>
        They were surprised that Gu Changge was in seclusion during this period,
        but it was obvious that he was not.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at some point, he had quietly left and went somewhere else. As
        servants, they didn't dare to ask, they were just curious.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, many Gu family members noticed that Gu Changge, who claimed to
        be in seclusion, appeared with a little girl by his side.
      </p>
      <p>This surprised many people.</p>
      <p>
        There were various speculations about the identity of the little girl,
        but no one dared to say that she was Gu Changge's daughter.
      </p>
      <p>Was it a little maid he hired?</p>
      <p>
        As for her being a disciple, no one thought about that. How old was Gu
        Changge?
      </p>
      <p>How could he possibly accept disciples?</p>
      <p>Gu Changge was not surprised by the thoughts of the clansmen.</p>
      <p>
        After all, it was not like when he left last time, hiding it from
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time he entered directly from the mountain gate, which naturally
        attracted attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also didn't want to go back quietly and let Yaoyao misunderstand
        something, thinking that he was afraid that the clansmen would notice
        her existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The little girl's mind was likely to be cranky for a long time because
        of this little detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge took her back to the island where he lived and then
        ordered the maid to arrange for Yaoyao's daily life.
      </p>
      <p>After all, it was impossible to let this little girl live with him.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was also very well-behaved and followed the beautiful big sister
        in front of her to the place where she would usually live.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she came to the mountain gate where the Ancient Immortal Gu family
        was located, she was too surprised to see the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time, she found that there could still exist such a power.
        It was just like a big world being opened up by itself.
      </p>
      <p>The the vastness of the weather.</p>
      <p>"Sister‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        But then, Yaoyao's first sentence made the maid in front of her turn
        pale with fright and she almost fell to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Little Ancestor, don't call me that, if others hear me, I'll be
        miserable. You can just call me by using my name‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>The maid's face was pale, and she couldn't help trembling slightly.</p>
      <p>
        She could see that Yaoyao's identity was not simple, and Gu Changge's
        attitude towards her was very gentle, not like the indifferent, aloof
        young master who looked down on everything at all.
      </p>
      <p>As a maid, she still understood Gu Changge's temperament.</p>
      <p>It was because of this that she felt uneasy and afraid.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao called her like that, in the Ancient Immortal Gu family where the
        rules and regulations were extremely strict, if someone noticed it, she
        would inevitably be punished.
      </p>
      <p>"Sorry‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yaoyao quickly understood the meaning and felt a little
        guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it could be seen from this that her Master had such terrifying
        power in the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably, his every word and deed had great majesty, and his mere name
        could scare people like this.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, she admired Gu Changge even more.</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, after returning to the palace, Gu Changge summoned
        his confidant, Ah Da, and asked him to report all the things that
        happened in the Upper Realm during this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "During this period, there were signs of the Ancient beings finding
        signs of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction, and they were very disturbed.
        Therefore, various Ancient Clans and Dao heritages have negotiated and
        planned to jointly establish the True Immortal Academy to start the
        Immortal Project."
      </p>
      <p>
        "In hope that someone in this life can become Immortal and prevent the
        coming of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "In addition, during this time, many Ancient Monsters and Ancient Kings
        were born, and the golden age kicked off‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "The descendants of Emperor Ying of Heavenly Emperor Mountain have not
        left Heavenly Emperor Mountain during this period because of the
        suspicion of the inheritor of the demonic art. Another descendant of the
        Human Ancestor Hall is also walking around, trying to find the
        reincarnation of the Human Ancestor‚Ä¶ ."
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Ah Da respectfully reported what had happened during this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't care much after listening to it, everything was still
        under his control.
      </p>
      <p>After all, he claimed to be secluded from the outside world.</p>
      <p>
        So during this time, Gu Changge disappeared, and there was not much
        about news him.
      </p>
      <p>
        And without him doing things, Ying Shuang, who was detained as the
        inheritor of demonic arts, did not dare to show up at will.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the Ancient freaks and the sealed Young Kings were not
        stupid, and they would not make moves to provoke him at such a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for the appearance of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction, which was
        a little unexpected by Gu Changge, everything was still developing in
        the direction he wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        "By the way, young master, some time ago, the Heavenly Emperor's
        daughter from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain came to visit you, but she
        waited outside the mountain gate for a long time, and finally left
        angrily."
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Ah Da spoke again, reporting an incident of the time when Gu
        Changge had just left the Ancient Immortal Gu family.
      </p>
      <p>After all, the Ancient Princess was named to visit Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge was not there at the time, and without his order, who
        would dare to pay attention to the Ancient Princess, who knew what her
        purpose was at that time?
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 243-2: Gu Xianers inexplicable jealousy, She is the younger
        sister, okay? (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        So in the end, no one paid attention to her. The Ancient Princess could
        only leave with anger.
      </p>
      <p>"It seems that she is Ying Shuang's sister?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was a little interested, and he still had a good idea of
        ??the personal connections behind Ying Shuang, the current backer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang's younger sister Ying Yu, as far as he knew, could be
        regarded as a young Supreme with terrifying talent. From the perspective
        of strength, it should not be a problem to crush many current young
        Supremes today.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the bloodline of the Heavenly Emperor had been sealed up to
        this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        So after hearing that she left, Gu Changge still felt a little
        regretful. Because he planned to start with Ying Yu first.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that since he had to go to Heavenly Star Realm, the time was
        conflicted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, to let Ying Shuang, the original horse feeder, show his
        feet, he had to make some arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't expect the hat of the inheritor of the demonic arts to
        be kept on his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the calculation at that time was very shallow, and it could
        be solved with a few tricks and tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
        He felt that Ying Yu came to find him, and nine times out of ten, it was
        for this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he opened his mouth, the possibility of Ying Shuang clearing the
        suspect of the inheritor of demonic arts was much higher.
      </p>
      <p>"Aren't you afraid that the more I wash it, the darker it gets?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge couldn't help but let out a sneer, looking very unconcerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Human Ancestor had disappeared now, it did not mean that
        his identity was not at risk of exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because in addition to the Human Ancestor Hall, there were many Ancient
        beings, and they were very secretive and understood the inheritor of
        demonic arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, a young Supreme like Jiang Chuchu with some kind of special
        talent might also be able to perceive his true identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Gu Changge must use up the value of Ying Shuang, and then
        continue to find a third scapegoat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he waved his hand to let Ah Da go back, and began to think about
        what to do next.
      </p>
      <p>He also thought about getting rid of Ying Shuang, the Son of Luck.</p>
      <p>
        After all, there was always a general trend that would give him some
        bells and whistles as leeks.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge didn't know what to say about this.</p>
      <p>"But before that, let's improve the strength first and then‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Gu Changge sorted out and digested the many gains from this
        trip to the Lower Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Massive Luck Points and Destiny Value were one aspect, in addition to
        harvesting one disciple, Yaoyao. CHùíÜCk for ùíèew stùíêries on

        The many Divine objects dropped by the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor were counted separately, and the second was that Nirvana Green
        Lotus raised his physical body to an extremely terrifying level.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now my cultivation has reached the Sacred Realm, but the physical
        strength is estimated to be close to the level of the Great Sacred, and
        so is the soul‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge estimated his exact strength.</p>
      <p>
        Because cultivation did not represent true combat power, he also had
        many magical tools and other means.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was to say, even if he encountered a Quasi-Supreme existence, he
        had a way to counter it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, this kind of Quasi-Supreme existence referred to the kind
        that had just entered the realm of Quasi-Supreme, at the first or second
        level.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the superficial realm of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Codex, Gu
        Changge also maintained the Quasi-Sacred Realm cultivation, which was
        not too high and outrageous, within a range that everyone could accept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, on the surface of his cultivation, he could adjust his life aura
        at any time, and he was not afraid of being seen as out of the ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, Gu Changge continued to exchange ten detachment bones with
        Luck points.
      </p>
      <p>
        A familiar, mysterious, and clear aura circulated in his limbs and
        bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately after that, the bones, which were already exceptionally
        dazzling, spewed out the rays of light, the divine light of auspicious
        colors, accompanied by bursts of sound.
      </p>
      <p>A mysterious feeling that was unclear, diffused in the bones.</p>
      <p>This was the meaning of detachment.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt that he had a much deeper understanding of the rules and
        Dao of the various Divine powers he had learned.
      </p>
      <p>The cultivators of the same realm couldn't keep up with him.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, on another majestic and magnificent divine island in
        the Ancient Immortal Gu family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er, who was wearing a long dress with wide sleeves, was
        recovering from her cultivation and slowly exhaled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between her mouth and nose, strands of immortal aura breathed out,
        slowly infiltrating her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the heavens and the earth, the power of the Supreme Laws turned
        into countless rays of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        As she breathed, it constantly integrated into her body, making her look
        like a fairy and mysterious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless Dao rhyme and inspirations also came madly from the four
        surroundings, and were swallowed up by her every breath.
      </p>
      <p>A piece of immortal crystal bone was exuding brilliance.</p>
      <p>
        The surface was full of various complicated laws, and the shape of the
        Dao was firmly imprinted on it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, her cultivation changed suddenly, breaking through
        to the middle stage of the True God Realm, and she had already surpassed
        many young Supreme beings older than her.

        "Xian'er's strength has broken through again. How long has it been since
        her last breakthrough?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm afraid it won't be long before she can catch up with Changge. This
        girl has suffered, and she is more diligent than the rest of the
        disciples."
      </p>
      <p>
        Several Clan Elders nearby smiled reassuringly, after seeing this scene,
        and said, praising Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Gu Changge said that he was in seclusion, but in fact
        he disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er went to look for the return of her parents, and found that
        they had nothing to do, but they couldn't come back in a short time.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she stayed with her parents for a while before returning to the clan
        and began to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's good intentions were discovered by her.</p>
      <p>
        After all, she had heard a lot of things from her parents, and she knew
        that people had been looking for them all along.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under her scrutiny, she found that those people were actually related to
        Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as she returned to the clan, she heard news from her parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these coincidences could only mean that Gu Changge specially
        prepared and arranged for her.
      </p>
      <p>But Gu Changge didn't plan to tell her this.</p>
      <p>
        This made Gu Xian'er both angry and moved. Gu Changge was stubborn, but
        in fact, he thought about others more than anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>But he just didn't tell anyone, he chose to endure it himself.</p>
      <p>
        That was why he would use this to spur herself and make herself
        cultivate hard, just because he was worried that he would kill her when
        it would be difficult for him to suppress his demonic nature in the
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        All kinds of painstaking efforts made Gu Xian'er not know what to say
        about Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        About her concern, Gu Changge was dismissive and refused to pull down
        his aloof face.
      </p>
      <p>This was what that made Gu Xian'er the most angry.</p>
      <p>
        At the Nirvana Pond, it was difficult for Gu Changge to suppress his
        demonic nature, and many things that happened still appeared in her mind
        from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er discovered the difficulty that Gu Changge had been hiding all
        the time, and her heart actually had mixed emotions.
      </p>
      <p>Feeling distressed and guilty for Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        That was why Gu Xian'er decided to live up to Gu Changge's expectations
        and cultivate hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, during this period of time, she was also trying to find a
        way to consult various ancient books to see if she could solve the
        demonic nature for Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Xian'er finished her cultivation and was about to get
        up.
      </p>
      <p>
        A maid suddenly came and ran quietly to her ear, reporting the matter
        with a very cautious expression.
      </p>
      <p>"What?!"</p>
      <p>"After Gu Changge disappeared, he brought back a little girl?"</p>
      <p>
        As soon as Gu Xian'er heard these words, she suddenly showed surprise on
        her beautiful face, and she felt a little uncomfortable in her heart for
        no reason.
      </p>
      <p>Even these words had a fit of inexplicable jealousy.</p>
      <p>She was Gu Changge's sister, okay?</p>

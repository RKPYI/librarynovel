          >In the dark and damp dungeon, Jiang Chen gritted his teeth and
          clenched his fists so tightly that the sound of his knuckles cracking
          could be heard. His heart burned with fury as he glared at Gu Changge.
          “You shouldn’t push people to their limits like this! I will not allow
          you to use Chuyue as leverage against me! I won’t even consider your
          proposition. If you want to end my life, then do it. I’m not afraid of
          death.”</span

          >Jiang Chen wanted to shred Gu Changge to pieces when he heard Gu
          Changge’s cruel and mocking words toward Ji Chuyue, who had been
          reduced to a mere commodity by Gu Changge’s callous tongue. His anger
          was further fueled by Ji Yaoxing’s indifference. It broke his heart to
          see him turn a blind eye to his own sister’s plight.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Is that so? It seems like you really have no feelings for Ji
          Chuyue.” Gu Changge smiled as his gaze moved further downward from Ji
          Chuyue’s face. In that moment, Ji Chuyue felt utterly exposed and
          vulnerable, as if she was being stripped naked. A chill ran through
          her body, causing her to shiver involuntarily.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“This is between you and me! What do you gain from taking advantage
          of her?” Jiang Chen’s voice grew louder as he watched Ji Chuyue’s
          frightened expression and trembling body. His heart ached at the sight
          of this kind woman being toyed by Gu Changge.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You have a decision to make. If your heart truly yearns for Ji
          Chuyue, then it would be wise for you to take my words into
          consideration.” Gu Changge reached out and lifted Ji Chuyue’s chin,
          forcing her to meet his gaze.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Young Master Gu…” Ji Chuyue felt a deep sense of humiliation. Tears
          welled up in her eyes, but she knew better than to resist or even
          entertain such thoughts. It was as Gu Changge had said, she truly
          wanted to refuse being reduced to a mere pawn to the Ji Family. She
          did not want to play this game of marriage, even if it meant refusing
          to become Gu Changge’s concubine.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite her inner turmoil, Ji Chuyue couldn’t help but remember Ji
          Yaoxing’s words from a few days ago. Decision had already been made
          for her the moment she was born, and she had no control over it. With
          Gu Changge’s immense power, even the Ji Family trembled in fear, let
          alone a powerless girl like herself.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Rest assured, I shall spare his life for the time being. I sense
          that you do not wish to become my concubine, and I will not coerce
          anyone to act against their wishes. It would be best for you to relay
          your feelings to this man yourself…” Gu Changge maintained his smile
          as he gracefully released Ji Chuyue.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing these words, Ji Chuyue’s face remained ashen. She
          quickly shook her head and said, “No, it is a blessing for Chuyue to
          become Young Master Gu’s concubine. How could I ever be
          unwilling?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge’s eyes remained as still as a lake as a gentle smile
          graced his lips. “Your words contradict your true feelings. Your eyes
          have already betrayed you. As a lady of such breathtaking beauty, your
          gaze is an honest reflection of your heart.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Young Master Gu, I speak with honesty. My words stem from the depths
          of my heart, and each one is nothing but the truth. This esteemed
          status is coveted by numerous prodigal damsels in the Upper Realm, and
          I feel nothing but immense gratitude for being chosen. To think that I
          would ever be unwilling is preposterous. I’m overjoyed beyond
          measure!” Ji Chuyue hurriedly shook her head and clarified, not
          wanting to further offend Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She knew her own family too well. Even if Jiang Chen were able to
          rescue their Prime Ancestor, they would never agree to her marriage
          with him. At best, they would select another woman from their lineage
          for him to wed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Being chosen to become Gu Changge’s concubine was a rare blessing,
          far surpassing the prospect of marrying other well-matched young
          prodigies. It was an opportunity that countless could only dream of
          and envy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Gu Changge, you despicable man! Stop forcing Chuyue! Let me
          have one night to contemplate your proposal, and I will provide you
          with an answer tomorrow morning,” Jiang Chen interrupted Ji Chuyue as
          he heard her insincere words. His eyes burned with fury as he turned
          to Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He had no idea why Gu Changge was going to such great lengths to save
          the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family, but he knew that he had no other
          choice at the moment. If he refused, he could be killed by Gu Changge,
          or spend the rest of his remaining life in this dungeon. Besides, he
          couldn’t bear to watch Ji Chuyue suffer either.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“It appears that there may have been a misunderstanding. You are
          lending your assistance to the Ji Family, not me. As you may be aware,
          rescuing the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family could potentially lead to
          you becoming a son-in-law of their esteemed family, which would also
          benefit you.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge smiled. With a wave of his hand, he dismissed everyone,
          choosing not to continue harassing Jiang Chen. He had already
          accomplished his objective and was certain that Jiang Chen would agree
          to his proposal the next morning. Did Jiang Chen truly believe he
          could survive the perilous expedition to Kun Mountain? Such naivety
          was almost endearing.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After Gu Changge, Ji Chuyue, and Ji Yaoxing left, a chilling silence
          returned to the dungeon. Jiang Chen’s eyes were cold as he leaned
          against the wall, taking deep breaths to quickly calm himself down. He
          conversed with the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation
          in his mind, hoping to unravel the enigma that had confounded
          him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Artifact Spirit, what is Gu Changge’s motive? It seems out of
          character for someone like him to go to such lengths to rescue the
          Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family. There must be some kind of
          catch.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;I am unable to figure out the true intention of his kindness
          either. He definitely harbors ulterior motives and does not genuinely
          want to rescue the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family&gt; the Artifact
          Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation replied with a solemn
          tone.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Then, what should we do?” Jiang Chen took a deep breath as he
          activated his technique to heal his injuries.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;Your focus now must be on surviving Kun Mountain and finding a
          means of escape. Cooperating with Gu Changge is akin to courting
          danger. As soon as you set foot in Kun Mountain, you must take every
          step with caution. I will try to create opportunities for you to
          escape by manipulating the prevailing Universal Great Shi and arrays
          there,&gt; the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation said,
          extremely worried that its existence would be discovered by Gu
          Changge.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >From the moment it laid eyes on Gu Changge, it sensed unparalleled
          danger from its very being. Subsequent events only served to confirm
          its initial impression. It was fortunate that Gu Changge remained
          unaware of its presence, believing instead that Jiang Chen possessed
          the Legacy of a Divine Source Master.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >By the time Gu Changge and his companions exited the dungeon, the sun
          was setting in a breathtaking display of golden hues, while the autumn
          wind rustled through the trees. To their surprise, a graceful figure
          stood before them, as if awaiting their arrival.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          who was known to share a close bond with Gu Changge.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After exchanging a brief glance with Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue, the
          two siblings swiftly departed, not daring to pry into the
          matter.</span

          >“Young Master Gu…” Xiao Ruoyin was dressed in a pristine white
          outfit, her black hair dancing in the wind behind her lithe figure.
          Her beautifully arched eyebrows, dainty nose and cherry red lips
          harmonized flawlessly with her porcelain skin, radiating an
          indescribable allure. Standing there, she appeared almost
          otherworldly.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin’s gaze rested upon his face as she gave a firm nod,
          unafraid to reveal her purpose. “I heard that Young Master Gu has
          captured Jiang Chen.”</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Oh, so you’re here for Jiang Chen?” Gu Changge raised his eyebrows,
          intrigued by Xiao Ruoyin’s sudden change in demeanor. He was
          well-informed about Xiao Ruoyin’s meeting with Jiang Chen, and also
          aware of the detailed account that Jiang Chen had shared with her.
          Understandably, Gu Changge found Xiao Ruoyin’s reactions to be a
          natural response to the situation. Even so, he still sensed that there
          was something different about her today.

          eyes before he quickly composed himself. [Judging from the sudden

          portion of her memories as the High Priestess of Destiny.]</span

          captured by Young Master Gu, I find myself unable to simply stand idly
          by and remain indifferent to his plight,” she carefully explained
          while secretly observing Gu Changge’s demeanor, so as to not raise any
          suspicion. Besides, her statement was impeccably within reason.</span

          Gu Changge suddenly approached Xiao Ruoyin and placed his palm on her
          face. Xiao Ruoyin let out a soft hum in response and immediately
          stiffened. His touch left goosebumps on her skin but she quickly
          regained her composure.</span

          having Jiang Chen’s assistance would undoubtedly alleviate a great

          >On their way back, Gu Changge casually asked with a faint smile on
          his face, “It’s getting late, you will return to Skyward Schloss
          tomorrow, yes?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Yes, Ruoyin will return to Skyward Schloss tomorrow with the Elders.
          It’s uncertain when I’ll be able to see you again, Young Master Gu,”
          Xiao Ruoyin nodded and said with a tinge of reluctance. Despite her
          inner turmoil, she followed him in silence, determined to maintain her
          previous persona to prevent Gu Changge from discovering she had
          regained her memories as the High Priestess of Destiny.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Continue training rigorously. I hope you will be able to surprise me
          with your progress the next time we meet,” Gu Changge said with a
          smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin felt a chill down her spine, but gracefully said, “Ruoyin
          won’t let you down, Young Master Gu.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Nihility Destiny Physique, though only slightly awakened, allowed
          her to possess blood that was the rarest elixir with numerous
          benefits. It dawned upon Xiao Ruoyin that Gu Changge’s insistence on
          her rigorous training was rooted in this fact. With this realization,
          she became even more vigilant, determined not to expose her awakened
          state to Gu Changge.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When they reached the palace, Xiao Ruoyin’s mind was filled with
          apprehension. She lifted her gaze to the starry sky and said, “It’s
          late, Ruoyin will take her leave now.”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She knew the longer she remained in Gu Changge&#8217;s company, the
          more likely her secret would be discovered so it was best to distance
          herself from him as much as possible.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Hmm, do you have any plans for tonight?” Gu Changge appeared to be
          surprised by Xiao Ruoyin’s excuse to leave, as though he hadn’t
          anticipated it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing Gu Changge’s expression, Xiao Ruoyin was taken aback for a
          moment but she quickly snapped out of it. Cold sweat drenched the back
          of her clothes as she shook her head and clarified, “N-No… I just
          assumed that Young Master Gu will be busy with the discussion of the
          upcoming expedition to Mountain Kun, so…”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the past, Xiao Ruoyin would never say something like that. Even if
          there were pressing matters, Gu Changge was always her priority. She
          would seize every opportunity to stay the night with him, especially
          when presented with such a golden opportunity. So, a slight variation
          in her reply could trigger Gu Changge’s suspicion.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What is there to discuss about the expedition to Kun Mountain? It’s
          the affair of the Ji Family and has nothing to do with me.” Gu Changge
          gently shook his head, a casual smile gracing his lips. He then
          reached out to tenderly caress her lovely face and said, “I cannot
          help but notice a hint of fear in your eyes. Has Jiang Chen said
          something to you?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing the question, Xiao Ruoyin felt a flutter of anxiety in
          her chest. Despite this, she was determined to act normal. She nestled
          her head tenderly against Gu Changge’s chest and softly said, “Jiang
          Chen did talk negatively about you, but I believe there are valid
          reasons behind Young Master Gu’s actions. I trust you.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You trust me that much? Do you not harbor any fear that I may
          unexpectedly hurt you one day?” Gu Changge’s smile was tinged with a
          curious glint in his eyes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin shook her head and said, &#8220;I have no such fear,
          Young Master Gu has generously bestowed everything I have today. If he
          chooses to hurt me one day, I will gracefully accept my fate.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Haha, gracefully accept it huh…? How can I bear to hurt you after
          hearing that?” Gu Changge couldn’t help but burst into laughter,
          greatly amused by Xiao Ruoyin’s response. [Since you intended to
          compete with me in terms of how skilled we are in acting, let’s see
          how long you can keep this up.]</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that Gu Changge didn’t display any signs of suspicion toward
          her, Xiao Ruoyin exhaled a deep breath of relief. She was the only one
          aware that her back was drenched in cold sweat. Despite this, the mere
          thought of what was to come left her feeling uneasy and
          helpless.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the High Priestess of Destiny of the Immortal Palace, finding
          herself in such a predicament was nothing but fate’s whimsical doing.
          In this moment, she wished she hadn’t awakened the memories of her
          past life.</span

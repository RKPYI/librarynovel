      <h4>
        Chapter 181: Yin Mei’s Forceful Approach; Wide Eyes full of Confusion!
      </h4>
      <p>———</p>
      <p>
        ‘I’ve vented my anger for now, but my annoyance has yet to subside! To
        think of how Gu Changge dared to plot and use this old man as a borrowed
        knife with no room to refuse…
      </p>
      <p>‘It's maddening!’</p>
      <p>
        ‘How can such an unworthy descendant exist? What good does it do for him
        to anger his own ancestor?’
      </p>
      <p>
        But could Gu Nanshan really say anything with Gu Xian’er smiling like
        that? He was chock full of grievances, but he dared not let anything
        show. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Great Elder at his side couldn’t help but shake his head and
        laugh inwardly. Seeing Gu Nanshan’s current expression made him feel
        hints of sadistic pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>As for sympathy? There was neither need nor necessity for such.</p>
      <p>
        Wasn’t it also like this when he had been angered to the brink of
        madness by that guy?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was a person who took everything while giving nothing back.
        For someone to ask for anything in return and succeed was practically
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could only sigh, for such a scheming heart was difficult to come by.
      </p>
      <p>‘What an amazing junior.’</p>
      <p>
        Despite having lived for so long, he himself has never achieved such
        shrewdness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s plans came together in such a way that it was impossible to
        find the slightest crack or flaw…
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Alright, it's almost time for the journey to the Ancient Immortal
          Continent to end. When that happens, Xian'er, you should return to the
          family alongside your ancestor. There are many things you must be made
          aware of.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Nanshan’s face soon turned solemn; it was rare for him to show such
        caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an ancestor from Gu Xian’er’s line, he naturally had to find some way
        to rectify their name and restore their former glory.
      </p>
      <p>But before all that, he must first seek justice for Gu Xian’er.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Ancestor, is this true?”</b> When she heard this, Gu Xian’er was
        stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn’t help but doubt the truth behind Gu Nanshan's words. No, it
        simply felt too good to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem laid in whether the rest of the Gu Family would agree or
        not. After all, the situation concerned the face of the entire Ancient
        Immortal Gu Family, not just a single branch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gu Changge of today was not only the Young Master of the family but
        also the heir of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace… identities which held
        the utmost prestige in the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most elders of the Gu Family would want to pay attention to the big
        picture, which meant that they would obviously not favour her in this
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been separated from the family for so long.
      </p>
      <p>
        It didn’t matter if Gu Nanshan was a noble ancestor with a strong
        cultivation base. He neither had the authority nor the reputation of the
        Family Head.
      </p>
      <p>Each branch family had their own ancestors, after all.</p>
      <p>
        If these ancestors were allowed to come forward and show their old faces
        in every decision, then the Gu Family wouldn’t need a Family Head in the
        first place.
      </p>
      <p>And there was another thing they had to worry about…</p>
      <p>
        What about Gu Changge? How would he react? It would be out of character
        for him to perform an act that aided others at the cost of himself. Even
        if he didn’t suffer all that much, they would probably have to pry them
        out of his cold, dead hands.
      </p>
      <p>It was impossible for him to give in so easily.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, Gu Xian'er herself had already pondered about the situation
        before, running through many possibilities again and again.
      </p>
      <p>She was skeptical for a reason, after all.</p>
      <p>
        She was nowhere near strong enough for the Gu Family to take notice, nor
        could it compare to Gu Changge either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, no matter how good the Gu Family’s philosophy and morals were,
        they would have no choice but to account for the long-term interests of
        the family first. Gu Nanshan’s decisions and actions wouldn’t be enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Xian'er, don't worry. With this ancestor here, you will definitely
          receive justice for what happened back then.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Nanshan was surprised; he’d never expected Gu Xian'er to be so calm.
      </p>
      <p>‘Is my confidence not enough to win her trust?’</p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, even he knew that Gu Xian’er’s strength was insufficient
        to catch the family’s attention. At most, he might suppress Gu Changge,
        ensuring he doesn't harm her in secret.
      </p>
      <p>But even that looked to be a hopeless endeavour.</p>
      <p>
        Today, Gu Changge’s actions had proven to Gu Nashan that he really
        didn’t have any intention of killing Gu Xian’er, which confused him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, he would’ve never even considered that Gu Changge may have
        suffered a few problems on his end, which in turn, led to where they
        are.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Really? If the ancestor says so, then I won’t question it</b>.” Gu
        Xian'er spoke, but she didn’t seem to take it entirely to heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, those bright and beautiful eyes possessed a strange gleam that
        seemingly yet discretely called him a lying old man.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Nanshan was a bit embarrassed.</p>
      <p>
        He really did like this descendant of his. In fact, he felt terrible for
        the hardships she had to endure over the years. He wanted to make things
        right for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge must’ve been forced. Xian’er, you must believe that the
          family itself has never held malicious intent towards you…”</b
        >
        Gu Nanshan rattled on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Then can you tell me what or who forced Gu Changge?”</b> Gu Xian'er
        asked.
      </p>
      <p><b>“…”</b> Gu Nanshan shut up immediately.</p>
      <p>‘My question exactly!’</p>
      <p>
        Although he did find it strange… Gu Xian’er suffered at Gu Changge’s
        hand, yet she never seemed to doubt him. Instead, she took this topic
        very seriously.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, in the end, Gu Nashan had no answers.</p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er didn’t pry any further either.</p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, there was a big secret that not even the ancestors would
        dare discuss so casually.
      </p>
      <p>She needed to figure it out on her own.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Gu Changge, one day, I will reveal your secrets…’ Gu Xian'er clenched
        her jade fist and swore in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three of them didn’t linger. The main purpose of the Great Elder and
        Gu Nanshan’s arrival was to protect Gu Xian’er, fearing for her safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as the journey is officially declared to be over, various Dao
        Lineages would start to pour in, and it would be very dangerous for any
        members of the younger generation to stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        The void in front of them blurred with a wave of the Great Elder’s
        sleeves, constructing a passage from thin air. He took the two of them
        and left the Ancient Immortal Continent, returning to the Heavenly Dao
        Immortal Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        And since Gu Nashan was an ancestor of the Gu Family, he naturally had
        to give him the hospitality he deserved after arriving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just when the trio finally returned from the Ancient Immortal Continent
        to the top of the mountain where the Great Elder usually cultivated,
        their cheery expressions suddenly froze.
      </p>
      <p>
        Awaiting them for quite some time was a young man clothed in white. He
        wore a casual expression, with raven-ink hair tied with a black
        hairband, and he exuded an aloof demeanour, greeting them with a warm
        smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p>———</p>
      <p><b>[Immeasurable Heaven]</b></p>
      <p>
        At the same time, in a magnificent city 80,000 miles away from the
        Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace…
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Empress Mingkong, why have you ordered your followers to stop this
          humble servant?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A grandiose figure floated in the sky, as several tyrannical figures
        surrounded the glamorous chariot.
      </p>
      <p>And from the chariot, rose a soft and charming voice.</p>
      <p>
        A sensual woman in a red dress, her nine fluffy, snow-white fox tails
        fluttering in the void, held aloft by the arms of two personal maids.
      </p>
      <p>She was none other than Yin Mei.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she had a strange yet charming smile on her face, which
        revealed an inexplicable and unclear meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The driver outside the chariot was a strong man in the Heavenly God
        Realm, but his expression was gravely solemn.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Young Miss, this group of individuals is very strong!”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It's alright. Empress Mingkong is a reasonable individual and is
          sure to give face to a lowly woman such as myself.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Yin Mei's tone was a bit smug as if she wasn’t worried at all.</p>
      <p>
        In the void outside, a terrifying aura churned the space around them,
        like a vast ocean with tumultuous waves.
      </p>
      <p>Countless experts had surrounded the chariot from all directions.</p>

        Their spiritual sense swept through the world, making a tyrannical
        atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        The world shook. Ripples erupted in the void, as the cultivators outside
        who were preparing to watch a grand show couldn’t help but groan as
        their very blood tumbled, scaring them to no end.
      </p>
      <p>‘Even at such a distance…!’</p>
      <p>
        They soon retreated as far back as possible, not daring to approach in
        the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>‘How monstrous!’</p>
      <p>It was impossible to grasp the other party’s strength.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        An indifferent and elegant woman, as beautiful as one can be, stepped
        into view. Her detached voice was calm and indifferent, announcing her
        threat as though her death were a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        With every step, dazzling lotus petals of her Great Dao emerged,
        blooming gently one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a silver light, morphed into immortal writing, imprinted on the
        world. She displayed her immense might, creating a terrifying sight.
      </p>
      <p>It was Yue Mingkong after leaving the Ancient Immortal Continent.</p>
      <p>At this moment, immortal brilliance covered every inch of her body.</p>
      <p>
        A face covered with divine mist, showing only eyes that seemed to carry
        an endless depth. Her wide sleeves futtered, as her face showed not a
        trace of emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peerless elegance! As if her eyes were gems plucked deep from within the
        ground, a beauty that was ethereal and otherworldly… a goddess upon
        mortal soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even her words carried apathy and dignity that befit her supreme
        demeanour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei wasn’t the least bit surprised by Yue Mingkong's confrontation.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they first met at the Baiheng Mountains, Yue Mingkong figured out
        the relationship between her and Gu Changge. And Yin Mei was aware of
        that.
      </p>
      <p>In her opinion, Gu Changge may not find this matter worth his time.</p>
      <p>In fact, Gu Changge might not care at all.</p>
      <p>
        She was his pawn. He liked her, but could she really compete with Yue
        Mingkong for his heart?
      </p>
      <p>
        With her level of intellect, how could Yue Mingkong not have long
        discovered these facts?
      </p>
      <p>
        It was only reasonable for Yin Mei to assume that Yue Mingkong would
        take the initiative to come knocking on her door.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, she didn’t expect her to act so quickly. Yin Mei had just
        barely left the Ancient Immortal Continent, yet Yue Mingkong had already
        personally intercepted her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a strong and decisive approach was truly in line with the rumours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei also knew that this future Empress was very possessive towards
        Gu Changge, chasing away all other women who would dare get even half a
        step closer.
      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: YANDERE WAIFU, WOOOOOH!]</p>
      <p>The current scene was the greatest proof of that.</p>
      <p>Upon hearing her scathing words, Yin Mei couldn't help but smile.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Empress Mingkong, this is a bit too much. Wouldn't the Master be
          upset when he finds out about this?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“This Empress doesn’t care.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong spoke lightly. Gu Changge was someone she understood very
        well. For him to be tempted by a mere fox spirit was improbable. At
        most, he probably used her for his plans or to gather his resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, she had to make it clear that Yin Mei was to avoid having
        any unnecessary or otherwise crooked thoughts toward Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be frank, she even hoped that Gu Changge would actually be angry with
        her. ‘At the very least, I would know that I’m still worth something in
        his heart.’
      </p>
      <p>More than anything, she was worried he might not even care.</p>
      <p>There was a chance he wouldn’t even ask, let alone lay blame.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Oh, it seems that the Empress has had a quarrel with the Master?
          Could it be that some trouble has arisen?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei’s smile suddenly looked a bit strange, as though she’d noticed
        traces of the loneliness and loss that Yue Mingkong hid behind her
        indifference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Controlling these tiny emotions and inflexions was her natural gift.
      </p>
      <p>It was thanks to this gift that she was able to act so seamlessly.</p>
      <p>
        With all that in mind, she was a little surprised when she noticed these
        little traces of Yue Mingkong’s true emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘No wonder she wasn’t by his side when he left the Ancient Immortal
        Continent.’
      </p>
      <p>‘They had most likely quarrelled at the Baiheng Mountains.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘And…it seems the crux of the problem lies with Yue Mingkong herself.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, Yin Mei was envious of Yue Mingkong. The future empress was
        definitely the first woman Gu Changge had treated as his own in the
        entire world.
      </p>
      <p>But now… she saw a faint glimmer of hope.</p>
      <p>
        Naturally, Yin Mei didn’t want to be just a pawn for Gu Changge. She
        hoped that he would look at her as a potential partner.

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“How did you know?”</b> Within Yue Mingkong’s phoenix eyes,
        terrifying divine light surged. Like the bright light of a moon, it
        contained a frightening amount of divine might.
      </p>
      <p><b>“It's only natural that I know.”</b> Yin Mei slyly spoke.</p>
      <p>
        She was no longer as apprehensive about Yue Mingkong as she was earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what if her reputation and strength weren’t as good as Yue
        Mingkong’s?
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s use for her was something unique and irreplaceable.</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong could never take her spot.</p>
      <p>
        Unless this future empress was a fool, she wouldn’t dare to kill her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much like herself, Yue Mingkong was also a woman who feared being hated
        by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was exactly the kind of opportunity she could take advantage of.

        <b>“Aren't you afraid that this Empress will kill you?”</b> Yue Mingkong
        indifferently replied. She was a regressor, so there was no way she
        would truly take Yin Mei seriously.
      </p>
      <p>This meeting was just a simple warning.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Not at all. If you kill me, the Master probably wouldn’t blame you.
          However, Empress Mingkong, please consider it carefully. If you really
          do so, you might never enter his heart again.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Have you never considered the consequences?”</b></p>
      <p>
        An endless sea of sparks seemed to seethe between them as Yin Mei
        smiled, choosing to confront Yue Mingkong head-on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“You dare threaten this Empress?”</b> Yue Mingkong's eyes suddenly
        grew infinitely colder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her Qi and vitality surged. Visions of mountains and rivers being
        destroyed across thousands of miles using merely her fingertips could be
        seen.
      </p>
      <p>A lowly vixen dared to provoke her? This was unexpected.</p>
      <p>
        More importantly, Yin Mei’s words were right on the money, poking at the
        sore spots Yue Mingkong thought she had carefully concealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Of course… not. It was just an explanation, Empress Mingkong.” </b
        >Yin Mei shook her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“That said, if you don’t kill me now, then Princess Mingkong will
          have to be careful in the future. There are many things I can help
          Master with that you yourself, cannot.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Let's see who gets a hold of master’s heart first.”</b></p>
      <p>

        “moon”? Kanant: Hello, dear readers; Yue means moon.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei spoke smoothly, seemingly indifferent to the murderous intent
        that Yue Mingkong radiated.
      </p>
      <p>She was by no means weaker, after all.</p>
      <p>
        With Yue Mingkong’s weakness in her hand, she naturally had to make good
        use of it.

      <p>
        Yin Mei estimated that these remarks of hers must have struck Yue
        Mingkong quite a blow.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Oh? How absurd.”</b></p>
      <p>
        But to Yin Mei’s shock, Yue Mingkong did not show even the slightest bit
        of anger at all, her narrowed eyes instead giving off a sense of
        mockery.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Win Gu Changge’s heart? By yourself?”</b></p>
      <p>
        It was obvious she didn’t take Yin Mei’s words to heart. Yue Mingkong’s
        voice remained calm and collected as ever, and even carried hints of
        contempt and disdain.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had never worried that Gu Changge would be tempted by other women.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing a woman other than herself by his side just made her feel
        uncomfortable, that's all.
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn’t help it despite understanding that Gu Changge was merely
        playing pretend.
      </p>
      <p>Even now, she felt uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>No one knew Gu Changge better than Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, Yin Mei's self-confidence was a delusion stemming from
        ignorance. That’s why Yue Mingkong completely disregarded Yin Mei's rude
        remarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I do have to thank you though. From your filthy words, this Empress
          understood the truth, that ‘blocking is worse than flowing’.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Rather than intervene, I suppose I’ll let karma sort itself out.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong laughed mysteriously.</p>
      <p>She had already received the answer she wanted.</p>
      <p>
        She wouldn’t give up, but neither would she do anything unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her identity and the advantages she gleaned as a regressor were both
        powerless in front of Gu Changge, so why not try attacking from another
        angle?
      </p>
      <p><b>“Yue Mingkong, what exactly do you mean?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei frowned and questioned, directly calling Yue Mingkong by name.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Yue Mingkong to be so certain that she would not get Gu Changge’s
        heart…
      </p>
      <p>It was unbelievable!</p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Yue Mingkong did not deign to answer Yin Mei’s question.
        She simply left the scene with a wave of her jade-like hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the other experts morphed into divine rainbows and rose into the
        sky, following her lead. They disappeared one by one, until no other
        than Yin Mei and her maids remained.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If you can actually do it, then that might not be such a bad idea
          either.”</b
        >
        Yue Mingkong's fading voice struck Yin Mei from a distance.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Why…”</b> Yin Mei was dazed for a while inside her chariot.</p>
      <p>———</p>
      <p><b>[Near the Infinite Sea, East of the ancient city]</b></p>
      <p>
        Millions of years ago, there used to be an ancient family residing here.
        They reigned supreme from ages past to modern times.
      </p>
      <p>Prosperity. Decline. Retreat. Revival.</p>
      <p>
        They experienced everything, and were the undisputed overlord of the
        area.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pity that within a few years prior, they had mistakenly offended the
        Primordial Divine Sect, resulting in many strong powerhouses making
        their moves.
      </p>
      <p>Since then, the domineering ancient family was destroyed.</p>
      <p>Traces of their annihilation spread everywhere.</p>
      <p>Broken walls and ruins with overgrown grass.</p>
      <p>
        Only the most durable of bricks and tiles still shone with the
        prosperity of their yesteryear.
      </p>
      <p>
        How bleak and tragic of a scene. Cultivators passing by occasionally
        glanced at the wreckage with a sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“In hindsight, nobody would’ve guessed that this would be the fate of
          the Primordial Sun Family. In the entire Dongli Ancient City, no one
          dared to refute even a single word of theirs, and their every step
          caused quakes among the population. Yet now I can't even find any
          lingering traces of them…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The Primordial Demon Sect converged on them from all sides. It was
          terrifying! With a single word of theirs, even strong forces like the
          Primordial Sun would be destroyed!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Many elderly people who had seen the reign of the ancient family, felt a
        sense of pity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It seems that, no matter how powerful a family is, there will be a
          time when the curtain comes down on them. Who told them to offend the
          people and forces that should not be offended?”</b
        >
        A wrinkly person on the side also sighed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Shush, be quiet</b><b>!</b
        ><b>

        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Speak carefully!”</b></p>
      <p>One individual immediately shivered and scolded.</p>
      <p>
        When they thought about that news, they couldn’t help but shut their
        mouths in unison, with a deep sense of fear reflected in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, there was a burst of clatter, like the rush of a big wave
        flooding the sky.
      </p>
      <p>A distant but extremely loud sound.</p>
      <p>It rang from the Infinite Sea.</p>
      <p>
        The various cultivators in the entire ancient city heard this massive
        boom, many of whom decided to break through the clouds to try finding
        the sound’s source.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hiss!</b></p>
      <p>
        When they saw it, everyone was shocked, taking deep breaths to steady
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p><b>[The Infinite Sea, the Sea Clan’s territory]</b></p>
      <p>
        They occasionally came ashore to sell native goods or buy resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        But today was different. An immeasurable number of warships were rushing
        in, a legion on the water, covering the sky and sun.
      </p>
      <p>A luxurious, aquamarine flag fluttered in the wind.</p>
      <p>The Sea King Palace!</p>
      <p>
        It was a coalition of numerous sea clans, charging under the banner of
        the Sea King Palace, slashing out murderously from the boundless sea!
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of them instantly thought of what happened in the Ancient Immortal
        Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess of the Sea Palace was robbed and killed by a girl
        named Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could it be that the Sea King Palace was angry because of this? Did they
        plan to come on land to take revenge and seek justice?
      </p>
      <p>
        This shocking news spread like wildfire. It resounded across the ancient
        cities of the Immeasurable Heaven and, for a time, caused a
        world-shaking sensation.

        Atop a mountain awash with clouds and surging mist, where the cold wind
        blew strongly, ethereal and lofty…

      <p>A paradise in the Upper Realm.</p>
      <p><b>“Oh, the Great Elder and the ancestor are back?”</b></p>

        Gu Changge, who was drinking by himself on the stone table, felt their
        movements and smiled, getting up to greet his ‘seniors’.
      </p>
      <p>The void blurred as a channel of space appeared.</p>
      <p>
        The three figures who walked out each possessed a unique expression, but
        none seemed pleased to see him.
      </p>
      <p>How could Gu Changge be here so early?</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er originally had a small smile on her face, but that smile
        abruptly froze.

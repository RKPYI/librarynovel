        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father, tell me this isn&#8217;t true! How can Fan’er be…&#8221; In
                the prison, the entirety of the Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s family was confined, including his wife, his
                eldest son, Jun Ping, his second daughter, Jun Yao, and the rest of the higher-ups of the Jun
                Family.</span><span id="more-29805"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the crowd was immensely confused and anxious, not knowing what
                exactly happened when the army suddenly barged into their homes and surrounded their territory before
                dragging all of them to prison. Now, however, it was as if they had grown decades older, given how there
                was nothing but depressed frowns and pessimistic grimaces on their faces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is true. Somehow, Her Majesty obtained the proof of Fan’er&#8217;s
                betrayal. As of now, everyone in the palace knows about this. It seems the Jun Family no longer has a
                chance at restoring its name and prosperity.&#8221; After listening to Jun Yao, the Quelling Chaos King
                instinctively looked at her and expressed his disaffection as his eyes were filled with dense
                helplessness and negativity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even to this moment, his mind was still ringing as he had yet to recover from
                the shock, given that the impact of the news was too great to him. Helpless and frustrated, he never
                expected that Jun Fan had secretly planned for Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s assassination behind their backs.
                In fact, once such a matter had been exposed, the Quelling Chaos King’s family should have been
                sentenced to death.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Impossible! Fan’er&#8217;s respect for Her Majesty is not to be
                doubted! There&#8217;s no way he would do such a thing! There must be a misunderstanding!?&#8221; Jun
                Yao&#8217;s face paled as her voice shook; she grew even more dismayed despite receiving the truthful
                answer.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her memory, Jun Fan was a confident, mature young man. Although
                he could be stubborn at times, his Talents and aptitude in cultivating was sufficient to make up for his
                flaws. Thus, it was impossible for him to pull off such an atrocious act, let alone doing it behind
                everyone&#8217;s backs.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fan’er has deceived me all this time…&#8221; Jun Fan&#8217;s older
                brother, Jun Ping, spoke as he heaved a long sigh. From his appearance, similar to the Quelling Chaos
                King, he was extremely tall and muscular, carrying a ferocious aura.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, the other higher-ups of the Jun Family were also stunned and
                frightened by the news. Prior to this, they never even once fathomed that Jun Fan had been hiding a
                secret identity, let alone thinking that he was Jun Bufan, the heir of the Solar Demon Overlord.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, many of them grew to abhor Jun Fan given how he ignored the
                stability of his family and executed a major plan that might have harmed his family. Instead of
                returning to the capital, Jun Fan simply gave an excuse and left, the reason of which was now apparent
                to all. He was taking the chance to evade the coming hazards.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, many were also guessing that the real Jun Fan had died a long time
                ago, and the person who was possessing his body was someone from over six thousand years ago.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let us not dwell on the matter and see how Her Majesty intends to deal
                with it. If her anger has passed, she just might let us go. I am sure this decision of hers was made out
                of rage. Time has proven my loyalty to her, and I deeply believe that she is not unreasonable.&#8221;
                Very soon, the Quelling Chaos King waved his hand and told the crowd to quiet down.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he, too, was uncertain about Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s true attitude
                towards this matter. Essentially, the magnitude of this was too great, and if it weren&#8217;t for Gu
                Changge&#8217;s sudden appearance in the Demon World, she would surely be at a disadvantageous, life
                threatening state now.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, the Quelling Chaos King had yet to move on from his vexation
                towards Jun Fan&#8217;s betrayal and deceit. If the matter were to be exposed, the entire family would
                be unquestionably annihilated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did it develop into this in just one day…&#8221; Jun Yao&#8217;s
                lips blanched as she clenched her plain fists. Before this, she was so calmly planting tea leaves,
                awaiting to serve them to Gu Changge the next time they met.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, now that she was submitted into prison, she had no idea how things
                would turn out. From the noble daughter of the Quelling Chaos King to a prisoner whose fate was out of
                her own control, such a drastic difference left her greatly perplexed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, as she was no ordinary person, she quickly calmed herself down,
                being aware that being hasty wouldn&#8217;t contribute to anything. Besides, she had no intentions of
                blaming Jun Fan. After all, judging by his usual actions, he never displayed any sort of strange
                behaviour. Things were fine as it was, yet he turned out to be Jun Bufan, the heir of the Solar Demon
                Overlord, who had supposedly been dead for over six thousand years.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right when the members of the Jun Family were agonised by their sorrow, a
                patter of footsteps could be heard coming from outside the prison.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the prison guards&#8217; faces changed as they reverently lowered
                their heads as a man in black walked over, possessing a mysterious yet extraordinary aura and innate
                nobleness.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge&#8230;&#8221; Jun Yao was visibly dazed as she
                didn&#8217;t expect to meet Gu Changge here.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did he come to visit me after knowing about the matter?] With that in mind,
                Jun Yao&#8217;s heart uncontrollably palpitated as bashfulness surged on her face.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also surprised by the sight, the Jun Family members, who were behind bars,
                immediately bowed and greeted in unison, &#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge.&#8221; Joy arose on the Quelling
                Chaos King&#8217;s face as he hastily took a bow.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Young Master Changge must be here because of Yao’er! It seems their previous
                interaction managed to pique his interest and he would even personally come over to visit her!] As such,
                the Quelling Chaos King felt a gush of hope in his heart. Given the current state of Demon World, if
                there was one person that could save him, it must be Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, even the Grand Tutor, who mentored Empress Yao Xi ever
                since she was child, wouldn&#8217;t dare to upset her at such a moment. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that wasn&#8217;t the same for Gu Changge. Not only was Gu Changge
                close with Empress Yao Xi, but he was also her saviour, so if he were to speak up for the Quelling Chaos
                King, the Empress would definitely comply with his request.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, why are you here?&#8221; Jun Yan shyly looked at
                Gu Changge with a blush on her delicate face.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gently nodding, Gu Changge scanned across the members of the Jun Family as an
                expression of realisation flashed across his face, after which he replied, &#8220;Yao Xi just told me
                about the matter. I thought it was some kind of misunderstanding, until I took a look at the
                photographic stone.&#8221; He heaved a sigh as he spoke.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faces of the crowd of the Jun Family grew gloomy as they understood what
                Gu Changge meant. Since he already put things this way, it was mostly likely that they wouldn&#8217;t be
                able to shake off the alleged connection between them and the matter regarding Jun Fan being the heir of
                the Solar Demon Overlord.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jun Yao, who visibly grew dull, apologised, &#8220;Young Master Changge,
                sorry to have made you worry.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge softly shook his head and answered, &#8220;Please drop the
                formalities, Lady Jun Yao. None of you should be worried about this. I believe that Yao Xi will release
                all of you once her anger passes.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the Jun Family crowd was relieved, so was the Quelling Chaos
                King, evidently with his delighted expression. Since Gu Changge made such a statement, Empress Yao Xi
                would certainly let them go.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm. Sorry to have troubled you to come all the way here to tell us all
                these, Young Master Changge.&#8221; Upon Gu Changge&#8217;s assurance, Jun Yao was also relieved. With
                her reddened cheeks, she spoke in a bashful voice.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to burden you either. Rest assured, all of you will
                be fine as long as I am here,&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly promised. Having said that, he subtly nodded
                at the Quelling Chaos King and the rest before turning around and walking out of the prison without any
                delays.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s words left Jun Yao&#8217;s heart violently thumping and
                her head dizzy. Intoxicated, she watched as Gu Changge&#8217;s figure fade away and she would only
                regain her senses when he completely vanished.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s all thanks to you, Yao’er! Otherwise, I wouldn&#8217;t have
                known what to do this time. Say, what level of relationship are you and Young Master Changge at now? For
                him to personally come and visit you? Yao’er, this is very important, you know!? Why didn&#8217;t you
                ever tell me anything about it?&#8221; The Quelling Chaos King gleefully asked Jun Yao.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his eyes, although Jun Yao could be prideful at times, her appearance was
                undoubtedly impeccable as the only person that could rival her beauty in the entirety of the capital,
                aside from Empress Yao Xi, was Song Youwei. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, after knowing that Gu Changge indulged in tea-tasting, Jun Yao began
                researching about it so that she could possibly gain Gu Changge&#8217;s favour.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jun Yao hastily refuted, &#8220;What are you talking about,
                Father? I was merely doing some research on tea, which coincidentally happens to be of Young Master
                Changge&#8217;s interest. It&#8217;s not what you think. Otherwise, do you think such a lowly woman like
                me could gain his interest?&#8221; Despite saying that, she was internally on cloud nine.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the Quelling Chaos King mindlessly chortled. &#8220;I know, I
                know. You damsels and your ego. Though, it would be even better if you get even closer to Young Master
                Changge.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If Yao’er could become Young Master Changge&#8217;s wife, I can drop my
                title as the Quelling Chaos King and the Jun Family would instantly become one of the top families in
                the vast Demon World! Even Her Majesty would have to contain herself before me.]</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, such a wonderful thing could only be imagined. Given Jun Yao&#8217;s
                identity, she would never suffice no matter how high she climbed. Thus, what he wished for was to have
                Jun Yao, by certain means, carry Gu Changge&#8217;s child. Judging by the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s
                dominance, they wouldn&#8217;t allow any of their heirs drifting aimlessly around the outside world. As
                such, the Jun Family could utilise that to climb up the ladder.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, everyone of the Jun Family was enviously looking at Jun Yao.
                Judging by Gu Changge&#8217;s manner of speech towards her, it was certain that she managed to gain his
                interest. Or else, someone as reputable as Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t stain their pride by coming to such
                a place and to reassure her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, outside the prison, Empress Yao Xi, who had been waiting for
                Gu Changge, saw him coming out and subconsciously asked, &#8220;You plan to use the Jun Family to find
                Jun Bufan, huh?&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed to have figured out Gu Changge&#8217;s scheme.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking a glance at her, Gu Changge leisurely answered, &#8220;Not
                precisely. The Jun Family is in no place to locate Jun Bufan. Even if he were to know about their
                confinement, he wouldn&#8217;t bat an eye. Do you think he&#8217;d care about the fate of the Jun
                Family?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Empress Yao Xi nodded with a pondering look and countered,
                &#8220;Then what is the purpose of all this?&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming that Jun Bufan would have been bothered by the fate of the Jun
                Family, there was no way he would have taken advantage of his identity as the third son of the Quelling
                Chaos Kind to plan for her assassination.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Naturally, it is to help you resolve your problems,&#8221; Gu Changge
                smilingly claimed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empress Yao Xi then peered at him without questioning him any further. Since
                he wasn&#8217;t willing to explain himself, there wouldn&#8217;t be any point in pursuing the matter.
                Besides, capturing Jun Bufan would indeed help her resolve her problems.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Quelling Chaos King and his family&#8217;s confinement caused a turmoil
                in the capital as many were guessing whether it was his incompetence that drew the Empress&#8217;s rage.
                Nonetheless, such a matter wouldn&#8217;t cause a significant commotion in the vast Nine Domains of
                Demon World since it was merely a ripple from a drop of pebble that would quickly recover.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, Gu Changge would occasionally visit Jun Yao in the prison,
                casting an illusion of him being interested in her. Grateful and relieved at the same time, the members
                of the Jun Family felt as if the days of them resurfacing in the outside world would soon arrive.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing as the time was approaching, Gu Changge walked in with a stern frown
                and ordered the prison guards to release Jun Yao.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the pleasant surprise, Jun Yao was more confused as to why only her,
                and not the entire Jun Family, was released.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, why is it only me?&#8221; Jun Yao was baffled,
                especially upon seeing Gu Changge&#8217;s solemn expression.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge looked at her and gently sighed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking
                into the matter for the past few days. Jun Fan is no longer the person you know as he is now possessed
                by the heir of the Solar Demon Overlord six thousand years ago.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221; At once, Jun Yao&#8217;s face blanched. Although she
                foresaw such a possibility, hearing it personally from Gu Changge felt as though her heart was struck by
                lightning, making her tremble in dejection. Not wanting to believe it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yao Xi is still pretty angry, and even my persuasion wouldn&#8217;t
                work on her. However, upon some consideration, she decided to give your family a chance to redeem
                yourselves,&#8221; Gu Changge continued after taking a glance at Jun Yao.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strenuously containing her agony, Jun Yao intuitively asked, &#8220;What does
                Her Majesty want us to do?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jun Fan she once knew would never have done anything that would harm
                their family. Therefore, she swiftly acknowledged the current Jun Fan was no longer the one she knew of
                as he was now nothing but an empty vessel. Her true brother had died by the hands of the heir of the
                Solar Demon Overlord, Jun Bufan. Thus, she swore to exact vengeance from him no matter what it might
                cost.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yao Xi thinks that Jun Fan is currently making a grand plan to wreak
                havoc across Demon World in secret, and now, only you are capable of stopping that, though, I
                don&#8217;t really want you to take the risk…&#8221; Gu Changge sounded somewhat helpless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, having calmed herself down, Jun Yao spoke in determination,
                &#8220;I fear no danger. As long as I&#8217;m able to rescue my family and avenge my brother, I&#8217;ll
                do anything it takes!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After heaving a sigh, Gu Changge pulled out a crystalline jade talisman in
                which heavenly beams were flowing out of, and stated, &#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, I no longer have
                to convince you. This jade talisman carries a fully powered strike from me. Once you tear it apart,
                it&#8217;ll protect your life. At the same time, the moment you tear it apart, I&#8217;ll be able to
                detect where you are and I&#8217;ll instantly dash to your rescue.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Jun Yao was momentarily dazed as immense sentiments surged in
                her mind, after which she accepted the jade talisman. &#8220;Understood, Young Master Changge. I am at a
                loss for ways to repay your generosity.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge waved his hands before sternly assuring, &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
                do that, Lady Jun Yao. Consider it as a token of appreciation for the tea you made back then. Such a
                matter is of utmost importance. Soon, I&#8217;ll tell you the details, which you must remember or you
                may lose your life. You must know that the current Jun Fan is no longer your younger brother. Should a
                beneficial opportunity arise, he&#8217;ll definitely do it without considering your family&#8217;s
                lives.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jun Yao heavily nodded with a solemn expression.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Gu Changge began instructing her according to the original
                plan.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, there was no chance that Jun Yao would doubt his words. Although
                the tasks sounded like a hassle, as long as she didn&#8217;t reveal any flaw, things should sail
                smoothly.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I got it. Rest assured, Young Master Changge.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smilingly replied, &#8220;Then, please be careful.&#8221;</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, he led Jun Yao out of the capital and headed to the planned
                location to await the emergence of an individual.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gu Changge&#8217;s plan, Jun Yao played a crucial role that
                would be the key to its success. Since the Gates of Life was now being guarded by Jun Bufan&#8217;s
                sister, Jun Ruoxi, then it would only be a matter of time until Jun Bufan located the Gates of Death,
                let alone the fact that he was now holding the key to the gate.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intending to find the Gates of Death through Jun Bufan, Gu Changge would have
                to refrain from startling his enemy until Jun Bufan found it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father, what you told me, are they real?&#8221; In that instant, in
                the Manor of the Grand Tutor, Song Youwei widened her eyes in disbelief.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the Grand Tutor let out a lengthy sigh and answered, &#8220;I
                couldn&#8217;t believe it either, but the footage of photographic stone was no
                fabrication.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Empress Yao Xi forbade anyone from spreading the information,
                failing to resist Song Youwei&#8217;s persistence, the Grand Tutor could only fess up about the
                matter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, since he knew Song Youwei was tactful enough not to reveal such a
                crucial piece of information to outsiders, he did not worry too much about sharing it with her..</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, that’s why…&#8221; Song Youwei was still in dismay despite having
                come to a realisation. Despite being hesitant and conflicted, she eventually heaved a deep sigh.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short while ago, she received a message from Jun Fan, who claimed to have
                found a ruin and invited her over to explore it, given that she was pretty knowledgeable about arrays
                and runes. Furthermore, her knowledge towards artifacts and her understanding of ruins weren&#8217;t
                shallow either, in addition to her interest in said field. Therefore, Jun Fan would usually invite her
                over to visit ruins.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, after hearing about the news, Song Youwei was certainly
                agitated. Her mind was a mess as she didn&#8217;t know what to do.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turned out, Jun Fan was actually Jun Bufan, the heir of the Solar Demon
                Overlord who was poisoned by Empress Yao Xi six thousand years ago, and he was also the mastermind
                behind the assassination on the peak of the Sacred Mountain some time ago. Apart from that, he was also
                the one who caused the Quelling Chaos King and his family to be imprisoned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, Song Youwei finally understood the reason as to why Jun Fan
                seemed rather peculiar back then.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father, I promise not to tell anyone about this, but I have to head
                out for some time.&#8221; Accordingly, Song Youwei, having composed herself, said to the Grand
                Tutor.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was still determined to see Jun Fan and personally question his motive.
                She was reluctant to believe that Jun Fan was some sort of abysmal criminal. [The current stability and
                prosperity of the Demon World is only possible thanks to Her Majesty&#8217;s contributions. Does Jun Fan
                truly intend to bring everything to ruin, or does he merely desire to take revenge on Her Majesty due to
                the incident six thousand years ago? Regardless, I must hear it from Jun Fan himself!] </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a scowl, the Grand Tutor observed Song Youwei&#8217;s expression
                and vaguely guessed her thoughts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Song Youwei and Jun Fan were best of friends, it would be impossible
                for her not to worry after the happening of such an enormous incident.</span></p>

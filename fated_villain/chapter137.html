        Chapter 137: Unqualified to Prance in Front of Gu Changge; Trembling
        Mind!
      </h4>
      <p>‘Lord Long Teng?’</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong’s indifferent eyes showed some fluctuations as she listened
        to the name from the dragon-horned girl’s mouth, and confirmed her
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>Still, she didn’t care about her.</p>
      <p>
        The Long Teng she knew — although he was scary and was also the best of
        the younger generation, and never suffered defeat after leaving the
        Ancient Immortal Continent, so much so that even some ancient monsters
        who removed their seals weren’t a match for him — disappeared in the end
        as if he never existed in the world, and turned into a strange case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators felt regret over his disappearance as they believed
        that Long Teng’s talent could help him stand at the pinnacle of the
        world in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas! He disappeared out of nowhere, and all they could do was sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many thought that Long Teng strayed into some forbidden area or fell
        into some Spatial Crack that led him to some entrapped world, and died
        there.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now that she had regressed, Yue Mingkong felt that it was very
        likely that Long Teng fell in Gu Changge’s poisonous hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        She remembered that one day in her last life, Gu Changge whispered
        something to her, and seemed to have mentioned Long Teng.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge held the [Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art] in his arsenal, so
        how could he not salivate after Long Teng’s True Dragon talent?
      </p>
      <p>With his character, it was impossible for him to let Long Teng go.</p>
      <p><b>[Hum!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong soon came back from her trip down memory lane; her
        indifferent expression showed no change as the palm of her hand fell and
        formed a plain, jade hand that was translucent and crystal clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Imperial Art of hers was quite tyrannical, and although the Realm
        she showed on the surface put her in the Middle Stage of the Conferred
        King Realm, the might she gave off easily reached the level of True
        Gods, and that shocked everyone in the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        One had to accept that if Yue Mingkong was in the same Realm as the
        dragon-horned girl in front of them, then she would have definitely
        dominated her without a hitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dragon-horned girl showed a change in her complexion. With her
        Cultivation Base and physical strength, she could hold back Yue
        Mingkong, but she realized that she was the one falling at a
        disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        She immediately brought out her tyrannical physical strength! Radiance
        flowed around her figure, and she resisted her foe’s blow, but her
        figure still flew back in the Void.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Lord Long Teng asked me to gather genius women from the outlanders,
          so if you willingly submit to him, then you will surely have a happy
          time.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Only a woman like you is qualified to be with Lord Long Teng!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The dragon-horned girl kept on persuading Yue Mingkong while exchanging
        blows with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mighty genius like Yue Mingkong was hard to come by even among their
        Ancient Immortal Tribe, so much so that they might not even see one like
        her in hundreds of thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dragons were promiscuous creatures, and their Lord Long Teng had a hobby
        of collecting beauties from all kinds of races, and that was why he sent
        his people to capture genius beauties from the outside world. Anyone who
        got one for him could go and claim some rewards from him.
      </p>
      <p>It was a coincidence that she came across Yue Mingkong!</p>
      <p>
        When she saw her for the first time, even she, a woman couldn’t take her
        gaze away from her flawless features and felt sour and jealous in her
        heart, so how could a man not feel his blood rush to certain regions of
        their body after seeing her?
      </p>
      <p>
        Right after seeing her, she made a move to capture Yue Mingkong as she
        believed that it wouldn’t be all that difficult, but now, she couldn’t
        help but feel anxious after exchanging innumerable blows with her.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong was as strong as her, and that shocked her!</p>
      <p>She couldn’t help but envy the beauty in front of her.</p>
      <p>
        It was because of this that she decided to persuade Yue Mingkong in a
        language that she could understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, their Lord Long Teng could be said to be the most terrifying
        talent their Tribe saw in the last few million years. The old fogies in
        the Tribe even said that their Lord Long Teng could compete for the
        title of True Dragon in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        True Dragon! It was a mighty existence that surpassed even True
        Immortals!
      </p>
      <p>
        The dragon-horned girl held utmost respect for her Lord Long Teng in her
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a pity that her face wasn’t good enough to enter Lord Long Teng’s
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“You better pray that this Empress’ fiance doesn’t hear those
          words…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong couldn’t help but shake her head and say with a hint of
        mockery in her tone when she recalled Long Teng’s fate in her previous
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        What were these so-called Young Supremes and Ancient Monsters in front
        of Gu Changge?
      </p>
      <p>They weren’t even qualified to prance around in front of him.</p>
      <p><b>“Fiance?”</b></p>
      <p>
        The dragon-horned girl’s expression showed a drastic change when she
        heard those words, and she said with a fierce tone,
        <b
          >“Your fiance is going to die then! No one can escape after touching
          the woman desired by Lord Long Teng.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong didn’t give a damn about her threat, and kept on exchanging
        blows with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, she wondered if she should expose some of her cards
        and kill the annoying dragon-horned girl in front of her?
      </p>
      <p>However, she decided not to do so.</p>
      <p>
        Wasting her trump cards on the dragon-horned girl wasn’t worth it as the
        dragon-horned girl probably also had means to counter her attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dragon-horned girl, on the other hand, realized that it wasn’t
        possible for her to win against the woman in front of her, so she
        prepared to take her leave as well.
      </p>
      <p>She had to report the matter to her Lord Long Teng.</p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Tribe lorded over countless Families of aborigines
        in the Ancient Immortal Continent, so they already knew about the young
        talents from outside coming in to gain some experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The birth of the Immortal Treasure was actually just the remnant
        brilliance of a treasure released by the Ancient Immortal Tribe.
      </p>
      <p>It was their plan to attract the outsiders.</p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Continent had been closed for a long time, and the
        younger generations of the Ancient Immortal Tribe wanted to go out to
        experience the outside world, to gain knowledge and experience…at the
        same time, they would also raise the prestige of their Ancient Immortal
        Tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng was the leader of their Ancient Immortal Tribe’s younger
        generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dragon-horned girl, on the other hand, wasn’t even in the top ten of
        their younger generation, yet she could still look down on all the Young
        Supremes from the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the Spiritual Qi and Cultivation Resources in the Ancient
        Immortal Continent were far richer than what the outsiders could chance
        upon in the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention the fact that there were countless hidden opportunities
        littered all over the Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: ‘Supreme Stone Carvings, Remains of Quasi-Emperors…and much
        more.’
      </p>
      <p>
        This allowed the younger generations in the Ancient Immortal Continent
        to be stronger than the younger generations of the heritages outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dragon-horned girl felt that they didn’t even need their Lord Long
        Teng to take action if they wanted to take down the outsiders.
      </p>
      <p>‘Long Teng, eh…how long will he live in this life?’</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong watched the dragon-horned girl leave, but didn’t pursue
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had a deep and calm expression as she watched her disappear in the
        distance. The most important matter was that she knew that…the
        dragon-horned girl was dead meat.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Gu Changge wouldn’t think that I deliberately pinned this hatred on his
        head, right?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong’s phoenix eyes narrowed and she tried to guess Gu Changge’s
        thoughts based on his temperament, ‘That Long Teng, he probably won’t
        even take him seriously…at most, Long Teng will be regarded as prey.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she put down her guard towards Gu Changge, she still didn’t
        fully trust him.
      </p>
      <p>‘Once bitten, twice shy.’</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong also had her own thoughts.</p>
      <p>
        She knew that the relationship between Gu Changge and her was much
        closer than before, but all of that…
      </p>
      <p>
        In her final analysis, the reason Gu Changge revealed his secret to her,
        cared about her opinion, gave her Mystical Weapons, and even said words
        that could move her heart was all because the current her held some
        importance to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong had a clear mind now, and wasn’t someone who would easily
        be tricked by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course…she hoped that she was just thinking too much, and that she
        just misunderstood Gu Changge in this life.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wanted to be by Gu Changge’s side, she wanted to be his virtuous
        wife who helped him through everything, she wanted to bear his babies,
        she wanted to help him rule the world, she wanted to look down on the
        Heavens with him, and she wanted to stand at the pinnacle of reality
        with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, on the premise that…that there were no ‘vixens’ coming up to
        court death!
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge only belonged to her!</p>
      <p>‘Xian’er…’</p>
      <p>
        Soon, Yue Mingkong recalled something important and her expression
        changed as worry clawed at her heart. Immediately, she left the place
        and rushed towards the place where Gu Xian’er was trapped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her followers followed after her, releasing a mighty aura as their
        entourage moved forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last period of time, Yue Mingkong relied on her prophetic
        ability to grab countless opportunities before anyone else could find
        them.
      </p>
      <p>She even took away an Imperial Inheritance.</p>
      <p>
        She also planned to find an opportunity to break through to the False
        God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her apparent Cultivation Base was in the Middle Stage of the Conferred
        King Realm, but that was all an illusion; this was something she learned
        from Gu Changge!
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>Mountains fell in her wake one after another.</p>
      <p>
        It didn’t take long for Yue Mingkong to bring her large group of
        followers to the area where Gu Xian’er was trapped by the Sea King
        Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, she didn’t see the figure of the cultivators who were
        previously watching the hunt, and that puzzled her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering Gu Changge’s temperament, there was no way he would care
        about Gu Xian’er’s life and death, so she had to do something. Diiscover

      </p>
      <p>
        Although she knew that Gu Xian’er would survive the ordeal, and even
        achieve a breakthrough during a critical moment, that didn’t mean Yue
        Mingkong wouldn’t worry about her future sister-in-law!
      </p>
      <p>[TL/N: you are in for a surprise, Yandere-chan.]</p>
      <p>
        When she reached her destination, she smelled a strong smell of blood.
        Countless mountains and forests had collapsed and turned to dust;
        massive cracks could be seen everywhere on the ground, and the earth
        appeared to be ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Princess, we have received some news…Young Master Changge, he just
          left this place not too long ago…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace died at Young Master
          Changge’s hands!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Miss Xian’er…she’s not in danger anymore. Young Master Changge
          appeared at a critical moment and saved her…all Sea Creatures of the
          Sea King Palace were slaughtered here.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then, one of Yue Mingkong’s followers stepped forward and reported
        the details to her with respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“No wonder there’s so much blood here! It turns out that he was
          here.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong was shaken by the news, but soon reacted and gave the woman
        behind her a nod in response with some feelings of relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, she felt the birth of a complicated emotion in her
        heart which she had never expected to feel…to think that Gu Changge
        would show up and save Gu Xian’er.
      </p>
      <p>He even killed the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace here.</p>
      <p>
        If she remembered correctly, then the Seventh Princess of the Sea King
        Palace was murdered by Gu Xian’er when she set off to avenge herself for
        her grievance, and then the Sea King Palace set out to hunt her down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, in this life, the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace died so
        fast?
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more? Gu Xian’er didn’t achieve a breakthrough at a critical
        moment either.
      </p>
      <p>
        The timeline was going in a different direction, and it wasn’t a good
        thing.
      </p>
      <p>‘Did I really misunderstand Gu Changge…just what is he planning…’</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong rubbed her glabella and wondered.</p>
      <p>To be honest, right now, she was shaken to her core.</p>
      <p>One time could be a coincidence, but what about a second time?</p>
      <p>What about a third time?</p>
      <p>
        Could it be that her previous life’s experience made her develop deep
        prejudice against Gu Changge in this life?
      </p>
      <p>
        Was she projecting the one she experienced in the previous life on him,
        and thinking that he had a reason for everything he did?
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, Yue Mingkong couldn’t help but question whether the past life
        she experienced was even real?
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn’t, then why were her experiences so real…every day, every
        night, every emotion, and everything else…she remembered it all so
        vividly.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it was real, then did it mean that this life and world were different
        from the one she lived previously?
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Forget it, this matter will become clear sooner or later! But what
        could have caused the Gu Changge in my previous life to be different
        from the Gu Changge in this life?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘His attitude towards Xian’er’ is indeed different from before. It seems
        I will have to take an opportunity to go to the Ancient Immortal Gu
        Family and ask Uncle Gu about it after I am done with the Ancient
        Immortal Continent.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong soon left the place as well. Since she had come to the
        Ancient Immortal Continent, she wasn’t willing to just raise her
        Cultivation Base to the False God Realm — she had other, higher
        ambitions.

      <p>
        A black and white divine light containing a strange power rushed towards
        a terrifying beast, and turned it into a hideous-looking bag of bones.
      </p>
      <p>

        amazed them. The fact that they ridiculed him before made them wonder if

      <p>
        A woman with petite and delicate features said with a tone full of
        emotions — she was dressed in a feather coat, btw. [TL/N: OV HAR
        BREATHRAN!]
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“That’s right! What’s more? He can kill False God Realm beasts in one
          blow! Even many of the Young Supremes aren’t able to achieve such a
          feat.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A red-dressed charming woman with foxtails moving behind her pursed her
        lips and smiled. At the same time, she curved her eyes, and gave off a
        seductive appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man in front of her couldn’t help but smile with satisfaction
        when he heard her words.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the purpose behind him taking the initiative to show his
        strength in front of everyone was to posture.
      </p>
      <p>What use was strength if one wasn’t posturing with it?</p>
      <p>
        How are you supposed to capture the hearts of maidens if you aren’t
        going to put on a show of might?
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, all they saw were majestic mountains and lush ancient
        forests. There were massive trees with their branches spread in all
        directions, covering the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        This place had even denser Immortal Mist streaming around. Clouds made
        of the mist floated around in all directions and displayed their strong
        vitality.
      </p>
      <p>
        They could feel countless mighty auras hidden in the mountain ruins;
        Spiritual Qi intertwined and released gorgeous brilliance in the area
        that was filled with fighting spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were ancient artifacts releasing divine brilliance, and Immortal
        Herbs releasing their medicinal fragrance that permeated the surrounding
        thousands of miles.
      </p>
      <p>Many cultivators robbed whatever they could get their hands on.</p>
      <p>
        Even ferocious beasts in the Heavenly God Realm would appear every now
        and then. Terrifying fluctuations of energy would shoot towards the sky
        and shake everything when they appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a chaotic battlefield. Be it the cultivators from the outside, or
        mighty aborigines, all of them were lost in battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under Ye Ling’s leadership, however, their group gained a lot of
        opportunities! What’s more? They were even able to turn a calamity into
        fortune, and reached their current spot without encountering any
        disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Turtle Bro, is the good stuff the Ancient Heavenly Emperor of
        Reincarnation left for me really there? Why is it in the territory of
        the aborigines? Won’t I be courting death if I go in there with my
        current strength?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling looked at the outline of the city in the distance and felt that
        it wouldn’t be easy for him to break in unnoticed, so he asked the old
        ghost in his pendant.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Humph! Where else do you think it’s going to be? Ye Ling, the Heavenly
        Venerate was a character from the Ancient Immortal Era, and he was good
        at manipulating time itself, so it’s a matter of course that he’s
        already taken care of preparing everything for you.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Sure, there are many strong figures ahead, but you are the Successor of
        the Heavenly Venerate, so how come you are such a coward…’
      </p>
      <p>The old turtle in the pendant spoke with disdain.</p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling finally put down his worries after listening to the old turtle’s
        words. After all, the old turtle was reliable most of the time, and
        wouldn’t throw him into a pit of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s just that the matter involved the secrets of the Ancient Heavenly
        Emperor of Reincarnation, so he had to make sure the others wouldn’t get
        a whiff about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling would never reveal his secret, or he would become a massive
        piece of meat desired by a lot of powerhouses who would do anything to
        get their hands on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After thinking for a while, Ye Ling thought up a plan and then winked at
        Yin Mei and Chi Ling.
      </p>
      <p>To him, these two women weren’t outsiders.</p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling and Yin Mei understood his signal, and immediately waved their
        hands to have their followers retreat.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Ye Ling, what’s the matter?”</b></p>
      <p>Chi Ling questioned.</p>
      <p>
        She couldn’t understand why Ye Ling took the initiative to lead the way
        and brought them here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I need to go to the ruins in front of me and get some stuff done! If
          you believe me, you can sneak in with me, too.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling said seriously.</p>
      <p>
        The two women had countless tricks up their sleeves, and had, in fact,
        taken good care of him on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei’s eyes rippled slightly, and she said without hesitation,
        <b>“I believe in you!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, she already knew that Gu Changge had already reached their
        location, and wasn’t far from her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] implanted in her Primordial
        Spirit, Gu Changge could pass instructions to her without needing any
        other medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling was moved when he saw that Yin Mei put unconditional trust in
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were about to sneak into the territory of the aborigines of the
        Ancient Immortal Continent, and the dangers of their actions couldn’t be
        estimated, yet Yin Mei didn’t hesitate at all in her response…it showed
        how much she trusted him.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, Chi Ling, too, chose to agree as she, too, believed in Ye
        Ling’s character.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, Ye Ling explained his plan and arrangements to the two, and
        how they would sneak into the ruins.
      </p>
      <p><b>[On a nearby mountain peak.]</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s figure appeared out of thin air and he looked at the ruins
        in the distance with a smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        It didn’t take him long to find his destination with the trail left by
        Yin Mei.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this operation, Gu Changge decided not to bring any of his
        followers, as it would be stupid to be too high-profile at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘According to Yin Mei’s report, Ye Ling’s opportunity should be hidden
        inside those ruins, but it will take him some time to sneak inside.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I will have enough time to sneak in and find their ancestral tombs and
        finish my job.’
      </p>
      <p>
        As he thought of this, the Void in front of Gu Changge blurred and he
        stepped inside it and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the previous experience, he was far more familiar with the process
        of locating ancestral tombs and sneaking in.

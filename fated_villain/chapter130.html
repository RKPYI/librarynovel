        <h4>Chapter 130: Top-Tier Ancient Corpse; Gu Xian’er in Trouble!</h4>
        <p> Several days passed in the blink of an eye. </p>
        <p> <b>[In a vast area to the east of the Ancient Immortal Continent.]</b> </p>
        <p> <b>[Boom!]</b> </p>
        <p> A mountain range resembling an earthen dragon exploded after a terrifying attack hit it. </p>
        <p> A forbidden artifact that resembled an umbrella soared into the sky and released thousands of sacred lights
            that fell on the mountain below and illuminated it. </p>
        <p> <b>"Catch her! Don't let her escape."</b> </p>
        <p> A large group of sea men chased after a slender figure while shouting. </p>
        <p> The slender figure turned into a brilliant ray of light and escaped at breakneck speed. It appeared that the
            figure possessed some secret art that allowed her to suddenly increase her speed many times over. </p>
        <p> ‘These bastards just won't give up! Why are there so many people from the Sea Heritages here?' </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er showed a frown on her tired face. </p>
        <p> After taking a look behind her, she decided to sacrifice a pitch-black long knife. Brilliant runes flashed
            around the blade, and it flew through the air and immediately slaughtered all the creatures chasing after
            her. </p>
        <p> She had killed countless people chasing after her over the past few days — this was already the third wave
            of people she slaughtered today. If it weren't for her sensitive perception, then the forbidden artifact
            would have seriously injured her just now. </p>
        <p> <b>"They are still chasing and trying to kill that girl in blue!"</b> </p>
        <p> <b>"She's too miserable! Now that she has offended the Sea King Palace, no one in this area would dare to
                lend her a hand."</b> </p>
        <p> <b>"I heard she's surnamed Gu and they said she's also related to the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal
                Gu Family…I don't know how much truth those claims hold, though."</b> </p>
        <p> <b>"What's the use of her relationship with him? I heard there's a grudge between her and Young Master Gu.
                What a pity? She's such a beautiful girl."</b> </p>
        <p> <b>"Even the disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace don't dare to help her."</b> </p>
        <p> A large group of cultivators were shocked when they noticed the scene, but they only dared to watch from
            afar. </p>
        <p> This scene was the norm for the past few days in their region. </p>
        <p> The news spread far and wide and brought along countless cultivators who desired to join in on the fun. </p>
        <p> The Sea King Palace was far too mighty. Although they knew that the girl might be related to Gu Changge,
            they still sent people to hunt her down without a care for the consequences. </p>
        <p> A lot of people from the Sea Families entered the Ancient Immortal Continent, so all of them obeyed the Sea
            King Palace's command. </p>
        <p> What's more? The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace guaranteed that she would reward whoever caught
            that girl with a Mystical Ability and a favor. </p>
        <p> The reward attracted the attention of many. </p>
        <p> It's just that most of the cultivators didn't dare to intervene after they learned that the girl was
            surnamed Gu, and Gu Changge's attitude towards her was hard to tell. </p>
        <p> That's why they could only watch from afar. </p>
        <p> ‘Dammit! Why do they have so many people?!' </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er's expression froze over. She just got rid of a bunch of their people, yet before she could rest,
            another group started to chase after her. </p>
        <p> The void trembled and vast fluctuations and brilliant runes rushed towards her; they had used another
            forbidden weapon with great might. </p>
        <p> The mountain in front of her exploded, and the shockwave affected her — her blood churned and her innards
            tumbled as a sweet sensation assaulted her throat after the attack injured her. </p>
        <p> Although Gu Xian’er had an amazing physique, she was dead tired after not finding any time to rest over the
            past few days because people kept chasing her for her life. </p>
        <p> This enraged and aggrieved her, but there was nothing she could do about it. </p>
        <p> Those people from the Sea Families were like maggots that one couldn’t get rid of, even if they were killed
            one after another. </p>
        <p> There were even a few Young Supremes in the Conferred King Realm chasing after her among their group, and
            their combined assault left Gu Xian’er no choice but to escape. </p>
        <p> In fact…she did have quite a few cards up her sleeve, still, like the Mystical Weapons given to her by her
            masters, but she didn’t want to waste those treasures in a minor skirmish like this — for her, this event
            could be regarded as an experience grinding opportunity. </p>
        <p> Still…Gu Xian’er regretted killing that young man without hesitation a few days ago since all of this
            started from that. </p>
        <p> What could she do? His eyes enraged her quite a bit and she couldn’t help but murder them. </p>
        <p> ‘It’s all Gu Changge’s fault! I wouldn’t have murdered that person if he hadn’t soured my mood…’ </p>
        <p> ‘Everything is his fault! I will find him and settle all the accounts together.’ UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m
            nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m</p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er put all the blame on Gu Changge’s head. </p>
        <p> What’s more? Didn’t he say others weren’t allowed to bully her? </p>
        <p> Where was he now that so many shrimp and fish soldiers were trying to hunt her down? </p>
        <p> It would have been great if she didn’t remember Gu Changge, but now that she did remember him, Gu Xian’er
            couldn’t help but feel her anger and grievance surge. </p>
        <p> To be honest, she did understand that she was deluding herself. After all, Gu Changge no longer bothered
            about her. </p>
        <p> Why would he care about her life and death? </p>
        <p> Once she died…no one would seek revenge for her. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge would be happy if that happened. </p>
        <p> The fact that the Sea King Palace chased after her for her life had already alarmed countless Young Supremes
            in all parts of the Continent, so how could Gu Changge — a mighty Young Supreme with innumerable followers —
            not know about her predicament? </p>
        <p> Yet, so many days passed and he did nothing to help her, and this explained Gu Changge’s attitude towards
            her. </p>
        <p> ‘Gu Xian’er, why are you so delusional? Just what are you looking forward to?’ </p>
        <p> Soon, Gu Xian’er shook her head and discarded all distracting thoughts from her mind. </p>
        <p> She continued her escape. </p>
        <p> A pair of faint, dazzling wings appeared behind her with brilliant runes lingering around them, and her
            speed soared to another height. </p>
        <p> Fortunately, her masters taught her quite a few means of escape. </p>
        <p> She wouldn’t encounter any major trouble for a while, but Gu Xian’er still felt somewhat lost in her heart.
        </p>
        <p> …… </p>
        <p> ‘Is this where the aborigines gather?’ </p>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> Gu Changge stood on a mountain and looked ahead with an expression of interest. In front of him, he could
            see a valley. </p>
        <p> Majestic purple mountains surrounded the valley, and each mountain overflowed with a purple energy that gave
            them a hazy appearance. </p>
        <p> The valley was vast beyond measure, with a large number of ruins and cities. </p>
        <p> There were dozens of magnificent palaces and pavilions lying around in the valley, and it appeared that the
            place used to be some sort of a holy land in the past. </p>
        <p> <b>“Sir, this is where our tribe lives.”</b> </p>
        <p> The aboriginal creatures kneeled in front of Gu Changge with pale faces and informed him while trembling in
            fear. </p>
        <p> They carefully guided Gu Changge and brought him all the way here in hopes that the mighty figures of their
            tribe would save them. </p>
        <p> They appeared to be on their knees in horror, but in their hearts, they quietly planned to use a secret
            method to contact them… </p>
        <p> Gu Changge, however, looked at them with a strange glint in his eyes. </p>
        <p> Then, with a puff, several blood mists burst in front of him as the creatures lay on the ground, unable to
            withstand Gu Changge’s gaze and aura. </p>
        <p> How could Gu Changge fail to predict their little tricks? Even if he predicted it wrong, it didn’t really
            matter. </p>
        <p> <b>“All of you wait for me here.”</b> </p>
        <p> After that, Gu Changge left a command for his followers and then his figure turned into a blur and he
            disappeared in the void. </p>
        <p> <b>“Understood, Master!”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s followers weren’t surprised by Gu Changge’s countless powerful and mysterious methods. </p>
        <p> At the same time, they dared not ask Gu Changge about his purpose in coming here. </p>
        <p> Since Gu Changge asked them to wait here, then they would wholeheartedly obey his command. </p>
        <p> On the other side, Gu Changge’s figure shuttled through the void. </p>
        <p> <b>[Hum!]</b> </p>
        <p> He noticed countless aboriginal creatures with strong auras in the ancient ruined city. Most of them were in
            the True God Realm, but there were also many in the Heavenly God Realm. </p>
        <p> Some of them were even in the God King Realm, and there was even a Sacred Realm master. </p>
        <p> It’s just that he sat cross-legged in one of the palaces, with divine lights flowing all over his body, and
            cultivated quietly. </p>
        <p> ‘It shouldn’t be hard for me to kill this Sacred Realm master if I sneak an attack on him…’ </p>
        <p> ‘Nah! I should head to these aboriginal peoples’ ancestral tombs first.’ </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s figure had completely merged with the void, and he held a golden rune in his hand that kept on
            flashing with a brilliant light. </p>
        <p> The [Divine-grade Aura Concealment Talisman] could perfectly hide his aura. </p>
        <p> The strength of this group of aboriginal people made Gu Changge believe that the strength of their ancestors
            buried in their ancestral tombs wouldn’t be all that bad. </p>
        <p> At the very least, there should be Quasi-Supremes buried there… </p>
        <p> Gu Changge felt that he could take advantage of the situation and break through to the God King Realm in one
            fell swoop. </p>
        <p> As long as he could get his hands on enough essence, even Quasi-Supreme wouldn’t be impossible to reach.
        </p>
        <p> ‘Those who seek treasures must take great risks.’ </p>
        <p> To be honest, he wouldn’t need to take much risk. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge had a lot of cards up his sleeve, so even if a Great Sacred Realm master or a Quasi-Supreme
            popped out of somewhere, he wouldn’t panic at all. </p>
        <p> <b>[Hum!]</b> </p>
        <p> The void trembled, but the fluctuations didn’t attract much attention. </p>
        <p> With that, Gu Changge smoothly reached the depths of the ancient ruined city. He passed through countless
            large buildings and palaces, and shuttled all the way to the innermost region of the place. </p>
        <p> Occasionally, he would feel a majestic divine sense fall everywhere, like Mount Tai pressing down on
            everything, and that made Gu Changge frown. </p>
        <p> ‘A small place like this actually has a transcendent Quasi-Supreme…’ </p>
        <p> Of course, the Quasi-Supreme’s existence didn’t worry Gu Changge. He still had his inner world, so he could
            hide inside there if some accident transpired. </p>
        <p> What’s more? He knew the characteristics of the aboriginal peoples’ tombs, so he wasn’t worried about not
            finding their actual ancestral tombs. </p>
        <p> He went all the way without causing the slightest sound or fluctuation. </p>
        <p> <b>[About half an hour later.]</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge finally saw a tall and simple tomb with ancient characters engraved everywhere on it, and the
            appearance of the tomb showed that it was at least tens of millions of years old. </p>
        <p> In addition, he noticed countless formations and several altars prepared in the place. </p>
        <p> Guarding the tomb were two powerful centipede-like creatures with purple faces and Quasi-Sacred Realm
            Cultivation Bases. </p>
        <p> ‘These tombs in the Ancient Immortal Continent have been nourished by the essence of the sun and the moon
            and overwhelming Spiritual Qi for countless years, so they should have a lot of their original essence
            preserved…they should have several times the essence when compared to the ancient corpses in the outside
            world…’ </p>
        <p> ‘They might just go crazy when they realize that someone dug up their ancestral graves! This isn’t a blame
            you would want to carry, Ye Ling.’ </p>
        <p> Gu Changge showed a somewhat playful expression as he thought in his heart. </p>
        <p> Soon, the void blurred and his figure stepped out. </p>
        <p> At the same time, the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] radiated monstrous fiendish energy that covered the
            sky. Gu Changge held the Halberd in his hand and slashed it straight down, as if he was trying to shatter
            the universe itself. </p>
        <p> <b>“Who?!”</b> </p>
        <p> The two creatures guarding the tombs were shocked, and had no time to react. </p>
        <p> A dazzling black light fell in front of them at breakneck speed! </p>
        <p> <b>[Puff!]</b> </p>
        <p> The hard scale armor burst apart and blood splattered in every direction! </p>
        <p> Gu Changge swept away one of them, and directly destroyed his body as his Halberd pierced through it in
            mid-air. </p>
        <p> The body of the Quasi-Sacred Realm master was like crumpled paper in front of the [Eight Desolate Demon
            Halberd]! </p>
        <p> <b>“Who are you?!”</b>
        <div id="pf-9473-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1" })</script>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p> The other creature was stunned; he never expected such a young man to appear in their ancestral tomb out of
            nowhere. </p>
        <p> Moreover, the youth severely injured its companion and made him lose all combat effectiveness within a
            blink. </p>
        <p> <b>“Please make way if you don’t want to die.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge said with a light smile, as if he hadn’t attacked them already. </p>
        <p> <b>“YOU…”</b> </p>
        <p> The other creature’s fury soared after he understood Gu Changge’s words through his Spiritual Sense. </p>
        <p> Just when his majestic Quasi-Sacred Realm aura soared, another ray of dazzling black light cut through the
            void. Its arm was directly cut off with a puff, and black blood splattered everywhere! </p>
        <p> Gu Changge showed a leisurely expression after easily dealing with the two. </p>
        <p> Soon, he avoided the formations in front of him and entered the ancestral tomb. </p>
        <p> <b>[Boom!]</b> </p>
        <p> A primordial aura of decay rushed towards him! </p>
        <p> Gu Changge swept the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd] and broke open the coffin in front of him. </p>
        <p> Corpses after corpses rolled out one after another with a thud. </p>
        <p> <b>“My harvest won’t be bad, it seems.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge muttered to himself in satisfaction. </p>
        <p> In his opinion, the corpses in front of him belonged to the topmost tier. </p>
        <p> All the corpses in front of him contained rich essence — both men and women, young and old — and wore
            different dresses that showed the fact that all of them were from different eras and dynasties…well, they
            were far from their current era. </p>
        <p> They were an ancient group of dead people. </p>
        <p> The weakest among them should have been in the Great Sacred Realm during his lifetime, but right now, they
            just looked weird. </p>
        <p> There was an old Daoist priest in a worn-out feather robe, exuding a decadent aura, that made it seem as if
            he was just dug out from a grave. [TL/N: bRuH?] </p>
        <p> There was also an ancient emperor, wearing a broken purple-gold crown, who appeared as if he had just
            crawled out of soil. </p>
        <p> There were also celestial women wearing silk robes, but their dresses were worn out, as if they were eaten
            by monsters. </p>
        <p> In addition, there were monks in cassocks with shriveled skin that seemed to have been casted from gold.
        </p>
        <p> There were also countless creatures from ancient times with tall bodies, but their wings appeared dry and
            cracked… </p>
        <p> As Gu Changge swept a glance at the ‘meal’ in front of him, dark runes of the Great Dao started to
            materialize in the palms of his hands, and joined together to form Natural Laws. </p>
        <p> After that, corpses began to float up and down in front of him. </p>
        <p> A ray of green light then emerged from the corpses, resembling magnificent and fantastic starlight. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge sat cross-legged and a Dao passage loomed behind him. Wisps of black light appeared from the
            passage and turned into pitch-black [Great Dao Treasured Bottles] that swallowed all the brilliance. </p>
        <p> He refined and absorbed the essence, and that constantly strengthened and increased his aura. </p>
        <p> A strange and mysterious pitch-black vortex formed as he absorbed everything. </p>
        <p> …… </p>
        <p> Three days passed since Gu Changge went deep into the ancestral tomb of the aborigines. </p>
        <p> <b>[In a vast mountain range right now.]</b> </p>
        <p> Blood trickled down the corner of Gu Xian’er’s mouth, and she stared ahead with frosty eyes. </p>
        <p> Vast, white fog rolled and swept in through all directions, covering an area of tens of thousands of miles
            in front of her. </p>
        <p> Brilliant runes flickered inside the fog, and the aura of an extremely tyrannical formation permeated the
            surroundings. </p>
        <p> A group of people from the Sea Families’ had prepared an ambush for her here. </p>
        <p> Head after head of the Sea Families’ fierce beasts appeared in every direction. All of them had huge bodies
            that would shock and terrify whoever faced them, and flaming runes revolved around their bodies. </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace sent countless talents of the Sea Families’ to hunt her down.
        </p>
        <p> She refused to give up on taking revenge for her brother’s murder. </p>
        <p> What’s more? Gu Xian’er had killed countless people from the Sea Families’ dispatched by her over this time,
            and that rubbed her face in the mud and enraged the Seventh Princess even more. </p>
        <p> Because of this, she set up a great formation of the Sea Families’ and firmly surrounded Gu Xian’er to take
            her down. </p>
        <p> The entire place turned into an area shrouded in white mist, and seemed as if they were above the sea now.
        </p>
        <p> Lightning flashed and thunder thundered, violent storms raged on, and all kinds of brilliant runes and
            Mystical Abilities intertwined together to create a gorgeous entrapment. </p>
        <p> At the same time, it attracted the attention of countless cultivators in the area, who watched from afar
            with different expressions. </p>
        <p> <b>“The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace is too ruthless! She sent so many people just to hunt down a
                little girl, and now, she even brought out the Sea King’s Great Array — even a True God will find it
                hard to escape now.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Her brother got murdered, so what do you expect? Who can blame her for going this far?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“I heard that the Crown Princess of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty rushed over to help her, but another
                female Young Supreme held her back; the two of them are engaged in battle right now, so I don’t think
                she will be able to come to this girl’s support any time soon.”</b> </p>
        <p> Just when the cultivators were discussing the matter, they heard a loud voice from the sky. </p>
        <p> The weather shockingly changed, and the world trembled under the sound of horseshoes stomping down on the
            void. </p>
        <p> It was as if thousands of troops were rushing to kill a monster, and the sound of slaughter was so loud, it
            could shock the world. </p>
        <p> A golden warhorse trampled the sky under its hooves burning with golden flames. </p>
        <p> On the warhorse sat a blue-haired woman dressed in golden armor, who held a spear in her right hand and
            looked ahead with an indifferent and contemptuous expression. </p>
        <p> She stared at Gu Xian’er, who stood on the mountain in front of her with a cold and pale face, and sneered,
            <b>“Little b!tch, where are you going to escape today?”</b> </p>
        <p> Countless sea creatures nearby respectfully saluted her when they saw the scene in front of them,
            <b>“Congratulations, Seventh Princess!”</b> </p>
        <p> The expressions of all the cultivators watching from afar changed, <b>“Holy crap! Was the Seventh Princess
                of the Sea King Palace always this strong? She’s already broken through to the Peak of the Conferred
                King Realm!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“No wonder she’s so bold! She’s simply invincible!”</b> </p>
        <p> They were shocked by the Seventh Princess’s terrifying strength, and realized that they had underestimated
            the Young Supremes and cultivators of the Sea Families’.</p>

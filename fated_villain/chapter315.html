          Changge asked neutrally, marching towards him. A terrifying aura
          exuded from him, settling over the crowd and nearly choking them. He
          did not care for the other man even after guessing his identity; he
          was more interested in whether there was a leader for these Eternal
          Overcast creatures. The man before him might be powerful but he
          didn&#8217;t look like their leader.</span

          >&#8220;Outsider, what do you want?&#8221; The man in purple and gold
          armour looked at him warily. Yin Energy emerged on the man&#8217;s
          palm to form a long spear which dripped with Sacred King Realm
          Principles. The power it had was too frightening, yet did not faze Gu
          Changge at all. Besides, the other Eternal Overcast creatures were far
          weaker than him, with some among them only just entering the Sacred
          Realm.</span

          >As he lifted his hand, a brilliant light emitted from it. A black
          machete, the condensation of many terrifying runes and Principles,
          appeared and sliced in a horizontal arc. It was so shiny and sharp
          that it might be able to cut through the universe and the skies.</span

          too late to react, as the machete&#8217;s motion cut them into half at
          the waist and killed them. They could not even withstand the slightest
          energy from the machete. Even the Sacred King Realm man in the purple
          and gold armour grunted and spat blood at the attack, his spear
          breaking before he flew backwards.

          human massacring the creatures with no fear for the Yin Energy of the
          area. This human did not even fear them at all, choosing to attack and
          kill them instead. He was terrified by this as he had only used his
          divine sense to investigate the man, that was all.</span

          >Murderous Principles of great strength swirled around the black
          machete. The presence of his Absolute Detachment Bones ensured that he
          did not need to waste his time enlightening himself about Principles.
          Thus, his ability to control and understand the Principles far
          surpassed the other Sacred King Realm experts, despite him only in the
          Sacred Lord Realm. This made the man not be able to sensed the shift
          in space from his movements despite being the Sacred King Realm.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With a loud pop, the machete struck again, slicing into the armoured
          man. Pale grey blood spattered from him, yet his life force was still
          strong and he wasn&#8217;t dead yet. He was just terrified and
          suffering greatly. Currently, the Chaos Principles applied from the
          machete had made him unable to heal.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Ah…&#8221; His expression was extremely terrified. He was now
          looking at Gu Changge like the man was a devil, and was more
          frightened of him than a normal cultivator encountering an Eternal
          Overcast creature. Gu Changge did not look at him, though, choosing to
          ignore him.</span

          >&#8220;Still refusing to come out?&#8221; he asked again, his hand
          moving more forcefully. With a surge of power, the knife continued to
          slice through the armoured man and nearly tore him apart. The other
          Eternal Overcast creatures were far too shocked and scared of Gu
          Changge and did not dare approach him.</span

          pleaded for help from the boat in an obscure and incomprehensible
          language. He was now scared of this man, who refused to be reasonable
          and chose to seriously wound him first. He might be indescribably
          powerful, but he had no time to display his techniques or skills at
          all.</span

          boat, accompanied by a wave of energy which was far more terrifying
          than before. The energy surrounded them and felt like the skies which
          had fallen on top of them.</span

          >The black machete broke into pieces and was carelessly discarded,
          while he rolled up his sleeves and pushed his palm in a strike which
          blocked out the sky. A rumbling sound echoed around the area and the
          air became saturated with energy and Principles. Strange and
          frightening phenomena appeared below the strike, including great
          mountains and rivers, the heavens, and even the world.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          disappearing. It could not withstand the strike even if it was from
          the Land of Eternal Overcast.</span

          light, which seemed to cleave up the sky and the land. A tall slim
          figure in a long black dress and bells on her ankle appeared, her
          black hair cascading like a waterfall. Her face was pale and smooth,
          yet her gaze was cold and as dignified as that of a god.

          It moved towards him, blindingly bright yet terrifying. Her Scared
          Emperor Realm might shook the earth, as she struck and seemed able to
          shatter the space around them.

          condensation of runes and Principles, broke as it couldn&#8217;t
          withstand the strike. He wasn&#8217;t worried about it though, and
          made a quick retreat but was rapidly pursued by the woman.
          Fortunately, the space they were in, the crack, was extremely vast.

          techniques and sealing off the world. The entire space was now bound
          as she tried to bind Gu Changge. However, a crisp cracking sound was
          heard.</span

          >A halberd exuding great amounts of demonic energy sliced towards her
          and cut through the many seals around the space. Her pupils contracted
          and her sword moved to counter it. It made a loud cracking sound,
          unable to stand the force of the attack. It wasn&#8217;t that she was
          weak, just that the weapon was far too terrifying. She could feel the
          extremely strong murderous energy just from the clashing with this
          weapon.

          strength the way Gu Changge had. Her useless brother was in the Sacred

          encountered the people from the Kingdom, it wouldn&#8217;t have been
          so easy. He was powerful but was no match for the Eldest Princess.
          Even the Sacred King Realm brother wearing armour from before could
          defeat him easily.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, Gu Changge was different. He could easily negotiate with the
          Kingdom and demand great benefits in the process. This would be
          helpful when he took control of the Eternal Overcast.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[So, this is the effect of the Amethyst Fortuity Crown…] He thought,
          gazing at the woman as he began to plot how he could benefit greatly
          from her. The founding of the Kingdom was definitely connected to the
          Eternal Overcast Sources, which was just the thing he needed now. The
          woman seemed wary of him and refused to talk about many other things,
          but he wasn&#8217;t worried about that for now.</span

          >&#8220;You must be the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme
          Being, then. No other person would know how to use a Reincarnation
          Technique. It&#8217;s okay, I do not have any evil intentions.&#8221;
          The woman spoke again, her tone now more friendly than before. To show
          her honesty, she released the Sacred Emperor Realm power she was
          exuding.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge raised his eyebrows and smiled meaningfully. &#8220;I did
          inherit a lot from the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, so you
          could say that I am his Successor.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The woman did not know why he had said that, but she now knew that
          this man was the person she was looking for and felt relieved. She
          wasn&#8217;t going to ponder why he had shown up here.</span

          the grey fog and travelling at a tremendous speed. The Eternal
          Overcast creatures as well as the man in purple and gold armour did
          not know what had occurred or why the duo had suddenly stopped
          fighting.</span

          people behind her, speaking directly to Gu Changge.</span

          >&#8220;My purpose for leaving the Kingdom was to find you. The
          Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had left behind knowledge about
          the Principles of Reincarnation…&#8221; The woman was open and honest
          about her purpose for being there. She might have to resort to a more
          forceful approach if he did not agree.</span

          interested. I just want to know what deal you&#8217;re planning to
          make with me.&#8221;</span

          >The woman&#8217;s expression was briefly stunned as Gu Changge
          interrupted her unexpectedly, not listening to her explanations. Such
          behaviour was a little surprising. [Was I being too overbearing and
          arrogant? Or, is this man only interested in the benefits he can
          gain?]</span

          >&#8220;My family needs the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme
          Being&#8217;s assistance to forge a Reincarnation Platform. Since the
          Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being has disappeared without a trace
          and it isn&#8217;t known if he&#8217;s still living, we have to ask
          for your help instead. As for the terms of the deal, the Kingdom will
          do everything we can in order to satisfy you, including destroying any
          force which dispeases you.&#8221; The woman said with pride in her
          voice.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Forge a Reincarnation Platform?&#8221; Gu Changge realised
          immediately that this matter had something to do with the secrets of
          the Eternal Overcast Kingdom. The woman would never tell him about it
          but that wasn&#8217;t important to him. He was just focused on the
          benefits which the Kingdom could grant him. Destroying the other
          forces? That sounded pompous, but they might be able to do so
          considering how peculiar they were.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No problem. I can agree to this deal.&#8221; Gu Changge did
          not hesitate. This was such a great offer that he wished he could have
          more like this.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You agree?&#8221; The woman was confused, not expecting him to
          agree so readily. This makes things easier, though. She had no other
          intentions and would never fake anything. Gu Changge, of course, swore
          it on his Dao Heart, which he had done so many times. Besides, the
          more he gained the better. He need not even consider the consequences,
          as none of that matters to him since they were practically
          non-existent to him.</span

          >The sincere way he behaved seemed to show he wasn&#8217;t lying. She
          was already fearful after hearing so many consequences of such vows
          being unfulfilled. She felt more relaxed at this and liked him more.
          His decisive and direct manner was just what she liked.</span

          The woman nodded although she didn&#8217;t know what he wanted from
          them.</span

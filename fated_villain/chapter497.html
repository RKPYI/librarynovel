          Realm camping outside Sky Deer City. Black clouds blocked out the sky
          for millions of kilometres, the size making giant stars look like
          dust.</span

          anxious. They became worried that the array protecting the city would
          be broken, allowing the supreme experts outside to charge in.

          >Many Upper Realm experts could be seen attacking the city every day,
          causing brilliant light to illuminate the sky and causing the
          surrounding area to explode and collapse. The scent of blood and
          burning spread everywhere as great swathes of the ground cracked. Even
          the arrays made by past supreme experts could not withstand the
          aftershocks from these attacks.</span

          >Eventually, the experts in Sky Deer City decided to stop fighting and
          barricaded the city to prevent more unnecessary losses. While it did
          fulfil its purpose, it was still a great blow for those of the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains. The attitude of their supreme experts
          seemed to indicate they were waiting for the Upper Realm to invade Sky
          Deer City without putting up a fight. This made the people feel
          desperate, even thinking that the day this city would get invaded
          would mean the beginning of the end, where they would start to be
          exploited and enslaved.</span

          retrospect. We don&#8217;t have the strength to fight against the
          Upper Realm Army, so it&#8217;s better to surrender. That Gu Changge
          is far too powerful and it&#8217;s unimaginable that such a person

          >In the depths of Sky Deer City, there was a place which seemed to be
          in its own universe, which resembled a deserted barren star.
          Terrifying puddles filled with different colours of blood could be
          seen on the ruined ground, emanating a terrifying aura. It was so
          powerful even a Sacred King Realm expert could feel his body nearly
          exploding. Ancient coffins which had been dug out lay haphazardly
          everywhere. The place was enormous, reflecting giant stars dimly
          shimmering. A black-coloured river flowed along, expelling black light
          mixed in with a myriad of Principles.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sounds suddenly came from the dug-up coffins, which contained supreme
          experts who were suspected to have died in battle with the Upper
          Realm, who all held unrivalled power. However, no one knew that they
          hadn&#8217;t actually died but instead hid out here. Their reason had
          been the fear of death. So, they had faked their deaths in order to
          trick those of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >While they did not have the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;s determination to
          pledge her loyalty to the Upper Realm, they did not want to die for
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains either. A discussion had led to
          the idea of playing dead. After which, they were buried here by their
          respective clans.

          happened in the outside world. Many orders or messages which dictated
          the direction and important issues in the Ten Domains and Eight
          Directions had come from this place, albeit in secret since several of
          their peers didn&#8217;t even know they were still alive.</span

          >A voice suddenly came from a frightening-looking coffin, which had
          blood seeping from. This was an unimaginably old being who held great
          seniority in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, who was a Vermilion
          Bird War God Clan Ancestor.</span

          >&#8220;We should go back to our respective clans. In my opinion, the
          best thing to do is to seal up our clans, barring anyone to leave. We
          can hide in smaller worlds, where it would be hard to find us and wait
          for things to quiet down before we reappear with new appearances. If
          Sky Deer City is conquered, leave it be. That could buy us some time
          to prepare.&#8221;</span

          >Another voice spoke, this time from a dark and shadowy cave. While
          light swirled within, the voice sounded exceptionally cold as if the
          owner did not care about the lives of those in Sky Deer City. That
          made sense since if not for their clans, they wouldn&#8217;t even care
          about the fate of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. At their
          cultivation level, everything was impermanent. Even Immortal Sects
          would fall one day, much less Sky Deer City or the Eight Wastelands
          and Ten Domains. In their view, nothing held any value except for
          their own Dao and their legacy.</span

          >Footsteps came suddenly from another direction, resonating in the
          deserted space. This was a youthful-looking man with pale skin and
          long hair, yet his gaze looked somewhat tired as Chaos Qi surrounded
          him. His arrival caused a great stir among those who sensed this; the
          coffins began to shake slightly before becoming ajar, as the figures
          emanating blood-coloured light within materialised. Their appearance
          was accompanied by an all-encompassing energy powerful enough to cause
          the universe to collapse.</span

          Prime Ancestor, and his existence could be traced back to the birth of
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. Thus, many ancient beings had to
          call him his Senior. Many had heard of him already halfway past the
          threshold of the next cultivation realm a long time ago. His power
          could not be calculated even now. None of those present expected him
          to be here and besides, he was like a living fossil who had lived
          through the history of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span

          his gaze neutral. He wasn&#8217;t exactly tall but held a
          poorly-hidden air of invincibility. &#8220;I&#8217;m here to awaken my

          connection with the Upper Realm here and as such, existed a mysterious
          place. This place resembles the land where people entered

          Those who had tried exploded into ashes and died after coming into
          contact with the supreme Principles inside. They all knew that the
          place would contain Principles exceeding the Nirvana Realm since it
          involved the Power of Reincarnation, which was one of the most
          mysterious forces of all. Anyone touching it would only end up
          dying.</span

          confidence and reassurance. He looked like he had other plans and did
          not care about the threat presented by the Upper Realm. He had never
          appeared in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains before either.</span

          silver light to counter the oppressiveness of the mysterious place.
          The black river converged like the Yellow Spring, to form a deathly
          quiet sea in a lower attitude area. It was silent and dark, with many
          spirits wandering along the river before transforming into clouds of
          bright dust, which moved into the sea.</span

          obscure and profound energy. An old tree with withered leaves and
          branches could be seen growing within it, surrounded by faint strands
          of light. Black mountains stood around the sea, all possessing ancient
          caves which emitted multicoloured light and mist, resembling celestial
          caves. An oppressive energy exuded from one of those caves meanwhile,
          the others were silent without any sign of vibrations.</span

          cultivator&#8217;s soul, which was the result of different Daos
          colliding. The vibrations caused by their mutual neutralisation made
          even Lin Qinglong grunt and stumble. Had Gu Changge been here, he
          would have discovered that the place was connected to the Fortuity of

          avoid any confrontation. Several unofficial sources even said that the

          causing shock, anger, confusion, and desperation. Of course, no one
          knew if it was true. Likewise, it was not like they were going to get
          clarification from those True Daoists. The societal levels of the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were extremely rigid, so normal folk

          direction, enclosing the Chaos Qi below and protecting the enormous

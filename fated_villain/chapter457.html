          >The Sky Deer Goddess was captivatingly beautiful. Her body was
          slender and glamorous, as though she was a tall Buddha Lotus, and her
          arching brows were elegant beyond compare. Her entire body was covered
          in divine light such that no one could resist ignoring her

          notice her presence. Essentially, there was a unique field around her
          body. Except for those whom she wanted to meet, no one else would be
          able to see her. Not only was this an exceptional display of her
          abilities, but it also showcased her wondrous mastery over the Great
          Dao.</span

          to have existed since the Upper Realm and Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains&#8217; separation. The Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;s tracks, on the
          other hand, were even more impossible to find. For the past countless
          epochs, there were hardly a handful of living beings who had ever laid
          eyes on her.</span

          and Ten Domains force thinks that Lu Luo can no longer be saved now
          that she is in the hands of the Upper Realm. No one would ever choose
          to help me at such a moment.&#8221;</span

          didn&#8217;t seem pretentious but was genuine instead. Gradually, he
          calmed himself down and bitterly chuckled. Though, suspicion remained

          protect all living beings of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains from
          danger. There&#8217;s nothing confusing about it, is

          were traces from past battles. In some spots, figures without the
          faintest Lift Force could be seen sitting, yet it was as though they
          were subtly moving.</span

          Deer Goddess, he suddenly felt a heavy weight on his shoulders.</span

          >There weren&#8217;t many people on the streets, but many of them were
          faces familiar to Lin Wu. Nonetheless, when they saw him, they
          couldn&#8217;t help but feel sympathy and pity for him.</span

          >After the Upper Realm&#8217;s seized the Immortal-Killing Gourd, it
          stirred up quite a commotion in Sky Deer City. Many thought that Lin
          Wu&#8217;s actions were selfish. He chose to save the few while
          rendering significantly more of them to be sacrifices.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, some individuals were aware that the matter was out of
          Lin Wu&#8217;s control, as the outcome wouldn&#8217;t have been any
          better even if he didn&#8217;t surrender the Immortal-Killing Gourd.
          After all, Gu Changge was too powerful, and many inferred that his
          strength had surpassed the Sacred Emperor Realm. Under such a massive
          disparity, Lin Wu simply had no other choice. Furthermore, his beloved
          was captured as well.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What a pitiful man. I wonder what he will do now…&#8221; The
          street-walkers heaved a sigh after they watched Lin Wu&#8217;s fading
          away, but they didn&#8217;t seem to have seen the Sky Deer Goddess,
          who was walking in front of him.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, Lin Wu and the Sky Deer Goddess arrived at a pavilion—one
          of the most popular pavilions in Sky Deer City. Beside it, there was a
          fluid spirit spring, in which its water vaporises into Immortal Mists
          as it wafted around.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Lin Wu was baffled to see the young woman, who seemed to be around
          his age, but he had never seen her before. Though, tactfully, he
          didn&#8217;t ask any questions.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, as she raised her arm, faint, clear gleam dispersed
          and surrounded the ancient pavilion, entrapping every motion
          within.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sceptically, Lin Wu peered at the Sky Deer Goddess as he wished to
          know what her plan was, given how it needed such caution.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s not exactly safe within Sky Deer City. The Upper
          Realm planted many spies among us without us knowing, so it is best
          for us to remain prudent,&#8221; the Sky Deer Goddess smilingly
          explained after seeing his puzzled look.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Lin Wu was stunned. He never expected Sky Deer City,
          which he thought was the safest place, to contain spies from the Upper
          Realm. Since it was the Sky Deer Goddess who made such a claim, it
          must not be false. After all, no one was more knowledgeable about Sky
          Deer City than her.</span

          stern expression and asked.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >&#8220;In three days, I will leave Sky Deer City with you to rescue
          your beloved from the Boundary Marker Sea. During that time, you must
          not disclose my whereabouts, nor should you mention this matter to
          anyone else. I need you to swear that you can do that,&#8221; the Sky
          Deer Goddess stated as she looked outside the ancient pavilion,
          seemingly towards the Boundary Marker Sea.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          do that.&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I trust you.&#8221; The Sky Deer City&#8217;s expression was
          warm. She then continued, &#8220;In that case, we shall rendezvous
          three days later. In the meantime, you may gather help from people you
          deem trustworthy.&#8221;</span

          >Finished, she raised her snowy hand once again. As faint, clear light
          reemerged, Lin Wu disappeared and reappeared outside the ancient
          pavilion.</span

          heart. He was headed to the Lin Family&#8217;s base to gather help.
          Simultaneously, he sent a message to Lu Cui to invite her to
          participate in his attempt to rescue Lu Luo.</span

          surged on her face, after which she heaved a sigh and said,
          &#8220;This journey holds an uncertain fate for me. The future is
          undecided. If I don&#8217;t make it back, the safety of Sky Deer City

          trying to avenge me. It’s best if you remain in the city and focus on
          cultivating.&#8221; Her tone was ever so serene, as if she had

          it. Frankly, I should have passed down the role of Sky Deer Goddess to
          you years ago, but you were merely a child back then. Your cultivation
          level was still insufficient. Furthermore, given the Upper
          Realm&#8217;s invasion back then, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do
          that. However, given how things are now, we no longer have a choice.
          You&#8217;ll have to gradually grow up, and eventually shoulder these

          >In a flash, three days had passed. Outside Sky Deer City, Lin Wu
          gathered innumerable people at an ancient, spectacular altar. Everyone
          present were shrouded in heavenly lights as they were clad in battle
          armour. Their auras, too, were formidable.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Apart from Lin Wu himself, there were also Lu Cui and members of the
          Lu Family who had escaped with him back previously.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, the strongest among them were merely two Sacred Emperor
          Realm Elders. Lu Cui and an old monster from the Lin Family who was
          sent to protect him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Their mission to rescue Lu Luo was extremely precarious. Initially,
          none was willing to partake in it, given that even those in the Sacred
          Emperor Realm would most likely get themselves killed.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, after taking Lin Wu&#8217;s identity into
          consideration, the Lin Family dispatched some men for him. Currently,
          those that joined had faces filled with gloom. After all, they could
          already see the outcome.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since Lin Wu, bound to the promise, did not disclose about the Sky
          Deer Goddess&#8217;s existence, they saw no hope in this venture.
          Naturally, if he were to reveal her existence, it would be a trump
          card which they could pin their hopes on. Unfortunately, it was also a
          trump card he could not afford to rashly reveal.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Around the teleportation altar, many other people stood as they
          peered at the sight with complicated feelings. Among the bystanders,
          there were young prodigies of Ten Domains and Barrens with exceptional
          Talents, and some of them were even on par with Lin Wu. Their entire
          bodies were covered in divine light and there were golden flames
          pulsating above their shoulders.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Indubitably, they had the desire to join Lin Wu&#8217;s venture to
          the Boundary Marker Sea. However, they were advised against it by
          their respective Elders. Hence, they could only silently send Lin Wu
          and the rest away.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All of a sudden, a faint disturbance in the void, shrouded in divine
          light as a strange Dao Energy swirled. From within, the Sky Deer
          Goddess appeared.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As usual, she wore an unstained white robe. Her appearance was
          ambiguous and ethereal as her body was covered in blinding lights and
          a subtle fragrance. It was as if she was an invaluable vessel of an
          Immortal.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          else could see her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, the teleportation altar lit up with dazzling lights, after
          which Lin Wu and the rest stepped onto it.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon a gush of fluctuations in space, it was as if everyone was
          travelling through a tunnel between universes. They could see the
          floating stars and silver glimmers arising from the Milky Way. In the
          sky, one could perceive the radiant divine light that seemed to tear
          the universe apart before forming a tunnel that was directed towards
          the distant Boundary Marker Sea.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On a grand ancient battleship at the shore of Boundary Marker Sea,
          Chaos Mists whirled around palaces and pavilions, as if the realm of
          gods had descended upon the mortal world.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There, daunting, vigorous armies filled with overbearing murderous
          intent set up their camps. Their terrifying aggression formed a banner
          that swayed in the air.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was a terrorising power. Its aggression alone was enough to
          overwhelm the entire world. Regardless of distance, even the forces of
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains far away dared not to approach it
          as they could only watch from afar while bracing themselves for the
          sudden attack.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although many forces chose to take up camp here as they awaited for
          the Upper Realm Army, some formidable cultivators chose to charge on
          fearlessly instead, and their presence resembled a violent waterfall
          that could irresistibly wipe out everything in the world.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, they halted their advancement right before the boundless
          chaotic Aether Abyss. After all, even a True Daoist couldn&#8217;t
          afford to lower their guards as they might possibly get lost in there.
          Besides, within the Aether Abyss, there were infinite storms due to
          the chaotic void and oceans, striking fear in all hearts as they could
          easily disintegrate one&#8217;s body.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the first greatest barrier of the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains, the Aether Abyss posed innumerable threats, and it would take
          one a lot of time to figure out the correct path through it.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >For the past countless years, Aether Abyss had inconsistently
          undergone changes. Even the cultivators of Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains would have to be wary as they tried to locate and travel
          through the right path.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In this instant, the vast army stopped before the Aether Abyss as the
          powerful experts began deduction in an attempt to find the right
          path.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, somewhere within the Aether Abyss, an ambiguous light
          flashed across as a number of individuals appeared on an ancient
          altar. Accordingly, space was ripped apart before disappearing, all
          while making not a sound.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          lightly blanched as she watched Gu Changge entering the dungeon and

          it through ?&#8221; Gu Changge casually glanced at her, thinking that
          it was about time Lin Wu was on his way.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >&#8220;Dream on! I will never betray my homeland!&#8221; Although Lu
          Luo&#8217;s face bore unconcealable dread, she remained determined
          without giving in to her enemy.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Really? In that case, do you plan to watch your hero—Lin
          Wu—perish as he comes to save you?&#8221; Gu Changge let out a
          leisurely chuckle.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that, from outside the underground dungeon, a pale, tall woman
          walked in behind him. There was a golden tattoo on her forehead. Her
          features were delicate and captivating.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What are you doing!?&#8221; Seeing that, Lu Luo immediately
          felt distressed, subconsciously stepping back as she couldn&#8217;t
          fathom what Gu Changge&#8217;s plan was.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Begin.&#8221; Disregarding her question, Gu Changge then spoke
          to the tall woman behind her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes, Young Master Changge.&#8221; The tall, slender woman was
          reverent towards Gu Changge. Upon the order, she walked up to Lu Luo
          and put her hand on her forehead despite the latter&#8217;s dread and
          restlessness.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Whoosh!* The next moment, surges of vibrant mists appeared. The
          figure of the tall woman then became ambiguous as her bones, flesh,
          and organs were shifting. Even her features, body, quality, and aura
          were going through changes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was not a simple appearance-imitating ability as all the bones and
          flesh in her body went through thorough reshaping. Almost
          instantaneously, she donned Lu Luo&#8217;s appearance.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Apart from their garments, every part of hers seemed as though they
          were forged from a mould, and given the precision, no one could spot
          one difference. Even Lu Luo&#8217;s fearful, unnerved expressions were
          imitated perfectly.</span
        >

          >&#8220;Who… Who are you? What are you going to do?&#8221; Lu Luo
          peered at her doppelganger with her pale face as the fear in her heart
          deepened. She could already roughly guess what Gu Changge was
          planning.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Not bad. Though, it&#8217;s merely a vessel. Perhaps it may
          not be able to deceive the Mirror of Heaven and Earth. Regardless,
          it&#8217;s sufficient to trick that brat, Lin Wu.&#8221; Gu Changge
          ignored Lu Luo as he carefully observed the woman before him and
          satisfiedly nodded.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The name of the woman before him was Mi Chun. She was a prodigal
          damsel of the Shapeshifting Demon Clan. Gu Changge had instructed his
          men to look for her these past few days. Shapeshifting Demons&#8217;
          were the best at shapeshifting. Furthermore, those with outstanding
          cultivation levels were even more proficient at concealing their own
          auras to thoroughly trick others.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, it would still prove difficult for them to sneak into
          Sky Deer City as the Mirror of Heaven and Earth, which was levitating
          in the sky, could instantly reveal someone&#8217;s original form,
          especially if they were from the Upper Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Moreover, as the environment and Great Dao of both worlds were
          different, the Mirror of Heaven and Earth could discern the
          differences right away. Nevertheless, this could still be used as a
          temporary means to deceive Lin Wu.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Say, do you think Lin Wu would realise that he actually
          rescued a doppelganger instead of you?&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at Lu
          Luo with a subtle smile on his face. &#8220;Though, even if he finds
          out, he wouldn&#8217;t dare to do anything, since you&#8217;re still
          in my hands.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;You… You devil!&#8221; Hearing that, Lu Luo finally realised
          Gu Changge&#8217;s ill intent. Her voice trembled as her heart was
          overflowing with fear and sorrow.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >From the beginning, he had never planned to let Lin Wu rescue her.
          Rather, his plan was to force Lin Wu into submitting to him through
          her. And that, to her, was a torment worse than death itself. After
          all, she could never allow herself to sit back as Gu Changge took
          advantage of Lin Wu.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Alas, it was as Gu Changge noted—she truly had no choice.
          Nonetheless, she had never expected Gu Changge to have come up with
          such a method.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, her face blanched even more. However, Gu Changge had already
          left with Chun Mi, without caring about her, who collapsed to the
          ground.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[If Lin Wu dares to show himself, it must mean that he has reliable
          support, and someone worthy to support the Fortuitous One must not be
          someone simple. After all, Lin Wu is no fool. He wouldn&#8217;t come
          to rescue Lu Luo without a card up his sleeves. Maybe I’ll get myself
          a big catch this time?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, the space before him split apart. As his gaze grew
          uncanny, he brought Chun Mi into the rift as they were headed to the
          Boundary Marker Sea.</span

          in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. Similar to the situation of
          the Upper Realm, True Daoist were the apex forces. As for Remnant
          Immortals, none had appeared for so long that they might as well not
          count at this point.

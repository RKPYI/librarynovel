          rays of moonlight spilled through the windows like water, carrying an
          extraordinary, pure sensation. On the bed, Yue Mingkong, whose hair
          was silky, turned her head and her eyes twitched as she peered at one
          side of Gu Changge&#8217;s face and gently asked.</span

          shall emerge tonight.&#8221; Looking at the Jade Messenger Amulet in
          his hand, Gu Changge revealed an enthralling grin.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Naturally, the message was sent by one of Chen Ning&#8217;er&#8217;s
          men, claiming that she discovered some clues about the Tower of World
          Domination and she would notify him right away should she find out
          more.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the other hand, Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t exactly interested in how
          Chen Ning&#8217;er received the information since he could still
          easily get his hands on the Tower of World Domination even without
          her. Nevertheless, with her involvement, he certainly saved a lot of
          effort and found himself more excuses.</span

          his hands resting behind his back and his garment swaying, Gu Changge
          gazed at the mountain range far away. He then squinted his eyes and
          said, &#8220;The Tower of World Domination hasn&#8217;t even appeared.
          What the hell is Jiang Chen doing? Taking his time like
          this?&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;Jiang Chen?&#8221; Yue Mingkong tensed her brows as she
          didn&#8217;t have any impression of the name since she never heard
          it.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;A fortuitous individual from the Lower Realm,&#8221; Gu
          Changge briefly stated with a smile.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;A fortuitous individual…&#8221; Yue Mingkong seemed lost in
          thought, wondering if the holder of the Sword of World Domination in
          her memories was the same person as the &#8216;fortuitous
          individual&#8217; Gu Changge mentioned.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >According to her memories from her past life, the holder of the Sword
          of World Domination was indeed lucky, and judging by the timeline, the
          holder of the Sword of World Domination was about to emerge.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, Yue Mingkong wasn&#8217;t worried, as Gu Changge eventually
          slaughtered the holder of the Sword of World Domination, forcibly
          seizing the sword without breaking a sweat in her previous life. Given
          the sequence of events, the Sword of World Domination would ultimately
          end up in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If we manage to get our hands on the Tower of World
          Domination, we only have the Wheel of World Domination and the Sword
          of World Domination left to gather. Once we obtain all Seven Tools of
          World Domination, we&#8217;ll be able to locate the Immortal Palace
          Treasury,&#8221; Yue Mingkong muttered.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The Sword of World Domination&#8217;s whereabouts is still
          unknown, but the Wheel of World Domination should be in the possession
          of the two siblings of the Ji Family. I&#8217;m pretty sure of
          that.&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite knowing the consequences of contending Gu Changge for the
          Tower of World Domination, the two siblings of the Ji Family still
          insisted on pursuing it, and that could only mean that they were
          certain that they could reach the Immortal Palace Treasury.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for why Gu Changge so confidently claimed that the siblings was
          carrying the rest of the Tools of World Domination, it was because
          four: the Flask, Jar, Mirror, and Seal, were all now in his
          possession. Only the remaining: Tower, Sword, and Wheel, had yet to be
          discovered.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In fact, the Sword of World Domination was the most mysterious. It
          was said to have appeared in the past and was used to be a godly
          weapon that bore unparalleled sharpness and offensive strength. It was
          also said to have caused endless bloodshed as countless cultivators
          had scrambled for it, hence it was referred to as the first Artifact
          among the Seven Tools of World Domination.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There were even rumours stating that anyone who managed to obtain the
          Sword of World Domination could control the wonders within it and gain
          unrivalled might to become invincible. Although those were just
          rumours, the Sword of World Domination was unquestionably
          mysterious.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Therefore, thinking that the Sword of World Domination wasn&#8217;t
          in the hands of the two siblings of the Ji Family, Gu Changge figured
          that they most likely only possessed the Wheel of World
          Domination.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Hmm, it seems we have received new information. We may go
          now.&#8221; All of a sudden, Gu Changge noticed the light on the Jade
          Messenger Amulet and revealed the grin of someone who won his
          bet.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yue Mingkong then glanced at him and nodded.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Followingly, the two summoned their followers and rose to the sky,
          transforming into divine rainbows and travelling across the
          skies.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the other hand, Jiang Chen, Ji Chuyue, Ji Yaoxing, and the rest
          were still oblivious to the fact that they were trailed by Chen
          Ning&#8217;er.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the group was following Jiang Chen, they slowly entered the depths
          of the mountains. The fog nearby grew denser, as if it was about to
          engulf everything in sight, covering the night sky and forbidding the
          moonlight to enter the depths. There was only a chilly breeze that
          blew into the group&#8217;s bones, making them feel a chill up their
          spine. As a matter of fact, the chilly breeze was not a simple gush of
          wind as it harboured forces of World Principles.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sceptical, Ji Chuyue looked at the spot gleaming with heavenly light
          before tossing a twig at it, and all of a sudden, a glow flashed
          across the air, resembling the shine of a blade. Instantaneously, the
          twig was cut to pieces.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that, Ji Chuyue and the rest were dazed as the power of the
          suspicious primal array was too terrifying. If a cultivator were to
          walk into it by mistake, they would instantly disintegrate. If it
          weren&#8217;t for Jiang Chen&#8217;s warning, they wouldn&#8217;t have
          known that such a primal array was concealed in such a place. Even
          with the protective artifacts they were carrying, triggering the array
          would be burdensome and it might even annihilate them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch it!&#8221; Jiang Chen turned around and
          caught Ji Chuyue&#8217;s movement, after which he irritably glowered
          and reprimanded, &#8220;If any disturbance were to get out in the
          middle of the night, cultivators will surely be alerted by it, and
          you&#8217;ll find yourself at a loss by then.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Awkwardly, Ji Chuyue withdrew her hands and softly whined,
          &#8220;What&#8217;s with that attitude… Can&#8217;t a woman be
          curious?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then, Ji Yaoxing shot her a glare and said, &#8220;Talk less, would
          you? We promised we&#8217;ll listen to Jiang Chen after reaching this
          place, so don&#8217;t go touching everything you see.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Hmph!&#8221; Ji Chuyue pouted, though she couldn&#8217;t argue
          with her brother since she knew Jiang Chen&#8217;s rebuke was for the
          sake of their safety.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, Jiang Chen, despite being an ordinary person, became
          the core being of the group.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Yaoxing took a glance at Jiang Chen and an indescribable sensation
          flashed across his eyes, but he quickly recovered from it.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, Jiang Chen and the rest entered a somewhat lower valley
          area. The nearby mountains seemed enormous and grand as wild beasts
          could be seen standing amid the haziness.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >&#8220;This should be where the Tower of World Domination is,&#8221;
          Jiang Chen calmly claimed as he was chatting with the Artifact Spirit
          of the Celestial Boat of Creation in his mind.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;We actually scoured this region before, but we have never
          expected the Tower of World Domination to be hidden in such a valley.
          This is totally wonderful, amazing…&#8221; Stunned, Ji Chuyue scanned
          her surroundings before her gaze landed on the deeper part of the
          valley, where purplish mountains could be seen.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Within the valley was a number of giant, spectacular purple
          mountains, each of which Purple Qi was gushing out from, making the
          scenery extremely foggy. The valleys were quite spacious as a big area
          of ruined site, wherein the remains of collapsed palaces was lying
          around, could be seen. It was apparent that the area was once a sacred
          land.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon such a sight, Ji Yaoxing was shocked. If it weren&#8217;t for
          Jiang Chen, they probably wouldn&#8217;t have found this place their
          whole lives.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;These mountains seem complicated. There&#8217;s an unnerving
          aura to them, as though some being was sealed within. Jiang Chen, can
          you make out what it is?&#8221; Ji Yaoxing spoke in a low voice as his
          gaze fell upon Jiang Chen.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that, traces of golden, glimmering talismans appeared from his
          body, as if his flesh was made of golden concrete. With his eyes that
          resembled miniature suns, he assiduously observed the mountains before
          him and Jiang Chen at the same time. At that moment, a powerful aura
          surged on his body as he displayed half of his Sacred Realm
          cultivation, paying attention to the abnormalities in his vicinity.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, a jade-like flute appeared in Ji Chuyue&#8217;s
          hands. Emitting green gleams, the flute was ready to attack
          anytime.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, everyone had their guards up, wary of their
          surroundings. Ever since they arrived, they could feel an icy
          sensation probing their skins and making them shiver.</span

          >&#8220;No idea, but it can&#8217;t be good.&#8221; Restlessness arose
          in Jiang Chen&#8217;s heart, but he kept forcing himself to calm
          down.</span

          whether he could protect his own life given his current strength, let
          alone the fact that he was a little defensive towards the siblings of
          the Ji Family as he was worried that after he helped them through
          adversities and found the Tower of World Domination, they would
          immediately turn on him and hand him over to Gu Changge.</span

          although Ji Yaoxing was an honest man, he would glare at him from time
          to time during their venture. In the face of absolute benefit, none
          could tell how others&#8217; behaviour might change. After all, a
          person&#8217;s heart was unpredictable, so Jiang Chen had to be
          careful. Indeed, he was rather fond of the siblings, but not if they

          flickered in Jiang Chen&#8217;s eyes, but he quickly hid it.
          Nonetheless, the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation did
          not respond to his question.</span

          that seemed as though they were forged with purple gold. About two
          kilometres tall, the mountains were emitting purple gleams, and
          something appeared to be hanging on it.</span

          most likely in there. Should we go in now?&#8221; Faint green godly
          lights glistened in Ji Chuyue&#8217;s eyes, resembling a lake with a
          jade-coloured shade, as she was observing the purple mountains before
          her.</span

          with my Heaven Peering Eye. The danger in those purple mountains is
          unusual. Anyone below the Sacred Realm will die upon entrance.&#8221;
          There was vigilance in his voice.</span

          entering, only to see his calm, confident expression. Thereupon, he
          lowered his gaze and suggested, &#8220;Chuyue, you stay out here.
          I&#8217;ll go in and investigate. If any danger arises, all of you
          should leave at once. Since I have the ability to protect myself, you
          don&#8217;t have to worry about me.&#8221;</span

          warning her brother, she nodded and said, &#8220;Be safe,
          Brother.&#8221;</span

          turned to Ji Yaoxing and revealed an expression of respect. Given how
          Ji Yaoxing was thinking about protecting his sister under such a
          situation, he would certainly make a good friend. Though, his
          scrutinising gazes must have been his incredulity.</span

          layers of blindingly glowing golden lights, seemingly incredibly
          sacred and divine.</span

          Spirit, upon receiving the recognition of the universe, would gain a
          Symbol of the Universe, and they would be considered as the most

          autumn, and her lips were faintly red. As she possessed extraordinary

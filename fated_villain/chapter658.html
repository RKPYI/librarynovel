        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven days quickly passed.</span><span id="more-34823"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Yu Capital was especially crowded today, with a great army arriving outside its walls and standing amongst the clouds. Black smoke swirled violently around the army, as they exuded overpowering murderous intent. They looked ready to charge into the Imperial Capital at any moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military forces had quickly amassed from different parts of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and they were now waiting outside the city walls, all donned with armour and weapon in hand. Both sides consisted of soldiers of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, just that their leader was different. Many experts did not wish to see them fight, so the best option was to wait for the showdown between the leaders to end everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless had come in droves from different ancient cities after hearing the news. They filled the inns of the capital, pavilions, and mansions to the brim to watch the fight. Several astounded Sacred Emperor Realm experts scanned the place with their divine sense and looked taken aback since with how many there were gathered within the capital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elders and ancient beings from powerful Forces, including ancient royal families, Immortal Sect, Formidable Sects, Immortal Families, and Celestial Dynasties. Those who were rarely seen had all shown up as well. The streets which were thousands of kilometres wide were noisy and congested, and rarely-seen beasts such as Pixiu, Taotie, Phoenixes, and Azure Dragons could be seen. Nevertheless, ancient beasts and flying boats continued coming in from many places to witness the battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change in rulers for an Immortal Celestial Dynasties was something common. However, this event might involve a secret of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, which might turn the situation on its head. It might change the relations the Celestial Dynasty have with other Forces, which was why everyone paid close attention to this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ministers of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty had already stood by in different places and sent experts under them to guard their surroundings, to prevent any intruders with evil intent. Besides that, the concubines and children of Emperor Yu had all gathered to watch the battle. As far as they were concerned, Emperor Yu was the ruler of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and thus oversaw an infinite expanse of territory. He could cause earthquakes just by stomping his feet and making everyone quiver. Anyone who dared challenge him would pay a huge price and die here, so they were eager to see Yu Tianzheng being struck to death by Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yu Tianzheng lost in the last battle with father. Now, he is just serving himself up on a silver platter. He&#8217;s definitely suicidal,&#8221; a prince who had already shown great potential despite his young age declared, his voice full of scorn and hatred for Yu Tianzheng. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was surrounded by many powerful princes and princesses, who shone with extraordinary auras and possessed bright eyes that glowed with power. All of them didn&#8217;t say anything and only looked silently at the walls, as if waiting for something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time slowly passed; soon, dusk fell and the moon rose. Everything became quiet as the entire Imperial Capital was surrounded by a faint light. Arrays everywhere began to appear and glow blindingly while expelling mist, making the city mythical and celestial looking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless gazes landed on the Summit of the Imperial Capital as they held their breath, not daring to speak. Even the ancient beings of Immortal Sects frowned and remained silent in fear of disturbing anything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cough, cough.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, quiet coughs came from the end of a quiet street which broke the silence. Members of ancient royal families, Sects, and Families looked in that direction with surprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;s here!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young prodigies secretly clenched their fists, feeling extremely tense and uncomfortable as a slightly pale man clad in a white robe approached from that direction while the gorgeous woman beside him used a clean white silk handkerchief to wipe away the blood at the corners of his lips. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone on the street retreated involuntarily to give him space, not daring to block his way. Many had only heard of him sustaining serious injuries and damage to his Source, without seeing him in real life. No one had expected him to show up to watch the battle. Even the ancient beings looked somewhat stricken and awkward, no longer as serene as before. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge might be injured and had coughed up blood in public, but no one dared to underestimate him since he could still kill True Daoists if he wanted to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We must have come just in time. The battle at the Summit hasn&#8217;t commenced yet.&#8221; Gu Changge seemed surprised and smiled at Yin Mei beside him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You might have missed it had you been a second too late.&#8221; Yin Mei, who was clad in white and had thick black hair, smiled at him charmingly. She looked breathlessly beautiful and many young men looked at her admiringly, filled with envy and jealousy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, you came just in time. How could you be absent from this battle?&#8221; Supreme experts from various Forces showed up from their hiding places in order to invite him to go with them to the tallest floor of their pavilion, which was the optimal place to watch the battle. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had all hidden in the shadows without revealing themselves prior to this, but no one thought Gu Changge would come. After all, it was common knowledge that he was currently wounded and if someone suddenly attacked him, they would be suspected if they hid in the shadows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sight made many young prodigies feel bitter before becoming lost and hopeless. While they were secretly using him as a target to catch up to, their Ancestors were already behaving cautiously with Gu Changge</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems that both the competitors have not arrived.&#8221; Gu Changge stood at the highest point of the pavilion, his robe fluttering in the wind and making him look like a celestial being. He sounded surprised.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s time. Yu Tianzheng probably isn&#8217;t brave enough to show up.&#8221; As he finished speaking though, an authoritative voice reverberated in the air as a tall figure wearing a purple gold crown and purple gold dragon robe appeared above the city wall. He approached slowly, millions of beams of Imperial Qi swirling behind him and causing earth-shattering sounds due to resonance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone sensed an oppressive aura around them and felt afraid like they were facing universal destruction, feeling the urge to worship in that direction. Even True Daoists were frowning, sensing that Emperor Yu seemed to have reached the Nirvana Realm and was not in his supposed cultivation level, the Quasi-Nirvana Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu had finally arrived, slowly and carelessly walking towards them before landing at the Capital Summit. Billions of beams of Imperial Qi surrounded him as the world resonated, while strange phenomena interspersed and resonated with each other. He looked formidable and frightening, seemingly unrivalled. However, many ancient beings could sense another hidden overpowering force behind him and guessed that there might be many Ancestors of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty concealed in the shadows. These Ancestors hadn&#8217;t appeared yet and might act when something unexpected and difficult to resolve came up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Emperor Yu looks unbothered, yet he&#8217;s also secretly cautious.] The ancient beings all looked at him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Emperor Yu appeared, the previously silent capital was stirred with excitement. Many Ministers were excited and shouted, &#8220;His Majesty is invincible and shall decimate the enemy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To many, the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty had become stronger and more peaceful under Emperor Yu&#8217;s rule, so the sudden riots had to be caused by Yu Tianzheng. They all wished that Emperor Yu could slay his former opponent and return peace to the land.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The time has come. Where are you, Yu Tianzheng?&#8221; Emperor Yu shouted from the Summit, his gaze dark. His aura was already at its peak and about to break past their limits. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the call and prayers by the ministers and citizens allowed the Power of Faith and Fortuity to gather towards him, making him stronger. He had everything to his advantage, so how could Yu Tianzheng win against him now?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The result of this battle is probably already destined. Even we cannot be certain of beating Emperor Yu right now and besides, he has plenty of abilities and artifacts in hand. There won&#8217;t be any suspense.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many ancient beings shook their heads, feeling that the result was apparent. Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s absence was a smart move, and the formidable army outside the Imperial Capital might be quickly defeated or slain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There might be unexpected circumstances though. Yu Tianzheng doesn&#8217;t seem like a fool, so he probably has something to back up his decision in challenging Emperor Yu.&#8221; Another ancient being didn&#8217;t agree with that. He had lived for such a long time that his eyelashes had become hollow, so he sensed faintly that the battle had an indescribable strange tinge to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Things might not be as simple as they seem, so we just have to observe what happens.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you think, Young Master Changge?&#8221; The other ancient beings all looked at Gu Changge, hoping to get his opinion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge seemed to come back to himself at that and smiled in surprise. &#8220;Any consequences of today&#8217;s battle will concern the internal affairs of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. We are all outsiders, so we should be careful about what we say and not interfere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after he finished speaking, an overwhelmingly savage aura came from outside the capital. A beam of energy broke through the atmosphere and shattered constellations in the sky as it rushed towards the Capital Summit like a meteor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man with messy hair and a cold electrifying gaze had arrived, resembling an unrivalled king. He broke the arrays outside the city wall with his golden heavenly blade before charging straight into the venue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yu Tianyong, we need to resolve the hatred between us. One of us must die today.&#8221; Yu Tianzheng had finally appeared, staring at Emperor Yu coldly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianyong was Emperor Yu&#8217;s real name, which no one had addressed him by in many years.</span></p>

          on the man in blue. Her brows furrowed slightly before relaxing and
          she said, &#8220;This man&#8217;s name is Jun Fan and he is the third
          son of the Quelling Chaos King. He is considered a brilliant prodigy
          of the Demon World. He has been hidden away by the Quelling Chaos King
          until he began showing his skills and Talents recently.&#8221;</span

          >As the Empress of the Demon World, she had eyes everywhere and so
          knew of many young prodigies. She had already been aware of prodigies
          like Song Youwei and Jun Fan since a long time ago; her purpose in
          founding the Black and White Academy had been to gather young
          prodigies from all over the Demon World, whom she would eventually
          use. If nothing went wrong, Jun Fan would land in the Top Three in the
          Banquet of Prodigies later today. At that thought, her mood became
          better as it was rare to see such an outstanding prodigy like him. He
          would be famous in the Demon World in the future.</span

          to his current status and I know about his children&#8217;s

          suspect anything about the similar names of his progeny. Jun
          Fan&#8217;s Talents in cultivation were truly brilliant, so she felt
          appreciative of his gifts. She had thought Gu Changge was suspecting
          something and so added another word of explanation.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The speed at which Song Youwei ascended the mountain wasn&#8217;t
          much slower than Jun Fan and besides, she didn&#8217;t look like she
          had used her full power in doing so. She looked natural and relaxed,
          her skirts flowing around her which made her look dignified and
          scholarly. She had an uncompetitive nature as well and was just
          slightly behind Jun Fan. Many young prodigies who had tried to fight
          her had lost, which shocked them. This showed that her abilities
          should never be underestimated.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone near Sacred Mountain watched this in amazement. The Quelling
          Chaos King, Jun Fan&#8217;s father, couldn&#8217;t hide his joy in
          particular. He hadn&#8217;t expected Jun Fan to exceed his peers and
          leave them in the dust.

          >Already, Jun Fan had advanced 108 steps, and the many prodigies in
          the Demon World lost to him as they couldn&#8217;t compete against him
          at all. This made the Quelling Chaos King extremely proud and he
          smiled continuously, as he heard his companions&#8217; praise and
          expressions of envy.</span

          crowd, watched the scene on the Sacred Mountain closely. Bai Hua had
          been the one who had spoken, his voice sounding astounded.</span

          no mistaking it. That has to be him. No one else among the Demon

          >&#8220;So why did he want to climb to the peak of the Sacred
          Mountain? Logically, Empress Yao Xi is the person he despises the
          most, so why did he do that? Isn&#8217;t he afraid Empress Yao Xi will
          discover his real identity?&#8221; He sounded sceptical, unable to
          understand Jun Fan&#8217;s actions.</span

          prove himself. He&#8217;s still outstanding despite coming back from
          the dead. Hate is often born from love, so he&#8217;s definitely
          filled with anger and hatred. He will take revenge on Yao
          Xi.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Bai Lainer became hesitant. She had already seen Gu Changge, who was
          standing at the peak of the Sacred Mountain and chatting with Empress
          Yao Xi. That was a man who she couldn&#8217;t see through.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for why he was here in the Demon World, he might be here for her
          or more precisely, the brocade bag in her possession. He had already
          captured her father, and Gu Changge could easily find ways to make her
          father open his mouth through interrogation. How else would Gu Changge
          follow her tracks here to the Demon World?
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had two choices here: follow her father&#8217;s instructions and
          hand the bag over to Jun Bufan, or find Gu Changge and make a deal to
          let her father go in exchange for the brocade bag. She was conflicted
          about which choice to make. [Is this man worth trusting? If I can
          trust him, I would hand the bag over to him in exchange for
          father&#8217;s life.]

          >Jun Bufan was a mere stranger to her, even though they had grown up
          together most of the time and had been as close as siblings despite
          not sharing any blood relations. That had changed after he met Empress
          Yao Xi.

          >Bai Lian&#8217;er had had high hopes for him to be a powerful Demon
          Overlord the likes of the Solar Demon Overlord, yet his actions had
          hurt her deeply. She had warned him many times that Yao Xi had
          ulterior motives and wasn&#8217;t as innocent as she looked. However,
          he hadn&#8217;t listened to her. He loved Yao Xi ardently and ended up
          dying as expected. Jun Bufan had deliberately hurt Bai Lian&#8217;er
          many times because of Yao Xi. All of that was too much to take since
          she ended up being hated the most by the person she was most concerned
          about.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that thought, Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s smile became one of
          mockery. She had been far too stupid back then. Now, she wished she
          could go back in time and strangle her past self. If this hadn&#8217;t
          been her father&#8217;s last instructions, she never would have agreed
          to this.</span

          brightly from the peak of the Sacred Mountain. Runes swirled about and
          fell instantly, making the 108 steps vibrate and hum. They then glowed
          brightly in orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and purple, the
          blinding coloured light flowing and interweaving to show his top
          rank.</span

          6000 years old record at the Banquet of Prodigies. This would cause a
          shock in the Demon World. Empress Yao Xi smiled as well, a sight
          rarely seen in public, as she looked at the approaching Jun Fan. Such
          talent was truly hardly seen and delighted her.

          Jun Fan maintained a neutral expression as he walked onto the peak of
          the Sacred Mountain with quick steps. He felt somewhat unhappy after
          seeing Empress Yao Xi and Gu Changge together. Their actions
          weren&#8217;t intimate and didn&#8217;t cross boundaries, yet they
          made him uncomfortable. That was why he had shown more of his
          abilities and thus broke the record of the Banquet of Prodigies. His
          reputation was at an all-time high but he still assumed a somewhat
          humble expression as he approached.</span

          shocked him immensely and his mind turned into blank static, as if he
          had been hit by a large bell. His expression turned stricken and pale,
          and his first reaction was to put up his guard. He prepared to crush
          the jade amulet within his sleeve and alert his hidden subordinates to
          act. He couldn&#8217;t believe this. [How did he know of my real
          identity? Did Qing Zhu betray me and spill everything?]</span

          confused between these names.&#8221; Just as Jun Fan frantically
          prepared to fight, Gu Changge spoke once again. He sounded slightly
          surprised and apologetic.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          doubtful. He hadn&#8217;t expected to be so panicked and cautious that
          he overreacted to Gu Changge&#8217;s words. He didn&#8217;t know
          whether his behaviour caused any suspicion as he never acted like this
          usually. The main issue here was that Gu Changge&#8217;s question had
          been so sudden that he couldn&#8217;t catch himself in time,

          >[Was it just a playful joke?] She had already noticed Jun Fan&#8217;s
          stricken and panicked expression though and felt amused by it. His
          reaction was not out of the ordinary, since everyone who knew Jun
          Bufan knew what that name symbolised. Thus, though hearing Gu Changge
          suddenly call him by that name had to make him react immediately with
          anxiety and fear, that didn&#8217;t mean anything to her.</span

          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, stop scaring him.&#8221; Empress Yao Xi
          smiled, shooting a narrow-eyed glare at Gu Changge. She showed a smile
          rarely seen by the public and waved a hand to signal a female courtier
          to give him a seat.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Fan&#8217;s eyelid jumped slightly as he thanked her
          respectfully. He sat down and centred himself, eventually regaining
          his calm. He had watched her glare at Gu Changge and couldn&#8217;t
          believe it. How could Yao Xi, as the Empress of the Demon World,
          direct such an intimate expression towards another man? This made him
          uneasy.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Was it just a joke or did it serve some other purpose?] He peeked at
          Qing Zhu, who shook her head slightly in return without any other
          meaning. He became relieved as it seemed that Empress Yao Xi
          hadn&#8217;t noticed anything strange yet.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, his expression darkened a little as he listened to the
          conversation between Empress Yao Xi and Gu Changge. He controlled
          himself as forcefully as he could so he didn&#8217;t do anything
          suspicious. Their words sounded like something two well-acquainted
          people would say to one another. The feeling intensified as he watched
          the usually elegantly solemn and frigid Empress Yao Xi chatting so
          happily with Gu Changge. Taking a deep breath, he reined himself in
          quickly as acting rashly would ruin his plans.</span

          >Jun Fan&#8217;s feat in breaking the 6000 years old record had
          rendered them shocked and envious but also frustrated. However, they
          did not dare say anything before Empress Yao Xi and greeted her in
          turn before settling in their seats.

          >They were waiting for when the Empress would personally reward them
          with the royal wine and unique dishes only available in the imperial
          palace. These things contained unimaginable power and Dao Creation
          Energy. Besides, the royal dishes served at the banquet would normally
          be inaccessible to them. These dishes were priceless and might help
          them breakthough.

          head of the table. Many young men looked besotted; while her face was
          hidden by a layer of Chaos fog which rendered her features indistinct.
          Nonetheless, her voice and appearance were already enough to bewitch
          everyone.</span

          Fan was a little different today compared to the man she usually saw.
          He wouldn&#8217;t behave so openly and would also strategize every
          step before making his move. However, she did not think about it much
          as the Banquet of Prodigies was a chance to make themselves famous. In
          her mind, any youth would want to fully make use of this
          opportunity.</span

          commencement spread everywhere. Beams of light flickered as the
          spiritual dishes surrounded by swirling light were served by the
          maids. They smelled fragrant and contained unimaginable spiritual
          energy which seemed to open up everyone&#8217;s pores.

          beasts, and the potent effects were complemented by many spiritual
          herbs. Many young prodigies expelled marrow from their pores after
          just taking their first bite, which transformed into a small cloud of
          red mist. Their vitality and Qi surged as powerfully as the river, and
          they started to meditate on the spot to cultivate. They dared not
          waste any of it.</span

          >Meanwhile, Jun Fan was secretly taking note of Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s
          behaviour. She would ask a female courtier to test it in case of
          poison before eating it. Such caution did not surprise him at all, but
          these were just paltry issues. [The main event is about to
          start.]</span

          meat course, the fruit course, and finally the wine course.&#8221;

          Changge, who was at the head of the table.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He nodded and exclaimed, &#8220;These meat dishes are simply complex
          as they contain unimaginable power and the Energy of Creation. These
          would be extremely hard to digest normally but they seem milder after
          undergoing the process of cooking.&#8221;</span

          poison. He could easily consume and digest the Eternal Overcast
          Sources, much less any poison in the world.</span

          couldn&#8217;t stand it any longer and began sitting cross-legged to
          digest the energy consumed. That meant they would miss the fruit
          course and wine course. This couldn&#8217;t be blamed on anyone else
          since they couldn&#8217;t absorb that much Energy of Creation.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The second course soon started. Everything served consisted of shiny
          spiritual fruits containing Dao Energy. They varied in shape and
          expelled light; some even had strange patterns and were surrounded by
          a divine glow. These fruits had the effect of making one enlightened
          in the Great Dao.</span

          They were all shaken to the core, while the important figures watching
          from a distance felt jealous and wished they could take the places of
          these young prodigies.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Her Majesty the Empress must have spent a princely sum of money for
          the Banquet of Prodigies. To think that Bodhi Dao Fruits are being
          served. The imperial palace must have considered this for a long time
          before serving so many of these at once.] These important figures
          exclaimed internally with envy. Even at their cultivation level, they
          still craved the Bodhi Dao Fruit. It could make them achieve immediate
          enlightenment and even allow them to break through any obstacles in
          their cultivation, thus allowing them to enter the next realm. The
          fact that Empress Yao Xi had these fruits served up astonished
          them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many young prodigies did not hesitate before grabbing the fruit. They
          started consuming and digesting it. Even Song Youwei received it with
          careful hands and a rare expression of wariness. However, Jun
          Fan&#8217;s expression did not waver as he quickly consumed the fruit
          so no one noticed anything strange. Soon, a thick cloud of fresh
          fragrance spread through the air while interweaving beams of heavenly
          light lit up the sky. The chimes of the Great Dao resonated through
          the air and could be heard far away.</span

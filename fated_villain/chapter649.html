        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the dungeon was flabbergasted by Yu Feiya&#8217;s words. Even the Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and others widened their eyes with incredulity as chills ran down their spines.</span><span id="more-34814"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had witnessed how Gu Changge killed the True Daoists, including the Imperial Ancestor behind Yu Feiya. Yet, she was turning a blind eye towards it. Not only that, she even instigated the others to head down into Profound Sword World!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Just what in the world is she planning?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you put it that way, it is possible that the Seniors are still alive.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled faintly, unfazed by Yu Feiya&#8217;s words. That said, he didn&#8217;t expect the young woman to put things that way. However, the foundation was laid perfectly, for it would motivate the cultivators to head into Profound Sword World and become sustenance for the immolation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;re trapped somewhere.&#8221; Yu Feiya&#8217;s words had the other cultivators pondering. They wouldn&#8217;t want to see their Ancestors die either when there was still hope.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like we have to make another trip down to Profound Sword World,&#8221; said a cultivator of the Godly Spirit Mountain with a nod, looking like he had made a decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, many decided to leave and gave orders to descend into Profound Sword World. After all, it was the perfect time for them to enter it when disaster was roaming the lands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, many left the dungeon, leaving those of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Be gone.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head lightly and threw an arm out. As a breeze blew, the shackles of the Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and others were removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is Young Master Gu trying to do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of them were shocked, some baffled by Gu Changge&#8217;s actions and intentions. At that, they exchanged glances and found others were just as baffled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Not only will he not kill us, but he has even unshackled us and set us free?!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now that the Profound Sword World is in shambles and its people are in misery, supreme experts like you should step in,&#8221; said Gu Changge plainly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The finance was heaven and earth; and the sustenances were the living beings. As the best sacrificial offerings, it was indeed time to put these Earth Sword Immortals to good use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s words stumped the Earth Sword Immortals for a moment before they became filled with mixed emotions. Still, they thanked the man deferentially, &#8220;Thank you for sparing us. We shall forever be in your debt.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, they were oblivious that Gu Changge had subdued the World’s Will, merely thinking the latter turned soft and no longer wanted to see any more deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, they grew guilty and believed they had gauged a gentleman&#8217;s heart with a villain&#8217;s measure, especially when they thought the man was scheming and merciless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of Gu Changge&#8217;s pardon, cultivators of other Forces no longer dared give the Earth Sword Immortals a hard time. They could only watch as the latter left the ancient battleships and returned to the Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Lin En wasn&#8217;t as lucky as the others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as he was filled with indignance and regret, Gu Changge killed him with a smack, allowing a golden Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest to pop out of him. Gu Changge claimed it, but he made nothing of everything in the chest apart from the Fatums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Yu Feiya&#8217;s heart skipped a beat, she suppressed her shock at the scene and announced deferentially, &#8220;I shall continue with my task of having the other Forces head into Profound Sword World.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had come to realise Gu Changge&#8217;s true nature after having survived all of this. The man might look suave and all, but he was actually merciless and would stop at nothing to achieve his goals. In the past, she was curious about him and even had a slight crush on him, but now, she just wanted to stay as far away as possible from him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You only have three days. I want every single cultivator inside Profound Sword World by then,&#8221; Gu Changge glanced plainly at Yu Feiya, looking like he could read her mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three days was a fairly decent limit, and it was about time for the last part of the immolation to commence. Once the time was up, he would wait no longer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Young Master Gu. Three days should be plausible,&#8221; Yu Feiya answered deferentially, to which Gu Changge nodded in return. He then transformed into a beam of light and vanished from the spot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of the Profound Sword World would meet its demise reached everyone in no time and caused an uproar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devastation enveloped the lands as terrifying scarlet chains made of Principles that had appeared a few days ago returned one after another. They took away all Earth Sword Immortals, foretelling everyone their upcoming fate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining Ninth Realm and Eight Realm experts had gathered with grimness on their faces to devise a countermeasure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some believed they could only survive this catastrophe by leaving this world and seeking refuge on another habitable one. Others thought they should just yield to the Otherworldly Sky Demons, for they thought being enslaved was better than dying a horrible death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone had their opinions, but one thing was for sure, they were doomed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could anyone else make it through this when even the Earth Sword Immortals couldn&#8217;t escape the scarlet chains? Hence, they believed surrendering was the only way to go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, only a little clung to the idea. Most still believed they should band together and fight against the World’s Will. After all, the heavens were always merciful to its creations. They didn&#8217;t think everyone would ultimately give their lives to this catastrophe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, the Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and many other Earth Sword Immortals who had been captured by the Otherworldly Sky Demons returned, and the panicked masses gradually eased up as they thought there was still hope in winning this battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our only way out of this is to band together. Our Ancestors managed to seal up the World’s Will centuries ago. Now, it&#8217;s our turn. If they could do it, then so can we!&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal related the secret he heard from Lin En, inspiring everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, everyone was moved after hearing it, and their morale was boosted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The most important thing now is to come up with a plan to save the Earth Sword Immortals the World’s Will had captured. It must have chosen to make the first move and weaken our forces because it fears us,&#8221; said a veteran Earth Sword Immortal. He was authoritative, and his words were dependable as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, everyone hurriedly thought of a way to locate the whereabouts of the captured Earth Sword Immortals. They were confident the captured were locked up in an undisclosed location, as their Soul Lamps were still burning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess our only way about this is to do what we did when we searched for Mirror Lake…&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only solution they could come up with in the end was to confirm their exact location through how they did when they attempted to find Mirror Lake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, incredibly terrifying, world-crumbling noises came from the entrance to the Profound Sword World in the faraway land of the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!* The space shook violently, and shockingly, the rift that spanned tens and thousands of kilometres was slowly closing up. Meanwhile, light rays dimmed as World Principles spread, and later, black blood oozed streak by streak.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene rendered the many cultivators guarding the place stupefied and later fearful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is going on?! How can this be?! Why would the entrance suddenly close up?! My Sect&#8217;s Successor is still in there!&#8221; An old servant of a formidable shouted anxiously.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One needed to know that the duration a World Rift remained open was inconsistent. Now that this entrance had been sealed off, no one could tell how they could enter the same world next time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, the Space Rift had suddenly closed and even oozed black blood. Could it mean that something unfortunate had happened at the other end?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Upper Realm Successors from various Immortal Forces and several True Daoists had entered the Space Rift. What were they to do if something were to happen to the former!? There was absolutely no way they could explain themselves!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s try to open it together,&#8221; suggested a Quasi-Nirvana Realm Master stationed here as he discussed gravely with fellow Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts of other Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Such an anomaly is no minor issue. We should join forces and try to force the Space Rift open…&#8221; The others nodded gravely and apprehensively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, they cast their techniques. The vast energies shook the place and stirred up massive waves. However, they failed to stop the Space Rift from completely closing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, a young man from the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty couldn&#8217;t help worrying, &#8220;The Eldest Princess and the others are still in there, and so is Young Master Changge. Will the Immortal Gu Family take their anger out on the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty if something bad happens to him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wouldn&#8217;t doubt Gu Changge could escape unscathed even when everyone else had died in that world. That said, he still contacted the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and related all that was happening to them, worried that Yu Feiya, the Imperial Ancestor and the rest of their people would die in that world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the darkest day of the Profound Sword World had descended. The terror unleashed was beyond any other they had seen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrifying phenomena occurred in various locations as the world plunged into darkness. Boundless black mist drifted followingly, eclipsing the sun, descending upon the world like a surging black landmass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even the sun has been swallowed up. All light has disappeared…&#8221; Countless gawked at the scene, stunned by what they saw.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Crack!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cracks began forming in the sky, shattering like a broken mirror as black blood oozed. At the same time, black matters crash landed one after another with thumps, flooding everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the remaining lands of Profound Sword World, a plethora of powerful cultivators dropped to the ground and spasmed while screaming in pain after being hit by those black matter, and as though alive, these black matters kept burrowing into their every orifice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, sounds of gnawing and chewing could be heard. It was beyond terrifying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mere seconds, all life perished into thin air as they screamed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the Profound Sword World had plunged into chaos.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, ancient battleships descended from space once more as the massive Upper Realm Army stood above deck. They consisted of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, Godly Spirit Mountain, Sky Emperor Mountain, and many other Forces alike. This time, they had gone all out to invade Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya dared not disappoint Gu Changge. Hence, she bent over backwards and ultimately used the excuse of locating the True Daoists to lure all Forces to rescue them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Ancestor&#8217;s auras are within this area. We must rescue them amidst the chaos,&#8221; said Yu Feiya softly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The energy here doesn&#8217;t feel right. Looks like this world is ending soon…&#8221; said a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert grimly while sensing the anomaly happening in the Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky dimmed in an instant. It was as though the most terrifying chaotic thunder was rumbling within the depths, causing the entire world to shake. At the same time, countless terrifying beasts stirred from the depths of the sea and gazed up with utter fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s happening? Why is the world crumbling? The sun and stars are gone too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sudden turn of events within Profound Sword World rendered many unsuspecting cultivators stupefied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Upper Realm cultivators blanched as they stood on the ancient battleships. They realised the entrance had disappeared, and they could no longer sense the Upper Realm&#8217;s aura anymore. They were trapped in this world, impossible for them to return to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discovery left them in utter fear and confusion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world continued to crack, collapse, and eventually tear off. Blazing fires shot to the sky, melting everything away like a meteor shower crash landing onto the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profound Sword World&#8217;s sky shattered like a mirror as gusts of astral winds blew across the lands. The world was entirely pitch black, like the void.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the area was a sea of nothingness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even True Daoists had to be careful as they traversed the place. The terrifying Principles present could suppress and kill them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The view left all the cultivators of Profound Sword World in stupefaction as their eyes widened with incredulity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the world fell apart, various Principles pervaded the space, as divine light burned down everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if that wasn&#8217;t terrifying enough, cultivators who were tainted by a sliver of this energy turned to dust instantly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire world was shrinking and collapsing. At the same time, it was like a crumbling continent that shark towards the centre. Meanwhile, the edges, where the sea of nothingness and chaotic turbulences touched, disintegrated into specks of dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This isn&#8217;t just the end of the world. It&#8217;s recreating it. All living beings born of this world will die!&#8221; gasped a Sacred Emperor Realm expert with fright as he shuddered in fear and worry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The energy fluctuations left him fearful and devastated, even though he was incredibly powerful. In fact, he felt as defenceless as a vermin. So what more could be said about the other cultivators, whose legs turned to jelly and faces blanched?!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was even more devastating was the fact that they couldn&#8217;t find a way to flee this place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Heavenly Dao here was chaotic, the Principles were in shambles. Everything was a mess. They couldn&#8217;t sense the Upper Realm&#8217;s aura at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, someone noticed the rate the sky was collapsing. It was relatively paced. However, only the central region of the Profound Sword World remained unscathed and unaffected by the catastrophe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Quick, to the central region!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We might be able to survive there!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People from various parts of Profound Sword World shouted. While glowing, runes enveloped their entire body, and they rushed towards the central region at top speed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, everyone rushed towards the central region with fear, believing this was their only hope of surviing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain ranges crumbled as the earth cracked, all while volcanoes erupted and spewed scarlet flames, burning everything they touched. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catastrophe descended once again, and all sentient beings perished into nothingness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the entire Profound Sword World was being obliterated, thick destructive energy interweaved in a dark space. Chaotic Lights dissipated as various vast and majestic forces that could obliterate a person floated about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark cages floated within the space, encasing many devastated Earth Sword Immortals, captured from Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They trembled with great fear when they gazed upon the dark throne within the space, where a man in white sat upright, seemingly waiting for someone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to him stood the true body of the World’s Will, who was speaking deferentially.</span></p>

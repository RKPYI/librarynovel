          >Empress Yao Xi thought Gu Changge didn&#8217;t believe her when he
          heard her words. Instead, she started explaining solemnly. &#8220;I
          prepared more than 20 years in advance for this banquet. I even went
          to the Immortal Academy to exchange for a long-lost brewing method
          from an old monster. Other than that, I personally went to an
          extremely cold place in the Demon World to harvest
          eight-million-year-old Ice Lotuses to dilute the medicinal effect of
          the royal wine because I was worried that it would be too effective,
          causing the one to consume it to explode from the amount of power and
          die.&#8221;</span

          >She had never said these words to anyone. Even her closest female
          officers who supported her knew nothing about this. No one knew how
          long she had been preparing for the Banquet of Prodigies. However, she
          hid nothing in front of Gu Changge because she felt that he could
          understand her good intentions.</span

          &#8220;Really? I will have to enjoy the royal wine you mentioned in a
          while. They will probably be even more grateful for you if they knew
          that their Empress has put so much effort into this
          banquet.&#8221;</span

          Empress Yao Xi pointed at the many young prodigies below and chuckled,
          her voice proud. &#8220;They are the Demon World&#8217;s future, after
          all. I haven&#8217;t done much.&#8221;</span

          >This endless and magnificent territory within sight all belonged to
          her, and the many people in it were her subjects. For her, the hard
          work and effort put in for more than 6000 years were all worth it.

          laughed Gu Changge when he heard her reply. He then glanced at Jun
          Fan, who was sitting cross-legged at his seat with his eyes closed,
          refining a Bodhi Dao Fruit. When he couldn&#8217;t see anything
          unusual about the man, he continued to ask casually, &#8220;But Your
          Majesty, do you think all this is worth it?&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Empress Yao Xi frowned slightly and only mulled over it for a short
          moment before she replied, &#8220;They will serve me sincerely in the
          future and bring new changes to the Demon World. I don&#8217;t think
          there is anything unworthy about it.&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge hummed in return, and he now sported a nonchalant smile.
          &#8220;Is that so?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You have so much trust in
          them just because you think that they will all serve you,
          hmm?&#8221;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Of course I trust them. I chose them all myself.&#8221;
          Empress Yao Xi took a confused glance at him. She didn&#8217;t
          understand why he would ask her this. [Could it be that he is
          suspicious of the group of young prodigies in front of us? But, that’s
          impossible. All of them here managed to get here after I had
          personally checked them a long time ago. I would have known from way
          before if they had other plans up their sleeve.]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; Gu Changge nodded without agreeing or
          denying her words. He began to understand Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s
          thoughts then. [She is too consumed by what is to happen in the far
          future to notice what is going on right in front of her.]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before this, he had wondered whether Empress Yao Xi would have
          anything prepared for any unexpected events happening during the
          banquet. However, he could tell from her words that he had
          overestimated her. He had helped Empress Yao Xi gauge Jun
          Bufan&#8217;s reaction just now, but she didn&#8217;t notice it at
          all. It seemed like she would only react by the time Jun Bufan was
          thrusting a blade in her direction.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Perhaps, in her naive opinion, Jun Bufan wouldn&#8217;t dare to
          appear in front of her now even if he wasn&#8217;t dead. Empress Yao
          Xi, you might be qualified as the Empress of the Demon World, but you
          don’t have what it takes to be an excellent monarch.]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To Gu Changge, a monarch shouldn&#8217;t easily trust others, even
          their own confidants. If he hadn&#8217;t gone to the Demon World this
          time, Empress Yao Xi might have suffered a big loss, and gotten
          gravely injured during the banquet. According to the common cliches
          that he knew, the current ruler of the Demon World would be
          overthrown, and Empress Yao Xi would become a prisoner. Her fiancé Jun
          Bufan, who was poisoned by her, would show himself to the world again
          to admonish her for all her crimes. From then on, he would take charge
          of the Demon World and become the new Emperor of the Demon
          World.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even if the turmoil was quelled, Empress Yao Xi would have to spend a
          lot of effort to find Jun Bufan, the mastermind behind the scenes.
          After all, she was blind to the fact that Jun Bufan was right in front
          of her. She was even optimistic about him and cherished his talents.
          Gu Changge himself might have fallen for it if it hadn&#8217;t been
          due to his ability to view others&#8217; Fortuity.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          It would be strange if nothing happened.]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He shook his head and glanced at Empress Yao Xi with a smile.
          &#8220;But I am afraid everyone in the Demon World will never know
          that their cold-blooded and cruel Empress has such a pure and lovely
          side.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          you trying to say, Young Master Changge? Are you scolding or praising
          me?&#8221;

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She mustered a response, but she still hadn&#8217;t fully grasped
          what was going in. It was difficult for her to maintain her usual
          regality as the Empress. She even wondered if she had misheard those
          words about how she was pure and lovely.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Having heard that for the first time in her life, she couldn&#8217;t
          help the awkwardness and panic that suddenly hit her. She had always
          known that she had nothing to do with those descriptions. Not to
          mention, her image in the hearts of everyone in the Demon World had
          always been cruel, murderous, and ruthless. In order to wipe out the
          remnants of the Demon Overlords, she did not hesitate to start wars
          everywhere. It had caused many mighty clans of the Demon World to
          perish in her hands.</span

      <p>

          numerous people were caused by her orders.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Realising that she thought he was making fun of her because he
          thought that her way of thinking was silly, Gu Changge smiled calmly
          and answered, &#8220;Of course, I am not scolding you, Your Majesty.
          It&#8217;s just that I suddenly saw another side of you. A huge
          contrast that made me feel that way.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Another side of me?] She stared hard at him. In the end, she
          couldn&#8217;t bear Gu Changge&#8217;s straightforward scrutiny, and
          she turned her head away to look at the many young prodigies
          below.</span

          >Instead of refuting, Gu Changge only let out a soft chuckle. Of
          course, he wouldn&#8217;t call her naive right now. He had tactfully
          described her as &#8216;pure&#8217;. He added a &#8216;lovable&#8217;
          to the adjective to make it sound better.</span

          >At this moment, under the main seat, almost all the young prodigies
          were refining and absorbing after consuming the Bodhi Dao Fruit. Their
          bodies were surrounded by divine light, and the precious brilliance
          flickered. They didn&#8217;t miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

          stared at them with envy and jealousy in their eyes. All they could
          feel was how the aura of all these young prodigies got stronger. As
          dawn came, and the orange afterglow lingered, the entire Sacred
          Mountain was shrouded in pale gold, making it solemn and

          own strength, and they were pleasantly surprised. Afterwards, they got

          fruit before today. Now that they got many opportunities at the

          eyes as he snapped back to reality from his epiphany. With a natural
          expression, he thanked Empress Yao Xi like the rest of the young

          Empress Yao Xi had prepared.</span

          >As soon as Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s words fell, many beautiful women in
          flowy dresses and earthen jars in their hands walked out behind her.
          Even though those simple-looking pots were sealed, there was still a
          strong aroma of wine drifting in the air.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The ladies then glided in front of the young prodigies, unsealed the
          jars, and poured the wine in one fell swoop.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As if it contained spirituality, a light golden liquid swiftly rolled
          out of the jars and fell into the white jade wine bowls in front of
          the young prodigies.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many young prodigies stared wide-eyed at it. Their faces had turned
          red, and their balance was off from just smelling the scent of the
          wine. The astonishing medicinal properties that filled the air
          contained a majestic energy that seemed to be able to crush their
          internal organs.

          >*Hum* The void started to tremble as divine light of various colours
          burst out flowing and intertwining. This was a terrifying scene. Many
          of the banquet&#8217;s attendees even saw various visions emerging
          from the wine bowls. These visions ranged from the floating sun and
          moon, surging mountains and rivers, changing seasons, and thunder and
          lightning.</span

          >When many big figures of the Demon World recognised what kind of
          royal wine this was, their eyes widened, and their hearts thumped in
          shock. As far as they knew, the brewing method of Demonic Fairy Wine
          was lost a long time ago. However, there were still records of it in
          the history books. It was supposed to have indescribable magical
          effects, and even was capable of helping with rebirth.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, Empress Yao Xi would never be able to brew the real
          Demonic Fairy Wine. The rare ingredients alone would be difficult
          enough for her to acquire. It could only restore one ten-thousandth of
          its effects at most.</span

          quietly sneered, and he was the first to raise his head to empty the
          golden wine in the wine bowl. [You shall die after this wine
          course.]</span

          >Until now, Empress Yao Xi didn&#8217;t know that the winemaker she
          had especially hired had actually been headhunted by him. In order to
          be safe, Jun Fan controlled the many ministers who were in charge of
          the royal wine this time, and even firmly controlled the lives of
          their wives and children.</span

          her mouth slightly curled up, Empress Yao Xi personally poured wine

          Wine really deserves its reputation. Just smelling it was enough to

          >&#8220;It seems to be worth it,&#8221; she smiled in return. She was
          also pleased with herself. The female official behind her then stepped
          forward to test Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s wine for poison.</span

          Yao Xi drink up the bowl of wine, and a smile appeared on the corners
          of his mouth. [It is finally time!]

          >Still, he hadn&#8217;t crushed the jade talisman in his hand because
          it would take some time for the poison to work. He had used a mixed
          poison that had no effect if drank alone. Naturally, he didn&#8217;t
          have to worry about anyone noticing anything odd. It did, however,
          have an unimaginable miraculous effect when combined with the elixir
          powder that Qing Zhu gave to Empress Yao Xi before the latter had her
          meal.</span

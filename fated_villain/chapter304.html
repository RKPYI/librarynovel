        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proofreader: </strong><span style="color: #00ffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color><strong>Silavin </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the courtyard, Gu Changge was seen walking over. He had a slender and tall body, with a dashing face which carried a calming smile, emitting an outworldly, spectacular sensation.</span><span id="more-28384"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the followers behind him, having their own respective backgrounds, was by no means nobodies. Some from the Ancient Royal Family with their bodies covered in lightning; some from the ancient races born with golden horns. Nonetheless, all of them overflowed with a daunting and intimidating aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the Azure Dragon Emperor and his people, who were leading the way, couldn&#8217;t help but feel anxious as their faces turned pale since it was the first time they felt such a terrifying aura. Furthermore, it was the greatest of the younger generation present, himself. Despite ruling an entire empire, the Azure Dragon Emperor found no way to alleviate the tension within himself as he trotted to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmph!&#8221; Shooting Gu Changge a glance, Gu Xianer let out a snort, completely disregarding his question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, is your sudden visit also because of Qing Xiaoyi?&#8221; Quickly, the three Elders, having come to their senses, expressed various emotions on their faces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Great! It&#8217;s Young Master Changge!&#8221; In that instant, Qing Feng grew absolutely ecstatic as if he finally met his saviour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a glance at the ancient artifact in Gu Changge&#8217;s hand, Grandma Yin Hua nodded in realisation, after which she curiously asked, &#8220;Young Master Changge, you came with your aura concealed. Are you worried that someone might detect your presence?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancient artifact possessed the function to conceal one&#8217;s aura, and that was precisely the reason they didn&#8217;t notice Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival even with their heightening senses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, they couldn&#8217;t fathom why Gu Changge would need to hide his aura with this ancient artifact on his way here, and they wondered if he was concerned that someone might know his whereabouts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I am here for this kiddo right here.&#8221; Gu Changge turned to Gu Xianer, who was donning an indifferent, stone cold face, and smilingly claimed, &#8220;I wanted to give her a surprise. Alas, it appears I am unfortunately welcomed with pure slander.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bullshit!&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Xianer angrily glared at him, gritting her teeth. [When did I even slander you!? You’re the one who&#8217;s slandering me right now! You’ve just saw me and your mouth is already moving to spit out poison to my name]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, who is the one that said not to mention my name?&#8221; Gu Changge leisurely smiled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, Gu Xianer felt embarrassed, and she could only retain the freezing, wordless expression on her face. Frankly, she did not expect Gu Changge to eavesdrop on her. [Give me a surprise, my ass! He clearly wanted to sneak here and catch me off-guard then find some stupid excuse to bully me! Gu Changge, you evil, scheming bastard!]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, Elders, what do you think my plan is? To eavesdrop as you come to a conclusion before joining your discussion?&#8221; Ignoring Gu Xianer&#8217;s hatred-filled, chilling sharp gaze, Gu Changge walked towards the three Elders and smilingly asked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visibly taken aback, the Elders subconsciously took a step backward as they couldn&#8217;t behave as mindlessly with Gu Changge as they did with Gu Xianer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am guessing, Young Master Changge, you’ve already heard what is happening then.&#8221; Grandma Yin Hua took a deep breath and helplessly said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the Elders could arrive at a concrete conclusion, it was best for them not to confront Sky King Zhi Yang just yet. After all, although they were supreme right now, Sky King Zhi Yang was destined to surpass them in the future. They didn&#8217;t stand a chance against him. Most importantly, they couldn&#8217;t afford to upset Purple Mansion, his backers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put this less pleasantly, no matter how powerful Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s Talents was, even she couldn&#8217;t subdue Purple Mansion if she reached the height of her potential, let alone the fact that she was now merely an unready child. Besides, she didn&#8217;t have any forces to back her up, so none was willing to risk their life for her over such uncertainties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for her abduction, it would be too rash to decide that it was related to Sky King Zhi Yang or the Successor of Demonic Arts without any evidence, and disclosing such an inference to the public would be asking for trouble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm, I may have just arrived in time to overhear some things,&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly claimed. &#8220;It seems I didn&#8217;t miss out on anything crucial.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helpless, the three Elders peered at one another in awkwardness. Since they were all old and experienced, they understood that Gu Changge&#8217;s &#8216;in time&#8217; implied that he listened to every single detail of the incident in the dark. Thereupon, there was no point for them to explain themselves.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, since you are intelligent and wise, we shall cut to the chase. It is truly out of our power to further pursue this case. We do not dare to intervene in it as well, but that does not mean we don&#8217;t care about it,&#8221; one of the Elders bitterly stated, desperately wishing that Qing Xiaoyi could be rescued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, a minute ago, he used a Nine-Cycles Spirit Restoration Pill to save Qing Feng from death, in hope that Qing Xiaoyi would accept him as her mentor out of gratitude. Otherwise, his sacrifice would be painfully in vain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Gu Changge chuckled as he nodded. &#8220;Xianer informed me about Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s abduction. As her Senior, Xianer is at fault for failing to keep that little girl safe. And I, as Xianer&#8217;s big brother, am naturally responsible to deal with her mistakes. But of course, since you Elders have inferred who might have kidnapped Qing Xiaoyi, you can leave the rest to me. I am sure I don&#8217;t have to remind you what to say by then, as you Elders clearly know it, yes?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rest assured, Young Master Changge. We know what to say.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, the Elders&#8217; faces immediately changed as if they were in a daze. It was as if the devastation of the galaxy was occurring right before their eyes. Hastily, they nodded and answered, realising that Gu Changge genuinely intended to get involved in the matter. Given his identity, he indeed didn&#8217;t have to fear Sky King Zhi Yang as they did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this, the Elders also heard that there was an unresolvable feud between Gu Changge and Sky King Zhi Yang. Now that such a timely opportunity presented itself, there was no way Gu Changge would let it slide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the Elders were astounded. Gu Xianer was the reason a conflict arose between Gu Changge and Sky King Zhi Yang as well as Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s abduction. [The way Young Master Changge treats Gu Xianer is quite an envy-instilling one!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Gu Xianer stared at Gu Changge&#8217;s with slight stupefaction on her delicate face. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s not his style to agree to this so straightforwardly. Didn&#8217;t he always reject requests all the time?] Gu Xianer couldn&#8217;t help but grow suspicious of Gu Changge’s ulterior motive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, it was because of her that Gu Changge and Sky King Zhi Yang got into a fight, twice. Accordingly, Gu Changge even had his followers surround Sky King Zhi Yang and teach him a ruthless lesson, putting him through immense humiliation that he could never recover from in the fellow disciples&#8217; eyes. Truthfully, if she weren&#8217;t around, Gu Changge and Sky King Zhi Yang wouldn&#8217;t have so much drama between them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, Gu Xianer felt a gush of warmth flowing in her heart. Although Gu Changge always liked to bully her, he honestly never let anyone else bully her or make her feel worthless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The conflicts between Gu Changge and Sky King Zhi Yang are irrefutably related to me. It&#8217;s no wonder why Qing Feng claims that Gu Changge spoils me so much. And I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s how anyone else sees it as well. But none of them had seen him bullying me before!] Gu Xianer snickered in her heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is great! Thank you, Young Master Changge!&#8221; Seeing Gu Changge agreeing so directly, Qing Feng grew excitedly joyous and thanked him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before that, Qing Feng always thought Gu Changge and him were beings of different worlds, and his assistance was nothing but a momentarily feigning of sympathy. There was no way he would ever lend a hand to the fragile siblings. Nonetheless, little did he expect, Gu Changge actually promised to save Qing Xiaoyi without the faintest hesitation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Young Master Changge is such a compassionate man! To think I held such prejudice against him…] Qing Feng felt somewhat embarrassed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, he turned to Gu Xianer and thanked, &#8220;You have my gratitude, Senior Xianer.&#8221; Of course, Qing Feng was also aware of Gu Xianer&#8217;s many contributions to the matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subtly nodding, Gu Xianer assured, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry. Gu Changge never breaks his promises.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge burst out in laughter. &#8220;Oh, you do know me very well, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rendered speechless, Gu Xianer rolled her eyes on him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, this is the Flask of World Domination. There is no way I can ever repay my debt to you, so…&#8221; Then, Qing Feng, despite his reluctance, decided to hand the Flask of World Domination over to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that his body had been improved by the Flask of World Domination, there was no longer the need for him to hide it as he could now cultivate properly like the other young prodigies. Moreover, the Flask of World Domination was no longer as useful as it was before, and although it remained precious, nothing was more precious than his own sister.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon that sight, the eyes of the Elders were filled with envy, but they dared not to speak of anything. Since Qing Feng made the decision on his own accord, no one could force him out of it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So this is your Flask of World Domination. Though, do you really think I really need such an item?&#8221; After observing the Flask of World Domination, Gu Changge casually smiled. Seemingly uninterested, he returned the flask to Qing Feng and stated, &#8220;Such a thing is of no significance to me, but it should serve you better.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right away, Qing Feng was stunned by how the ever so invaluable Flask of World Domination meant nothing to Gu Changge. Even the three Elders as well as Gu Xianer were stunned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since when has Gu Changge become so altruistic, rejecting repayment? He even rejected such a treasure?]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking a deep breath, instead of accepting the flask, Qing Feng rejected, &#8220;Young Master Changge, you must accept the flask, or else, I don&#8217;t even know how to thank you. You helped me and my sister back at the entrance of the Immortal Academy, and we haven&#8217;t managed to repay you for that. Now that Xiao Yi&#8217;s abducted, I know that no one would ever save her if you hadn&#8217;t shown up. Besides, almost everyone knows that the Flask of World Domination is in my hands. Do you think I&#8217;ll be able to hold on to such a treasure? When the time comes, surely many will come to seize it, and they may even try to take my life in the process,&#8221; Qing Feng explained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Flask of World Domination was in his possession, he was aware that it would draw problems towards himself anytime, but things would be different were it in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands as none dared to challenge him. Even if those in the Sacred Emperor Realms knew that Gu Changge was the one carrying the Flask of World Domination, they wouldn&#8217;t dare to engage him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, does that mean I&#8217;m saving your life once again?&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly questioned. Without saying more, he accepted the Flask of World Domination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long time ago, he predicted that Qing Feng would eventually surrender the Flask of World Domination to him without him ever having to resort to force. Thus, everything else fell under his prediction, so did this handover.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uhh…&#8221; Qing Feng awkwardly rubbed his nose. Although Gu Changge was right, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel strange. Not only did Gu Changge accept his artifact, but it appeared he now owed Gu Changge another debt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge waved his hand and said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry about Qing Xiaoyi. I am sure the Elders have come with her Life Plaque, yes?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Grandma Yin Hua nodded. As she swung her arm, a glowing Life Plaque appeared out of thin air in front of her. Its calm state indicated that Qing Xiaoyi was currently safe and in no danger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, Qing Feng heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Things are much simpler with the Life Plaque. As long as I am near Qing Xiaoyi, I&#8217;ll be able to locate her exact whereabouts by detecting her presence with a Secret Technique,&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly claimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is great!&#8221; Qing Feng was thrilled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, I shall hand the matter pertaining to Sky King Zhi Yang to the Elders.&#8221; Upon those words, Grandma Yin Hua and the other Elders were left with no choice. To be truthful, they didn&#8217;t want to get involved as they would rather stay away from offending either party. Nevertheless, since Gu Changge already gave his word that he could rescue Qing Xiaoyi, there was no way they could refuse to help him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Worry not, Young Master Changge. We shall tend to it fair and square without any prejudice. We will relay what happened today to the Immortal Academy,&#8221; the three Elders assured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then consider me relieved.&#8221; Gu Changge subtly smiled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, without saying more, the three Elders promptly left, and with their Sacred Emperor Realm abilities, they passed on information of this incident to the Immortal Academy, leaving the decision to the higher-ups.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Spread the word: Sky King Zhi Yang has abducted Qing Xiaoyi.&#8221; Squinting his eyes, Gu Changge ordered the followers behind him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, he wasn&#8217;t quite bothered by Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s absence in Black Tortoise Empire as Yin Mei was there, meticulously observing the actions of young prodigies while supervising Ying Shuang&#8217;s whereabouts. At the same time, while Sky King Zhi Yang was tracking Su Qingge down, Gu Changge intended to welcome him back with a big and amazing surprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Young Master Gu!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiftly, the group of followers departed with photographic stones in their hands, which they used to record whatever happened earlier upon Gu Changge&#8217;s instruction. After all, those hints were discovered by the Elders themselves, so if Gu Changge were to baselessly spread such words, many would assume that he was attempting to defame Sky King Zhi Yang. Though that was exactly what he was doing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, despite the Elders&#8217; wish to make the incident hidden from the public, that would be impossible now as their conversation was recorded. Thus, Sky King Zhi Yang wouldn&#8217;t be able to shake suspicion off him no matter how hard he tried.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, Qing Feng tactfully left, leaving Gu Changge and Gu Xianer the only people in the courtyard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a glance at the leisurely Gu Changge, Gu Xianer suddenly panicked, though she managed to retain her cold, composed look.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You may drop the act now that we&#8217;re alone. You are the exact opposite of the definition of &#8216;elegance,'&#8221; Gu Changge mischievously chuckled, breaking the silence between them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who&#8217;s acting? W-What are you laughing about!?&#8221; Gu Xianer angrily gazed at him. Whenever she was with Gu Changge, she would always fail to remain calm as he would always disrupt her mind.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m laughing at your tendency to cause trouble. Why don&#8217;t you be a nice little girl and stop steering problems my way, hmm?&#8221; Gu Changge sat down on a bench and unaffectedly grabbed a cup of tea before drinking it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me…&#8221; Gu Xianer stated with a scornful look, and when she caught Gu Changge drinking from her cup, vexation instantly surged on her flawless, delicate face. &#8220;Hey, put my teacup down! That&#8217;s mine!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No wonder it&#8217;s so bad.&#8221; Unaffected, Gu Changge put down the cup after taking a sip. &#8220;Say, have you been sick recently?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s sick! You clearly just want to drink off the teacup I placed my lips on!&#8221; Gu Xianer let out a snicker with a cold look on her face as her voice was filled with iciness. Though, there was more embarrassment in it than coldness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, Gu Changge put his lips on where she drank from, and he even insulted her tea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It tastes bad,&#8221; he then repeated as he shook his head while his face remained unbothered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shut up, you sly cheapskate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh! With a contemptuous look, she drew her sword. &#8220;Go away. Get the hell away from my bench!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at this moment Gu Changge burst into laughter. &#8220;I can&#8217;t even sit on your bench? Did you yell for me all the way here just to make me solve all your problems, expecting me not to get anything in return? Gu Xianer, do you think you’ll get to take advantage of me all the time? You did it last time, and I&#8217;ve yet to collect my reimbursement from you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Xianer lost her temper and vexedly drew her fist. &#8220;Gu Changge, shameless as ever. You say that, but obviously you&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s taken the biggest advantage!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh? What advantage did I take? Care to elaborate? I don&#8217;t think I have enough on my plate?&#8221; Gu Changge breezily shot a volley of questions as he suddenly stood up, slowly walking towards her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* All of a sudden, Gu Xianer sensed a frightening aura charging at her, as if the vast astral plane was collapsing on her. In that instant, she was too afraid to make a move and she could only watch as Gu Changge approached her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t care! My problems are your problems too! *W-Wah…* What are you going to do…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuckling, Gu Changge pinched the bridge of her nose. &#8220;What do you think I&#8217;m going to do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahh! I&#8217;m going to kill you!&#8221; Infuriated, Gu Xianer was frustrated. In spite of her frustration, if they actually fought, there was no way she could beat him as she would easily be subdued by him with a slap instead.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, you better not bully a poor, pitiful girl—&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll bully you forever,&#8221; Gu Changge laughingly interrupted as he saw how she was going to slash him with the sword in her hand out of rage. Instantaneously, he teleported backwards and reappeared on a roof far away. In the blink of an eye, as if he disappeared into the winds, he was no longer anywhere to be seen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Xianer furiously watched as Gu Changge vanished. Ultimately, she could only vent her frustration in the courtyard all by herself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew he didn&#8217;t come with any good intentions. Who would want to get bullied by you forever…&#8221; She resentfully muttered to herself and let out a scoff. &#8220;Hmph! Dream on!&#8221;</span></p>

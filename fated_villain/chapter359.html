        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Proofreader: </strong><span style="color: #00ffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color><strong>Silavin

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several hours later, Yue Mingkong lay lazily on the sofa in her chamber,
                looking spent and not wanting to move a finger.</span><span id="more-29185"></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge, on the other hand, looked at the frayed map in his hands
                with great interest and, in the end, landed his gaze on the spot Yue Mingkong circled out. &#8220;So
                this is where the Tower of World Domination is located? The Sky Jade Mountain Range?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;ve flipped through many ancient books before
                finally learning the possible location the Tower of World Domination might emerge.&#8221; Yue
                Mingkong&#8217;s crisp voice travelled over.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded in response. &#8220;Out of the Seven Tools of World
                Domination, I now have the Flask and the Jar…&#8221; While speaking, he waved his arm, and a
                plain-looking jar and flask with glittering light appeared in his hands.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Flask of World Domination, especially, had intertwining strands
                of glowing light that looked like it could illuminate the void at any time.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Jar of World Domination, it looked no different from any
                other ordinary jar. It was raven-black, and it drooped out some kind of strange light, as though it
                could devour everything.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rumour has it that the Jar of World Domination was a forgery of the
                Grand Flask. However, just how powerful and horrifying it was, no one knew, and Gu Changge had never
                really tried it before.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So these are the Flask and Jar of World Domination?&#8221; Curious,
                Yue Mingkong came closer.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Word is that anyone who can gather all Seven Tools of World
                Domination can open the Immortal Palace Treasury. But who knows if it&#8217;s real or just a
                myth.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and handed the two artifacts to her, stupefying her as she looked at him
                with bafflement. &#8220;Why are you handing them to me?&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, she was intending to hand him the Mirror and Seal of
                World Domination, but who&#8217;d have thought he gave her the Jar and the Flask instead.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly speaking, Yue Mingkong didn&#8217;t know how to react to it,
                as it wasn&#8217;t Gu Changge to do something like this.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re collecting the Seven Tools of World Domination,
                are you not? I happen to have no use for them, so here you go.&#8221; He smiled.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have no use for them either.&#8221; The young woman shot her
                fiancé a dirty look. Though surprised that Gu Changge would do something like this, she still felt
                touched.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you collecting them then?&#8221; Gu Changge was rather
                surprised. &#8220;Have you actually collected them for me?&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Naturally.&#8221; Yue Mingkong snorted, but her gaze was
                riveted on him. Then, with a wave of her arm, the void rippled, and a crystal-clear mirror and a seal
                that looked to be forged from violet gold ore floated in the space. A mystical aura surged around them,
                making them look enigmatic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So these are the Seal and Mirror of World Domination?&#8221;
                asked Gu Changge matter-of-factly as he quirked a brow. He could already vaguely sense the connections
                between these Tools of World Domination.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one knew who forged these artifacts. They were made with different
                materials and means of forging as well. Each gave off a different sense. However, between each of them,
                there seemed to be an inexplicable connection. [No wonder there are rumours that the Seven Tools of
                World Domination can open up the Immortal Palace Treasury.]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My Mingkong sure is the best,&#8221; Gu Changge said with a
                smile, then kept the artifacts away with a wave of his hand. [Well, she naturally wouldn&#8217;t be left
                out if there are treasures there.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days after that, Gu Changge began devising some plans according
                to the information he got from Yue Mingkong. It was without a doubt that he had to obtain the Tower of
                World Domination. But other than that, he also needed to devise a plan for the Demon-Burying
                Abyss.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though no news had come from the Demon-Burying Abyss lately, Gu
                Changge thought it was a sign of the calm before the storm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once demoness in red, Chan Hongyi, emerges, chaos would undoubtedly
                befall the Upper Realm. Though he had long planned on the appearance of the demoness, the Floating
                Buddhist Temple was guarding the Demon-Burying Abyss, and given the tight security, barely anyone could
                even approach the place.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Yure Mingkong certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the only one
                who knew about the existence of the Tower of World Domination. Thus, he&#8217;d had to make advance
                preparations in case there were others vying for it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Yue Mingkong was giving her own orders as she intended to
                follow Gu Changge up the Sky Jade Mountain Range.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location was actually pretty far from the Immortal Academy, and
                they would have to pass a few teleportation arrays. Because it was rather secluded and close to the
                wastelands, there would be much fewer powerful forces. So even if they encountered powerful cultivators,
                they wouldn&#8217;t be much stronger. Thus, the only thing Gu Changge needed to worry about was if
                others would get to the artifact before him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that were to happen, it&#8217;d be even more difficult for him to
                gather all Seven Tools of World Domination.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had always had an agenda for the Immortal Palace Treasury.
                Not because he was personally interested in the things hidden within. Rather, he just needed them for
                refining the Eight Barren Demon Halberd, and only the Immortal Palace, which once dominated the entire
                world, had what he needed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days passed in the blink of an eye, and peace gradually returned to
                the Immortal Academy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Successor of Demonic Arts that all the disciples once feared
                seemed to have also gradually vanished following Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s execution, which put many
                Elders and disciples at ease, no longer jittery like before.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no longer hearsay about disciples being mutilated by the
                Successor of Demonic Arts anymore. Rather, signs of the Successor of Demonic Arts appearing in several
                places in the outside world began surfacing, leading many to be on alert.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, right then, Wang Zijin was reprimanding Jiang Chuchu in a
                cave mansion. &#8220;Look how much of an idiot you are, Jiang Chuchu!&#8221; </span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was so disappointed in the saintess that she was close to pointing and
                cussing at the latter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You know just how much of a womaniser Gu Changge is, and yet
                you still expect him to treat you well!? Bastards like him are people you should be staying far away
                from. You shouldn&#8217;t even give him a chance to touch you!&#8221; While speaking, a tinge of red
                laced her fair face, seemingly also livid with herself.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu was normally calm and collected in front of Wang Zijin.
                In fact, she would even normally go against the latter. However, after being severely reprimanded this
                time, Jiang Chuchu only drooped her head while clenching the hem of her skirt like a misbehaved child,
                taking pains to speak up, for she thought Wang Zijin was right and she couldn&#8217;t
                refute.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Trial ended, Wang Zijin interrogated Jiang Chuchu after
                returning to the Immortal Academy. The latter yielded in the end and confessed that she and Gu Changge
                were closer than people thought.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a shrewd one, Wang Zijin realised, through her observation over
                the past few days, that her friend would always space out and also leave the cave mansion every now and
                then to wander outside.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, she decided to stalk Jiang Chuchu only to discover that the
                young woman would walk towards Gu Changge&#8217;s chamber after wandering around, then stand beside the
                stone slab outside, waiting for god-knows-what.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though she&#8217;d find Jiang Chuchu leaving dejectedly at the end of
                the day, the latter would then once again wander to Gu Changge&#8217;s chamber a few days
                later.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, even a blind man could tell Jiang Chuchu wanted to
                speak to Gu Changge and yet didn&#8217;t know how to bring it up. So she ended up stuck in a loop of
                hesitation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Zijin had to hand it to Jiang Chuchu. The young woman obviously
                minded it, yet she still put up a nonchalant front.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, she felt rather bad for Jiang Chuchu.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though she didn&#8217;t know when her friend had gotten familiar with
                Gu Changge, judging from Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s current behaviour, she had fallen pretty deep into the
                relationship. And yet, Gu Changge was no decent man. In fact, the sky might fall before the man would
                take his romance seriously.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s situation, Wang Zijin only had one thing
                to say — she could do nothing after Gu Changge ate her up and walked away.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then… What do you suppose I should do now?&#8221; asked Jiang
                Chuchu after coming to herself while Wang Zijin was complaining about her.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had only told Wang Zijin all about it because she trusted the
                latter. After all, they grew up and cultivated together in the Mortal Palace since they were kids.
                Though they constantly bickered, they were still technically close.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What you should do now is to stay as far away from Gu Changge
                as possible. Better if you can ignore him. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You
                </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are the mighty Successor of Mortal Palace, a Saintess that
                many worship, and plenty of young prodigies also try to win your heart… The more you act like
                you&#8217;re desperate to see him, the cheaper you look. You get me? So, you just have to put on your
                usual aloof front at this time. That way, only wouldn&#8217;t Gu Changge look down on you,
                understand?&#8221; Wang Zijin advised analytically like a Senior Romance Expert. Sure, she had never
                been in a romantic relationship before, but it didn&#8217;t mean she had never seen others in
                one.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu thought what her friend said made sense. Perhaps the
                reason Gu Changge would constantly bully her was that she behaved like a damsel in distress in front of
                him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hold up. Why does it feel like you&#8217;re actually creating
                opportunities for yourself?&#8221; She looked sceptically at Wang Zijin, who snorted and rebuked,
                &#8220;I&#8217;ve already seen through that bloody Bastard. Do you think I&#8217;m an idiot like
                you?!&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu nodded thoughtfully, but her gaze was still filled with
                scepticism, for she remembered well that Wang Zijin&#8217;s words were entirely different back
                then.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Either way, Gu Changge&#8217;s no decent man. You can&#8217;t
                always be this naive, Chuchu…&#8221; cautioned Wang Zijin while rolling her eyes. </span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu nodded in acknowledgement. &#8220;I know he&#8217;s no
                good guy.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there was more she didn&#8217;t disclose, like him being
                the real Successor of Demonic Arts, and that even the Mortal One died brutally in his hands.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Wang Zijin knew far less about Gu Changge than she did, she
                still did as the former said in the next few days. However, very quickly, she discovered that Gu Changge
                had already left the Immortal Academy, and the other person who followed along was his fiancée, Yue
                Mingkong.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revelation rendered the poor young woman stupefied for a long
                while before becoming upset for quite some time. Gu Changge genuinely had no intentions of even seeing
                her after he returned to the Immortal Academy, and she couldn&#8217;t help doubting Wang Zijin&#8217;s
                words.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, at a hill in Heavenly Ruin Gate, there situated a few huts
                and a couple patches of bamboo groves. In front of the huts was a herbal field with a few old trees by
                the side. The place had serene written all over it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it was where the handymen lived, Jiang Chen thought it suited
                him just fine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, it was no grand house or majestic palace, but everything here
                looked confident and simple. Cultivating here had him believing he had improved immensely.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;According to Senior Black&#8217;s words, I&#8217;m close to
                opening up the Spiritual Sea now.&#8221; Jiang Chen focused on his Dantian, where a fist-sized spiritual
                energy vortex was hovering, slowly absorbing the surrounding essence of the universe.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he kept at this pace, he&#8217;d become a true cultivator in at
                most three days.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, he only managed to achieve such speed because the young
                woman named Chuyue ordered her men to bring him all sorts of elixirs and pills over these past few
                days.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though they were all bland, the ingredients being nothing but
                average, they still helped him in grasping spiritual energy. Furthermore, he had learned quite a few
                things through asking around these past few days.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the young woman named Chuyue wasn&#8217;t just anybody,
                and she wasn&#8217;t a disciple of Heavenly Ruin Gate but from an old force called the Hidden Ji Family.
                It had a long legacy, far longer than Purple Mansion, which Gu Changge had obliterated some time
                ago.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue seemed to have come here in search of something, as she had
                been sending cultivators to search the entire mountain range to no avail.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, an idea popped into Jiang Chen&#8217;s head. The only use of
                the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation now was to explore terrain changes, direction of
                Fortuity, and so on. [Isn&#8217;t searching what it does best?!]</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he could help her find what she was looking for, she&#8217;d owe
                him a favour. Though it would be as far as entering the Hidden Ji Family, it&#8217;d be much easier if
                he ever encountered any trouble, given the debt.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, he still hadn&#8217;t found the perfect excuse. Besides,
                she might not even trust him. After all, he was barely even a cultivator.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation
                spoke up. &lt;You can tell her you&#8217;re actually the Successor of a Divine Source Master, and your
                ancestors have a couple of tricks in hunting and sourcing out treasure. No doubt she&#8217;ll believe
                you.&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the suggestion stumped Jiang Chen a little, and he asked in
                bafflement, &#8220;Divine Source Master? What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;It&#8217;s a long lost legacy that can search for the Source of
                the Universe, explore terrains, peer into heaven and earth, lock the dragon vein using Principles,
                change the world to your will… They can do almost anything. Coincidentally, the tricks I currently know
                can deceive them through this identity,&gt; suggested the Artifact Spirit.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen&#8217;s eyes lit up in response, and he hurriedly left the
                place and went to search for Ji Chuyue to talk about it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ji Chuyue was pondering with a frown in a tower, feeling
                somewhat bewildered. [Many cultivators seem to have shown up here lately. But why would people visit
                such a secluded place all of a sudden? Can it be that someone had let the cat out of the
                bag?]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her family had only learned about the emergence of the Tower of World
                Domination after spending great lengths in research and study. Though the Hidden Ji Family had a long
                history, they had very few young prodigies these past recent years, and their family was beginning to
                show signs of regression.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they didn&#8217;t do something, the Hidden Ji Family would undoubtedly
                become a second-rated family very soon and lose its former glory. Because of that, she and her brother
                had decided to secretly find the Seven Tools of World Domination in hopes of finding the legendary
                Immortal Palace Treasury to revive their family.</span></p>

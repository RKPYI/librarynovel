          old man and the other True Daoists were astounded and found it hard to
          believe Gu Changge had not only agreed to lend a hundred Immortal
          Crystals to her, but he also intended to personally bring them to
          her.</span

          >Although many were shocked by Gu Changge’s wealth and ability to
          produce another hundred Immortal Crystals, they were more shocked by
          the attitude of the demoness in red. In contrast to Gu Changge’s
          assertiveness, the formidable demoness appeared remarkably subdued in
          that moment.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As they listened intently, they couldn’t help but ponder over the
          events that transpired during the battle in Divine City. The demoness
          in red seemed to be familiar with Gu Changge.</span

      <p>

          >“Many have met their demise by her hand. Gu Changge is really
          courageous, does he not fear that she may suddenly lash out?” All
          watched on with grave expressions on their faces.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Young Master Gu is not one to act recklessly. He must be certain
          that she would not strike at him all of a sudden,” the Phoenix Lady
          speculated in a hushed tone, finding herself increasingly intrigued
          about Gu Changge’s behavior and his unpredictable actions.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was extremely dim inside the demonic cloud and chaotic energy
          permeated the air. Amidst the shadows, a black carriage was parked.
          The four black Demonic Water Serpents with crimson eyes roared
          ferociously in front of it. Yet upon Gu Changge’s arrival, even these
          fearsome creatures appeared intimidated and backed off.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!!* Suddenly, a burst of red light erupted from the carriage,
          accompanied by an aura of immense might. The four Demonic Water
          Serpents immediately cowered, too intimidated to make any further
          movements.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Why bother? They’re mere beasts.” Gu Changge smiled faintly, and
          walked towards the carriage without any apprehension that Chan Hongyi,
          who was in it, would attack him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You don’t have to come here, just toss the Immortal Crystals my
          way,” Chan Hongyi said calmly. Her piercing gaze was icy, conveying a
          sense of ruthlessness. The carriage’s curtain parted, revealing a
          delicate, fair hand that glowed with the luster of jade. The hand
          beckoned to him, urging him to hand over the jade jar.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I’ve already walked all the way here, don’t you even want to see me,
          Hongyi?” Gu Changge shook his head as he continued toward the carriage
          like he didn’t notice her outstretched hand. There was a tinge of
          disappointment in his words.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You really put me in a lot of pain when you poisoned me last time…”
          He spoke softly, a slight grin forming at the corner of his
          lips.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Chan Hongyi, seated in the carriage, felt a sudden shiver run down
          her spine at his words. Without saying a word, her gaze hardened as
          she swiftly raised her hand and struck out, determined to take control
          of the situation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The current her, who had rushed all the way to Dark Kun City, was
          merely a phantom of her true self, and not even an incarnation.
          Otherwise, given her fiery temperament, she would not have exchanged
          pleasantries with the group of ancient beings outside, but promptly
          seized the Cursed Rock.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!!* Gu Changge was unfazed by the sudden explosion and simply
          smiled before swiftly striking forward with his palm too. Principles
          swirled around him as he expertly countered Chan Hongyi using the same
          skill.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He realized that Chan Hongyi’s power had not yet fully returned, not
          even a fraction of what it once was at its peak. Furthermore, he knew
          that it was not actually her who had arrived in this place.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Suddenly, the area erupted into chaos as cracks appeared in space,
          creating a dizzying blur.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All the Principles seemed to be broken, causing an intense aura to
          surge upward, spreading in every direction. Another terrifying aura,
          infused with the Nirvana Realm Principles, threatened to break free
          from the domain and shake the very foundations of the Dark Kun
          City.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone including those from the Devil Mountain looked on in
          disbelief as they witnessed the chaotic scene unfold. The
          white-bearded old man and others swiftly sprang into action to block
          the surging energy, preventing any catastrophic consequences that
          could potentially wreak havoc on the entire Dark Kun City.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They never expected that Gu Changge would suddenly engage in a fierce
          battle with the demoness in red. They had assumed that the two would
          reminisce about the past, and this sudden turn of events cast doubt on
          left their earlier speculations. If they were indeed close
          acquaintances, why were they now fighting like they were going to kill
          each other?</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Demonic fog engulfed everything in its path. Chan Hongyi stepped out
          of the carriage, donned in a striking red dress that resembled blood.
          Her eyes were void of emotion as she prepared to engage in a fierce
          battle with Gu Changge. Despite being a phantom, her strength
          surpassed even that of True Daoists.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The terrifying aura manifested into various ancient runes and
          condensed in the air before hurtling toward Gu Changge with the force
          of a thousand swords, spears, and halberds. The clash of their powers
          illuminated the surroundings, as all kinds of ancient and even
          long-forgotten abilities and techniques were unleashed. Those outside
          the demonic fog could only sense the intense turbulence, but were
          unable to catch even a glimpse of the epic battle unfolding before
          them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge effortlessly dispelled the formidable attacks before him.
          His countenance remained serene as he gently shook his head and asked
          in a manner only she could hear, “Are you certain you wish to fight
          me? Don’t forget, all that you know was imparted to you by me.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing his words, Chan Hongyi gracefully descended from the sky
          and halted her attack. She gazed upon Gu Changge coldly, choosing not
          to speak. She had merely acted preemptively because she sensed a
          potential attack from Gu Changge just now.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Compared to their last encounter in Divine City, Gu Changge’s
          strength had grown significantly. Moreover, Chan Hongyi was uncertain
          if she could defeat him as she had no idea what tricks Gu Changge had
          up his sleeve.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Hand over the Immortal Crystals,” she demanded.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Moments ago, you tried to kill me and now you’re demanding Immortal
          Crystals from me,” Gu Changge’s gaze fell on her face and remarked
          with intrigue. “Do you not see the error in your ways? Or do you
          persist in believing that your actions are justified?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Chan Hongyi’s tone was chilly as she assured, “I fully intend to pay
          back what I borrowed from you.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge simply shook his head and smiled gently. “That won’t be
          necessary. When have I ever said no to your request?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >While saying that, he suddenly took hold of Chan Hongyi’s hand. She
          instinctively flinched, but he pressed the jade jar filled with
          Celestial Spirits into her grasp. “I don’t have any Immortal Crystals,
          but there are quite a number of Celestial Spirits in this. You can
          keep the remaining for yourself after exchanging them for the
          rock.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Without awaiting Chan Hongyi’s response, Gu Changge left the demonic
          fog and stepped out into the open air. Chan Hongyi lowered her gaze,
          fixating it on the jade jar in her possession that was still radiating
          with the warmth of Gu Changge’s palm.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“When have you never said no to me…?” As she murmured these words,
          her eyes flickered with a fleeting emotion before coldness returned to
          them once again.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >Outside the demonic fog, the white-bearded old man and his companions
          had been anxiously awaiting for Gu Changge. Upon seeing his safe
          return, they let out a collective sigh of relief and couldn&#8217;t
          resist asking, “Young Master Changge, what happened just now? Why did
          you two suddenly fight? Are you unharmed?”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          breathing, Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, An Xi, and their companions couldn’t
          help but feel a hint of disappointment. They had hoped to witness Gu
          Changge suffer at the hands of the demoness in red, but it seemed that
          their expectations had fallen short. Gu Changge appeared unfazed and
          looked as if he hadn’t even lifted a finger.</span

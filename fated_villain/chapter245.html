        "Brother Gu should also attend the True Immortal Academy with his
        talent. I should be able to see Brother Gu again soon, just so I can ask
        him for advice on these matters."
      </p>
      <p>In the Ancient Ye Clan.</p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian, who was pacing with his hands behind his back inside the
        main hall, had a somewhat thoughtful look.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother, if this matter is true, then it is really terrifying, one
        inheritor of demonic art is already terrifying enough‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Next to him, Ye Liuli's expression was also cautious along with a sad
        expression on her face, she was shocked by the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, this matter is simply too shocking, otherwise why would I be so
        cautious."
      </p>
      <p>
        "For this matter, at least, we have to discuss it with Brother Gu. It
        might also be related to the inheritor of demonic art that had appeared
        before."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Ye Langtian sighed and said, with an unusually heavy face,
        rubbing his brow.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But this possibility is too small, in addition, Emperor Ying‚Äôs son has
        not left the Heavenly Emperor Mountain, and the location where that
        happened, is also very far from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, even Ye Liuli couldn't help but shiver, then asked,
        "Brother, do you think it's possible that this matter is related to that
        organization behind the inheritor of demonic art?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian shook his head and said, "No, there is only one person who
        had been the inheritor of the demonic art for generations, and the
        people in the organization behind him would at most have some means to
        assist himself. It is impossible for the sudden appearance of another
        inheritor of demonic art."
      </p>
      <p>His mood was even heavier.</p>
      <p>
        The appearance of one inheritor of demonic art was already terrifying
        enough to set off shocking waves in the Upper Realm, enough to make all
        beings tremble and shudder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now he had discovered the trace of another inheritor of demonic art, and
        it was likely to involve an existence that existed within the ancient
        books, which was terrifyingly big.
      </p>
      <p>
        This matter made Ye Langtian's back shiver and he didn't know what to
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some time ago, he and Ye Luli went to the auction house of an ancient
        city and heard that a certain ancient weapon had appeared and was being
        auctioned there.
      </p>
      <p>
        But they did not expect to be half a step slower, and when they went,
        that ancient weapon had already been auctioned off to someone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two of them did not want to give up that ancient weapon, because the
        origin of that ancient weapon was very deep, so they followed it all the
        way up.
      </p>
      <p>
        But unexpectedly they bumped into something that horrified both of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle of a wild mountain, the mysterious person who auctioned
        off that ancient weapon was seen cultivating the essence of the ancient
        corpse nearby, gulping down the aura of heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seemingly sensing the approach of the two, that mysterious person went
        alert and quickly disappeared, and there was no trace of him left.
      </p>
      <p>
        This incident made Ye Langtian and Ye Liuli chilled to the bone, and
        they froze in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        With such a method, if it was not the rumored forbidden demonic art,
        what was it? F·ªãùíèdd ùíèew updùíÇtùíÜs on n(o)v/e/lùíÉin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        But the good thing was that the mysterious person did not strike at
        them, and quickly fled far away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, they were not sure if they could survive in the hands of the
        inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from Ye Langtian, the only person who knew about this matter was
        Ye Luli, and even the Clan Elders in his clan had not been informed yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the importance of this matter, he could not decide, and now
        the only person he thought of was Gu Changge.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        After all, Gu Changge had dealt with the Inheritor of demonic art for
        quite some time, he should know it well and understand what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Upper Realm is getting more and more chaotic, demons and devils are
        really coming out‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian sighed, "At this time, we still need brother Gu as the
        backbone, presiding over the big picture."
      </p>
      <p>Ye Luli nodded in agreement.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        "Fellow brothers just send it here, I'm going to visit Young Master
        Changge at the Ancient Immortal Gu family next, I heard he's out of the
        seclusion."
      </p>
      <p>
        "That‚Äôs good, there are some things that I need to discuss with him."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, on an immense divine boat, Yan Ji, whose face was blurred
        and hidden by a layer of mist, stood as if she was standing in another
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her voice was calm and bland, like heavenly music, extremely melodious,
        and she was speaking to the group of young geniuses behind her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among that group of young geniuses, there were both men and women, there
        were also many young supremes from various sects, whose body was
        shrouded in light, powerful, and were considered as the current top
        sects of the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing that the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall had come out of the
        world, walking the world, looking for traces of the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor in various places, and investigating the news about the
        inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        So they all came uninvited to protect the heir of the Human Ancestor
        Hall and escorted her, lest she get sneakily attacked and killed by the
        heartless inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        So during this period of time, Yan Ji could often see the young supreme
        of various clans and Dao sects.
      </p>
      <p>
        For her, there was incomparable reverence, even admirers, but they also
        did not dare to make the slightest act of overstepping.
      </p>
      <p>They could only watch from afar and not get close.</p>
      <p>
        As the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall, her strength naturally needed no
        explanation, many young supremes were clear, anyway, no one could see
        through the strength of Yan Ji.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if there was a challenger in the same generation, it would also go
        flying thousands of miles away by a wave of her hand.
      </p>
      <p>This kind of strength also made everyone have great reverence!</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, hearing the words of Yan Ji, many young supreme beings
        had mixed feelings in their hearts and were very envious and jealous.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their eyes, the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall was a fairy who was
        high above, only existed above the nine heavens, with superb identity
        and terrifying strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with their background, and the support of their Ancient Dao sect
        that could control the terrifying power, they could only watch from
        afar, and hold a reverential attitude not daring to get close.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with this in their eyes, usually, if she said a word, would make
        them feel flattered by the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall, but to a
        young man so revered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even to the point that when they heard that he had just come out of
        seclusion, they planned to visit him at home.
      </p>
      <p>This made them so envious and jealous that their eyes turned red.</p>
      <p>
        What virtue and ability could an ordinary man have to deserve such
        treatment from such a fairy?
      </p>
      <p>
        But that young man was Gu Changge, now recognized as the strongest
        person of the younger generation, while mentioning him, everyone had to
        pay respect like a god!
      </p>
      <p>It all made sense and was totally deserved!</p>
      <p>
        So this made them very reluctant, but they could not do anything, and
        could only put this emotion deep in their heart.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>On the surface, they still had to squeeze out a smile.</p>
      <p>
        "Since that's the case, then we won't disturb Your Highness the Holy
        Maiden, ahead is the frontier of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If Young Lord Changge is out of seclusion, then the matter about the
        inheritor of the demonic art should be much easier, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, after all, that is Young Master Changge, after he came out this
        time, I wonder what kind of terrifying level has his strength reached,
        I‚Äôm afraid that we will not be able to catch up."
      </p>
      <p>
        A group of young supremes opened their mouths, for Gu Changge there was
        only incomparable awe, and they did not dare to say the slightest
        disrespectful words.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that Dao Brother Changge has now reached this point in your
        hearts, it seems that when I see him, I will have to talk to him."
      </p>
      <p>Hearing these words, Yan Ji faintly smiled and showed a rare smile.</p>
      <p>
        At these words, many people's hearts moved, feeling a sense of
        closeness. It seemed that the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall and the
        young master of Changge were getting quite close, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was also right, in order to crusade against the inheritor of
        demonic art, Gu Changge spent a lot of time and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall, shouldered the heavy
        responsibility of the world, and also had to deal with the inheritor of
        demonic art, and it was normal to walk very close to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when more people heard these words, their eyes lit up, and they
        spoke again, and all kinds of flattering and awe-inspiring words emerged
        one after another.
      </p>
      <p>Hoping to be mentioned by Yan Ji in front of Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        This scene made Yan Ji's eyes flash with a strange color, and the smile
        on the corner of her mouth deepened.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that the majesty of her young master, during this period of
        time, had penetrated into the hearts of many young people in the outside
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the news that the descendant of Human Ancestor Hall was visiting
        Gu Changge again spread around everywhere, because whether it was Gu
        Changge or the descendants of the Human Ancestor Hall, they all
        attracted special attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meeting and discussion between the two of them was of great
        significance to the current younger generation of the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Ancient Immortal Wang Family, in an extremely magnificent and
        quaint hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji was sitting by the window, looking a little bored. She was
        hugging her legs, her chin resting on her knees, and her silky hair were
        softly falling down.
      </p>
      <p>
        "With Jiang Chuchu's temperament, she would take the initiative to visit
        Gu Changge again?"
      </p>
      <p>She was a little surprised when she heard the news.</p>
      <p>So it didn't make sense.</p>
      <p>
        In Jiang Chuchu's eyes, in addition to cultivation, there was only the
        responsibility of shouldering the great responsibility of the world and
        the responsibility of being a descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was why she often said that she would find a man to marry Jiang
        Chuchu off.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two of them had cultivated together for more than ten years, and
        they still knew each other very well.
      </p>
      <p>"It's a little weird."</p>
      <p>Wang Ziji frowned.</p>
      <p>
        Or was it because after Jiang Chuchu visited Gu Changge last time, she
        actually learned a lot of news about the inheritor of the demonic art,
        so she planned to find Gu Changge again to discuss some things again?
      </p>
      <p>As a traveler, Wang Ziji found that her speculation was not enough.</p>
      <p>
        Or that cold-faced icebergs like Jiang Chuchu would really melt one day?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking like this, Wang Ziji moved and left the palace, intending to go
        to Jiang Chuchu to ask about the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since she left the Human Ancestor Hall without authorization, the two of
        them had not seen each other until now.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 245-2: In the future, you and I will have no more ties, I will
        hate you for life (2)
      </h4>
      <p>"Young Master."</p>
      <p>
        "That's pretty much what happened during this period of time. No one has
        ever doubted my identity, because there is the Ancestor Hall‚Äôs token
        given by the young master, but I feel that it has aroused the suspicion
        of many people‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "After all, I am not a true descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall. All
        my actions seem to be too aimless, and I have been busy for a while."
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the hall, Yan Ji gently reported the events of this period of
        time. Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled and listened quietly.</p>
      <p>
        "It's hard work for you. You've been pretending to be someone else."
      </p>
      <p>"It‚Äôs not hard."</p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji's glazed eyes blinked lightly, and then shook her head, "It is my
        honor to be able to help you out."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Although you say that it's not hard, I also know that this kind of
        thing makes one cautious all the time, and it's not that easy."
      </p>
      <p>"I'm also very distressed."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge smiled, "Next time, you don't have to go
        anywhere, just stay with me."
      </p>
      <p>
        With a wave of his sleeve, many cultivation resources emerged, hundreds
        of thousands of years of divine medicine, a large number of divine
        pills, immortal spirits, etc., were all given to Yan Ji.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had been doing things for Gu Changge. Although she was in the Great
        Sacred Realm, it was difficult for her to improve again in a short
        period of time, but it also took time to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Gu Changge had nothing to instruct her, so he gave her
        a vacation, to cultivate with peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no reason to keep people doing things and not give benefits,
        even Yan Ji, who was so committed to him, couldn't be so stingy.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, young master."</p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji naturally understood what Gu Changge meant, and was a little
        moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge treated her very naturally and had always been polite and
        courteous, unlike his attitude towards his servants and subordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, no matter what time it was, he maintained an
        atmospheric and careful demeanor.
      </p>
      <p>This was also the reason why she was willing to follow Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Sometimes Yan Ji wondered, if she hadn't chosen to follow Gu Changge,
        where would she be at this time?
      </p>
      <p>Afterward, Yan Ji returned the Ancestor Hall‚Äôs token and left.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge entered the Inner Universe.</p>
      <p>"I‚Äôm giving this back to you."</p>
      <p>
        He shook the quaint and mysterious Human Ancestor Hall‚Äôs token in his
        hand, looked at Jiang Chuchu with a vigilant face, and couldn't help but
        smile lightly, "Am I some kind of beast? To make you look at me like
        that?"
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu noticed the Human Ancestor Hall‚Äôs token in his hand.</p>
      <p>
        At the beginning, Gu Changge took it away from her with despicable and
        shameless means.
      </p>
      <p>Now he wanted to give it back to her?</p>
      <p>What was the meaning of ??this fight, didn't she know it already?</p>
      <p>"I don't want this, Gu Changge, keep it for yourself."</p>

      <p>Jiang Chuchu stared at him coldly, not wanting this token at all.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge looked a little surprised, and said to himself,
        "As a descendant of Human Ancestor Hall, you don't even want Human
        Ancestor‚Äôs token now."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Chuchu, you are a big sin of deceiving your Master and destroying your
        Ancestors. If you let the Ancestors in the Human Ancestor Hall know,
        they will definitely be angry with you."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Listen to me, put this thing away, after all, it was yours before."
      </p>
      <p>"Shut up, Gu Changge. The rhetoric is just a set."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing his shameless words, Jiang Chuchu couldn't help but get anxious,
        and it was difficult to keep calm like just now, "Don't call me Chuchu,
        we are not that close."
      </p>
      <p>"Then what should I call you?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's smile continued, "Besides, aren't we close?"</p>
      <p>Saying that, he shook Human Ancestor‚Äôs token in front of her eyes.</p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu stared at him coldly, unmoved.</p>
      <p>
        "I thought you had figured it out during this time and planned to let
        you out, but your attitude now makes it difficult for me."
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing her appearance, Gu Changge sighed and said with a bit of a
        headache, "I don't want to kill you, but you are disobedient."
      </p>
      <p>"You don't even understand my good intentions‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"Where did you get your good intentions?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's attitude was a little slow when she heard these words,
        but her tone was still cold, mainly because she was angry with Gu
        Changge's shameless words just now.
      </p>
      <p>"Since you don't believe my kindness, then forget it."</p>
      <p>"Did you figure it out? My patience is running out."</p>
      <p>"From today on, you are free."</p>
      <p>
        "You are still the descendant of your Human Ancestor Hall, upholding
        justice, clearing the world, and bringing peace to all sentient beings,
        continuing to search for the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, and by
        the way, track down the traces of the inheritor of demonic arts."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And I won't care about you anymore, whether it's life or death, it's
        all up to you, and there are no longer any ties between us."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It doesn't matter whether you are a stranger or an enemy in the future.
        If you want to expose my true identity, that's fine, as long as you can
        figure out what to do‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled calmly and didn't care about Jiang Chuchu's
        increasingly pale face.
      </p>
      <p>"There are no ties between us anymore?"</p>
      <p>
        After listening to these words, especially this sentence, Jiang Chuchu's
        face turned pale, and her fingers couldn't help grasping her dress.
      </p>
      <p>There were no more ties between her and Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>
        This means that in the future, Gu Changge would let her go, leave her
        alone, and let her continue to be the successor of the Human Ancestor
        Hall, so that she could restore the Human Ancestor Hall and do what she
        should do.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Gu Changge would no longer care about her, naturally including her
        life and death.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, whether she wanted to live or begged to die, Gu Changge wouldn't
        care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, this was what she had always wanted before, but why couldn't
        she be happy?
      </p>
      <p>What did Gu Changge's unconcerned attitude mean?</p>
      <p>
        In turn, Jiang Chuchu's expression became even colder, "Gu Changge, do
        you really think that after you let me go, everything that happened
        between you and me can be erased? I am telling you, this is not
        possible, right?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Nothing is impossible. What do you still think of me? I won't kill you,
        but I'm letting you go. It's already the greatest kindness."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge was not surprised, and his expression was still
        indifferent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu looked at him coldly, snatched the Human Ancestor Hall‚Äôs
        token from his hand, and said, "I will hate you for the rest of my
        life."
      </p>
      <p>"There are many people who hate me, but it's not worse than you."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled lightly as if he didn't care.</p>
      <p>He knew that Jiang Chuchu had actually made a choice.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, no matter what his attitude was towards herself, it had
        been decided that she had embarked on the road of betraying the Human
        Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, you are a despicable villain, an irresponsible bastard!"
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu gritted her teeth and her face was very white.</p>
      <p>
        "If you had made your choice earlier, it might not have been what it is
        today. After all, a person's patience‚Ä¶ is very limited."
      </p>
      <p>"Holy Maiden Chuchu."</p>
      <p>
        The smile on Gu Changge's face had disappeared, and after saying this,
        he didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the space in front of him, a silver door appeared, and he took the
        lead to walk out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was stunned when she heard this, and she was a little lost.
        Why couldn't she be happy even after she got free?
      </p>
      <p>
        Was Gu Changge talking about the events of that day? It was really
        impossible for a person like him to have good intentions all the time.
      </p>
      <p>Human Ancestor had disappeared.</p>
      <p>
        The Human Ancestor Hall could not fall, so a new Human Ancestor was
        needed, but this completely contradicted her long-standing concept.
      </p>
      <p>It was she who made it difficult for Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>That was why he said that he ran out of patience.</p>
      <p>
        Later, Jiang Chuchu didn't know how she got into the Ancient Immortal Gu
        Family and came outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        She looked back, didn't notice Gu Changge's figure, and she really let
        herself go, it really seemed like a troublesome burden to him.
      </p>
      <p>Why not do it?</p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Jiang Chuchu's face showed a little grievance.</p>
      <p>
        After a while, all these emotions quietly dissipated, and her face
        became like immortal ice, revealing a creepy cold.
      </p>
      <p>"Holy Maiden?"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, the old woman who had been following the descendant of
        Human Ancestor Hall was a little shocked and puzzled. She didn't know
        that the previous descendant of Human Ancestor Hall was a fake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing Jiang Chuchu‚Äôs appearance, she thought that she was being bullied
        just now.
      </p>
      <p>"Let‚Äôs go back to the Human Ancestor Hall."</p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu said calmly, without explaining anything before.</p>
      <p>
        As Gu Changge said, with her current ability, she could not shake his
        status at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way was to find the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, right?
      </p>
      <p>But the Human Ancestor had already been killed by Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>What else could she do?</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge did everything he could, and couldn't possibly do stupid
        things.

          Ju.</span

          Changge?&#8221; Finished with their chat, Empress Yao Xi curiously
          asked. Although she had always kept in contact with Gu Changge through
          letters, the latter never mentioned his purpose of visiting Demon
          World, which certainly piqued her curiosity.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In response, Gu Changge put down the glass of wine in his hand and
          chuckled. &#8220;Empress Yao Xi, do you know about me obliterating
          Bandit Thirteen in Chaos Star Territory some time ago?&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Aware of the matter, Empress Yao Xi nodded. Essentially, the
          individual behind Bandit Thirteen was a remnant of the Five Demon
          Overlords who fled from Demon World 6000 years ago, Demon Master Bai
          Kun.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Knowing that, Empress Yao Xi was shocked as she never expected that
          Bai Kun had been hiding in Chaos Star Territory all these years, which
          explained she was never able to find traces of him despite having sent
          so many men. Nevertheless, now that Gu Changge successfully captured
          Bai Kun, she no longer bothered herself with such a matter.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, did you perhaps come to Demon World for
          this matter?&#8221; Empress Yao Xi asked with a contemplating
          look.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge then nodded and smiled. &#8220;Indeed, Bai Kun plays a big
          part in my visit here, but so do you, Empress Yao Xi.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;m involved?&#8221; Empress Yao Xi furrowed her
          brows.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, given how Gu Changge did not proceed on the matter, her eyes
          twitched as she understood the probable graveness of the matter, and
          it was indeed inappropriate to talk about the matter under such
          circumstances, so she did not pursue it any further.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, Qing Zhu, who was standing humbly behind Empress Yao Xi,
          was rather disappointed by that as she was hoping to obtain crucial
          pieces of information, only for Gu Changge to leave such a teasing
          remark behind without finishing his story.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >While Gu Changge and Empress Yao Xi was conversing, in the
          guest&#8217;s seats below, an impeccably stunning woman in a yellow
          dress was talking to an elderly man in white, whose aura was as deep
          as the abyss, beside her. She would take spying glances upwards from
          time to time. Her eyebrows were as exquisite as a painting, as though
          they were cast from an ancient canvas, carrying a benign, poetic
          aura.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Youwei, what do you think of the rumoured Young Master
          Changge?&#8221; the elderly man in white inquired with a subtle
          smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The woman in yellow dress was none other than the sole Heiress of the
          Grand Tutor of the Demon World, Song Youwei, who was the greatest
          young prodigy in the Demon World.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, she raised her head and took a look before
          subconsciously revealing a smile as she replied, &#8220;Father,
          appearance-wise, Young Master Changge is indeed flawless and
          unparalleled. He certainly is the amazing man others claim him to be.
          Be it his attitude or manner of speech, there&#8217;s not the
          slightest flaw.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Of course, as for his cultivation level, I dare not speak
          carelessly of it as rumours have it that he has already reached the
          Sacred King Realm, which is truly astonishing. With him present, I
          frankly do not deserve to be called a &#8216;prodigy,&#8217; given how
          he and I are probably of about the same ages.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Spoken with a normal expression, Song Youwei&#8217;s words were brief
          and straight, bearing no motive of ingratiation or obsequiousness as
          she was simply describing her first impression of Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Indeed, Gu Changge was a man of brilliance, even to the state of
          perfection as no other young prodigy was comparable. Still, Song
          Youwei had no other thoughts towards him apart from her dismay and
          astoundment. After all, she was someone who would be completely
          smitten by the appearance of another. Likewise, she was not the kind
          of person who wishes to curry favour just because the other party was
          powerful.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Judging by his influence all over the endless Upper Realm,
          there is indeed no young man more splendid than him. Even using his
          fill might, a Sect Master was nothing to that youth. It intrigues me
          how such a monster exists in this world.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After listening to his daughter, he nodded in agreement as he
          expressed his wonderment. &#8220;Youwei, why don&#8217;t you pay
          respect to Young Master Changge with me later? See it as leaving
          behind an impression. Who knows, it could be beneficial to you to be
          able to interact with a person like him.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;As you wish, Father.&#8221; Song Youwei nodded as she was
          still curiously observing Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, Gu Changge seemed to have noticed her gaze and turned
          to her with a smile and a slight nod, which took her aback, but
          instead of bashfully shifting her gaze away like ordinary women, she
          responded with a generous smile during their exchange.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that, Empress Yao Xi tensed her brows and questioned,
          &#8220;Young Master Changge, do you know Youwei?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge then shook his head and answered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
          know her, but she seems different, compared to the other
          women.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;She&#8217;s the sole Heiress of the Grand Tutor, Song Youwei.
          She&#8217;s also the most outstanding young prodigy in the Demon
          World,&#8221; Empress Yao Xi explained in response as she
          nodded.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Song Youwei. The name sure sounds melodious.&#8221; Gu Changge
          smiled as he withdrew his gaze.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, the welcoming banquet ended in joy for the hosts and
          guests, after which the influential figures of Demon World gradually
          departed. They fathomed that Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival to Demon World
          must lead to enormous commotions, causing unimaginable
          aftermath.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Earlier, in the imperial palace, by hearing bits of the conversation
          between Gu Changge and Empress Yao Xi, they grew to understand that Gu
          Changge didn&#8217;t come to Demon World without a purpose. Thus, what
          was to happen soon in Demon World would be immeasurable. Therefore,
          they would have to return to prepare for it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Still, many of Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s trusted officers stayed, along
          with their families, intending to pay their respect to Gu Changge and
          get familiar with him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge. I am the Grand Tutor of Demon
          World, and this is my daughter, Song Youwei.&#8221; The Grand Tutor
          stood up with Song Youwei and talked to Empress Yao Xi and Gu Changge,
          who were above them. He held his hand with a gesture of respect. As he
          was speaking, he started introducing Song Youwei, who was beside
          him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Slightly nodding, Gu Changge turned to the Grand Tutor. &#8220;Please
          be at ease, Grand Tutor. Empress Yao Xi has introduced her to me
          earlier.&#8221; With that, he turned to Song Youwei with an amicable
          smile. &#8220;Youwei, what a nice name.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Revealing a smile, Song Youwei took a graceful bow, seemingly noble
          and generous. &#8220;Thank you for the praise, Young Master
          Changge.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Accordingly, the Quelling Chaos King and the rest, too, brought their
          families along to pay their respect, and they seemed more reverent
          than the Grand Tutor.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, judging by seniority, the Grand Tutor was Empress Yao
          Xi&#8217;s mentor, while the Quelling Chaos King and the rest were the
          Empress&#8217;s subordinates.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Quelling Chaos King was a tall, muscular man who had a warm and
          welcoming heart despite his intimidating appearance. There was a scar
          between his eyebrows filled with an aggressive, daunting aura,
          reflecting his cultivation level of the Sacred King Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Gu Changge node, retaining his natural, passionate face
          without feigning impatience, which made the Quelling Chaos King and
          the rest feel somewhat blessed. But of course, as the crowd was paying
          their respect,
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge was also observing those individuals, only to find the
          Fortuity on them was ordinary, unlike Song Youwei.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although the Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s Fortuity was slightly
          higher, it was not enough for him to be considered as a fortuitous
          person. Thereupon, Gu Changge put more of his interest in Song Youwei.
          After all, individuals with abundant Fortuity tended to be close to or
          draw Fortuitous Ones out. The Heir of the Demon Overlord might
          possibly be related to Song Youwei, but to prevent startling his
          potential prey, he decided to give it some more time as he looked into
          Song Youwei.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, the crowd excused themselves, leaving only Gu Changge,
          Empress Yao Xi, and a few of her people in the palace.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, what was it that you were talking about
          earlier?&#8221; Empress Yao Xi intuitively asked. Since all eyes were
          on them previously, she refrained from asking about the matter, but
          now, it was only her trustworthy servants that remained in the
          palace.</span

          had no intentions of keeping her in suspense. &#8220;Empress Yao Xi,
          do you perhaps still remember Jun Bufan?&#8221;</span

          require someone to keep an eye on.</span

          However, before Gu Changge could reject the offer, Jiang Luoshen, who
          kept silent the entire time with an icy face, suddenly spoke. She
          glanced at Gu Changge with her golden eyes, in which runes were
          swirling, as though she could tell what he was thinking.</span

          simply saw this as her expressing her jealousy. In Yao Xi’s opinion,
          Jiang Luoshen following Gu Changge to the Lower Realm suggested that
          their relationship was more than meets the eye. Of course, she only
          brought the matter up on a whim, knowing that given Gu Changge&#8217;s
          identity, no women would ever turn him down.</span

          blandly shot Qing Zhu a glare. Although the change on Qing Zhu&#8217;s

          Zhu&#8217;s identity, she should be thrilled to accompany Gu Changge
          to sleep, yet she was reluctant and hesitant.</span

          colder as he clenched his fists. &#8220;It&#8217;s been 6000 years.
          Yao Xi&#8217;s cultivation level must be at most in the Sacred Emperor
          Realm. Without opportunities available to her, it would be hard for
          her to reach the Quasi-Nirvana Realm. But even so, the Solar Heavenly
          Blade is a Nirvana Grade Artifact designed by my father and personally
          forged by Uncle Ye. Yao Xi will not be able to run from me this
          time.&#8221;</span

          >Jun Fan waved his hand to dismiss the individuals behind him, leaving
          total silence in the Cave Mansion. He then turned to the outside of
          the Cave Mansion as his eyes glistened, as if he was pondering.
          Recently, he had been trying to reach Song Youwei to ask some
          questions, but ever since she returned to Grand Tutor’s Manor, she had
          yet to come back to the Black and White Academy, which somewhat let
          him down.</span

          >&#8220;Jun Fan.&#8221; Very soon, a woman in purple slowly entered
          the Cave Mansion with a cold expression and a pair of troubled eyes.
          It was one of Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s personal officers, Qing
          Zhu.</span

          >&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; Seeing her expression, Jun Fan was
          confused, after which he wordlessly fetched her the tea on the table.
          &#8220;What happened? Relax. Take a sip, why don&#8217;t
          you?&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Taking a glance at him, Qing Zhu heaved a sigh as she accepted the
          tea and took a sip before recounting what happened back in the
          imperial palace to him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After listening to her, Jun Fan was obviously livid. &#8220;How dare
          Yao Xi make you sleep with Gu Changge in an attempt to gratify
          him!&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Also furious, Qing Zhu nodded. &#8220;Not only that, the Empress is
          also scouring every corner for you.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Emotions zoomed across Jun Fan&#8217;s face and he eventually let out
          a deep sigh. &#8220;Frankly, I called you over because I need your
          help. Once we are finished with this, we won&#8217;t have to worry
          about Yao Xi anymore, and we will no longer have to meet so
          discreetly.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Qing Zhu roughly guessed the answer as her
          face paled.</span

          >&#8220;I bought this poison with a huge sum of money. It&#8217;s
          effective even to cultivators in the Sacred Emperor Realm.&#8221; Jun
          Fan pulled out a white clay flask from his garment and continued with
          a solemn expression, &#8220;But don&#8217;t you worry. This alone
          works as supplementary pill powder. No one will see it as poison, so
          you don&#8217;t have to be worried about getting
          suspected.&#8221;</span

          >At that moment, Qing Zhu&#8217;s heart violently palpitated as her
          face grew even whiter, and even her fingers were trembling. [Poison
          the Empress? Jun Fan actually wants me to poison Empress Yao Xi to
          death?]</span

          daily meal as well as her cultivation pill. Regardless, this mission
          is safe. No one will discover the truth nor will they suspect you. I
          assure you of this.&#8221; Jun Fan intensely looked her in the eyes as
          he persuaded.</span

          the periphery of the hall. It was as if the blue sky was about to fall
          and completely smash this place. A series of vague and terrifying
          figures walked out of Sky Deer Sanctum. Their faces were as
          indifferent as sculptures that had remained unchanged since ancient
          times. As they stared at the hall without an ounce of emotion, the
          energy in their bodies was like an enclosed abyss. It felt like they
          would wipe out whoever disagreed with them.</span

          the crowd in Sky Deer Sanctum immediately fell. Many Domain Rulers and
          Wasteland Leaders promptly took out their artifacts. Huge waves
          emerged, and there was a bright and dazzling brilliance
          manifesting.</span

          things to defend themselves. All their faces were dignified and
          vigilant. Instead of sitting back and allowing Gu Changge to do as he
          pleased, they would rather fight back with all their might if Gu
          Changge insisted on making everyone stay.</span

          truce!?&#8221; Many Domain Rulers looked upset. Some were even furious
          from the mockery. The Domain Rulers of the Great Cloud Domain, the
          Crimson Shack Domain and many others were extremely grim.

          >After all, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t show one bit of sincerity. This
          truce was obviously his bait to lure all of them here for him to take
          them down in one go. [The talk about a truce is all a farce.]</span

          you&#8217;re not hoping I would recall my troop? That beautiful
          fantasy of yours will never happen in the real world. I’m sure all of
          you are aware of that already.&#8221;

          >To him, that kind of hope was merely a pipe dream. The Upper Realm
          had spent so much effort to break through Sky Deer City and wiped out
          everyone in sight all the way to the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.
          Despite that, they were still hoping that the Upper Realm would
          withdraw their army without them having to pay a price because he
          asked for a truce? [Ridiculous! They sure think too kindly of me and
          the Upper Realm Forces.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;re right. The Upper Realm has done so much to break
          into the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. They wouldn&#8217;t just
          withdraw their army for nothing.&#8221; The Supreme Mountain Elder
          seemed to ponder for a while before he sighed and nodded in agreement.
        </span>

          and reduce many unnecessary casualties if the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains were to submit to the Upper Realm.&#8221; He sounded like he
          was explaining to himself as much as he was talking to the leaders of
          the many Forces from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In fact, even though the majority of people were angry and unwilling
          to submit., there were still some of them who had been willing to
          surrender from the very beginning. However, they chose to remain
          silent because none of the Domain Lords and the remaining Leaders of
          the Three Powerful War God Clans spoke up. Hearing the words of the
          Supreme Mountain Elder now made them waver a little. At that moment,
          they thought they wouldn&#8217;t mind a truce if it meant submission.
          After all, the entire Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains only had two
          ways out: they either surrender or face destruction. Only a handful of
          people in this world would choose death over submission. The reason
          the many leaders let their anger show just now was to gauge if there
          was room for compromise.</span

          >&#8220;What do you mean, Supreme Mountain Elder…&#8221; The Great
          Cloud Domain Ruler looked slightly alarmed. He didn&#8217;t think the
          Supreme Mountain Elder would react in such a manner. He even seemed to
          be debating the possibility of accepting Gu Changge’s condition.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          this point.&#8221;</span

          sized the Supreme Mountain Elder up with an interested gaze.
          &#8220;You&#8217;re smart.&#8221; he hummed. He had a feeling that
          there was a hidden meaning behind the Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s
          words, which was somewhat different from what he expected. [But
          that&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s in line with my plan.]</span

          calmly spoke again. &#8220;We will consider the truce, Young Master
          Gu. But we hope you give us time to make a decision.&#8221;</span

          to do by dragging it out. Could he be trying to save the Second
          Mountain Elder? Or is it Luo Feng that he&#8217;s trying to save?
          Either way, I won&#8217;t let him live for long.]</span

          thundering away, and they opened their mouths to speak, only to end up
          closing them again. They didn&#8217;t expect the Supreme Mountain
          Elder to say something like this. However, they didn&#8217;t have
          another choice. These three days would allow them to think about
          whether to submit or not.</span

          before answering in a casual tone, &#8220;Sure, but you are not
          allowed to leave Sky Deer City during the three days. If I find anyone
          who tried to leave, don&#8217;t blame me for being

          The Supreme Mountain Elder unhesitantly nodded. He was now the
          backbone of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. With him as the
          overall leader, everyone naturally would listen to his opinions. With
          that, many of the others only looked at each other helplessly.</span

          atmosphere earlier was a mere illusion. Everyone sat down again.
          Everyone was feeling different emotions, but all of them could barely
          swallow the delicious food served. During the banquet, the dancers
          were graceful and charming like goddesses from the Nine Heavens, who
          had descended to the mortal world. They were too beautiful a sight to
          behold.</span

          >Gu Changge, who was in the main seat, didn&#8217;t seem bothered by
          the little episode as he kept a smile on his face. The way he would
          occasionally talk to Sky Deer Goddess beside him made him look
          carefree and easygoing.</span

          bitterly downing his drink. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t do anything rash
          anymore, Junior Xiao Yang. You have to know that your every action
          today will affect the life and death of the trillions of people in the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. You will be the in the whole of the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains if you got on Gu Changge&#8217;s bad

          mess things up for them. However, they couldn&#8217;t blame him with
          the Supreme Mountain Elder around.</span

          together. He was slightly upset with Gu Wudi. They might have had
          their fair share of hardships together during this period, and his
          attitude towards Gu Wudi had taken a turn for the better because of
          that, but it was not to the extent that he would put up with Gu Wudi
          telling him what to do.</span

          heard that. Even so, he only sighed and shook his head as though he
          was doing this for Xiao Yang&#8217;s own good. He sneaked a glance at
          Gu Changge who was sitting on the main seat then. His eyes only
          further dimmed when he saw that Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t spared a
          glance in his direction. He had been putting up with Xiao Yang for
          some time now. If it wasn&#8217;t because he had to follow Gu
          Changge&#8217;s order, he would have dealt with Xiao Yang a long ago.
          He didn&#8217;t dare act rashly before Gu Changge ordered him to do
          anything. However, Gu Wudi knew that Xiao Yang&#8217;s days here were
          numbered.

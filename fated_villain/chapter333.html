          instant. He wanted to resist but the strength contained in the palm
          was too much for him to withstand. Even if he was wearing a Sacred

          already begun appearing on his armor. Eventually, shattering into
          glittering fragments. As for his flesh underneath, it was as though an
          egg had hit a rock. He was incomparably weak afterwards, with bones
          cracking as they broke into pieces. His five internal organs were all
          ruptured. There were wounds all over his body and he was even covered
          in blood, making him look hardly human.</span

          roar, full of fury. At the same time, he felt his heart being crushed
          by pain, as his face twisted into a knot. He was so livid that his
          face has transformed into something no different from a beast.</span

          wasn’t the other’s opponent. He feared he was unable to last until
          reinforcements from Purple Mansion arrived, and Gu Changge would take
          this chance to destroy both his body and soul.</span

          cold and profound, but even more so, full of colds murderous
          intent.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing Zhi Yang, Gu Changge didn’t respond. He merely looked towards
          the side. Towards Gu Xianer, who was staring at him in a stupor as he
          let out a gentle sigh, “Why are you so impulsive? Why didn’t you tell
          me you’ve found out where he is?”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although he was holding her accountable for her mistake, there was
          concern and worry in his voice. Though, in actuality, before Gu Xianer
          had even reached this place, Gu Changge was already here. He just did
          not reveal himself as he was waiting for Qin Wuya to appear. He wanted
          to see what the two were plotting.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, he had witnessed the entire process where Qin Wuya was
          attempting to win over Gu Xianer. They even showed all the cards they
          had for Gu Xianer, information on their previous lives, and how Sky
          King Zhi Yang had exposed his identity as the true Successor of
          Demonic Arts.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Following after, Gu Xianer’s action surprised him a little. More than
          anything, he was a little stunned and couldn’t help sighing. It was
          especially so when, after seeing the scene of her miserable future, Gu
          Xianer was still able to say she was willing, even if it were to be
          true.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This actually made Gu Changge fall silent for a moment. In fact, he
          didn’t know what to say. [should I call her foolish or naive…?]</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, he also had his own guesses. [What Zhi Yang saw was most
          likely what happened in Yue Mingkong’s previous timeline. After all, I
          am only willing to go so far as to bully her. A bit of course. How
          could I possibly bear to hurt her like that?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After hearing Gu Changge’s words, Gu Xianer didn’t answer, rather,
          she stared at him and her usual cold eyes lost a bit of their light.
          She didn’t even wipe the blood off the corner of her mouth.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Gu Changge, how did you find this place?” At this time, it was Qin
          Wuya’s voice that sounded out, full or trepidation, His figure
          flashed, reappearing beside Zhi Yang while guarding against Gu
          Changge’s next move.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[I’m certain Gu Xianer hadn’t sent any messages to him. So, how did
          he find this place? And how long has he been hiding?] This thought
          sent shivers down Qin Wuya’s back. This meant that Gu Changge was
          listening to everything they said before, including the part about
          their origins and their relationship.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When they told Gu Xianer today, they already had a back up plan. If
          she didn’t agree with them, they would forcefully subdue her and force
          her to drink the water from the Lake of Reincarnation. Thus, they
          weren’t worried at all. But now…</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >“It’s all thanks to you. If you hadn’t led the way for me, I wouldn’t
          have been able to find this place. I have to really thank you.” Gu
          Changge smiled perfunctorily. He landed on the ground and walked
          towards him leisurely. He knew what Qin Wuya was worried about, but Gu
          Changge didn’t pay attention to it at all.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You left something to track me? Impossible, I checked thoroughly
          before, and didn’t find anything.” Qin Wuya’s voice was heavy, in
          complete disbelief.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          chuckled.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Qin Wuya’s expression sank even more, he was certain now that Gu
          Changge must’ve done something. [So, it turns out that he had let me
          go on purpose! He had used some kind of method unbeknownst to me, to
          place some kind of tracker on me. And, I had been none the wiser, and
          had led him here! There is no other explanation but this!]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, when Sky King Zhi Yang, who was recovering from his
          injuries, heard this, his complexion became pale as well. He never
          would’ve thought it would be his Eldest Senior Brother who had exposed
          their whereabouts.</span

          >“Junior Brother, it’s my fault, I never thought I would end up
          leading Gu Changge here.” Qin Wua gave Sky King Zhi Yan an apologetic
          look. If he had been a bit more cautious, Zhi Yang wouldn’t have been
          heavily injured by Gu Changge. He didn’t even know if they would be
          able to safely escape today.</span

          >“Eldest Senior Brother, it’s not your fault. Gu Changge is the one
          that was too cunning. No one could have predicted this.” Sky King Zhi
          Yang took a deep breath and calmed down. He had no intention to blame
          this on Qin Wuya.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!* At the next moment, purple mist burst forth from every inch
          of his battered body. Naturally, it was not easy for Sky King Zhi Yang
          to use this secret technique. After all, it needed him to consume his
          own Source. Even so, he had no choice. He needed to recover to peak
          condition in the shortest amount of time, to have a chance against Gu
          Changge.</span

          expression became solemn. It was because this secret technique did not
          belong to this era. Rather, it was a secret technique of the
          Borderless Sect.</span

          get rid of this incarnation of the devil! Not merely for Junior
          Sister’s sake, but also for the sake of the world, the Successor of
          Demonic Arts must be exterminated! He is completely without conscience
          and has committed all sorts of evil. Sooner or later, he’ll get what’s
          coming. It’s just his time to face retribution.” Sky King Zhi Yang was
          filled with a sense of righteousness. He also wore an extremely
          determined expression. His words were even more awe-inspiring and were
          full of inexplicable power.</span

          there was a Righteous Path in this world, that would never allow such
          an evil being to continue committing evil, and become a disaster to
          the Nine Heavens.

          had already arrived by Gi Xianer’s side. He clearly didn’t take Sky
          King Zhi Yang’s words to heart at all.

          whether Sky King Zhi Yang And Qin Wuya’s words were true, and if he
          really was the Successor of Demonic Arts. However, she didn’t know how

          do anything.” Sky King Zhi Yang snorted coldly. He was not as angry as
          before and had already calmed down. After all, Gu Xianer was already
          running on Gu Changg’e palm, she couldn’t tell left from right

          swift and fierce, he launched forth a powerful attack.

          overshadowed the sky and ran inexhaustibly. His runes rapidly morphed,
          transforming into myriads of godly weapons. Swords, spears, halberds,

          many cards up his sleeve, it did not ease his trepidation. Back when
          he wandered into the Nine Realm, he obtained many divine artifacts and
          learned many things. However, once he used those methods, there would
          likely be unimaginable consequences.</span

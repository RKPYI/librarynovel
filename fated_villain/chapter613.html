        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Something like this cannot be rushed. Since Gu Changge still needs something from you, he definitely will not push you into a dead end. Not unless he doesn&#8217;t want it anymore. Qing Yu should still be safe and sound right now,&#8221; Tuo Ba Fei Yun slowly uttered and comforted Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, telling him not to worry too much.</span><span id="more-33858"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am well aware of that.&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao took a deep breath and rubbed his temples. &#8220;But what if Gu Changge decides he doesn&#8217;t care anymore? He is a man who would do anything and everything.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao wouldn&#8217;t have resorted to this if it wasn&#8217;t because he was short on time. Now that Emperor Yu had ordered that no one was allowed to set foot in that world without his order, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao couldn&#8217;t easily ask his elder brother to allow him passage even if he was standing guard here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Great Yu Army will be here soon. There shouldn&#8217;t be a problem if you join them and follow along,&#8221; Tuo Ba Fei Yun suggested. He didn&#8217;t actually know why Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was so sure that the way to save Tuo Ba Qing Yu was in that world. But since it was such an important matter, all he could do was trust Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had heard all kinds of things about Tuo Ba Xiao Yao during this period of time, and what he heard had left him both confused and relieved. However, everyone, himself included, had their own secrets, and that was why he wouldn&#8217;t ask Tuo Ba Xiao Yao for his reasons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand. I&#8217;m going to make some preparations, but I&#8217;ll meet you here tomorrow, big brother,&#8221; said Tuo Ba Xiao Yao with a nod before he got up to leave. Even though he was sure that the world behind the Space Rift was his previous world, where he lived and cultivated, he didn&#8217;t know how much time had passed since he transmigrated here. Neither did he have any idea of what had happened to that world. It was still unknown whether or not his previous Master and fellow disciples were still there. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, he suddenly felt anxious the closer he got to his original world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more troops were gathering around the borders. There were a great number of carriages and boats, with many figures with strong aura inside, crossing the sky at high speed. Their flags rustled in the wind, looking extremely magnificent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them, the most eye-catching ones were the armour-clad Celestial Guardians from the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. They rode on ferocious beasts. The army seemed to have come from a mountain of corpses before they were finally stationed at the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a mountain ridge that could resist enemies from the outside, in an ancient city so huge one could never see one end from another, experts from all major Forces had rushed to this place. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The younger generation made up most of the crowd. They were elite disciples from various powerful Forces, each fearsome in strength. Their auras were overflowing, causing lingering divine lights to be often seen passing by on the streets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a pavilion next to the main street, the young lady, Ah Qing, couldn&#8217;t help asking under her breath as she watched the busy scene below through the window, &#8220;Is everyone going to invade my world?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge shook his head and softly chuckled. &#8220;&#8216;Invade&#8217; might not be the best word to describe this. They are only going to toughen themselves up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Toughen themselves up?] Ah Qing felt like laughing at herself when she thought about it. For her world, this was a catastrophe level disaster. But in the eyes of the cultivators from the Upper Realm, this was merely a space to practise. In fact, their victims&#8217; life and death were insignificant to them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have gotten accustomed to this, haven&#8217;t you, my saviour?&#8221; Ah Qing asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge let out a mystifying smile and hummed, &#8220;Which is why I told you to give what I’m offering some serious thought.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing fell silent as the crazy solution—one which would bury all the Forces within—that Gu Changge mentioned the other day popped up in her head. However, it wasn&#8217;t something she could achieve with her own ability. She needed to unite all the Forces in her world to have a chance to fight against the Upper Realm. As for how she could unite them, she only had herself to rely on as Gu Changge was only giving her a choice. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, why did he tell me all that? He is from the Upper Realm. Yet, he is helping an foreigner like myself… Is he sick of standing by idly and doing nothing?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked to another person, Jiang Chuchu, who suddenly started talking, &#8220;A just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust cause fails to gather people. The course of nature goes around, and this is the fate which everything in the world cannot escape.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&#8217;t know Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s identity, but she knew that everyone respected her. Not only that, Jiang Chuchu and Gu Changge were practically inseparable, like an ideal couple. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What goes around, comes around?&#8221; Ah Qing nodded as her gaze fell on Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s face. Both young women looked at each other. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu had a flawless face. Her misty eyes were as gentle as spring, adorned with long lashes. She had the untainted aura of a fairy. Both her beauty and temperament were otherworldly.  Even Ah Qing, as a fellow woman, couldn&#8217;t help feeling envious. [To think such a flawless face really exists… it can make anyone forget about the troubles of the world…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu calmly added, &#8220;If you want to save your world, what Changge said is the only way.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge only briefly mentioned a few things about Ah Qing&#8217;s background to her. Still, Jiang Chuchu was able to guess Gu Changge&#8217;s intention. It was highly likely that a World Source was in the ancient world. In fact, the World Source was most likely the reason the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty tried its best to conceal traces of this new world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who cultivated the Forbidden Demonic Arts, Gu Changge could devour and refine all Sources under the sky. Furthermore, normal Sources didn&#8217;t work for someone of his level. Only articles at the level of World Sources could help him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing was someone from that world, and her father was one of the strongest people in that world. Although she was young, she had a long-standing reputation. In this situation where the world was on the verge of being destroyed by outside enemies, Ah Qing could naturally win the hearts of the people if she stood up for them. And if that were to happen, it would make it more convenient for Gu Changge to find the whereabouts of the World Source through her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand what Master Gu said, but how can I fight and win against them when there is such a huge gap between us?&#8221; Ah Qing&#8217;s eyes looked a little downcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have to understand something. You and your people will not have a chance at all if you don&#8217;t resist. Only by fighting back will you have a chance to live. After all, there is always a way out. There is always hope.&#8221; Gu Changge let out a nonchalant smile before he turned to Jiang Chuchu. &#8220;I might have to go to that world as well this time. You don&#8217;t have to follow me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jiang Chuchu let out a small hum. &#8220;I will head back to Mortal Palace in a few days then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good girl,&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they were talking, the sound of fighting suddenly broke out, from a street not far away. Runes shot up to the sky, illuminating every corner with a splendid glow. The fluctuations were so violent that a large area was cleared in an instant. Seeing this, many people quickly avoided the place and looked over in surprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I heard that you have been keeping a low profile all these years, but your real strength is comparable to the Second Prince of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. I would like to give you a try today.&#8221; A young figure stood at the end of the street. He had a burly physique and untameable black hair. His eyes were like Heavenly Swords, which swept across the void. The people around even shuddered in fear the moment they heard a terrifying rumbling sound. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing in front of him was a slightly thinner figure with a grim and gloomy face—it was Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two had suddenly started fighting on the street without any warning. If it wasn&#8217;t for the powerful arrays engraved here, many pavilions and buildings would have been destroyed the instant the fight broke out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone around watched this scene in shock as more people heard the noise and rushed over. Divine rainbows rained in. Among them were Successors of Sects as well as Elders. Even a few living fossil-like figures were rubbing their chins and looking on thoughtfully. Yu Feiya, Yu Ming and the others had also hurried over upon hearing the news, and they were now frowning after witnessing what was happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crowd had begun to chatter amongst themselves when they recognised the figure with the brawny frame.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is the Mad Demon God, the Young Master of Demon God Palace. Rumour has it that he once fought with Yu Lie, the Second Prince of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty for three days and three nights, and it ended with a tie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed that it was him…To think he actually rushed over here as well. It is said that he went to the Demon God Palace’s Demon God Cave some time ago and went all the way to the thirteenth floor for a Supreme Secret Technique, which helped ascend his cultivation another level.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He wanted to have another fight with Prince Yu Lie after he was done cultivating, but Prince Yu Lie hadn&#8217;t left the Imperial Palace in awhile.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Demon God Palace was an ancient Sect. Although its background was not as impressive as that of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, it was considered long-standing and unfathomable. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people also found out about Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s identity. After all, he was involved in the commotion in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty some time ago. Everyone knew that the youngest son of General Tuo Ba was an enigma.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Young Master of the Demon God Palace must have suddenly appeared here to fight. He wanted to test out Yu Lie&#8217;s strength through a fight with Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. However, he had forgotten one thing. Being comparable didn&#8217;t mean that the two had fought against each other before. Since Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and Yu Lie had never fought before, there was no way to know who was stronger or weaker. That was also the reason why Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s face looked extremely gloomy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and the Young Master of the Demon God Palace continued to fiercely exchange blows on the long street. They caused terrifying fluctuations to spread and erupt with incomparable power. With the sky-piercing divine glow and Sword Qi that suppressed and made a mess out of everything, it was hard to believe that this was a battle between two young men. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even many older generations were frowning as they were deeply troubled by how difficult it was to defuse the fight. Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, especially, was fighting against the Young Master of the Demon God Palace with only a longsword made of refined steel, without using an artifact. What he could do with solely his swordsmanship was truly astonishing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How does he know Shu Sect&#8217;s Sword Technique?!&#8221; Ah Qing suddenly exclaimed. This was the first time since she came to this world to show such a surprised expression. Naturally, she was paying close attention to this battle as she wanted to understand the gap between the young prodigies in this world and her world. However, she didn&#8217;t expect to see such familiar swordsmanship in this world. Not only that, it was a technique exclusively for the Direct Disciples of the Shu Sect. She knew this Sword Technique well because she had fought against the current Successor of Shu Sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s eyebrows shot up when he heard that. &#8220;Who are you talking about?&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn&#8217;t invested in this battle at first. As a Fortuitous One, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had a halo that fueled people&#8217;s jealousy. It was inevitable for fights to come to him wherever he went. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There shouldn&#8217;t be anything unusual about this… But Ah Qing unexpectedly said that. Since Tuo Ba Xiao Yao knows about the Shu Sect&#8217;s Sword Technique, could it be that he has been to the world she was from in his previous life? Maybe he is originally from that world? Could this be the secret that he has been desperately trying to hide?]</span></p>

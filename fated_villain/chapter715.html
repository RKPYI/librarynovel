        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the depths of the homeland of Eternal Overcast, swirling grey mist billowed and twisted. The Great Ancestors stood there, witnessing the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being and his disciple, Gu Changge, openly attempting to seize their ancient wells. Their faces had turned so dark they were almost black as a surge of killing intent emanated from them.</span><span id="more-36178"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge might be young, but his true strength was unfathomable and difficult to gauge. In just a short period of time earlier, he had successively killed two of the Great Ancestors. Similarly, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was a dominant figure who surpassed the Immortal Realm during his prime in the Celestial Ancient Times. Even in the current era, such a character still possessed unimaginable means.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Ancestors could only rely on the three ancient wells to continuously reshape their physical bodies, or they would definitely not be a match for Gu Changge and the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Eternal Overcast Beings were filled with terror as they gazed at the scene. Throughout endless ages, no one had ever intruded into the depths of their homeland, let alone provoked the Great Ancestors to appear. Yet now, Gu Changge had forcibly barged into their territory and killed two Great Ancestors, forcing them to rebuild their bodies. Even the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being from the Celestial Ancient Times had reappeared to kill the Great Ancestors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Eternal Overcast, this was an earth-shattering and terrifying event that had pushed them to the brink of death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shocked and afraid, everyone had no choice but to kneel on the ground due to that overwhelming aura. Even the Eternal Overcast Beings who were True Daoists were shaking. They could sense that the entire Eternal Overcast would end up tattered even if it didn&#8217;t fall into ruins today. Jia Nan and the others felt especially as insignificant as ants. They knew that their bodies and souls would be annihilated countless times over with a mere ripple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are six of them in total. One is still rebuilding his body, and another is in a weakened state. How about you and I each kill two each of the remaining four?&#8221; The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being casually sized up the remaining Great Ancestors before he turned to Gu Changge with a smile and asked the question. He appeared confident, seemingly undisturbed by the fact that the Six Great Ancestors were difficult to kill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smiled faintly in response to his words. &#8220;Let&#8217;s follow your plan, Master.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re marching right into death!&#8221; Feeling like they were underestimated, the Great Ancestors shouted angrily upon seeing this. Their voices echoed through the sky, tearing it apart like lightning. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrifying black bolts of lightning started to stretch infinitely one after another as if descending from another universe and shot at Gu Changge and the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being. They were like black True Dragons, obliterating all the World Principles in their path. In an instant, this place transformed into a vast expanse of nihility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Excellent. I will take this opportunity to show you the Power of Reincarnation&#8221; The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being nodded and chuckled. As he spoke, his figure disappeared from the original spot when he seemed to have taken a step forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hazy and ethereal Dominion Domain extending from his footsteps, covering everything in all directions. Within this Dominion Domain, time seemed to slow down, and all things in the world began to stagnate. The Principles and Daos, too, appeared to move at a fraction of their usual pace. They even began to crumble and disintegrate under the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s gaze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolts of black lightning then struck, but in an instant, they decayed and withered as if it was millions of years old before they gradually dissolved into nothingness. It was a shocking scene as the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being seemed to walk in his own Domain of Time. Everywhere his gaze fell upon fell into this Domain, as all divine abilities became under his control.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All those watching were shocked beyond measure. They couldn&#8217;t even begin to make sense of such power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s sleeves fluttered, the area in front of him collapsed, eternalised into a dot or a circle. All living beings and Principles trapped within it were perpetually confined in a cycle of life and death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Domain of Time mean nothing to us. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are invincible within our homeland. Today, we, the Great Ancestors, will make you pay a heavy price. We will not be humiliated!&#8221; one of the Great Ancestors roared, attempting to break free from these binding Principles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From within the terrifying grey mist, thick chains resembling heavy and majestic mountains emerged, putting pressure on everyone&#8217;s heads and leaving them breathless and trembling. In the depths of the homeland, lightning descended as if the divine was punishing those who disrespected them. Every inch of space quivered, and a black whirlwind swept through the heavens and earth. Accompanied by black rain and ominous thunder, the bolts of lightning struck towards Gu Changge and the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Great Ancestors also made their move then. Suddenly, boundless light erupted from their decaying bodies enshrouded in the mist, and enormous hands stained with black blood swung at the two figures below. Chains made of Principles, accompanied by clattering sounds, appeared as if dragging a horde of malevolent spirits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next moment, a golden fist as brilliant as a radiant sun thrusted forward, directly colliding with one of the outstretched arms. As black blood splattered, a dense mist abruptly dispersed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have overestimated your powers. Your Spiritual Energy and divine sense may have transcended the mortal realm, but you aren’t that special&#8230;&#8221; Gu Changge wiped off his previous ethereal and divine appearance as his eyes turned cold and fierce, while his fist radiated immense power and sanctity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accompanied by Chaos Qi, his fist swung downward, covering and crushing everything ahead like a falling ancient sky. One of the Great Ancestors&#8217; arms instantly exploded and shattered into pieces, becoming red mist in the air. The Great Ancestor had crumbled in an instant the moment their physical body collided with Gu Changge&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an indescribably suppressive force. The mere fluctuation of their physical bodies was enough to shake this entire universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the Eternal Overcast Beings trembled in fear when they witnessed the Great Ancestors, who were supposed to be invincible, being continuously torn apart by Gu Changge. Even those Eternal Overcast Beings who were nearby couldn&#8217;t help but tremble. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the remnant aftershocks, their bodies began to crumble, revealing cracks that unceasingly oozed blood. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The endless grey mist burst open, revealing the scene deep within the land. Perhaps this world was originally broken, as there were scars covering the vast land and ruins scattered in every corner. It all fell further apart under Gu Changge and the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s attacks. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, the void cracked, the World Principles shattered, the Chains of Principles broke, and the runes were completely erased. The three mysterious and supreme ancient wells had emerged and were shining at the depths of the Eternal Overcast homeland, as if enveloping this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One by one, the six Great Ancestors shattered from the duo&#8217;s attacks. Although their Spiritual Energy was extraordinary, and they could unleash countless unmatched techniques, they had no way of resisting before they quickly exploded, both in body and soul, when faced with absolute power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Hum!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mysterious and hazy energy flowed from the ancient wells and enveloped the Six Great Ancestors. After their bodies disintegrated, it didn&#8217;t take long for them to reappear from above the ancient wells as they rapidly reshaped their physical forms. When their Spiritual Energy returned back to their Knowledge Sea, between their eyebrows, they once again launched an attack at Gu Changge and the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world here turned upside down, and the entire sky appeared dark as it collapsed. This wide world couldn&#8217;t withstand their aura at all. Soon, the surging dark aura permeated from the crumbling cracks and spread outward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, many ancient experts, with high cultivation, from the Forces of the Upper Realm, suddenly opened their eyes. They sensed the distant spatial fluctuations that made their hearts throb with unease and fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That cloud of grey mist has returned! It has descended upon the world once again&#8230;&#8221; One of them seemed to have realised something as fear filled their eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fluctuation from the battle in Eternal Overcast was so massive that it even alarmed many undying monstersities who had been in seclusion for a long time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They emerged from their secluded places or ancient caves to gaze at the battlefield from a distance. Even though there should be no living beings in millions of kilometres of the regions the Eternal Overcast took over, that didn&#8217;t stop them from speculating and deducing what might be happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If Eternal Overcast breaks out again, no one can suppress it if they are not a True Immortal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By then, countless people within billions of kilometres will suffer, and everything will be utterly destroyed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Elders stood in a pavilion inside Immortal Academy with a chessboard and geomantic compass in the centre, seemingly deducing something. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Elder of Skyward Schloss was also present with a solemn look on his face. He was from the same era as Gu Xianer’s Masters from Peach Village. With his unfathomable strength, he was one of the existences who stood at the top in the current era. One could tell how complicated this was from the way even he thought this situation was hard to deal with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Have you found out anything? It seems that something is going on in the Eternal Overcast. That&#8217;s why such a pervasive dark aura has suddenly emerged,&#8221; the Elder asked with a glum expression filled with concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Elder, there is indeed a problem in Eternal Overcast, but we do not know what the cause is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Yin Energy there, which was previously dormant, seemed to have suddenly started to boil and gushed out!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many Space Rifts have appeared there as well, and a huge amount of Yin Energy has been seeping through. Many forces in the vicinity who couldn&#8217;t move away in time are already submerged within.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elders in the pavilion replied with solemn expressions upon hearing that. They, too, only noticed these changes out of nowhere because there had been no signs before this. And even when the Yin Energy had appeared a long time ago, it had never erupted so abruptly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First, we need to find a way to stabilise the space surrounding Yin Energy to prevent the Yin Energy from spreading and engulfing the rest of the area, or else the consequences will be unimaginable. I will contact the other Immortal Forces and ask them to take action,&#8221; the elder instructed with a grim look on his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial purpose of establishing the Immortal Academy was to prevent Eternal Overcast from causing indescribable calamities to the Upper Realm in the future. However, even before the plan to create an Immortal succeeded, terrifying chaos had already erupted from the Eternal Overcast. This happened so unexpectedly that no one had any preventive measures to handle this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could it be that the terrifying Beings in the Eternal Overcast are awakening?&#8221; Another Elder speculated with concern. He couldn&#8217;t help making such a guess.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the entire Upper Realm was worried and anxious due to the turmoil in Eternal Overcast, Gu Changge, who was engaged in battle with the Six Great Ancestors deep within the Eternal Overcast, was unaware of the disturbances spreading to the Upper Realm. Likewise, he did not know about the devouring and submerging of many Forces by the Eternal Overcast’s Yin Energy. Then again, he wouldn&#8217;t care even if he knew. The fact that the origin of the Eternal Overcast being right in front of him was far more important.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You all have weakened to this extent. It won&#8217;t be long before the mysterious water in the ancient wells is depleted. If you don&#8217;t want to be completely annihilated, hand over these three wells obediently before they are thoroughly exhausted.&#8221; The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being calmly spoke after he appeared beneath the ancient wells and confronted the Six Great Ancestors who were in the process of reshaping their physical bodies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seemed composed and unruffled. Even in the midst of fighting against the Great Ancestors, he showed no sign of fatigue. Although his current strength was far from its peak, he had effortlessly dealt with the six weakened Great Ancestors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, there was also Gu Changge, whose true intentions were hard to discern, beside him. In the battle with the Great Ancestors just now, Gu Changge&#8217;s performance had caught the attention of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being. It left him with a lingering doubt in his mind. He had a feeling that Gu Changge was similar to himself; they both had profound and inscrutable thoughts, and their emotions were hidden beneath an impassive facade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was still uncertain of what Gu Changge was truly after and what he was capable of doing. Although they were nominally Master and disciple, neither of them took this seriously, and they remained cautious of each other.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, you will regret your actions today sooner or later.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Great Dao is omnipresent. Since you dared to break the agreement, you will have to bear the appropriate consequences in the future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Six Great Ancestors stared coldly at the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being. Their figures were fading out, and their auras had diminished compared to before. Although they had three ancient wells to revive them, the process consumed the well water, and was not a long-term solution. Moreover, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was right; once the well water was depleted, it would be the moment of their true demise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being remained indifferent to their words. &#8220;The Great Dao has already collapsed, and the Immortal Path has been cut off after the Forbidden Epoch. Even if I made a Dao Oath on my Dao Heart, how can it manifest to punish me? And even if it manifests, why would I need to lie dormant for countless ages, struggling to catch a glimpse of a Dao Fruit of that Realm?&#8221; he nonchalantly mentioned, showing an indifferent attitude towards the Great Dao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes flickered slightly when he heard these words. [The Great Dao has collapsed, and the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being struggled to catch a glimpse of some Dao Fruit? He has already surpassed the Immortal Realm before the Forbidden Epoch. Could the realm he sought to explore be beyond the Immortal Realm? Who could be in that realm then? Is it the Kind of Immortals? Maybe the Emperor of Immortals? Ancestors?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal Gate was destined to manifest in this life. Not only that, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, who appeared at this moment, clearly had his sights set on beyond the Immortal Realm. Gu Changge still remembered how Gu Qingyi had warned him of unimaginable upheavals that would befall the Upper Realm before her departure. [Could the &#8216;upheaval&#8217; she mentioned be related to the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, you never took that Dao Oath seriously, and you have been deceiving and plotting against us all along?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are despicable!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing the truth from the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being himself, the Six Great Ancestors immediately had a twisted look on their faces. Their emotions could no longer be described as mere anger. Still, they were not ordinary individuals. Upon understanding everything, they made a decisive move.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But you will still pay the price for this,&#8221; one of them continued. &#8220;Today, I engrave my undying True Soul in the River of Time and curse you!&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their figures quickly blurred, and every inch of their body seemed to be burning as an endless mist permeated from them. Strange runes that glowed endlessly began flying out from the mist before they swiftly incinerated into ashes in the void.</span></p>

      <p>
        "My lord, in this small northern mountain, there exists a powerful
        hidden cultivator, and it killed all of the people I sent."
      </p>
      <p>
        "According to the news that came back, there was a silver-haired old
        woman among them who was deeply hidden, and the cultivation base shown
        at that time had already reached the Conferred King Realm!"
      </p>
      <p>Inside the hall.</p>
      <p>
        The leader of the black wind bandit was talking with a cautious look,
        afraid that Gu Changge would blame him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he lost his people in a small village, which was entirely
        because of his poor performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, who would have thought that such a strong man could be hidden
        in a small village?
      </p>
      <p>
        However, what surprised him was that Gu Changge didn't care. He stood
        with his hands on his back, without even turning his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made the leader of the Black Wind bandits even more uncomfortable,
        and his back was wet with cold sweat.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of this young adult, he didn‚Äôt dare to say one more sentence.
      </p>
      <p>His soul was trembling, as if he was about to suffocate.</p>
      <p>"Oh? Silver-haired old woman?"</p>
      <p>
        "The strength of the Conferred King Realm?" Gu Changge smiled a little
        inexplicably.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry, my lord, this time this villain will personally take
        action, and everyone in that village will be arrested."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing that, the leader of the bandits wiped the cold sweat from his
        forehead and assured it carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thought that Gu Changge was asking them about the great loss they
        suffered at the hands of a cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>"No, it's none of your business, let's go."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge's expression remained unchanged, he waved his
        hand lightly and said, letting him leave.
      </p>
      <p>Hearing the news, he was in a good mood.</p>
      <p>
        In the Lower Realm, there was finally a clue about the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor that he was looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a small village, there were great masters hidden, and for some
        unknown reason, they could not take action generally.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the critical moment, their real strength broke out and blocked the
        intruding bandits.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was still very familiar with this kind of routine.</p>
      <p>
        A Son of Luck like the Human Ancestor, if the people around him had no
        background or past, they were not even worthy of being a supporting
        role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presumably, the silver-haired old woman who took in the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor could trigger a plot.
      </p>
      <p>"Wait, there's something else for you to do‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge suddenly thought of something, and called out
        the leader of the Black Wind bandits, with a somewhat intriguing
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mysterious baby girl he had been looking for recently should be in
        this small village called Northern Mountain Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, under his orders, they encountered a group of bandits and were
        in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivators in the Conferred King Realm, in such a small place, if
        there was no accident, they could naturally protect the peace for a
        while.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, without his intervention, even against some relatively
        powerful bandits, Northern Mountain Village would have a way to deal
        with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that they suddenly encountered a behemoth like the Black Wind
        Bandits.
      </p>
      <p>The two were not of the same magnitude at all.</p>
      <p>That was the so-called accident or variable.</p>
      <p>"My lord, please give me instructions."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's words, the leader hurried back, bent over and
        flattered, "The villain should do it with all his strength."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't want you to arrest people. I want you to send people to
        slaughter the village. After this is done, you will be free."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's smile was somewhat intriguing, "If it can't be done, then
        there is no need for the Black Wind Bandits to exist."
      </p>
      <p>"Slaughter the Village?"</p>
      <p>
        The leader's expression changed, but he didn't dare to ask Gu Changge
        the reason. In his opinion, a small village was completely unworthy of
        this big man's attention.
      </p>
      <p>Could it be that the village had some unknown secrets?</p>
      <p>Slaughter the village? How difficult was this?</p>
      <p>
        And soon, because of Gu Changge's order, the leader of the bandits began
        to gather all the Black Wind bandits.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the name of being provoked and going to take revenge, he was going to
        slaughter the Northern Mountain Village.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>

      <p>
        The terrifying black torrent rushed out from the mountain range, and
        with blood in the weather, it went in the direction of Northern Mountain
        Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cities and villages along the way were frightened, and the terror
        of the black wind bandits had always been well known in the vicinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time Northern Mountain Village had offended them, even if there was
        a monk in the Conferred King Realm, it would not escape the fate of
        being slaughtered!
      </p>
      <p>Many cultivators took pity on them.</p>
      <p>All right, why did you have to provoke the Black Wind bandits?</p>
      <p>
        After Gu Changge gave this order, he also brought his puppet servant and
        disappeared from the Black Wind Bandit Hall.
      </p>
      <p>After all, now was the best time for him to show up.</p>
      <p>Wasn't it nice for the hero to save beauty?</p>
      <p>
        Although this kind of plot was very old-fashioned, if it was staged
        carefully, the effect should not be bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was thinking about what kind of identity he should give
        himself this time, so that everything would look seamless. VIss·ªãT
        n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, that mysterious baby girl looked more or less related to the
        peach tree behind Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>
        The matter of his coming to the Heavenly Star Realm from the Upper Realm
        was a secret, and they might become aware of it if he used his original
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, at that time, with my cultivation base, I'm afraid that I
        won't need to consider these anymore."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt that with his current cultivation speed, when he
        returned to the Upper Realm, he might have already reached the Great
        Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>At least, it should not be far from the Great Sacred Realm.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        "Grandma Yinhua, the Black Wind bandits have said that they want to
        slaughter us‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"What should we do!"</p>
      <p>
        "The leader of the Black Wind bandits is a god, we can't escape, and all
        of us will die by then."
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, in the Northern Mountain Village.</p>
      <p>
        The current village chief was at the door of Yaoyao's house, talking to
        the silver-haired old woman with a sad face and despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him, the rest of the villagers Of Northern Mountain Village were
        equally desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group of bandits from the Black Wind Bandits came again the day
        before yesterday, aggressively trying to take away all the girls under
        the age of fifteen.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the villagers were desperate and unwilling, but who dared to resist?
        They didn't even dare to say no.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Yaoyao wiped her face with mud, she was recognized by the
        bandits and they said that they would take her away!
      </p>
      <p>
        She was so frightened at the time that she hadn't seen her brother come
        back, and she didn't want to be eaten by the Black Wind bandits boss.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at that time, no one thought that the trembling silver haired granny
        would suddenly burst into action. She was someone who needed another
        person‚Äôs support when she was walking usually.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as soon as she made a move, she displayed the powerful strength of
        the Conferred King Realm.
      </p>
      <p>She turned out to be a cultivator and a master!</p>
      <p>
        There was no accident, all the bandits were buried here, and no one
        escaped, because their strongest person was not anywhere near her, and
        the silver haired granny who was in the Conferred King Realm was still
        two big realms away.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene shocked everyone, and people of the entire Northern Mountain
        Village, including Yaoyao, were stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Granny Yinhua naturally became the backbone of Northern Mountain
        Village.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone‚Äôs hope was on her!</p>
      <p>
        Before this, no one would have thought that she was a master who was
        deeply hidden!
      </p>
      <p>It was just that surprises came quickly, followed by despair.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the Black Wind bandits were far more than just that group of
        people, and there were even more terrifying powerhouses behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
        They could escape the first time, but they couldn't escape the fifteenth
        time.
      </p>
      <p>The entire Northern Mountain Village fell into despair again.</p>
      <p>
        Looking at the desperate, but faintly hopeful people in Northern
        Mountain Village in front of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Granny Yinhua smiled bitterly and said, "At this time, I have no choice!
        Black Wind is the master of the bandit, but he is a high-ranking God,
        and the other nine masters are also True Gods‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Not to mention my current Conferred King Realm cultivation, even at the
        peak of my life, it would be impossible to stop them."
      </p>
      <p>
        She was telling the truth, if the Black Wind bandits really planned to
        come to the slaughter village, even if she had feelings for the rest of
        the village, she wouldn't be able to care.
      </p>
      <p>At that time, Yaoyao would have to run away first.</p>
      <p>
        The life and death of the rest of the people couldn't be controlled so
        much at all.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Silver haired granny actually didn't want to see such a day. Otherwise,
        she wouldn't come here to live in seclusion, or even show her
        cultivation, instead of being an ordinary old woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the enemy behind her was much stronger than the Black Wind
        bandits, once her whereabouts were revealed, the pursuit and killing she
        would face would be endless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing what Granny Yinhua said, everyone in Northern Mountain Village
        was truly desperate.
      </p>
      <p>Their last ray of hope was ruthlessly cut off.</p>
      <p>This time, there would be no miracles!</p>
      <p>"Grandma‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao grabbed Silver haired granny's sleeve, her big eyes like flawless
        gems showed worry and fear.
      </p>
      <p>She was also sad.</p>
      <p>
        Although she was very small, she was very sensible and understood the
        meaning of Grandma's words.
      </p>
      <p>When the Black Wind bandits come, everyone would die.</p>
      <p>
        All they could do now was wait for their death! In addition to waiting
        for death, running away or resisting would only make their death worse!
      </p>
      <p>
        And even if Grandma was a cultivator, she could find a way to take her
        to escape, but in front of the opponent's powerhouse, the chance of
        escaping was still very small and slim.
      </p>
      <p>"Don't worry Yaoyao, grandma will protect you!"</p>
      <p>
        Feeling Yaoyao's fear, Granny Yinhua couldn't help comforting her, but
        she was also desperate.
      </p>
      <p>It was impossible to escape and even more impossible to resist.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, she only hoped that Yaoyao's elder brother Jiang Yang
        would suddenly come back and bring the powerhouses of Immortal Lun Sect
        to slay the Blank Wind bandits!
      </p>
      <p>But this hope was too slim!</p>
      <p>"Yeah, Yaoyao believes in Grandma."</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao nodded as if a chicken was pecking at rice, unlike other
        children, crying out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this regard, she appeared to be far more sensible and mature than her
        peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Silver haired granny smiled with relief, even if she fought her old
        bones today, she would not allow the Black Wind bandits to move her
        single hair!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Grandma, do you think brother will come back to save us? He went to
        cultivate in the Immortal Lun Sect. He should be very good now, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I believe that brother will show up and kill all the bad guys of the
        Black Wind bandits!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's little face was full of fantasy, remembering the scene when she
        met a poisonous snake before and her brother drove it away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that her life was in danger, her brother should come to save her,
        right?
      </p>
      <p>A wry smile appeared on Silver haired granny‚Äôs face.</p>
      <p>
        What could she say at this time? Would she tell Yaoyao that even if her
        brother was talented, he would be in the Soul Palace Realm at most?
      </p>
      <p>
        It was impossible for one person to save them, unless a miracle
        happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's really the end, if I burn the blood of my life, sacrifice that
        secret treasure and move Yaoyao to a safe place. The Black Wind bandits
        will not be able to find her!"
      </p>
      <p>She looked at her innocent face and said secretly in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        "In the Northern Mountain Village, who dares to provoke me, the Black
        Wind bandits will let you know what is the fate of those who provoke
        us."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, a rumbling voice suddenly came from the horizon, and a
        large number of fierce bandits were rushing here on fierce beasts!
      </p>
      <p>
        The bandit at the head was dressed in black with a terrifying aura, and
        he was sitting on a black dragon.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the leader of a Black Wind bandits, who was in the True God
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stared at Northern Mountain Village below, and said coldly, wondering
        why the big boss would send him to bring people to this village.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Northern Mountain village, even if there were hidden Conferred
        King-level masters, it was not good enough to make him take action in
        person.
      </p>
      <p>It was just an order from the top so he had to do it!</p>
      <p>Slaughtering this village wouldn't take much time at all!</p>
      <p>
        "Black Wind bandits are here! They really came to slaughter the village,
        and it's over, no one of us can escape‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, everyone in the Northern Mountain Village was desperate!
        It was one thing to hear the news, seeing it live was something else.
      </p>
      <p>"Grandma."</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao bit her lip in fright, her small body was trembling behind Granny
        Yinhua.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, she still hadn‚Äôt cried, and was already very brave.</p>
      <p>"Don't be afraid, Yaoyao, grandma is here."</p>
      <p>
        While comforting Yaoyao, Granny Yinhua stared at the front with a solemn
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above, the Black Wind bandits were mighty, covering the sky and the sun,
        like a large black cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the leader at the True God Realm cultivation, the
        strength of the others was also extremely powerful, and they were the
        elites of the Black Wind bandits.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, for the sake of slaughtering the village, they actually sent

        Chapter 221-2: Are you the Immortal brother? Is this little girl willing
        to worship the deity as a teacher? (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Granny Yinhua was even more desperate in her heart, but she did not
        regret it. If the Black Wind bandits had captured Yaoyao last time, she
        would definitely live in endless regrets and guilt in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's just you, the old granny who killed our people, you deserve to
        die, making the boss so angry. After going down today, learn how to grow
        eyes for a while, we Black Wind bandits are not the ones you low-life
        can offend!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The ninth leader of the Black Wind bandits was standing high in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>He sneered and stared at the Silver Haired Granny.</p>
      <p>
        Having said that, he personally took action, because their leader had
        explained that this time the village slaughter must be completed,
        otherwise he would punish them!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>The pressure of the True God Realm instantly crushed down.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>The mountains shook, as if the sky was falling apart!</p>
      <p>It was like a large mountain fell down from the sky.</p>
      <p>
        All the villagers in the Northern Mountain Village were desperate,
        terrified, and horrified.
      </p>
      <p>Under this aura, they were no different from ants.</p>
      <p>"Stop!"</p>
      <p>
        The expression of the silver haired granny changed greatly, her whole
        body glowed with bright runes, and she burst out with all her strength,
        taking this palm head on.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, with a puff, her body was covered in blood, and
        she flew upside down, and half of her body almost exploded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gap between the two of them was too big, she couldn't be this
        person's opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone in the Northern Mountain Village looked at all of this in
        despair and horror, and shrank in place.
      </p>
      <p>What was more, they were already slumped to the ground.</p>
      <p>
        "You actually resisted my blow with physical strength. It seems that you
        were also a strong person back in your days."
      </p>
      <p>The leader of bandits froze for a moment, then reacted and sneered.</p>
      <p>The strength of the silver haired granny surprised him a bit.</p>
      <p>
        But she still couldn't make him worried, he felt that with one more
        palm, he could destroy her body and spirit!
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't need to mention what happened back then, now I'm just an old
        woman trying to protect her granddaughter."
      </p>
      <p>
        Half of Granny Yinhua's body was covered in blood, and blood poured out
        of her mouth, looking extremely pale and miserable.
      </p>
      <p>"Grandma!"</p>
      <p>
        This scene made Yaoyao's face turn pale, she shouted with extreme worry,
        and her little hands clenched the corner of her clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength of the Black Wind bandits was too strong, even if Granny
        Yinhua resisted, there was no possibility of survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        She hoped in her heart that her brother would show up to save her and
        her grandma, but no one came!
      </p>
      <p>She couldn't help but despair.</p>
      <p>
        "You don't know whether to live or die. Wouldn't it be better to wait to
        die honestly? You still have to resist?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing that the silver-haired old woman dared to make a move, the leader
        of bandits sneered again, ready to wipe her out!
      </p>
      <p>With such a strong gap in strength, was resistance any useful?</p>
      <p>
        He also didn't understand why the big boss would give this order to
        slaughter the village.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Maybe he happened to be in a bad mood when I met the big boss!</i>
      </p>
      <p><strong>"Puff!"</strong></p>
      <p>
        Under this powerful aura, without any accident, the silver-haired old
        woman spurted out a mouthful of blood again and fell from the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Yaoyao hurriedly ran over, intending to help her up, and
        her little face was full of tears.
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao, leave me alone‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Granny Yinhua coughed up blood and was seriously injured. At her peak,
        she was also close to the True God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>So even if she took two hits, she still wouldn‚Äôt die.</p>
      <p>But it was amazing enough.</p>
      <p>"Don't hurt my grandma!"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao opened her hand and stood in front of the silver-haired old
        woman, stubbornly looking at the leader of bandits in the sky, trying to
        stop him.
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao hurry up and come back‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        This scene made Granny Yinhua's expression change drastically, and she
        was about to pull her back.
      </p>
      <p>"A little girl, she really doesn't know whether to live or die."</p>
      <p>
        But at this time, the face of the leader of bandits turned cold, and he
        had already attacked again. The terrifying palm was so amazing that it
        fell from the air!
      </p>
      <p>To shoot this ignorant little girl to death.</p>
      <p>
        Unexpectedly, even a four or five-year-old girl would dare to stop him.

        This made him feel that he was being provoked, and his expression was
        even colder.
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>The villagers of the Northern Mountain Village also shouted.</p>
      <p>
        Some people were even angry and unwilling, they did not dare to watch
        this scene, and turned their heads away.
      </p>
      <p>They felt that under this palm, Yaoyao would definitely die.</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, the picture that everyone thought did not
        appear.
      </p>
      <p>With a slightly helpless sigh.</p>
      <p>
        Heaven and earth seemed to be quiet, with an inexplicable and mysterious
        aura flowing in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        Space, time, reincarnation‚Ä¶ All kinds of rules seemed to be stagnant.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The deity still wants to continue to watch the show, but how can you
        lay your hands on such a beautiful little girl?"
      </p>
      <p>
        A voice that sounded like a man reverberated between heaven and earth,
        making it impossible to tell the age.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed very young.</p>
      <p>
        But in these words there was a kind of vicissitude of sitting and
        watching the rush of eternity.
      </p>
      <p>As the world was unfolding like a scroll.</p>
      <p>
        A figure of a man with a blurry face and a fairy-like meaning appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        His deep eyes seemed to reflect many terrifying scenes such as the
        collapse of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just looking at them was enough to make people's minds explode, and
        cause them to die!
      </p>
      <p>
        It was Gu Changge who had come to the Northern Mountain Village long
        ago, but had been watching the play in secret, waiting for the right
        time to show up.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, the leader of bandits was trembling silly.</p>
      <p>His skull seemed to be opened, and ice water was poured into it!</p>
      <p>Cold to the bones!</p>
      <p>
        Although he had never seen this person who suddenly appeared before.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was definitely the kind that was unfathomably powerful, otherwise
        there would be absolutely no such means of interfering with the rules of
        heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>Faintly, he thought of the recent news from Xuan Domain.</p>
      <p>
        Could it be‚Ä¶ the mysterious and unpredictable Immortal from the Upper
        Realm?
      </p>
      <p>"Are you an Immortal‚Ä¶ brother?"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was a little stunned when she saw the man in white who suddenly
        appeared in front of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response, those big pure and clean eyes were full of confusion and
        curiosity, and then she asked timidly.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Immortal?"</p>
      <p>
        The figure walking out of heaven and earth seemed to be stunned when he
        heard these words, and then let out a chuckle.
      </p>
      <p>"It's a strange name."</p>
      <p>
        "Little girl, would you like to worship this deity as your teacher?"
      </p>
      <p>Then, his deep eyes suddenly fell on her.</p>
      <p>
        His voice was filled with a terrifying aura that made many laws and
        rules tremble.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone watched this scene in shock and amazement.</p>
      <p>
        Especially the bandits of the Black Wind bandits, they were all cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their souls seemed to be frozen, and it was difficult for them to move
        and even if they moved, they were as small as an ant!
      </p>
      <p>
        The mighty momentum caused deadly silence, causing the villagers in the
        Northern mountain Village to be horrified and unable to believe their
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Yaoyao didn't seem to realize what happened.</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the silver haired granny behind her had a drastic
        change in her complexion. First she was shocked, she couldn't believe
        it, and now she was ecstatic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supporting her terrifying injury, she said to Yaoyao with a trembling
        voice, "Yaoyao, promise this Immortal, this is your best chance! Don't
        miss it!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Northern Mountain Village was located in a desolate place,
        she also heard that during this period of time, an extremely mysterious
        Immortal from the Upper Realm had appeared in Xuan Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the help of this Immortal's words, the most powerful Taixu Sect in
        the Xuan Domain instantly unified the Xuan Domain without a single day
        of war.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man in white in front of her, his means and temperament, his
        identity‚Ä¶ Needless to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Granny Yinhua's heart jumped into her throat, and she
        was extremely anxious for Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's really a rare Immortal talent. No one has found it for so many
        years. I didn't expect to pass through this area today, but it's really
        a good fortune for the deity."
      </p>
      <p>"If you slow down, you'll be ruined. That's a sin."</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, the man in white in front of her spoke again with a
        slight smile, and said to Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao opened her eyes and felt a warmth and tranquility from the man in
        front of her.
      </p>
      <p>It was a refreshing feeling.</p>
      <p>As if the sky was falling, she would not have to be afraid.</p>
      <p>
        Just when she was about to be beaten to death by the bad guys of the
        Black Wind bandits, it was this Immortal who suddenly appeared, rescued
        her, and said that he wanted to accept her as a disciple.
      </p>
      <p>He was an Immortal?</p>

      <p>
        On the contrary, the brother she had been looking forward to did not
        come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without this Immortal, she, her grandma, and all the villagers would
        have died here today.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you Mr. Immortal for your help. The old woman is very grateful!"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, with ecstasy and deep gratitude, Granny Yinhua knelt down
        and thanked Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>Listening to this.</p>
      <p>She was completely horrified.</p>
      <p>Just passing by this Domain?</p>
      <p>How many Domains were there in the entire Heavenly Star Realm?</p>
      <p>
        Didn't that mean that the Immortal in front of him could cross hundreds
        of millions of distances at will, easily shrinking into an inch.
      </p>
      <p>This method was simply unheard of.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded slightly and let her stand up, but he obviously didn't
        mean to talk to her.
      </p>
      <p>The silver haired granny was not surprised, and felt normal.</p>
      <p>
        It was already a great honor to see an Immortal, so how could he
        possibly talk to her?
      </p>
      <p>In her opinion, Yaoyao's identity should not be simple.</p>
      <p>
        When she was adopted, no beasts approached her within a thousand miles.
      </p>
      <p>It was just that she hadn't figured it out since.</p>
      <p>
        The Immortal from the Upper Realm in front of her was very knowledgeable
        and must know a lot of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be no problem to understand Yaoyao's extraordinary mystery.
      </p>
      <p>"Is Mr. Immortal really going to accept Yaoyao as a disciple?"</p>
      <p>
        "They all said that I can't cultivate, I'm just an ordinary person. The
        cultivator who took my brother away last time also said that if I went
        along, I‚Äôll just drag him down‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao said in a low voice, she looked like she was only four or five
        years old, but it was obvious that she knew more than many people.
      </p>
      <p>It was not that she didn't want him as her teacher.</p>
      <p>
        But she felt that a little girl with a humble identity like herself who
        also had a strange disease and couldn't grow up was not worthy of
        worshiping the Immortal in front of her as her teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, earlier, she actually felt that it was fine not to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        She could accompany her grandma, wait for her brother to return after
        completing his studies, and protect them.
      </p>
      <p>
        But today, after witnessing the cruelty of this world with her own eyes,
        she suddenly felt that cultivation was very important. ALL new ùíÑhapters

        "It's just that they are blind and short-sighted. How can the real
        Immortal talent be seen by ordinary people?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge shook his head slightly, and said with a bit of disdain.</p>
      <p>
        The expression in his eyes seemed to be more and more appreciated the
        more he looked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, when he was hiding in the void before, he had already
        observed Yaoyao all over.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was indeed the Daughter of Luck, and the amount of Luck points on
        her body was extremely astonishing, reaching tens of thousands.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made him firm up his previous guess, and it really had something to
        do with the mysterious peach tree; it was not the template of the
        Ruthless Empress that he was familiar with in his previous life.
      </p>
      <p>There was a hint of a familiarity, but it was not exactly the same.</p>
      <p>However, his plan remained the same about how it should be done.</p>
      <p>
        Without any means, as the Daughter of Luck, she probably wouldn't agree
        easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Gu Changge had to go to great lengths to arrange such a drama
        of a hero saving beauty.
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao is willing to worship Mr. Immortal as a teacher!"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing what Gu Changge said, Yaoyao's eyes were full of determination,
        and she said in a crisp and clear voice.
      </p>
      <p>She looked very well-behaved, and her face was stained with tears.</p>
      <p>"It's nice and obedient."</p>
      <p>
        "These troubles, this deity‚Ä¶ oh no, I'll help you solve it as a teacher.
        They almost destroyed such a piece of immortal talent."
      </p>
      <p>"This sin is really not forgivable."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled slightly, and said with a flash of deep meaning on his
        face, and then directly waved his sleeve.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>It was like the whole world was turning!</p>
      <p>
        The terrifying and vast power, like a sea, turned into a melting pot of
        heaven and earth, covering it down.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Puff puff</strong>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        The group of Black Wind bandits who were still aggressive and covered
        the sky just now disappeared from the sky in an instant, as if they were
        instantly wiped away by an invisible and terrifying big hand!
      </p>
      <p>As if their appearance before was just an illusion!</p>
      <p>
        This scene made all the villagers of the Northern Mountain Village widen
        their eyes and stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their opinion, this method was no different from the real immortals
        in rumors.
      </p>
      <p>"Strong enough to be beyond the bounds of heaven and earth‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Granny Yinhua shuddered, and was shocked by this scene for a long time,
        but she soon came back to her senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then comes ecstasy. Because this Immortal from the Upper ealm actually
        accepted Yaoyao as his disciple!

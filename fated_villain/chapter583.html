        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* The void collapsed and a terrifying rift appeared, as if countless stars fell from the sky. </span><span id="more-32766"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daoist Sage and the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family were no longer at their peak state. After their battle, it was obvious that their limited stamina had further depleted, even if they tried their best to put up strong resistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge’s intention was to attack their Sources. When he made a move, he directly suppressed them with the Grand Flask. This made the situation even more chaotic as the two roared in rage and whipped out their strongest artifacts and techniques, while death was dawning on them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The light caused by their exchange caused the whole place to blindly lit up. Heaven and earth seem to have been destroyed countless times over, engulfing the whole universe in endless chaos. Even the river of time seems to have been shattered, engulfing the three figures. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a great yet endless battle. It’s no wonder that the Daoist Sage and the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family were regarded as invincible beings! At their peak, their cultivations had already transcended the True Immortal Realm. However, under Gu Changge’s persistence, they eventually lost their strength and coughed out blood. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the Eight Barren Demon Halberd appeared in Gu Changge’s hand. As if it could split the universe in half, rays of light burst forth from the Halberd. With a swift motion. Gu Changge destroyed all the incoming attacks from the two! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each move was made with clear intention, with not a second wasted. However, even the alliance between the Daoist Sage and the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family could not protect them from Gu Changge’s attacks. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After they let out screams of fury, silence ensued. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grand Flask suspended in the air, was like a black hole that devoured everything. Aside from the Source of the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family, it also took in the Daoist Sage. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if it was just a corpse from millions of years ago, the physical body of the once Ancient Feather Supreme Being would still contain power that was unimaginable to an ordinary cultivator.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family has fallen…” As he witnessed the scene unfold before his eyes, Jiang Chen let out a miserable laugh that made him seem as though he had become a fool. In the end, even the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family died in Gu Changge’s hands. Now, his last glimmer of hope had been completely extinguished. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Gu Changge had no need to keep Jiang Chen. Now that he had Xiao Ruoyin’s refinement method, he grabbed Jiang Chen and prepared to sacrifice him to refine the Celestial Boat of Creation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Dao Fire erupted from the ground and lit up the icy-cold underground palace. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen let out a tragic wail and cursed Gu Changge non-stop as his life dissipated into thin air. However, rays of light started to radiate off his entire body. Mysterious runes appeared on his body and materialised into a Spiritual Manifestation of an ancient bronze boat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the refinement process was time-consuming, Gu Changge wasn’t in a rush as he had already dealt with the Daoist Sage and the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family. During this period of time, he didn’t pay much attention to Xiao Ruoyin. Instead, he just sat down and started the process, summoning Dao Flames. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Sources he had devoured was so intense that it was enough for him to breakthrough the barrier to the Nirvana Realm and become a True Daoist. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time passed, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following months, booming noises resounded in this area, just like a tumultuous thunder storm. The tremor shook the heavens and earth, as if it could split apart the sky. Endless rays of light soared into the sky as if there were hundreds of millions of Immortals flying up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of Gu Changge, a grand yet ancient portal, which contained Dao Energy, appeared. However, the portal was shut tight and difficult to open. It seemed like there was another indescribable world beyond it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The door to the Nirvana Realm… looks like he’s going to become a True Daoist soon…” Xiao Ruoyin watched as everything unfolded with complicated feelings as she thought about Gu Changge’s age. [And he’s just twenty plus years old?] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would not be an exaggeration if she described all of this as unprecedented. However, when Xiao Ruoyin thought about Gu Changge’s identity, she remained unsurprised. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next moment, Gu Changge’s glabella lit up and a little golden figure who looked just like him stepped out and pushed the door open. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barrier opened up, with hundreds of millions of light beams imploding. A great wave of World Energy flooded, with Chaos Qi and Celestial Energy surging. For that moment, the whole place seemed to have turned into the legendary Celestial Domain. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Gu Changge’s skin, flesh, blood and bones became crystal-clear and bright, covered with Chaos Qi and Celestial Energy. Finally, the Heavenly Dao Symbol condensed onto his glabella. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heaven and earth shook. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fog appeared and completely surrounded him. This was Heaven’s Gift for cultivators who became True Daoists. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were various Dao fragments and precious Immortal Dao Runes in the fog. Normally, it was impossible for one to see them. Likewise, no one else other than True Daoists were qualified to touch them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, if this place was not so secluded, the sight of Gu Changge becoming a True Daoist would’ve undoubtedly shook the whole Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every cell Gu Changge had was devouring the Dao Fog. His soul and cultivation also evolved. The energy he was taking in was simply too intense. He was just like a furnace of Chaos Qi, boiling between heaven and earth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazzling divine light reflected off Gu Changge’s cheekbones. At this point, his aura was frightening. It was more turbulent than the vast sea. In fact, just standing near him was suffocating. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gap between a True Daoist and those who were not was difficult to describe in words. Just the transformation of one’s aura alone was beyond the imagination of ordinary cultivators.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the Chaos Qi finally dissipated and the place gradually returned to stillness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His spotless white robes fluttered in the wind and his crystal-clear ink-like black hair flowed behind him. This scene made him look transcendent. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a calm demeanour and deep eyes like an endless starry sky, Gu Changge stood up. “It took several months, but that wasn’t too long.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes that the time he took to do this was indescribably short as compared to other cultivators. Afterall, when ordinary cultivators in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm tried to breakthrough, they often retreated for tens of thousands of years. He was the only exception. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How long more would it take to refine the Celestial Boat of Creation?” Gu Changge looked to the side. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Ruoyin had waited there the whole time. Although she knew that Gu Changge was in the midst of breaking through, she dared not leave. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At most, half a month.” Xiao Ruoyin replied as she peered towards an area that was covered in Dao Flames. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded his head and waved his sleeve to accept the Heavenly Treasure Chest that laid within the raging Dao Flames </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had used the Fortuity and Fatum such that his entire body now had two hundred and six Absolute Detachment Bones. This was already the peak of perfection. Every single bone within him had been transformed. It was also the reason why he could become a True Daoist so easily. Afterall, each Absolute Detachment Bones were related to the Origin of Principles and the Great Dao. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn’t lacking in terms of insight as well. All he needed was the energy to make the breakthrough, which had been provided by the Sources he devoured. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once he had made up for what he lacked, he naturally became a True Daoist. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge felt like there was something amiss. [How could the Absolute Detachment Bones only serve such a simple purpose? There must be more to it. It seems like the incomplete World Principles are hindering its true potential. Seems like I can only investigate further after reaching the Immortal Realm…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">{Time to move up the plan with the Tree of Epoch] Gu Changge started to prepare for the next step of his plan. His hope of reaching Immortality while still in the Upper Realm was now within his grasp. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The day the Epoch Dao Fruit matures, the World Principles of the Upper Realm and its Fortuity would be fixed. In the process, the Immortal Gate would appear, giving cultivators the opportunity to become Immortals.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since that is the case, is the Epoch Dao Fruit not the best bait?] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half a month later, the refinement of the Celestial Boat of Creation was completed. An ancient celestial bronze boat emerged from the Dao Flame. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A blur of ripples surrounded it as if the river of time was surrounding it, transcending the past and the present. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is really something special about this Celestial Boat of Creation.” Gu Changge nodded his head as he saw Xiao Ruoyin’s complicated emotions through her eyes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Ruoyin looked away as she knew that it was impossible for her to regain the Celestial Boat now. Furthermore, although Gu Changge spared her, she knew that her future was bleak. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It contains the Power of Time. but it still lacks Spacetime Coordinates…” The sight of the Celestial Boat of Creation reminded Gu Changge of the Mirror of Wonders and the Spacetime Stone, all of which were in his possession. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If they were to be utilised alongside the Celestial Boat of Creation, maybe I can restructure time and space, returning back to the Celestial Ancient Era, or even the Forbidden Epoch? Hmmm… well, though it sounds great, as of now, I don’t have any plans to restructure time and space.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwhich, as he left Kun Mountain with Xiao Ruoyin, Gu Changge bumped into quite a few cultivators, who were lost or were in hiding after being attacked by the Daoist Sage. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Ji Siblings, Ji Chuyue and Ji Yaoxing were within this group of people. Of course, now that he possessed the Celestial Boat of Creation, Gu Changge wasn’t afraid of getting lost anymore. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He revealed himself and even saved this group of people. After being stuck in Kun Mountain for so many months, the group almost ran out of hope and didn’t dare to act recklessly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were life-threatening traps all around. They even witnessed their friends or family tragically explode to death when they accidentally stepped onto a trap. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Gu Changge appeared, this reignited the hopes of these people. It was as though they had finally found a lighthouse in a sea of darkness. Even JI Chuyue, who was extremely scared of Gu Changge, couldn’t help but feel happy and relieved. After all, to them, as long as Gu Changge was around, everything would be fine, even if the sky collapses. The sense of security that he gave was indescribable. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like the Daoist Sage had killed quite a lot of people back then&#8230;” As he listened to everyone’s experiences, Gu Changge regretfully sighed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the beginning, the Daoist Sage’s ability was terrifying. Even the alliance of a few True Daoists couldn’t match up to him. They all ended up with tragic deaths. During that time the True Doaist held him back, all of us fled, but the landscape of Kun Mountain is just too complex. We got lost in the end…” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our people also got separated from us. We don’t even know if they’re dead or alive. Even my father and the Elders, we don’t know what state they are in.” Ji Chuyue depressingly added on. She didn’t know why she said all of this in front of Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young Master Gu, what exactly happened after we entered the cave?” Ji Yaoxing couldn’t help but ask when he remembered something. He really wanted to know what happened to their Prime Ancestor, Ji Shengchu.</span></p>

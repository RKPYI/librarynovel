<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, Sky King Zhi Yang didn&#8217;t come here without a reason. Firstly, he didn&#8217;t know where else he could go, and secondly, he was awaiting for the latest news, so he figured he would wait here until his Eldest Senior Brother, Qin Wuya, came.</span><span id="more-28411"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when he was informed about his &#8216;abduction of Qing Xiaoyi&#8217; and &#8216;affiliation with the Successor of Demonic Arts,&#8217; he was absolutely shocked. As though he was struck by lightning, there were nothing but violent rings in his mind, and it took him a while to recover from the shock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His first instinct was that the rumours were nothing but false and slanderous. Essentially, he was focused on his pursuit of the Successor of Demonic Arts. Although he didn&#8217;t manage to catch the Successor of Demonic Arts and unfortunately had a number of his followers hurt, his connection to Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s abduction and the Successor of Demonic Arts was questionable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing the details of the rumours, Sky King Zhi Yang was infuriated. Enraged, he then screamed out of vexation, destroying the landscape within thousands of kilometres upon finding out that he was framed. He barely did anything yet he was turned into a scapegoat for something so abysmal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even his followers could testify that ever since they left Black Tortoise in pursuit of the Successor of Demonic Arts, he never made a move on his own, so for him to return to the White Tiger Empire to kidnap Qing Xiaoyi within such a short time was impossible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the details of the rumours and the footage recorded by photographic stones left him thoroughly stupefied, as his eyes almost popped out. If he weren&#8217;t conscious of his own recent behaviour and actions, he would have suspected himself to be the kidnapper of Qing Xiaoyi. Apparently, the usage of Chaos Force was visible in the footage, wherein the culprit actually possessed the same ability as him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, as far as he knew, no one else in the world possessed such a power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the situation back then was quite coincidental. If the culprit was, in fact, framing him on purpose, the fact that Qing Feng had the Flask of World Domination was suspicious. Without the Flask of World Domination, Qing Feng would have died right away, and there was no way someone using Chaos Force would be revealed. Everything seemed too coincidental, and it was so perfect that no flaws or explanations could be found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, another incident that caused major turmoil across the world happened, and it was basically the last nail to Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s coffin. Since he was chasing after the Successor of Demonic Arts, it was baffling how the latter appeared in Black Tortoise Empire and drew everyone into the Eternal Overcast Fog right before the eyes of many young prodigies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, the fall of Prince Shen and Gu Changge&#8217;s grave injuries stirred up a huge turmoil, a hundred times greater than that of Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s abduction. Therefore, the aftermath it left behind was unimaginable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing that, Sky King Zhi Yang grew so anxious he almost passed out as the terrifying chilliness overwhelmed his entire body, and he could barely move a muscle. Filled with shock, anger, restlessness, but mostly fear, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to clear his name no matter how he defended himself, unless he was able to locate Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s actual abductor, the mysterious person who, like him, possessed Chaos Force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, pulling off this task would prove more difficult than clearing his own name as his enemy was clearly messing with him. Right when he declared to chase after the Successor of Demonic Arts, the latter appeared in the public eye, and that was a fierce slap to his face. As such, everyone was convinced that he was working with the Successor of Demonic Arts from the beginning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, such flawless, interconnected plans were truly spine-chilling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Qing Xiaoyi possesses the Celestial Demonic Physique, and no one else except the Successor of Demonic Arts would try to kidnap her. To think that the person I&#8217;ve been pursuing was an imposter, and everything that happened was to deceive me… How insufferable! The culprit better keep their identity away from me, or else!&#8221; Muttering his thoughts, Sky King Zhi Yang was frantic with rage and dissatisfaction. As he clenched his fists, his overwhelming murderous intent surged upwards, almost shattering the sky. In that instant, he wanted nothing more than to dismember the person who deceived him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, he swiftly calmed himself down as he was no reckless fool, aware that rage was nothing but burden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My priority now is to find out who my enemy is. I am certain that Purple Mansion will not give up because of this!&#8221; Having regained his cool, Sky King Zhi Yang started to think of his plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given his similar identity as an ancient monstrosity, as well as the fact that the family he was born in was the most influential branch of Purple Mansion, he wasn&#8217;t worried that the force behind him would abandon him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, upon a moment of intense hesitation, he decided to resort to a Secret Technique, though that would damage his Foreseeing Eye, making it harder for him to use it in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This leaves me with no choice. Without knowing who my enemy is, having a plan is pointless,&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang convinced himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* All of a sudden, innumerable runes in his blood glowed and rushed, gushing towards his skull. Followingly, the rune between his brows shattered, revealing traces of ambiguous gleams that shone vibrantly, as if heanvely lights were surging from within.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a vague vision occurred. It was a fragmented view of the future. Although the view was blurry, he could clearly see the figure of a man within.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? That&#8217;s G-Gu Changge!? Again!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In disbelief, Sky King Zhi Yang widened his eyes so tensely that he almost tore the corner of her eyes. Although the figure was hazy, there was no way he couldn&#8217;t identify the familiar aura, appearance and visage. And that man was his very archnemesis, Gu Changge!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Has Gu Changge been scheming against me? Has this all been his plans?] Sky King Zhi Yang was bewildered and his mind was all over the place as he was trying to discern the details in the vision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, the next second the frightening sensation reoccurred. As he faintly saw his Sect being obliterated by an all-destroying palm, his every cell, every inch of flesh, and his bones were trembling in inexplicable dread. Sweating profusely, his face blanched as his entire body was drenched in sweat. It was as though he was just dragged out of the waters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Impossible…&#8221; His voice was shaky; his eyes were filled with shock and fear as he couldn&#8217;t fathom why he was presented with such a nightmarish vision of devastation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhi Yan, whose original name was Liu Ziyan, was the Saintess of Purple Mansion. Her father, the current leader of Purple Mansion, possessed incomparable influence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Liu Ziyan wasn&#8217;t enlisted into the Ten Great Ranked Disciples of Immortal Academy, she made it into the ranks of Unranked Disciples. Though, she certainly kept a low profile as not many had witnessed her in battle. Regardless, her strength was definitely not to be underestimated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had to be noted that there were hobbyists that collected the portraits of all the prodigal damsels of the Immortal Academy. They even made the Ten Gracious Portraits, a list of the ten most beautiful prodigal damsels in the Immortal Academy, which Liu Ziyan became a part of. Her visage was of utmost elegance; her body appeared slender, and her purple dress was a cherry on top. Her movements were as delicate as the sways of fairy plants, noble and beguiling, and she was dazzlingly bewitching.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the temporary base of the disciples of Purple Mansion in the Black Tortoise Empire, Liu Ziyan was standing in the primary position in the palace with her brows furrowed as she coldly spoke. &#8220;Gu Changge invited us for tea?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the other disciples of Purple Mansion, who were also disciples of the Immortal Academy, were standing behind her as perturbation and nervousness arose on their faces. All of them followed Sky King Zhi Yang to participate in the trial in Black Tortoise Empire, but due to Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s high expectation, many of them failed to become his followers and could only stay at the temporary base.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is Young Master&#8217;s order. I hope you don&#8217;t trouble us, Saintess Zhi Yan. Young Master also noted that, should Saintess Zhi Yan reject his goodwill, we are to resort to force and drag all of you there.&#8221; Standing in the doorway of the palace, a muscular young man with godly lights glowing around his body spoke. His name was Wang Zhong. There were divine runes gleaming in his eyes, and an overbearing aura would gush out of his eyes whenever he opened them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, he was followed by many young prodigies who were all daunting individuals, possessing formidable cultivation levels, and no one in the Immortal Academy was clueless to their identities. As their repressing aura surrounded the area, everyone on the streets subconsciously peered at them in stupefaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What a crafty man, Gu Changge!&#8221; Hearing that, Liu Ziyan tensed her brows as her voice remained icy and clear.  From the aspected of identities, she and Gu Changge were considered as peers, but Gu Changge didn&#8217;t seem to bear any respect for her. However, that bore no significance to her as what bothered her was whether she and the rest of the disciples would be dragged into Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Sky King Zhi Yang had his share of feuds with Gu Changge back in the Immortal Academy, after which the latter would engage him and humiliate him in front of all young prodigies and Elders, she figured the grudge between them wouldn&#8217;t be resolved so easily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it had been eventful recently. Now that Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s matter stirred up great turmoil across the world and Gu Changge declaring that he would be helping Qing Feng save his sister, Liu Ziyan could already guess Gu Changge&#8217;s motive, given how he would send his men to invite the disciples of Purple Mansion over for tea. Undoubtedly, it was a deceitful means to draw them into confinement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saintess Zhi Yan, please! Young Master has prepared a tea party and he is awaiting your arrival. Also, Young Master told me to relay that as he is injured, his service may prove flawed, and he hopes that you won&#8217;t be disaffected,&#8221; Wang Zhong then said courteously, yet his words carried intimidation as he was no longer trying to conceal his menace. If Liu Zi Yang dared to reject the invitation, he, along with the followers behind him, would subdue her and the rest at once.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, Liu Ziyan was so enraged that her body trembled as she gritted her teeth. &#8220;How kind-hearted Young Master Changge is!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being critically injured, Gu Changge remained an irresistible threat to Liu Ziyan. Besides, he was pretty clear with his order that if anyone dared to reject him, he would order his men to subdue everyone in the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon such an aggressive attitude, Liu Ziyan was vexed and frustrated, yet she could do nothing about it. Even the disciples behind her were extremely terrified as their faces paled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the young prodigies before them were Gu Changge&#8217;s followers that were feared by every single soul in Black Tortoise Empire. Even the Elders who came to control the situation dared not to upset Gu Changge as the man could still dominate the world in spite of his grave injuries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very well. Have Young Master Changge wait for a little bit and I will be there soon.&#8221; After taking a deep breath, Liu Ziyan calmed himself down and answered Wang Zhong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sky King Zhi Yang was an ancient monstrosity, and judging by seniority, he would be further up on the ancestry tree than her own Ancestors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liu Ziyan did not believe that Sky King Zhi Yang would pull off such evil deeds as she was once under his guidance, and thanks to that, she managed to learn an ancient technique that cultivators of great years and experience would not be able to understand. She also once listened to him discussing his ambitions and passions, hence she was reluctant to believe that he was working with the Successor of Demonic Arts to kidnap Qing Xiaoyi.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Perhaps there is a misunderstanding, Saintess Zhi Yan. Young Master mentioned that you are to go see him immedaitely. His time is precious and shouldn&#8217;t be wasted on such a trivial matter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, upon Wang Zhong&#8217;s response, Liu Ziyan&#8217;s entire body froze as immense embarrassment and fury arose in her heart, as only a person of utmost dominance and aggression would say such a thing. It was as if Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t at all trying to hide his condescension and indifference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the rest of the disciples of Purple Mansion were also infuriated, they could only feel so without venting it, not daring to speak a word.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, scorn flashed across the eyes of Wang Zhong and his peers. [Will they still be able to act this way in front of Young Master?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very well. We shall go right away!&#8221; Then, Liu Ziyan clenched her teeth as she forced herself to cool down. It was the first time in her life that she was overwhelmed by such helplessness and humiliation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, Liu Ziyan and the rest quickly departed and hurried towards the palace Gu Changge was staying in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they eventually arrived, Wang Zhong led them into the palace and they finally got to meet the man who invited them over for some tea, Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, why can’t you go easy on me… You&#8217;re always so heartless…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the palace, a duo was sitting facing each other with a set of chess between them. A graceful woman was visibly annoyed as she looked at the inky doodles on her snowy face, while the man opposite her donned a white robe and a pair of white socks. His hair was untied and his gaze was leisurely, seemingly unaware of his surroundings as if he didn&#8217;t just arrange everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, his pupils moved to the side and he chuckled upon realisation. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re here, Saintess Zhi Yan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Qingge, go prepare some tea. My important guests shan&#8217;t wait for too long.&#8221;</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the ancient battlefield, mist shrouded the area.As the terrifying
                breaths were heard, it caused everyone&#8217;s hearts to palpitate as they trembled.</span><span
                id="more-30506"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sky Deer Goddess was dressed in white and her silky smooth hair shone
                with luster, but when she made her move, she did not have any mercy or hesitance. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Swish!* As her sword energy rained down on her opponent, with a
                controlled force that would not endanger their life. It was enough to cause Chen Suyun to grunt and
                cough up blood. Every technique that she used resulted in an explosion. Even someone in the
                Quasi-Nirvana Realm, who had spent their whole life cultivating, showed signs of breaking
                apart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there was such a large gap between them, there was no suspense to be
                expected in this battle.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the battlefield were all of the disciples as they looked at the scene
                with shock followed by anger. They never expected that their Eldest Senior Sister would lose the battle
                so quickly, likewise, they never thought that despite the Sky Deer Goddess’s saintly appearance, she was
                so ruthless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had it been someone else battling against the Sky Deer Goddess, the person
                would have been blown into pieces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no stopping the Sky Deer Goddess unless the Mountain Elders stepped
                in to mediate.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mountain Elders furrowed their brows, but they remained silent as they
                turned to look at Gu Changge, who was on the other side. They couldn&#8217;t guess his identity, which
                was why they dare not offend both the Sky Deer Goddess and Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Chen Suyun was a disciple of the Nine Great Mountains, they also
                couldn&#8217;t intervene because this involved their personal grievances.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stop it! Sky Deer Goddess, as the guardian of Sky Deer City, you are
                so ruthless that you don&#8217;t even consider the relationship that former sect members have. Even
                though Eldest Senior Sister has wronged you, it has been so many years. She&#8217;s already lost. She
                has already suffered severe injuries. There&#8217;s nothing in this world that can&#8217;t be discussed.
                Sky Deer Goddess, since you are from the same sect as Eldest Senior Sister, can&#8217;t you be a bit
                more magnanimous?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Xiao Yang cried out as he saw Chen Suyun’s injuries getting
                more severe. His eyes reddened as he eventually stood up. As he frowned, he turned to Sky Deer Goddess,
                who was about to make her next move.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that Chen Suyun had wronged her and that her past actions were not
                justifiable, but Chen Suyun was still his Eldest Senior Sister. There was no way he could watch her
                being tortured like this.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eldest Senior Sister isn&#8217;t even the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;
                opponent. She&#8217;s being too much of a bully by tormenting Eldest Senior Sister just because she is
                stronger in cultivation…&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right; by coming to the Nine Great Mountains and bullying
                others, it&#8217;s obvious that she doesn&#8217;t respect us.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure how our Mountain Elders feel about allowing someone
                like the Sky Deer Goddess to disrespect the Nine Great Mountain like this.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they heard what Xiao Yang said, many disciples expressed their
                anger.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many disciples were in awe of Chen Suyun, and looked up to her. Now that she
                was in such a miserable state, they couldn&#8217;t bear such a sight.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While on the Golden Rune, Gu Changge watched the battle with great interest
                but had no intention of getting involved. Judging from the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217; capabilities, it
                would be easy for her to resolve her grievances.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same could not be said for Xiao Yang&#8217;s attitude, which caused Gu
                Changge to narrow his eyes. It was the typical behavior of a Fortuitous One, thinking that they were at
                the center of the world and perfect in the eyes of others.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A nice description of such behavior is that he lacks an understanding of the
                times, while a more negative description is that he is just a plain hypocrite. Still, that kind of
                personality is the easiest to manipulate.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What a foolish person.&#8221; Gu Wudi coldly laughed in his attire as
                he looked at the crowd. Then, his gaze fell on Gu Changge, who had a calm and indifferent expression,
                which frightened Gu Wudi.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that Gu Changge&#8217;s purpose for coming to Nine Great Mountains
                was not to assist the Sky Deer Goddess in her quest for revenge but rather to destroy this place. [Those
                fools. They think that they are clever, but they don&#8217;t know their peace will be
                short-lived.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And you are advising me to be magnanimous?&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, it was as though the Sky Deer Goddess had finally heard Xiao
                Yang. There was a slight smile on her immaculate face as she stopped and turned to face him to respond,
                &#8220;It looks like you know what she did back then?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t know why, but he hated that smile of hers. It was as if she
                was mocking him, but he frowned. Then, he solemnly answered, &#8220;Even if I know, so what?
                Aren&#8217;t you alive and well now? Don&#8217;t tell me you really want to kill your own Senior
                Sister?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his eyes, what happened in the past had already happened. Chen Suyun had
                wronged Sky Deer Goddess, but she was still their Senior Sister. Moreover, since she regretted her
                actions back then, she should be given a chance to repent and turn over a new leaf.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yeah? What can you do if I were to kill her?&#8221; Sky Deer
                Goddess laughed with a voice that left others breathless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221; Xiao Yang had a cold expression and was about to
                speak.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen Suyun, who was covered in blood, swallowed a few pills. After which, she
                radiated with a divine glow as she began to recover from her injuries. She waved and said, &#8220;Junior
                Brother, you don&#8217;t need to worry about me. This grudge is between the two of us, and she
                doesn&#8217;t intend to forgive me. It can be considered as my punishment.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I were to forgive you, who is going to avenge Master?&#8221; The
                Sky Deer Goddess still had a faint smile, which made it difficult for people to guess her true
                emotions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen Suyun looked ashamed as she answered, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t intend to
                harm Master back then…&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But Master is already dead. I promised her that I would protect Sky
                Deer City well and let go of my grudge against you. I&#8217;ve kept my promise, but I can&#8217;t let go
                of Master&#8217;s hatred…&#8221; Sky Deer Goddess shook her head and maintained her expression.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen Suyun was stunned when she heard that but continued speaking with a
                bitter smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ve wronged both Master and you. Make your move. If this can settle the
                grudges between us, consider it a relief for the both of us. I can understand if you can&#8217;t forgive
                me since I was jealous of you… and how Master always dotes on you&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Does it even matter now for you to say all of this?&#8221; The Sky
                Deer Goddess shook her head with a hint of mockery. She knew her Senior Sister well. Such words were
                merely mentioned to soften her stance, which the Sky Deer Goddess believe it to be a smart move. Had
                Chen Suyun wanted to repent for her actions, she would have left the Nine Great Mountains to pay her
                last respects to their Master.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!* Once again, the sword energy appeared again. It fell on Chen Suyun,
                which caused her to experience the kind of pain that the Sky Deer Goddess felt before. However, she
                could not feel the emotions that Sky Deer Goddess felt back then.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen Suyun continued to groan as she intended to grit her teeth and endure
                the pain, but as time passed, she could no longer bite the bullet and took out her Quasi-Nirvana Grade
                Artifact.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she faced the sword energy that Sky Deer Goddess casually unleashed, Chen
                Suyun&#8217;s Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact could not withstand the blow and soon exploded into numerous
                pieces. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disciples outside the battlefield were filled with exasperation, anger,
                and worry when they saw such a scene. They had already guessed who was in the wrong back then during
                their earlier conversation. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Xiao Yang had said, it had been so many years since the incident, so
                why couldn&#8217;t the Sky Deer Goddess allow Chen Suyun to repent?</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They couldn&#8217;t help but connect the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217; behavior to
                the rumored guardian of Sky Deer City. Now, even a Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact had been destroyed, so
                it was only a matter of time before Chen Suyun would cave in.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They subconsciously gazed at the Mountain Elders in the hopes that the
                Mountain Elders would step forward and intervene. However, except for the Second Mountain Elder
                frowning, the rest of the Mountain Elders were calm and did not react at all.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are the Mountain Elders refusing to intervene because they are afraid
                of that young man?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disciples felt a sense of unease because they suspected that something
                was not right. [Could our Eldest Senior Sister lose her life today?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like you intend to kill me, huh?&#8221; Chen Suyun coughed out
                blood as she was covered in injuries. She smiled bitterly and finally summoned a palm-sized golden
                bell.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The golden bell was accompanied by a blinding light, it grew larger in size
                with Dao energy flowing. It was obviously a Nirvana Grade Artifact that was given to her through Xiao
                Yang upon his request to the Second Mountain Elder. It was because she could not be allowed to die in
                the battle, which was why he gave it to her to safeguard her life.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only after using the Nirvana Artifact that Chen Suyun could block the
                Sky Deer Goddess&#8217; sword energy. Still, it left her feeling uncomfortable, as if she was about to
                explode into pieces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Master, who is in Heaven, will definitely not want to see you two
                fighting with each other. Can&#8217;t you understand your Master&#8217;s pain?&#8221; Xiao Yang
                couldn&#8217;t help but shout again. His expression was terrible as he clenched his fists, wishing that
                he could step forward and help Chen Suyun in person.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what he said had offended the Sky Deer Goddess. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She never intended to be serious, but there was a sense of coldness in her
                eyes too. When her aura raged, a single ray was enough to change the world and emerge from the ancient
                battlefield. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arrays near them could not even resist such an attack as it aimed
                straight for Xiao Yang.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area within the vicinity also swayed, as if the place was about to
                collapse as a result of this energy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disciples were horrified as they paled with panic. This was the rage of a
                True Daoist. If they hadn&#8217;t been at a location that was protected, its energy would have spread to
                a distance thousands of kilometres away.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221; Xiao Yang never expected that the Sky Deer Goddess would
                attack him in front of the Mountain Elders, making his expression turn ugly.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, he was not worried because the Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s Master
                was behind him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft wind blew the next moment and carried the gentlest Yin and Yang energy
                to calm the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217; attack. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xiao Yang, don&#8217;t interfere.&#8221; The Second Mountain Elder
                finally made his move to wave his sleeve to cause a blur in the void. Then, he appeared outside the
                ancient battleship to block the effects of the battle.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, she is really going to kill Eldest Senior Sister.&#8221; Xiao
                Yang frowned because he was unwilling to witness the tragedy befalling his Eldest Senior Sister.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Second Mountain Elder, are you really going to intervene?&#8221; At that
                moment when the Second Mountain Elder took the initiative to move, a faint voice suddenly emerged from
                the universe.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Golden Rune came forward and landed in front of him. It was Gu Changge
                walking out with calmness and composure.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time that the disciples of the Nine Great Mountains heard
                him speaking, and they almost held their breaths as they felt that the atmosphere became tense.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This young man, who looked like a banished Immortal, had a terrifying aura
                that seemed endless, which made it impossible for anyone to look at him. Even if there were several
                Mountain Elders in front of him, they still felt overwhelmed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this sight, the Third Mountain Elder and everyone else had flickering
                gazes as they turned to look with different expressions. They actually wanted to know what tricks Gu
                Changge had up his sleeves.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean? The old man is merely trying to persuade his own
                disciple not to intervene in the matter.” When he heard that, the Second Mountain Elder shook his head
                as he never intended to have a conflict with Gu Changge and chose to surrender instead.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge never intended to let the matter die down just like that.
                There was a terrifying divine light in his eyes that landed on Xiao Yang, causing his expression to
                change to one of fear. He couldn&#8217;t help but retreat as a result.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He has been interfering repeatedly, but I didn&#8217;t see you
                stopping him. Now that you sense danger on the horizon, you couldn&#8217;t resist making a move, huh?
                You two really have the same temperament.&#8221; His words did not fluctuate much as they lacked
                emotion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s expression changed slightly, after which he
                shook his head and explained, &#8220;Xiao Yang is only trying to persuade the Sky Deer Goddess to let go
                of her grudge. With his strength, how can he even interfere with her actions?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; Gu Changge looked at Xiao Yang, who met his gaze
                with determination. He suddenly smiled and spoke coldly, &#8220;Since that&#8217;s the case, what if I
                persuade her to let go of her hatred?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over at the ancient battlefield, the Sky Deer Goddess stopped her attacks on
                Chen Suyu the moment Gu Changge appeared. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was waiting for his command. It could be observed that whatever happened
                today was part of his plan. As such, she was the least surprised. &#8220;I will follow what Changge
                says.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this, she emerged from the battlefield with a smile and a bloodied Chen
                Suyun, but Chen Suyun looked as if she had never fought with her clothes devoid of any stains. She
                looked like a Divine Lotus, and there was hardly any trace of their battle.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen Suyun&#8217;s injuries were definitely severe even though she had used a
                Nirvana Grade Artifact. In fact, her body was on the verge of breaking apart. However, since she was oin
                the Quasi-Nirvana Realm, her Qi and vitality were impressive.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time they left the ancient battlefield, she was already recovering
                from her injuries. Though there were rumbling sounds coming from within her, those were just sounds of
                her Qi and blood at work.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn&#8217;t help but smile and breathe a sigh of relief as she thought
                that today&#8217;s events were over.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was in a state of shock as they looked at the scene and for a
                moment, they couldn&#8217;t wrap their heads around what had happened. [Could it be that this is
                it?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mountain Elders frowned, unable to comprehend what kind of spirit herb Gu
                Changge was selling as they believed that the situation had become more complicated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu&#8217;s so magnanimous that it&#8217;s
                admirable,&#8221; the Second Mountain Elder commented in astonishment as he finally realised what
                happened. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He never expected Gu Changge to directly ask the Sky Deer Goddess to stop the
                attack and let go of her grudge. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also shocking that the Sky Deer Goddess followed his orders without
                questioning him, as nobody expected this.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eldest Senior Sister…&#8221; Xiao Yang never expected that the
                situation would end up like this. At first, he was stunned and subconsciously felt that Gu Changge was
                respecting their Master by doing so.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His face was full of shock as he was about to reach out to help the bloodied
                Chen Suyu.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for forgiving me, Junior Sister.&#8221; At this moment,
                there was a sense of relief and freedom on Chen Suyu&#8217;s face as she even slightly smiled.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An instant later, her smile suddenly froze while her eyes were filled with
                shock, confusion, and disbelief as she couldn&#8217;t believe what happened.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Chi!* A golden spear suddenly emerged and pierced her forehead at the speed
                of lightning. She exploded in mid-air, along with her bone fragments, turning into Bloodmist. Her soul
                was also destroyed at that moment.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now that I am being magnanimous, would you do the same?&#8221; Gu
                Changgee had a cold expression as he looked at the dumbfounded Xiao Yang and spoke up.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spear was so fast that it surpassed time and space. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Second Mountain Elder could only watch in helplessness without being
                able to trace back its source, let alone intervene.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place fell into a solemn silence at that moment while everyone looked
                shocked and in a state of disbelief. They found it hard to believe that Gu Changge had killed
                her.</span></p>

          didn&#8217;t add up. She swore she ate those things all the time, and
          it was all thanks to those products that she could gain such a
          terrifying physique. But how could there be such a stark difference
          between them?! The difference was so massive that she was green with

          ask in detail. So instead, she cussed her dear cousin, for if it

          introduce me in the meantime. That way, it wouldn&#8217;t be too

          it&#8217;d be days after then she was willing to see him.</span

          >&#8220;On second thought. I&#8217;ll join you,&#8221; Gu Xianer
          interjected with a frown, sensing something amiss. She stood up,
          seeming a little doubtful. She had a feeling An Yan approached her
          with an agenda from the very beginning, and she should watch it play
          out a little.</span

          Gu Xianer reconsidered. At that, she hurriedly got up, seemingly
          worried Gu Xianer would reconsider again.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Followingly, the two headed towards the throne, catching many
          people’s attention, whose countenance shifted subtly in response. Many
          were familiar with Gu Xianer. In fact, many prodigal damsels would
          actively befriend her in hopes of getting closer to Gu Changge. She
          was the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s little princess, and even Gu
          Changge would spoil her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >For instance, she would rebuke Gu Changge unforgivingly right in his
          face sometimes. If it were anyone else, Gu Changge would have
          undoubtedly already crushed them to dust; only Gu Xianer would dare
          behave so audaciously. And because of the relationship, many youths
          revered the young woman.

          duel with, would surrender seconds into the match, not daring to spar
          with her at all. After all, Gu Change&#8217;s protectiveness towards
          his friends and family was no secret in the Upper Realm. They
          wouldn&#8217;t even dare Gu Changge&#8217;s followers, so what more

          thing or two about An Yan.</span

          matriarch. If nothing happened, she would share a similarly venerable
          position as Gu Xianer in the Hidden An Clan. However, she had an older
          sister named An Xi, who was born from a concubine. The young woman was
          no simple character. Be it cultivation and talent or means and
          schemes, one would find her iron-willed.

          That said, she had left An Yan a handsome inheritance. Sadly, An
          Yan&#8217;s father only had his mind on cultivation and cared nothing
          for the clan&#8217;s issues, causing serious infighting among the
          Elders, whom most of An Xi had won over. There was even word that An
          Xi would send her men to give An Yan trouble every now and then and
          also seize the inheritance An Yan&#8217;s mother had left.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Moreover, the clan An Yan&#8217;s mother belonged to wasn&#8217;t as
          influential and had never concerned themselves with the young woman.
          Hence, it all resulted in An Yan&#8217;s incredibly sensitive position
          within the Hidden An Clan—having far less power than An Xi despite
          being the eldest daughter born from the wife. In fact, she was even
          more powerless than many family members of the other branches.</span

          of the Hidden An Clan.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled plainly, well aware of
          An Yan&#8217;s agenda. After all, it wasn&#8217;t his first time
          seeing a woman approach his friends and family to get to him. He would
          have no trouble finding out An Yan&#8217;s current social status if he
          really wanted to know. If it weren&#8217;t for the fact that she was
          Gu Xianer&#8217;s friend, he couldn&#8217;t be bothered to entertain
          her at all.</span

          Changge&#8217;s words, for she sensed impassiveness in his attitude,
          and it baffled her. In her head, Gu Changge supposedly wouldn&#8217;t
          hate her when she was Gu Xianer&#8217;s friend.</span

          Xianer glared displeasingly at her cousin. Though she knew An Yan
          might have approached her with a purpose, the two were still genuinely
          good friends. Especially when An Yan would tell her about her life in
          the clan, causing Gu Xianer to sympathise with her, as she thought she
          found a bit of her past self in An Yan.</span

          you&#8217;re alone all the time.&#8221; After overcoming the slight
          surprise, Gu Changge smiled and reached for Gu Xianer&#8217;s cheek,

          the young woman evaded his hand with narrow eyes.</span

          The way she saw it, Gu Changge would only say something like that
          because he adored and spoiled her to no end. Nowadays, in the Upper
          Realm, even True Daoists would be careful with their words towards Gu
          Changge, unlike Gu Xianer, who still dared to act rudely towards Gu
          Changge.</span

          to an end, and all the ancient beings and cultivators retired to their
          ancient battleships to prepare for the upcoming battle. Meanwhile, Gu
          Changge asked An Yan to stay.</span

          her cousin would tell her what she needed to know. That said, she

          quaint, yet empty palace. Cold sweat had even gathered on her back at
          that. Little did she think that Gu Changge would ask her and her alone
          to stay after the banquet.</span

          his back to An Yan, but his tone gradually turned cold towards the
          end.</span

          Xianer.</span

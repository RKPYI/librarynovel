          >Wang Zijin was blessed with impeccably delicate features, a petite
          nose, graceful eyebrows, cherry lips, inky hair that glistened, as
          well as fair skin that was as elegant as a jade. It wouldn&#8217;t be
          strange to think that she was born from the purest spiritual energy of
          the world. Whenever her eyes fluttered, she would give off a sly yet
          bewitching sensation.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, she was following Gu Changge with her arms resting
          behind her back. She seemed rather mature, yet there was something
          about her that was so appealing that made it difficult for others to
          turn away.</span

          >&#8220;Brother Gu, may I ask you a question about the Mortal
          One?&#8221; She said with a beaming smile. Although she reckoned that
          Gu Changge was holding back his urge to strangle her to death, she
          couldn&#8217;t help but enjoy the thrill.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          her question.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You may not.&#8221; In response, he naturally smiled and
          denied, after which he slowly advanced towards the crossroad,
          seemingly uninterested in entertaining her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The matter regarding the Mortal One might be hidden from the world,
          but there was no way it could be hidden from Wang Zijin. Though, Gu
          Changge never planned to hide it from everyone, since that was what he
          and Mortal Palace wanted, and he couldn&#8217;t care less about Wang
          Zijin&#8217;s opinion about it.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Not surprised by Gu Changge&#8217;s response, she retained her smile
          and replied, &#8220;Brother Gu, have you forgotten your promise to me?
          You&#8217;re in my debt, you know?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As she was speaking, she pulled out the jade pendant Gu Changge gave
          her from her robe.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Gu Changge glanced at it and revealed a troubled look,
          helplessly stating, &#8220;Oh, why would you put me on the spot, Lady
          Zijin? Yours is no easy question.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Wang Zijin then let out a sneer. &#8220;So, you are going to renege
          on your promise?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ll agree to satisfy you if your request is within my
          capabilities, but I truly can&#8217;t answer that question of
          yours,&#8221; Gu Changge answered with a helpless tone, though the
          unaffectedness in his eyes was retained.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Since you&#8217;re not going to tell me, forget it. Either
          way, you&#8217;re now the Mortal One and I am the Saintess of Mortal
          Palace. Say, we&#8217;ve surely gotten closer to each other,
          huh?&#8221; Receiving the response, Wang Zijin stopped clinging to the
          subject as she knew Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t reveal anything about
          it. Thereupon, she withdrew the jade pendant and walked closer to Gu
          Changge. Changing her tone, she smilingly going on a tangent.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Indeed. I&#8217;m looking forward to your guidance if I were
          to lead Mortal Palace in the future.&#8221; Sensing a subtle fragrance
          wafting into his nose, he smilingly replied.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s no problem. Anyway, who do you think is prettier,
          me or Saintess Chuchu?&#8221; Wang Zijin let out a chuckle and blinked
          her eyes before staring at him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In her eyes, it didn&#8217;t matter what she might obtain from the
          venture to the Ancient Divine Tomb of Godly Illusion Clan as her
          motive was to expose Gu Changge&#8217;s true self.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Go on. Keep pretending.] Thinking that, she felt as though she was
          playing with fire, and she could accidentally burn herself
          anytime.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Both you and Saintess Chuchu are talented damsels. You
          can&#8217;t expect me to compare the two of you. In my opinion
          you&#8217;re both rare treasures of the world, and you&#8217;re both
          equally invaluable.&#8221; Upon those words, Gu Changge noted with his
          usual calm face while guessing the purpose of her question.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Back when he first encountered Wang Zijin, he could sense that she
          took a distinctive interest in him, and to this day, she would
          inadvertently tease him. Back then, Gu Changge simply wanted to gain
          some Fortuity from her, which was why he played along with her, but
          eventually, finding that the returns for his efforts were less than
          desirable, he no longer had the desire to entertain her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Essentially, Wang Zijin was different from other Fortuitous Ladies.
          Not only was she a transmigrator and a member of the Immortal Wang
          Family, but she, born in the Sacred Realm, also possessed the
          Celestial Physique and Innate Unmarred Perfection.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In other words, she was destined for greatness, and her life would be
          filled with luck and fortune. Therefore, trying to acquire treasures
          or advantages from her would be difficult, which was what Gu Changge
          discovered after trying to pilfer Fortuity from her.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Furthermore, Wang Zijin&#8217;s fondness towards him was solely out
          of curiosity. As such, Gu Changge lost his interest in her. Though, it
          would be rather troublesome should he intend to deal with her, given
          how she possessed countless protective abilities as well as her
          mysterious Innate Unmarred Perfection. It would be a drag to try to
          repress her Fortuity as well, so instead of wasting his time on such a
          meaningless task, he would rather toss her aside.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Besides, Wang Zijin&#8217;s personality determined that it was
          impossible for her to become an obstacle to him. But of course, if it
          were to come to that, he would have to change his plans.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Brother Gu, does that mean you want both of us? The more the
          merrier, huh?&#8221; In response, Wang Zijin laughingly remarked with
          a tone full of mischief, as if she was a succubus who indulged in
          wreaking havoc.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Gu Changge seemed somewhat dazed, as though he
          didn&#8217;t understand what she said, after which he shook his head
          and heaved a sigh. &#8220;What do you mean, Lady Zijin? I don&#8217;t
          quite understand.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He vaguely figured out Wang Zijin&#8217;s motive, which was to assess
          the meaning behind his words. He had always tended to his matters with
          utmost confidentiality, unless he intended to let Wang Zijin in on
          something. But, she had yet to earn his trust.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Nevermind if you don&#8217;t get it. Brother Gu, I wonder what
          kind of woman is able to win your heart.&#8221; Wang Zijin
          wasn&#8217;t surprised by his answer, though accordingly, she felt
          somewhat disappointed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To others, Gu Changge had always been a polite, graceful, amiable man
          whose words were always flawless, so it wouldn&#8217;t be an easy feat
          to expose his true colours. To her, that was not a small challenge,
          but she wasn&#8217;t ready to give up yet. After all, one had to find
          joy amid all the dull cultivation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Lady Zijin, are you insinuating something?&#8221; Gu Changge
          chuckled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Subtly, Wang Zijin rolled her eyes on him. Her attempt to test himwas
          so apparent, yet Gu Changge expressed not a trace of oddity. As such,
          she began to doubt her own charm. [Am I not pretty enough? Is my body
          not glamorous enough? Am I not cute to him? Or does he only have his
          eyes on cold, ruthless women like Yue Mingkong?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that, the two chatted as they ventured to the deeper parts,
          though it was mostly Wang Zijin who initiated the conversations, while
          Gu Changge calmly tended to her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Regardless, Wang Zijin was rather curious as to why Gu Changge would
          pick this very path out of all the others. Although she thought that
          it was unlikely for Gu Changge to have chosen the wrong path, she felt
          that he must possess some abilities that helped him locate the true
          burial site of the Godly Illusion Clan.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In front of them, they detected numerous aura fluctuations. Apart
          from them, there were also some Sect Masters who selected this path.
          The group of Sect Masters possessed formidable cultivation powers, and
          the weakest among them was in the Sacred Lord Realm, being one step
          away from the Sacred King Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, battles, aura fluctuations, and plunders were
          everywhere, but Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t bothered by it as his steps
          remained steadily paced. As long as he knew Jiang Chen&#8217;s
          location, he would indubitably be able to find where Jiang Luoshen and
          the rest of the Godly Illusion Clan were, so all he had to do was go
          to them and effortlessly retrieve the Divinity Crystal.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Prior to that, he was hoping that the members of Godly Illusion Clan
          and the group of Sect Masters would get into a fight that would
          ultimately result in the fall of both parties, which he could benefit
          from without doing anything. [Well, their Sources might not be of much
          use to me right now but, better than nothing.]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, Wang Zijin was constantly paying attention to Gu
          Changge&#8217;s expression and actions, only to find him confident and
          unconcerned the entire time, in spite of the terrifying shock waves
          from the distant battles, which could bring the entire region to ruin.
          As such, she felt that everything was under his control, and she
          couldn&#8217;t help but wonder how he did all these.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the other hand, in the burial site, as Gu Changge predicted, a
          battle indeed broke out.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          Chen, Jiang Luoshen, Monk Pu Du and the rest eventually arrived at the
          burial site.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Here, Jiang Luoshen found the site, where the Prime Ancestor of her
          clan died on. Amid ambiguous lights, vague Chaos Qi was drifting and
          intertwining. Heavy and dense, it seemed to be carrying the force to
          collapse a mountain range.</span

          seemed to be floating as vast energy and frightening Divinity was
          gushing within it. Even those in the Sacred Lord Realm instinctively
          grew afraid. Facing the purple crystal before them, they could feel
          their Souls trembling.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Creation, Jiang Chen was informed of a way to retreat. Should Jiang
          Luoshen turn on him, he needed only to repeat what happened back in
          the purple mountains, where the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat
          of Creation could easily overturn the Earthly Shi and arrays of the

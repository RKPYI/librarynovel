          >Surrounded by an Immortal Mist, Gu Changge sat in the main seat of
          the palace, dressed in luxurious clothing that added to his air of
          nobility and mystery. As Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue entered, he sipped
          his drink with a leisurely smile gracing his handsome features.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Greetings, Young Master Changge.” Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue just
          looked up at Gu Changge, then cupped their fists respectfully.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Such formality is not necessary, Brother Yaoxing, Lady Chuyue.
          Please, have a seat.” Gu Changge looked at them and smiled, gesturing
          for them to sit down. Although the siblings were unsure of Gu
          Changge’s intentions for summoning them, they dared not reject his
          kindness.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the siblings settled into their seats, Yin Mei came over and
          poured fragrant wine into their bronze cups. The rich aroma of the
          wine filled the air, and hazy light swirled inside the cup, creating a
          mesmerizing display.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Yaoxing raised his wine cup in a gesture of gratitude toward Gu
          Changge before politely saying, “Thank you for the treat, Young Master
          Changge. May I inquire about the purpose of our gathering
          today?”</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sitting beside him was Ji Chuyue, wearing a flowing pale yellow
          dress. Her face glowed like the radiant moon, her delicate skin as
          smooth as porcelain and her luscious hair cascaded down her shoulders
          like a waterfall. She mirrored her brother’s actions and raised her
          cup to toast Gu Changge as well.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The two were filled with unease and visibly nervous. The age-old
          saying about being in the company of a king being akin to being in the
          presence of a tiger rang true in their minds. In Gu Changge’s
          presence, they had to carefully consider every word they spoke.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Following the Divine Rock Conference, word quickly spread that Gu
          Changge’s strength was on par with the fearsome demoness in red. It
          was widely believed that even without the aid of the treasures he had
          acquired in the treacherous Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, he could
          hold his own against any True Daoist. This news only served to deepen
          the fear Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue had toward him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“There’s no need to be so nervous, Brother Yaoxing. I have invited
          both of you here to discuss your plans in rescuing your Prime
          Ancestor.” Gu Changge smiled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing this, the two of them felt a sense of relief and became
          less nervous. Ji Chuyue let out a long exhale, but she was unable to
          comprehend why Gu Changge would go to such great lengths to assist
          their family without expecting anything in return. [Is it possible
          that he intends to resolve the Eternal Overcast crisis after rescuing
          our Prime Ancestor? Or perhaps there is another different
          reason?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“The benevolence and virtuousness of Young Master Changge will
          forever be remembered by the Ji family. Your assistance in rescuing
          our Prime Ancestor is greatly appreciated… After consulting with a few
          of our Ancestors, we have decided to commence our operation in three
          days. Our forces will convene at the base of Kun Mountain, where we
          will utilize an Artifact to open a path first.” Ji Yaoxing was
          completely transparent in sharing all the plans of their family
          without leaving out any details.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge sipped on his wine as he listened, then nodded with a
          smile. “Sounds like a solid plan. In three day’s time, I shall bring
          along strong experts from the Gu Family and do our part in rescuing
          Senior Ji Shengchu.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing this, Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue were overwhelmed with
          gratitude and raised their cups in a heartfelt toast to Gu Changge.
          Regardless of his motives, he had provided great assistance to the Ji
          family in their plan to rescue their Prime Ancestor.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Actually, I’m well aware of the potential dangers that Kun Mountain
          poses. Rushing in without proper preparation will not increase our
          chances of rescuing Senior Ji Shengchu. However, there is someone who
          could be of great assistance to us. Do you remember Jiang Chen, the
          guy who we met on Purple Mountains? He possesses the Legacy of a
          Divine Source Master, and has an innate ability to navigate through
          perilous situations. If we can locate him, he could prove to be a
          valuable asset in our upcoming operation.” Gu Changge smiled as he
          deliberately mentioned Jiang Chen to the siblings.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Yaoxing’s heart stirred at the mention of Jiang Chen. “Young
          Master Changge, this Jiang Chen that you speak of, is he the one who
          charged into the Purple Mountains back then?” he asked with a look of
          doubt on his face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Chuyue was also taken aback by Gu Changge’s sudden mention of
          Jiang Chen, and her heart filled with unease for some reason. She
          remembered Jiang Chen’s burning desire for revenge against Gu Changge
          and she actually knew that he had disguised himself as a Divine Source
          Master to work for An Xi. What worried her the most was the fact that
          her own brother had found out about Jiang Chen’s true identity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Indeed. He survived the collapse of Purple Mountains back then and
          resurfaced in the Godly Illusion Tomb, where he ruthlessly slaughtered
          numerous Sect Masters and seized the Divinity Crystal, bringing about
          a catastrophe.” Gu Changge smiled while shaking his head, succinctly
          laying the blame on Jiang Chen.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In fact, many Forces in the Upper Realm shared the same belief that
          this was precisely what transpired in the Godly Illusion Tomb. To this
          day, many people continue to search for Jiang Chen, wanting to avenge
          their fallen Sect Masters.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I understand. If we can locate this person, our chances of
          successfully rescuing our Prime Ancestor will be significantly
          improved.” Ji Yaoxing nodded solemnly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He never doubted Jiang Chen’s capability. Despite his relatively low
          level of cultivation, he had managed to eliminate numerous Sect
          Masters within the Godly Illusion Tomb. Such a display of audacity and
          skill was unparalleled, setting him apart from the average
          person.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With a smile of approval, Gu Changge nodded. “I’m glad you get my
          point, Brother Yaoxing. The key to successfully rescuing your Prime
          Ancestor lies in the hands of this Divine Source Master.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With his informants scattered throughout Dark Kun City, Ji Yaoxing
          had access to all the information he needed. If he were to
          investigate, it wouldn’t take long for him to discover that Ji Chuyue
          had recently visited Jiang Chen. From the looks of it, it was very
          likely that Ji Yaoxing already knew Jiang Chen’s true identity long
          ago.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge’s sole objective in telling Ji Yaoxing all this was to
          have him track down Jiang Chen and bring him to Kun Mountain on the
          day. To avoid any unnecessary alarm, Gu Changge had to feign ignorance
          of Jiang Chen’s identity. Otherwise, Jiang Chen might refuse to
          cooperate and this in turn, would thwart Gu Changge’s plan to take on
          the Prime Ancestor of the Ji family.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge continued talking to Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue for a little
          longer before looking a little sleepy and dismissing them with a wave
          of his hand.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“It’s high time for me to reveal the existence of the Demonic Seed I
          planted in Jiang Chen,” he mused as he watched the departing figures
          of the siblings from Ji family while tapping his wine cup on the
          table.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In terms of cultivation, Jiang Chen was far inferior to the Successor
          of Demonic Arts. Even so, that didn’t stop Gu Changge from using him
          to mislead the masses, adding more confusion to the chaos.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue bid their farewell, a somber mood
          overtook them as they made their way back home. Both of them appeared
          to have a lot on their minds.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >“Brother, are you really going to expose Jiang Chen’s identity?” Ji
          Chuyue couldn’t contain her concern any longer and asked
          worriedly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Yaoxing cast a glance at her before shaking his head. “Do you have
          a better idea? Do you truly have the heart to witness our Prime
          Ancestor suffer in Kun Mountain for the sake of a stranger?” His words
          rendered Ji Chuyue speechless, unable to find a valid argument to
          counter them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Yaoxing’s tone was cold and indifferent. “There is no room for
          further discussion. We have to give up everything for the sake of
          rescuing our Prime Ancestor, let alone this friend of yours.”</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Besides, do you believe that Gu Changge brought up this topic on a
          whim? Maybe he already discovered something.” Ji Chuyue felt a shiver
          down her spine. She couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear as she
          pondered over it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          now is follow in the footsteps of Ji Qingxuan…”</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Brother, are you suggesting that I should try to gain favor with Gu
          Changge?” Ji Chuyue’s eyes widened in disbelief. Her brother’s
          suggestion suddenly left her feeling as though she had never truly
          understood him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“This is not my idea, but Father’s. Your beauty is no less than that
          of Ji Qingxuan, and your status in the Ji family surprasses hers. Your
          qualities are far superior to hers&#8230; Alas, it is not within our
          power to make decisions in our marriage. We have no say in the
          matter.” Ji Yaoxing sighed softly as he gazed upon Ji Chuyue’s pale
          face, his heart heavy with sorrow.</span

          he will undoubtedly be a distinguished young man from another Force. I
          know you hold some affection for Jiang Chen, but he is a poor man with
          no wealth or influence. Furthermore, he even managed to offend Gu

          that this was her reality.</span

          descendants of an Ancient Immortal Race or the Successor of an
          Immortal Sect, could easily afford such luxuries. Unlike ordinary
          cultivators who had to spend their entire lives pursuing this
          lifestyle, these individuals were born into it.</span

          >“As a Divine Source Master, you could probably afford such luxuries
          if you wanted to, no?” The Young War Immortal wore a smile on his
          handsome face, golden crosses occasionally twinkled in his eyes.
          Judging from his aura, he was probably almost fully healed, despite
          the widespread belief that he was still seriously injured.</span

          where I stand very well.”

          >After downing a few more cups of wine, his face flushed. As he
          surveyed the lavish spread before him, his thoughts involuntarily
          drifted back to Xiao Ruoyin, causing his mood to plummet.</span

          >“There are plenty of fish in the sea, Ah’chen. Why do you keep
          torturing yourself with memories of her?” Niu Tian couldn’t help but
          express his concern. After the Divine Rock Conference, he had asked
          Jiang Chen about Xiao Ruoyin and gained a better understanding of the
          situation.</span

          >“Niu Tian, you don’t understand. It is only now that I realize why
          she left without hesitation. Being with Gu Changge, she can live her
          life a thousand times more luxurious than this. How could she possibly
          give that up?” Jiang Chen clenched his fists tightly as he spoke. His
          eyes were red and his voice was hoarse.</span

          >He was consumed by bitterness. Upon reflection, he understood why
          Xiao Ruoyin walked so weirdly and spoke evasively back then. It was
          foolish of him to believe that she really twisted her ankle at that
          time.</span

          >“Xiao Ruoyin doesn’t strike me as a materialistic woman.There must be
          a reason or circumstance that compels her to make such a decision.”
          Niu Tian couldn’t help but sigh when he saw Jiang Chen looking so
          heartbroken.</span

          >An Xi, who had been quiet until now, couldn’t help but show a
          peculiar expression as she began to grasp the situation. It appeared
          that Gu Changge had taken Jiang Chen’s beloved woman away from him. In
          any case, this provided An Xi with a golden opportunity to win over
          Jiang Chen.</span

          >As An Xi was about to offer words of comfort to Jiang Chen, they
          sensed a bone-chilling and murderous aura coming from outside the
          courtyard.</span

          >“Damn it! Assassins!” The Young War Immortal immediately sensed that
          something was amiss. He suddenly sprang up from his seat, his
          expression drastically changed.</span

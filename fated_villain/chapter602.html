<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why bother with such an insignificant matter, Young Master Changge? Yu Lie, why havenâ€™t you making a toast to Young Master Changge yet? If the opportunity presents itself in the future, you should seize it and learn a thing or two from Young Master Changge. The two of you are around the same age, yet the disparity is so great. Once you attain at least a tenth of what Young Master Changge possesses, I&#8217;d gladly pass down Great Yu Celestial Dynasty to you.&#8221;</span><span id="more-33847"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the primary seat, Emperor Yu regained his calm. Given that he was the ruler of a Celestial Dynasty, he needed to keep up an image. Instantly, he revealed a smile on his face as he went on a tangent, ordering Yu Lie, the Second Prince, to pay his respect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing that it was a chance to get close to Gu Changge, Yu Lie, too, feigned a humble smile and walked forward with a glass of wine in his hand upon instruction. He appeared extraordinarily dashing as every step he took was filled with grace and nobleness. His expression was completely different from the apathetic boastfulness he showed to Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, I, Yu Lie, offer you my respect.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And I to you as well, Prince Yu Lie!&#8221; Gu Changge reciprocated with a smile as he nodded. As he suddenly remembered something, he fascinatedly inquired, &#8220;Anyway, something piqued my curiosity. What kind of woman is worthy to have the younger son of the Tuo Ba Family reject Emperor Yu&#8217;s goodwill?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the crowd was dumbfounded. Everything was fine, but only until Gu Changge asked a question that evoked curiosity among the entire crowd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it pleasantly, Gu Changge said &#8216;reject Emperor Yu&#8217;s goodwill,&#8217; but if he were to express the question in a rude way, it would have been &#8216;look down on the princesses.&#8217;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu, too, was surprised. With that said, he also grew curious. If Tuo Ba Xiao Yao couldn&#8217;t give a reasonable explanation, he would have to label him as being utterly disrespectful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now that Young Master Changge mentioned it, I&#8217;m curious as well.&#8221; Emperor Yu nodded with a smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Gu Changge smilingly suggested, &#8220;How about this? If the woman that he is fond of is from the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, Your Majesty, you might as well grant them the wish and arrange a marriage for them. It could serve as an apology to him for the rashness earlier.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Emperor Yu was clueless about why Gu Changge would be so respectful to Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and was willing to apologise to him, now that Gu Changge made such a suggestion, there was no reason for him to refuse. Thereupon, he then inquired Tuo Ba Xiao Yao about it. After all, such a trivial matter should be easily settled with a few words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you think? If the woman you adore is of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, I shall decide for you two to get married,&#8221; Emperor Yu stated with utmost sternness in his gaze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge must favour the talented. He respects Tuo Ba Xiao Yao after seeing his performance in the Hunting Event.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That must be it! Rumours claim that Young Master Changge takes good care of his subordinates and is protective of his followers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How lucky. That brat has gained Young Master Changge&#8217;s respect. His first arranged marriage failed, and now he gets to have a second one!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the sight, many made guesses as they grew envious and jealous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the grin on Gu Changge&#8217;s face, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao suddenly felt the familiar chilliness all over him again. His face slightly grew distressed as he clenched his fists, knowing that Gu Changge must not bear good intentions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be it the first or second arranged marriage, they were nothing but Gu Changge&#8217;s pretence to be cordial. In reality, he was secretly trying to draw out Emperor Yu&#8217;s vexation, keeping him distant from Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. After all, Gu Changge had found out about Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s relationship with Yu Feiya, which was why he deliberately made such a suggestion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every word of Gu Changge was a blade in disguise, which was driving Tuo Ba Xiao Yao to a corner. They were detestable and underhanded. Nevertheless, they did the job..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Emperor Yu&#8217;s question, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao took a deep breath and answered, &#8220;Your Majesty, to be honest, the woman I love is none other than Princess Yu Feiya.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He admitted it boldly and directly without any intention to hide his feelings. Moreover, when he spoke those words, he even looked up at Yu Fei, but seeing her dazed expression, he couldn&#8217;t help but heave a sigh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it weren&#8217;t for Gu Changge&#8217;s scheme, he wouldn&#8217;t have confessed his feelings at this moment. Though, this could in the end work to his favour. Now that he expressed his affection right in front of everyone, he might potentially stop the marriage between Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and the Eternal Overcast Royal Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if he were to thoroughly upset Emperor Yu, and thereby foiling his numerous plans, he was left with no other choice. Gu Changge had forced his hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you mean what you say?&#8221; Emperor Yu&#8217;s face grew gloomy as his voice bore suppressed anger. He never expected that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao would claim that the woman he was in love with was Yu Feiya, the Eldest Princess. Such a claim had embarrassed the Emperor himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ministers present were also stupefied by this. They widened their eyes and were in daze for a long while.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, even Jia Luo, the Prince of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family, who had been remaining silent, peered at Tuo Ba Xiao Yao with squinted eyes. Given that he was to wed Yu Feiya, it was blatantly obvious that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was intent on taking her away from him after making such a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Yu Feiya remained silent, clutching her sleeves with her pale hands as her mind was deeply perturbed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems the relationship between Princess Feiya and the younger son of the Tuo Ba Family is more than meets the eye.&#8221; All of a sudden, Gu Changge&#8217;s somewhat surprised voice pulled Yu Feiya out from her frozen state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why do you say so, Young Master Changge?&#8221; She questioned out of bafflement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letting out a chuckle, he replied, &#8220;Given how you don&#8217;t seem surprised, you must have known of his secret from the start. Isn&#8217;t that right, Princess Feiya?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon Yu Feiya&#8217;s wordlessness, Gu Changge knew his guess was right. As he casually grinned, he then turned to Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, he was eager to see how this Fortuitous One would save himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tuo Ba Xiao Yao would be dreaming if he still wishes for the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty to be his final shield. From now on, even if the Emperor were to know about my desire to seize the Sword of World Domination from your hand, he would simply overlook it.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, you may be an exceptional talent with a limitless future, but what would that matter? In Emperor Yu&#8217;s eyes, you are no longer the recognised young prodigy but an incompetent, tactless fool. There&#8217;s no way the Emperor would start a feud with me over puny guy like you. It&#8217;s simply not worth it.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Majesty, my words cannot be any truer. The woman I love is none other than Princess Feiya.&#8221; Disregarding the glares from his surroundings, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao took a deep breath and replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Excellent, excellent. Excellent, indeed!&#8221;  Out of anger, Emperor Yu chortled and said the word &#8216;excellent&#8217; thrice. There was a vision of the world&#8217;s devastation in the golden gleam in his eyes. His terrifying aura swirled around his body, violently causing the stars in the sky to tremble. The stars uncontrollably quaked as if they were about to plummet. Frightening clouds billowed and gathered, covering the sky and the sun.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the wrath of the Emperor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, which directly affected the stars above the territory. Joy, sorrow, despairâ€”all sorts of emotions were directly interconnected to the Fortuity of the Empire and the wonders within.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, every living being within the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty immediately raised their heads, only to find themselves stunned by the anomaly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those in the palace were also shivering. Some of them even collapsed to the ground, not daring to raise their head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Tuo Ba Yun Tian and the two young women were so shocked that their faces paled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the second time Emperor Yu was angered today, and it was even worse than anyone had imagined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite knowing that Emperor Yu&#8217;s plan to get Yu Feiya married to the Eternal Overcast Royal Family, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao shamelessly expressed his feelings. This was equivalent to a slap at Emperor Yu&#8217;s face, right in front of everyone. It was as though Tuo Ba Xiao Yao wished that Emperor Yu would revoke the marriage in his favour, which was obviously impossible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very well! Then I shall tell you. That is impossible. It is impossible for me to hand Feiya to you, so just forget it. And since you&#8217;re so determined to challenge my patienceâ€¦ Men, have Tuo Ba Xiao Yao imprisoned!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu&#8217;s face was filled with unconcealable exasperation. At once, he yelled as he raised his hand, commanding the guards outside the palace to send Tuo Ba Xiao Yao to prison.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having foreseen such an outcome, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao wasn&#8217;t at all surprised. Instead, he seemed extremely calm. Though, when he turned to Gu Changge, his eyes were filled with immense abhorrence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiftly, the guards marched into the palace with Heavenly Swords and Heavenly Blades in their hands, they took Tuo Ba Xiao Yao away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Tuo Ba Yun Tian and the rest could only witness the event with their blanched faces, not daring to speak a word, let alone standing up to stop Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s imprisonment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other ministers also felt helpless. Tuo Ba Xiao Yao could have peacefully remained one of the greatest young prodigy, yet he was turned into a prisoner in a flash. Still, they believed that he drew such a consequence upon himself.</span></p>

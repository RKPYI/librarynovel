          glimpse of the Chaos Purple Scripture, knowing Gu Changge, he would

          worried about the Shen Family&#8217;s fate, but as she mulled over it,
          she grew to believe that the man had other motives. No way would Gu

          who had fallen would spread out or dissipate into the vast world. Most
          would linger at the Boundary Marker Sea, then eventually gather here.
          With time, a Sanctuary of Resurrection like this was formed, and
          legend has it that the deepest part of the sanctuary was the Ten
          Thousand Immortals Altar.</span

          each other?&#8221; The War Immortal&#8217;s cold and raging voice came
          from inside the coffin. He couldn&#8217;t believe Gu Changge would be
          so relentless as to come all the way here, sparing no mercy.</span

          towards the coffin. For a moment, a terrifying wave rippled through
          the space.

          Immortal&#8217;s body to roll out instantly.</span

          mouth. His current state looked beyond hideous. There wasn&#8217;t a
          single piece of his flesh safe from being rotten, and he was covered
          in green fur so long that it was arm&#8217;s length.</span

          waste of this sweet Sanctuary of Resurrection.&#8221; Gu Changge, on
          the other hand, wasn&#8217;t surprised at all.</span

          >It was apparent that the War Immortal was in a state of
          transformation, just that he still had a long way to go. However, he
          wouldn&#8217;t be able to achieve it even if he was given another few
          million years, and he&#8217;d be left defenceless at this stage.</span

          this if I was at my peak!&#8221; The War Immortal was furious.
          However, he was now but rotting flesh and bones. As much as his mind
          was still working, his body couldn&#8217;t move an inch.</span

          Resurrection in the first place, and the War Immortal&#8217;s current
          state to him was nothing more than experience points now. Hence, he
          couldn&#8217;t be bothered to entertain the walking dead.</span

          Fortuity before that. However, after doing all that, he ignored the
          System notification that had popped up in his head as well as the Gold
          Fortuity Chest that had dropped out. Instead, he continued to

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was certainly a dark, catastrophic day for all beings of the Profound Sword World. Nothing but despair and wails stretched across the Thirteen States as countless cultivators wept bitterly. Blood and fire spread, the earth split, waters receded, and the sun and moon lost their shine as vast and terrifying turbulence covered all the way till the edge of the world.</span><span id="more-34812"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place was nothing but a blur. One could only hear distant roars of anger and disintegrating chaotic light.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!* The area crumbled in the end. A massive chunk of the sky fell apart as multicoloured fires burned ablaze like the legendary </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domain of Eternal Fire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could burn everything to ashes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the catastrophe, an azure, large, horrific hand wreathed with devastating Principles reached out from the edge of the world to capture the sentient beings of this world. With its touch, countless perished and disappeared, ceasing to exist with no hope of reincarnation. Even the Earth Sword Immortals were fragile as glass, and vaporise in an instant under it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the revival of the World&#8217;s Will, which also wielded the Heavenly Dao, it attempted to destroy all life from this world, to achieve Absolute Detachment and a chance to Transcend. However, such a terrifying world-destructing existence ended up being torn asunder by a halberd, making it bleed black blood that looked beyond horrifying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, countless watched the scene with trepidation as though they were looking at a miracle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s Dharma Body appeared between heaven and earth, spanning kilometres. Even his strands of hair were larger than the stars. Vast Chaos Qi also enveloped his body, giving him the appearance of a legendary God of Creation that cut through the chaos.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment he reached for the rift, countless restrictions and barriers of space instantly shattered. It reached into a different dimension.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Found you. Until when are you going to stay hidden?&#8221; Gu Changge entered impassively. He was confident the battle would come to an end very soon, despite the fact that the World&#8217;s Will escaped his hunt and hid in a different dimension. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He eventually located its true body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it could resist, such resistance was futile as what was eventual would still occur.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You and I hold no grudges, so why do you keep hunting me down!?&#8221; questioned the World&#8217;s Will as it stood within the dark edge of the world in its true appearance. It was an incredibly burly man with raven-black hair.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frost and mercilessness enveloped his bloody eyes as light from karma wreathed around his body. An auspicious iridescent cloud shrouded him before transforming into an iridescent armour that covered his entire body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The endless golden light of karma that wreathed his body framed him as the lord of this world, worshipped by many as he floated blurrily in the air as though standing above the endless divine light.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To think the likes of you are entitled to the light of karma. How ironic. And you said I hunted you down? Weren’t you the one who attacked me first?&#8221; Gu Changge said with a chuckle as he approached the World&#8217;s Will, his footsteps ringing, overlapping in the dim space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wielded the Eight Barren Demon Halberd, and wherever the weapon grazed, space crumbled while World Principles shattered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His aura was incredibly terrifying, so much so that the space overloaded and began crumbling while all World Principles vanished.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just who are you?&#8221; asked the World&#8217;s Will impassively with a hint of dread in his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s powers had exceeded what he could fathom. While his powers reached the likes of Remnant Immortals, he was still overwhelmed in a battle against Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was how Gu Changge could locate his true body and come at him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when he thought he could absolutely detach himself from the world, transcend and reshape his true form right after awakening, at that last step, Gu Changge showed up out of the blue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To him, even the True Daoists of the Upper Realm were nothing, yet Gu Changge was beyond troublesome. Be it his origin or powers, they were all fathomless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter who I am. Hand over the World Source, and I might spare you a quick death,&#8221; Said Gu Changge plainly with a smirk as he approached the World&#8217;s Will, intending to devour it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space rumbled the next second, creating multiple ripples as a terrifying storm attacked, all while a black mist filled with complex and chaotic black-hole-like energy enveloped the entire place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just who the hell are you?&#8221; reiterated the World&#8217;s Will as his countenance shifted as he had sensed an immense threat. It wasn&#8217;t just Gu Changge&#8217;s powers; the man himself, his sole existence made him feel fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like I said, it doesn&#8217;t matter who I am. Hand over the World Source if you know what&#8217;s best for you,&#8221; Gu Changge demanded plainly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a buzz, a vast, endless dark light fell and obscured the place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grand Flask emerged. Though it was only the size of Gu Changge&#8217;s palm, countless Divine Principles floated and sank within it, interweaving before turning into a black hole as a plethora of galaxies converged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World&#8217;s Will sensed immense danger from the palm-sized flask, which was seemingly the most terrifying object in the whole universe, which could even swallow him whole.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He dared not delay as a Pool of Principles emerged next to him. In it, silver lightning danced and transformed into a True Dragon, Celestial Phoenix, Black Tortoise, and White Tiger that pierced through the sky to attack Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge merely sliced through the air with the Eight Barren Demon Halberd in his hand. However, that alone was seemingly enough to obliterate this entire world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Principles crumbled like eggs hitting rocks. They exploded and turned to dust in an instant. Even the Pool of Principles disintegrated instantly, overwhelmed by the power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah!&#8221; As the World&#8217;s Will roared, his iridescent armour glowed brightly, and his black hair danced in the air. He knew he had to attack, or he&#8217;d be devoured by that mysterious object sooner or later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The energy in this place turned even more terrifying. It was as though it would overturn and be reforged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge remained unfazed. A blurry worldly silhouette appeared around him, and surrounding every world were blazing silver divine flames.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the World&#8217;s Will charged at him, the silver divine flames burned even brighter, even burning down space. However, Gu Changge merely stood there, waiting for the massive black hand to attack him, having no intention of dodging.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, terrifying trembling noises rang in the air. The World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s hand, which could obliterate a True Daoist easily, only faced reverberations when attempting to hit Gu Changge. It was as if there was an invisible wall.  Not only had he failed to land a blow on the young man, but his hand bled badly, and his bones were shattered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your body…&#8221; The World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s countenance shifted as he backed up hurriedly. He realised something wasn&#8217;t right—the strength of Gu Changge&#8217;s physical body was beyond what this world could bear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like you still can&#8217;t grasp the situation well enough.&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled with zero emotions in his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World&#8217;s Will turned grim, for it was his first time feeling such grave uneasiness and scared for his life since possessing consciousness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He roared once more as terrifying Chains formed from Principles appeared around him as Dao rumbled and the heaven and earth disintegrated. Each chain seemed to wrap around an ancient world, extracting its Principles as all of them attempted to overwhelm Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tell me where the World Source is,&#8221; Gu Changge reiterated impassively as he walked towards the World&#8217;s Will in this disintegrating space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, all of the being&#8217;s attacks were absorbed by the dark light the second before they landed in front of Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was different from being indestructible. Gu Changge was absorbing and nullifying all of the World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s powers. In fact, not even Immortal Principles could be of any use in front of Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha! You&#8217;ll have to destroy this world if you want to know where its World Source is. Can you still do it now that you know about this?! The source of this world comes from its sentient beings. Only by immolating everything will it converge. You want the World Source!? Simple. Obliterate the entire Profound Sword World!&#8221; the World&#8217;s Will laughed maniacally as his true body manifested far away. His body was tattered at this point, and thick, black blood was seeping out from many parts of it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had received great damage. The power the Grand Flask exerted was far too terrifying. It was useless even when he healed his wounds by absorbing various Principles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And seeing that Gu Changge was determined to obtain the World Source, he simply revealed the truth to the young man so that the latter would finally give up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immolate the entire world… Who else but he could achieve such a feat?! After all, it sounded absolutely deranged. What was more, doing so would not only lead one to incur endless karmic hell, it would haunt them for the rest of their life. It might even harm one&#8217;s cultivation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Obliterate the entire Profound Sword World, huh?&#8221; Gu Changge furrowed his brows lightly and eased them the next second.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t doubt the World’s Will words at all. Judging from the being&#8217;s intention to obliterate the world, it was evident the only way to achieve Absolute Detachment was to immolate all sentient beings of the Profound Sword World. Moreover, the first thing the World&#8217;s Will did upon reviving was to destroy the whole world, using the sentient beings of this world as sustenance for immolation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World&#8217;s Will thought Gu Changge turned apprehensive, seeing that the latter was silenced, and he couldn&#8217;t help guffawing. &#8220;You cultivators and I are different! It&#8217;s within nature&#8217;s course that I initiate that war to destroy the world! Not only will I not incur karmic hell, but I will even obtain heavenly karma! But the likes of you will certainly feel the wrath of your actions and leave endless scourges behind once you do so. You better think twice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, Gu Changge shook his head lightly and sighed, &#8220;Looks like I&#8217;ll really have put myself in trouble if you haven&#8217;t warned me. I guess I can&#8217;t kill you anymore.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; The World&#8217;s Will bored icily into Gu Changge as an ominous feeling stirred within him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like you&#8217;ll have to be the one to initiate the catastrophe,&#8221; said Gu Changge with nothing but impassiveness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* The Grand Flask floated as it emitted rays of dark light, freezing the space over in an instant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vast and terrifying Demonic Energy surged and enveloped everything as it charged towards the World&#8217;s Will. At the same time, Gu Changge threw his hand out, causing his sleeve to billow as zillions of scarlet rays beamed, and the Sound of the Great Dao rang, forming a cage that seized the World&#8217;s Will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an intense move, vast and profound, indescribable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various Dao light and primal sounds rang throughout the space and even manifested images of the beginning of time. For a moment, the space turned blurry as various World Principles interweaved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World&#8217;s Will cast his greatest ability since awakening, wanting to defeat Gu Changge once and for all. However, after a few hundred exchanges, vast Demonic Energy seeped through and corroded the karmic light that shrouded him. Then, they transformed into galaxy-like chains and shackled his true body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how he struggled, he couldn&#8217;t break free. He was now but a lump of meat on the chopping board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You might be the World&#8217;s Will, but your true body is no different from any other  living being&#8217;s. It’s much easier for me to control it this way,&#8221; mumbled Gu Changge as his eyes glowed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darkness spread across the space behind Gu Changge as he descended to the ground like the tide and engulfed the World&#8217;s Will in two shakes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Runes shone and wreathed one another as they seeped through the chains before entering the World&#8217;s Will, like a branding that could control its very existence with just a thought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I suggest you heed my words if you don&#8217;t want to die just yet,&#8221; Gu Changge warned impassively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the World&#8217;s Will possessed the authority to control the Heavenly Dao, which allowed him to dominate the Profound Sword World. Even the Earth Sword Immortals were nothing in front of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge didn&#8217;t stop him, it was only a matter of time before all sentient beings of this world were immolated and shaped into the World Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?! You—&#8221; Chills ran down the World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s spine after hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s words as apprehension enveloped his eyes on the man. He had thought Gu Changge would give up obtaining the World Source, but who&#8217;d have thought the man intended to destroy the Profound Sword World through him so as to obtain the World Source?!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appeared that the survival of the Profound Sword World was genuinely irrelevant to Gu Changge. Moreover, the man&#8217;s schemes were far more villainous than his. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This man takes everyone as nothing but tools at his disposal!] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After subduing the World&#8217;s Will, Gu Changge wasted no more time entertaining him. He disappeared after taking a step forward as space split apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This space was still a part of the Profound Sword World; it just existed in a different dimension. However, common cultivators couldn&#8217;t detect it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end of the Profound Sword World had become inevitable at this point, and all Gu Changge had to do was wait.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No doubt the Upper Realm has figured out it was my doing when so many of their True Daoists have died. They might not say anything now, but it will certainly become troublesome after we return to the Upper Realm,&#8221; mused Gu Changge as he appeared above the Profound Sword World after leaving the space. He decided to use this chance to eradicate all issues altogether.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, he shook his head lightly while gazing at the now-ravaged world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His battle with the World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s had destroyed nearly half of the Profound Sword World, and five of the Thirteen States had sunk because of the battle, not to mention the ocean, which was totally dried up, leaving nothing but a terrifying-looking sea bed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, many living beings still survived. Hence, it wouldn&#8217;t affect the immolation greatly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Voom!* Gu Changge disappeared from the spot again after taking a step forward, making his way to where the ancient battleships were anchored.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He deliberately let the Abundance Sword Immortal and the other Earth Sword Immortals out of the Ancient Arcane Ruins, so as to provide himself with an excuse against the Forces of the Upper Realm who had arrived in this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, those Forces could still deduce it was he who killed the True Daoists, even if he had silenced all the Earth Sword Immortals while in the ruins.</span></p>

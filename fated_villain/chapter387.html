        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did they find this place?&#8221; Jiang Luoshen was obviously
                perturbed. With the tremendous number of crossroads along this path, she thought it would take a huge
                deal of effort and luck for others to find the real tomb, yet so many various Sect Masters had suddenly
                showed up.</span><span id="more-29566"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They must have split up and covered every crossroads before making it
                in here. How lucky of them to have found this place by coincidence, and the fact I helped remove the
                restrictions and arrays of this region gave them the upperhand.&#8217; The golden-haired old woman
                beside Jiang Luoshen dully stated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, she stood out and displayed her greatest strength as the
                might of the Sacred King Realm burst out, leaving those Sect Masters stunned. As Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s
                protector and pillar of strength, she naturally possessed unrivalled might.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hold them off while I retrieve the Divinity Crystal.&#8221; Shooting
                the Sect Masters a cold glance, Jiang Luoshen began to leg it as she cast a golden beam and charged
                straight towards the platform.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the members of the Godly Illusion Clan kept their guards up
                against their surroundings in fear that other parties might suddenly intervene.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is the Divinity Crystal of the Prime Ancestor of the Godly
                Illusion Clan. Once we get our hands on it, we shall distribute it equally among us. How does that
                sound?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sect Masters who barged in enthusiastically leered at the purple crystal,
                sensing the vast aura and energy it was emitting. If they could absorb the purple crystal, they would
                undoubtedly receive an enormous boost to their cultivation and they might even break through the
                bottleneck and reach the Sacred King Realm, which had been frustrating them for years.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, the other Sect Masters expressed their consent. Essentially
                the Divinity Crystal was as big as a fist, but it would still remain as an excellent treasure even if
                they were to divide one tiny chunk among themselves, which would still make their journey here more than
                worth it. To them, although the golden-haired woman was in the Sacred King Realm, there was no way she
                could take all of them on at the same time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess, I can only hold them off for a while. Please retrieve the
                Divinity Crystal of the Prime Ancestor at once, and I&#8217;ll be with you as soon as I find an
                opportunity to flee,&#8221; the golden-haired old woman said to Jiang Luoshen as a gigantic golden tower
                appeared in her hand.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filled with golden light, the gigantic golden tower harboured nine floors,
                resembling a golden blinding sun that shed its glaring rays upon the lands of the world. Upon the
                eruption of the might of the Sacred King Realm, thundering sounds reverberated, as though all disastrous
                calamities of the world happened in one instant.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is no way you can fend us off, so be wise and surrender the
                Divinity Crystal. Do not be rash, or blame us not if it means the annihilation of you lot,&#8221; The
                four Sect Masters before them stated with an apathetic expression and immediately drew their
                hands.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, intertwining, terrifying Order Divine Chains were summoned, as if
                the starry skies exploded upon the frightening burst of overloading energy. Failing to contain the
                shockwave, the air seemed to be tearing apart as the Sect Masters immediately cast peerless divine
                abilities. If it weren&#8217;t for the special arrays in this region, the site where the Prime Ancestor
                of Godly Illusion Clan had died, everything would have crumbled into a pile of ruins.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, a terrorizing battle broke out. Be it the golden-haired old
                woman or the four Sect Masters, they displayed their most powerful abilities, and the martial exchange
                of such a level instantaneously brought their surroundings to destruction.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Jiang Chen could feel his legs weakening as suffocating dread
                engulfed him. Compared to the formidable cultivators before him, he, given his strength, was nothing but
                an ant.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If things go down bad, I&#8217;ll have to run away.] As he was communicating
                with the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation, he anxiously glanced at Jiang Luoshen, who
                was currently his greatest insurance. If she were to fall at this moment, there was no way the Sect
                Masters would allow him to live.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kind Sir Jiang, perhaps we should take the opportunityâ€¦&#8221; At that
                moment, the face of Monk Pu Du also blanched. He assumed the Godly Illusion was sufficient, but the
                sudden siege of the four Sect Masters would clearly overwhelm them very soon. Although the rest of the
                Clan members were by no means weak, there was no way they could take on four powerful Sect
                Masters.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is the platform where the Prime Ancestor died preventing me from
                proceeding? What is wrong with this array?&#8221; All of a sudden, Jiang Luoshen spoke, seemingly
                perturbed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she speedily approached the platform, a waft of golden mist followed by
                the emergence of a massive strange fluctuation stopped her from advancing any closer as the array within
                was awakened upon her touch. Nonetheless, the aura supposedly belonged to the Prime Ancestor of her
                Clan. Yet, it was stopping her from passing through.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jiang Chen, what is going on?&#8221; Jiang Luoshen turned to Jiang
                Chen and coldly asked as she noticed his intention to flee.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That should be an array left behind to prohibit anyone from acquiring
                the Divinity Crystal after the Prime Ancestor&#8217;s death. It&#8217;ll take some time to
                dispel.&#8221; Jiang Chen felt numbness in his head as his soul shivered when he was glared at by Jiang
                Luoshen. If she intended to kill him now, there was no way he could escape given his
                capabilities.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you fail to remove the array, you won&#8217;t be walking out of
                here alive today,&#8221; Jiang Luoshen menacingly threatened.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cursing in his heart, Jiang Chen was left with no choice but to endure and
                bear through the terrifying disturbance. Given his capabilities, he would unquestionably be unable to
                dispel the array, but if the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation were to be given some
                time, it should be able to pull it off.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right at that moment, the golden-haired old woman, who was battling the four
                Sect Masters, spewed a mouthful of blood as she fell from the air. Her hair was messily swaying as she
                was miserably covered in blood. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she was in the Sacred King Realm, she didn&#8217;t attain her
                cultivation level by decent means, so she was unable to overcome a true Master in the Sacred King Realm,
                let alone the fact that there were four Sect Masters before her. Each possessed absolute strength, and
                were unparalleled young prodigies who conquered the world during their youth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, she was able to resist them, but as time went by, her strength
                gradually diminished.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aunt Jin!&#8221; Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s face drastically changed as she
                gritted her white porcelain teeth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the golden-haired old woman shook her head and consumed a pill
                before getting back up and rushed back at her enemies. Her entire body was glowing, covered in golden
                gleams as she conjured a weapon during her charge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Jiang Luoshen grew even more restless. If the Grand Elder
                hadn&#8217;t been murdered by Gu Changge, she wouldn&#8217;t have to be so desperate, needing the
                golden-haired old woman to buy time for her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How much longer will you be able to resist? You&#8217;ll only burden
                yourself trying to resist. Be good and surrender the Divinity Crystal. That way, you&#8217;ll still make
                it through the day,&#8221; the four Sect Masters coldly stated as they drew a gigantic palm that landed
                on the golden-haired old woman, inflicting severe injuries on her and causing her to cough up more
                blood. They were simply too powerful to deal with. Although they had yet to reach the Sacred King Realm,
                their battle power was not too far apart, and given that they were working hand-in-hand, they proved to
                be peerless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Go! Help delay them!&#8221; As Jiang Luoshen furiously gazed at the
                four Sect Masters, she commanded her followers to hold their enemies off. &#8220;Jiang Chen, you better
                act fast!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon receiving their orders, the formidable cultivators of the Godly Illusion
                Clan, too, charged forward without any hesitation as they conjured artifacts of their own and exhibited
                their ultimate abilities. Alas, their effort proved to be futile as they were instantly driven back,
                spewing blood, and some of them even disintegrating from the devastating explosion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon that sight, Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s face grew even more hideous as she
                clenched her delicate fists. Although she still held other methods in her hand, those were only for
                contingency purposes to save her own life. She admitted that she had been rash. If only she had brought
                more men, she wouldn&#8217;t have been put in such an egregious situation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good, the array has been removed!&#8221; Jiang Chen&#8217;s voice
                sounded out of nowhere. Heaving a sigh, he wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead as the weight on his
                shoulders was relieved.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the flash of light in his hand, the array before him began to crack
                open before turning into fragments. Due to this, the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation
                spent a great deal of energy and almost fell back into deep slumber.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing the terrifying, obstructive force fading away, Jiang Luoshen let out
                a sigh of relief as she intended to get on the platform to retrieve the Divinity Crystal.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* All of a sudden, a blaring noise came from the corridor, leaving
                those in battle shocked. Even the four Sect Masters, who were attacking the golden-haired old woman,
                stopped what they were doing at that moment and turned away with a frown.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the air trembled, an immensely piercing force suddenly approached.
                Powerful fluctuations swirled apart, as though they were petals drifting in the winds, as mighty
                Principles formed a sword that penetrated the air and slashing towards those in the battle.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such an overpowered force instantly made the four Sect Masters drop their
                jaws in fear before hastily retreating, evading the blow. Nevertheless, the aftershock of the blow still
                injured them, making their blood gush out.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who&#8217;s there!&#8221; They were obviously furious, feeling like
                the phrase â€˜the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behindâ€™.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, coldness surged on Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s face, after which,
                she quickly withdrew an item from her storage ring and was on standby to activate it. The fact that
                someone else appeared right after the array on the platform was removed caused her to think that someone
                was hiding in the dark, watching how things play out the entire time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is there another party?&#8221; Jiang Chen tensed his brows tightly
                as he turned to the corridor.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Did I come at a bad time? Why are you staring at
                me this way?&#8221; The next moment, upon a soft chuckle, the figures of a man and a woman appeared at
                the entrance of the corridor. There was a sword energy flashing on the man&#8217;s hand, instilling fear
                in all as though it was the end of the world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changgeâ€¦&#8221; Jiang Luoshen exasperatedly glared at the
                approaching young man with her golden eyes that were filled with unconcealable abhorrence and
                shock.</span></p>

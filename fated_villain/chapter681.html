        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Blue Flood Ancient World was considered famous among countless Lower Realms worlds as it was ranked thirteenth in terms of strength. Still, it was insignificant compared to any of the Ancient Royal Clans of the Upper Realm, and in fact, the idea of comparing the two of them was simply absurd.</span><span id="more-36144"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the young disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans each represented more than just their respective clan, and they were a force that terrorised every cultivator on the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Vermilion Bird Hall&#8217;s situation was more peaceful as there were less feuds than in Azure Dragon Hall and White Tiger Hall, things weren&#8217;t exactly harmonious. Essentially, in the eyes of the locals, a barbaric dogs-eating-dogs culture was nothing but the norm that they were long used to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Lu Ming, Xu Yan, and the rest of Blue Flood Ancient World were blocking the way of the disciples from the Ancient Royal Clans. Such a mess wasn&#8217;t of importance to the many present.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, in the eyes of the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans, they were declaring a challenge. Even killing these puny insects that were blocking their way into the arena wouldn&#8217;t be able to cease their vexation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brother Zhao…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Ming, Xue Yan, and the rest angrily peered at their friend’s back, never expecting they would be mercilessly subdued and disintegrated into mists of blood in the blink of an eye without even managing to let out a scream.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They clench their fists, their eyes reddened and their bodies shivered in exasperation and helplessness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining young prodigies of Blue Flood Ancient World were also stunned by the unexpected scene, their faces blanched as their jaws trembled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The women lost their gracefulness as they violently shook, and the timid ones collapsed to the ground as their legs weakened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in Blue Flood Ancient World, they were highly respected youths with limitless fame, unrivalled even by their peers, and their names struck fear to all beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, now that they were in the Upper Realm, they were nothing but fragile ants whose lives were manipulated by someone else. They could be killed out of whim at any time, without the right to defend themselves. They couldn&#8217;t accept such massive degradation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damned insects. Your blood is all over my clothes! You shall join your friends as well!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans, a fierce-looking man in gold scowled at the spot of blood on his garment and his face immediately grew sullen. At once, the golden feathers of the wings on his back began to glow, each resembling divine swords that bore terrifying lights that seemed capable of tearing up the void.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cultivators that recognised him felt goosebumps all over their body as they understood that that man was a prodigy of Golden-Winged Roc Clan who possessed daunting Talents. Although he was not as strong as the Successor of his Clan, he was not to be underestimated as some older cultivators would not be confident of beating him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the other disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans walked up and surrounded those of Blue Flood Ancient World, their faces bore mockery, indifference, condescension, coldness, and even mischief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it… We won&#8217;t be able to escape now…&#8221; Upon the sight, the face of the man in scholarly robe paled as he fell onto the ground in immense fear. On the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, he was merely an insignificant individual that stood no chance against the Ancient Royal Clans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, he was thoroughly devastated, his heart filled with nothing but remorse. [Why did I give in to greed and accept the benefits, only to draw upon so much trouble? Hell, I might even die here today!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surrounding people apathetically stood afar, observing the scene as if they were watching a show, while some prominent figures were also coldly witnessing everything in the dark, not really affected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, all lives were as frail as that of weed, especially for the cultivators from the Lower Realm. Their lack of influence and power already predetermined their fate in this world as they no longer had control over their own lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are the young prodigies of the Upper Realm this quick to decide one&#8217;s fate, getting rampantly insensible solely because we accidentally got in your way?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the other young prodigies of Blue Flood Ancient World, who were now shivering in dread, Lu Ming managed to retain his sense of reason. Taking a deep breath to calm his rage, he stared intensely at the disciples of Ancient Royal Clans and sternly spoke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pressure he felt from his opponents were intimidating and dangerous, and in certain aspects, they were the most frightening foes he had ever faced in his life. He could even hear the loudly flowing blood menacingly thundering within their bodies, and such a sound left all souls trembling frantically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, there were more than one disciple from the Ancient Royal Clans, whom he couldn&#8217;t even tell whether he could take on. Prior to this, he had never fought against a member of the Ancient Royal Clans that possessed such a dense bloodline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Insect, what gives you the right to get in my way? You must be tired of living!&#8221; The man with golden feathers appeared extremely indifferent and belittling, shooting Lu Ming a disparaging gaze as he was not at all affected by his presence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, he wouldn&#8217;t put anyone from the Lower Realm in his eyes, as even the disciples of Formidable Forces were no match for him, let alone the ignorant insects from the Lower Realm. They were just bugs whom he could easily annihilate with one arm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, the other disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans coldly chortled, not even trying to conceal the mockery on their faces. In their eyes, Lu Ming and the rest were nothing but preys waiting to be slaughtered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Insufferable!&#8221; Lu Ming revealed a glower. As he took a look at his surroundings, he noticed that he was only the one among those of Blue Flood Ancient World who stood out, while the rest were panicking and trembling in restlessness, unable to muster the courage to resist the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, all of a sudden, a slightly shaky yet melodious voice sounded beside him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you really oppressing us due to our lack of power?&#8221; Gritting her teeth, Xue Yan resolutely stood out. She wore a fiery red dress, her red puffy as clouds and her slender, glamorous figure carried heroism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Junior Sister Xue Yan?&#8221; Lu Ming was taken aback, never expecting Xue Yan to join him. As such, he felt a surge of warmth flowing through his body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, those of Blue Flood Ancient World revealed ashamed faces. Regardless, given such a bleak, life-threatening situation, they were truly unable to garner the courage to stand out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, another fool who comes forth. Though, thanks to your charming guise, I might forgive you as I coincidentally need one more servant. Who would have expected such a beautiful girl to be born in the barren Lower Realm?&#8221; The man with golden feathers never expected someone else to stand up against him, staring at Xue Yan with his surprised eyes. As a matter of fact, despite having seen countless ravishing damsels, he couldn&#8217;t help but be astonished by Xue Yan, as such unmarred beauty was extraordinarily rare.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brother Jin, since you adore her this much, we shall capture her for you and you can do whatever you want to her.&#8221; In response, the other disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans laughed aloud. Casually, they marched forward, bearing no respect for Lu Ming and Xue Yan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they were conversing, one of them had iciness flash across their eyes and immediately attacked. Piercing lights swirled within his palm as glaring, vibrant Principles bloomed before charging towards Lu Ming. The formidable aura resembled a thunderous tsunami that was to engulf and suffocate the young prodigies of Blue Flood Ancient World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How powerful…&#8221; Lu Ming&#8217;s face drastically changed. Although he possessed numerous exceptional abilities and even had the help of a certain mysterious item, in that instant, he felt strenuous as a tremendous pressure with the weight of a mountain was dropped on him. Given the enormous difference in their strengths, they were evidently not of the same level.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having no time to think, Lu Ming instantly summoned a silver shield with bolts of purple lightning crackling on it. The lightning then solidified into a giant ferocious silver serpent that opened its jaw as it stormed towards the disciple of the Ancient Royal Clans who was charging at him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So this is what bugs from the Lower Realm can do, huh? How laughable!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, despite Lu Ming&#8217;s forceful attack, the disciple of the Ancient Royal Clan let out a scornful snicker, not at all bothered. He then proceeded to throw a punch, his vast Life Force erupted like a terrorising volcano and immediately blew up the void before spreading web-like cracks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Crack!* </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silver shield Lu Ming conjured was completely useless against the force of the punch. While the silver giant serpent disintegrated, his shield, overwhelmed by the attack, instantaneously crumbled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it! I&#8217;m no match for him, unless…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Lu Ming felt the terrifying gap that was difficult to overcome, his face changed drastically. Despite his desire to dispel the shockwave, his actions were too slow. Consequently, he took the punch head-on and his ribs instantly shattered while his internal organs were almost all crushed. Then, he spewed out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away like a torn sack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How disappointing. Instead of dying, he actually withstood my punch.&#8221; Seeing how the heavily injured Lu Ming was, being merely blasted away instead of exploding into a mist of blood, which he was expecting, the attacking disciple of the Ancient Royal Clan frowned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senior Lu Ming…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, Xue Yan&#8217;s face dramatically changed. Without considering whether she was a match for the opponent, she summoned a fiery red Dao Sword.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnificent brilliance emanated from the sword, as though it was the revival of a revived the God of Flames that could set all things ablaze. As she charged towards the disciple of the Ancient Royal Clan, her figure flickered became ethereal amid intertwining chilly lights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the opponent was clearly not a man of sympathy. As his gaze grew frosty, a terrifying aura, which resembled a miniature Demon God emerging, erupted. He then drew another punch and amid whirling runes, it landed on the fiery red Dao Sword before blasting it away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letting out a groan, Xue Yan vomited a mouthful of fresh blood. Like Lu Ming she was sent flying away like a withered leaf. During her miserable fall, blood spread profusely across her dress, accentuating its fieriness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Dao Sword in her hand was a rare treasure imbued with traces of the Great Dao, she couldn&#8217;t use it to its maximum potential in the face of such great disparity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How can this be…&#8221; Xue Yan coughed up more blood, her body in excruciating pain, as if her internal organs were all displaced. If it weren&#8217;t for the mysterious soft armour that she was wearing, she would have exploded into a mist of blood upon that punch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, she thoroughly experienced the terror and ruthlessness of the Upper Realm. Here, she was no longer the prodigal damsels pursued and worshipped by many, but someone even more inferior than the average cultivator.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right as Xue Yan was struggling to stand up, she suddenly widened her eyes in stupefaction, sensing something was off. The entrance of the arena and the lake not far away that were extremely merry just a second ago suddenly grew quiet—even to an uncanny extent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone that were spectating the fight instantaneously grew wordless, donning dumbfounded expressions, as though they saw something so incredible that they were put under total distress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the face of the disciple of the Ancient Royal Clan that assaulted her immediately blanched, his body shaking as he subconsciously retreated backwards before falling onto the ground with a pale face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the faces of his acquaintances of the Ancient Royal Clan similarly changed, losing all traces of blood. Some of them even fell onto their knees, stuttering, &#8220;I am sorry for getting in your way…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Perplexed, Xue Yan arduously turned over to see what was behind her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only then, she noticed a thin, elegant young woman with a snowy face standing behind her, seemingly filled with murderous intent that left everyone else shivering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And beside the thin young woman, a man in white with a hazy face stood. It was as though he was standing amid a layer of fog, making him seem like a young divine being. She could barely see his deep, serene eyes, yet they were as vast as a universe that reflected all of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From those eyes, Xue Yan saw herself as well as all beings in the world, and she was almost lost in them. The man&#8217;s cultivation level was unfathomable and indescribably frightening. Not daring to imagine it, she felt an intense chill up her spine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How dare you interrupt Young Master Gu by sending this insect over here! You deserve death!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing glacial gaze harboured overwhelming murderous intent as she glared at the attacking disciple of the Ancient Royal Clan. Her identity was no secret in the entire Vermillion Bird Hall, so it was only natural that the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans recognised her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they were no fools, they knew that the only person who Ah Qing would accompany in this Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was the person who came over yesterday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, immense regret and fear filled their hearts as they never expected that damned young woman in a red would land there, and block his way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So I blocked their way when I landed right here…] Xue Yan peered at the scene in shock as she was still thoroughly stunned, unsure of her own emotions.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the news of Gu Changge killing the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was only circulated in the Eternal Overcast Royal Family. There were plenty of people who assumed that Gu Changge had inherited powers from the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span><span id="more-32783"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was one of the reasons why Jia Luo was respectful towards Gu Changge. The Eternal Overcast Kingdom was a place where strength ruled supreme. For Gu Changge to reach this unprecedented level of strength at such a young age, it was definitely worthy of Jia Luo&#8217;s respect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the Eternal Overcast Royal Family still required the help from Gu Changge in order to construct the Reincarnation Platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Eternal Overcast Creatures, the Reincarnation Platform was extremely crucial. In fact, it even involved the birth and breeding of Eternal Overcast Creatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems like Young Master Changge already has some ties with the Eternal Overcast Royal Family before this.&#8221; Emperor Yu laughed heartily as his eyes flashed with anomaly. Had Jia Luo not mentioned this, he wouldn&#8217;t even know that Gu Changge was already acquainted with the Eternal Overcast Royal Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only Emperor Yu, it was probable that not many in the Upper Realm knew about this as well. Gu Changge had hidden this information very deeply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I coincidentally met Prince Jia Luo&#8217;s elder sister back then. We arenâ€™t that close.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If there is a change, Young Master Changge must come to our Eternal Overcast Royal Family as a guest. I think my father and sister would want to see you. When my sister first returned to the royal family, she frequently mentioned about you.&#8221; Jia Luo was also smiling and inviting Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His statement stirred up thoughts in everyone&#8217;s minds. A Princess of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom was constantly thinking about Gu Changge. Many of them even thought of romantic scenes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Prince Jia Luo&#8217;s tone of voice, his elder sister didn&#8217;t have a regular status in the Eternal Overcast Royal Family. Of course, Jia Luo was speaking like this intentionally. It was to pull a closer relationship to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His eyes had always been looking up. He didn&#8217;t put anyone else here in his eyes. In fact, it was only because of Emperor Yu&#8217;s status that Jia Luo had treated him so courteously. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After a period of time, I am indeed planning to make a trip to the Eternal Overcast Kingdom. I will have to trouble Prince Jia Luo to lead the way when the time comes.&#8221; Gu Changge responded with the same smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is definitely not a problem. If Young Master Changge is to visit, it is definitely an honor for the Eternal Overcast Kingdom.&#8221; Jia Luo revealed a pleasantly surprised expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prince of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom certainly treated Gu Changge with an entirely different attitude. Jia Luo wasn&#8217;t even so eager when treating his alliance marriage partner, Princess Yu Feiya. When watching this scene, the ministers were all in deep thoughts. They felt that Prince Jia Luo was under orders to marry her, not because he admired Princess Yu Feiya.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Elder Sister, this person is so perfunctory. If father agrees, I&#8217;m afraid you will be mistreated once you marry over.&#8221; Yu Ming might normally be loud and unruly, but he was genuinely concerned for Yu Feiya right now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Ming might be a prince, but he still couldn&#8217;t alter Emperor Yu&#8217;s decision. His second brother Yu Lie couldn&#8217;t do it either. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He might have said it in an extremely hushed voice, but the experts around were people with great cultivation. It was obvious that they could hear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu didn&#8217;t have any instructions, therefore, the ministers didn&#8217;t dare to speak. Meanwhile, Yu Feiya&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t change. She merely shook her head slightly and didn&#8217;t say anything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Luo naturally heard it too. He looked at Yu Feiya with a smile, &#8220;It is hard for me to control my excitement as I have encountered the person that I have always respected. I hope Princess Feiya doesn&#8217;t mind.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya gave a decent smile and replied, &#8220;Prince Jia Luo doesn&#8217;t have to worry, Feiya wouldn&#8217;t mind such a small matter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, Prince Jia Luo is a person of extraordinary talent. How will Feiya be mistreated if she marries over?&#8221; Emperor Yu let out a hearty laughter and was obviously in a pleasant mood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the ministers responded by agreeing, making it a very bustling scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was the only person remaining silent while he looked at Yu Feiya with a worried look that was hard to conceal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arrival of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Prince had caused the Hunting Event to end in advance. The host of the event started to announce the rankings of the participants and bestowed them their respective rewards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had exposed his strength. Although the colorful treasure tower didn&#8217;t capture how he had survived, resulting in a mystery, he still made it to the top five ranks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scarred-man&#8217;s strength was recognized by everyone and was exceptionally terrifying. Not even the imperial descendants would be able to defeat him with ease. As such, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao deserved this ranking. Even his older sister was only in the top 30.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the Hunting Event ended, many of the flying boats and ancient battleships had passed through space and returned to the Great Yu Capital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu was overjoyed and wanted to reward those with merits. He had hosted a banquet to bestow treasures and cultivation techniques to the young prodigies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the reasons for his joy was due to the fact that the Second Prince Yu Lie didn&#8217;t get assassinated, which allowed him to finally relax.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the banquet, many of the ministers were curious to find out why Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had hidden his strength until now. But they were merely interested and didn&#8217;t ask much. Instead, it was Emperor Yu who asked Yu Feiya about where she obtained the information about the assassination. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya merely said that she received some information, but didn&#8217;t know who was the one that provided it. As for why the assassins didn&#8217;t appear, she explained that it was possibly due to the additional guards that Emperor Yu assigned, causing them to give up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the ministers, including Emperor Yu could hear that Yu Feiya was trying to muddle her way through. However, Emperor Yu didn&#8217;t continue asking and shook his head with a smile. He knew that Yu Feiya was intentionally hiding something. In the face of others and especially Gu Changge, it wouldn&#8217;t be nice for him to continue this topic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge knew that Yu Feiya was the one that said that he would send assassins to kill the Second Prince, Emperor Yu wouldn&#8217;t know how to rectify the situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this banquet, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had obviously become the focal point apart from the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Prince. Many of the ministers had intentionally asked their daughters to get close to him. Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was not engaged while his father was the favored minister. With a limitless future, he naturally became a target for everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao rejected all of them. He appeared to be steady and wasn&#8217;t moved by superficial things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems like the Third Young Master of the Tuo Ba Family has great ambition. Why don&#8217;t Emperor Yu make use of this opportunity to bestow a marriage proposal?&#8221; At the host seats, Gu Changge suddenly smiled and spoke to Emperor Yu after drinking his wine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When hearing the suggestion, many of the ministers were stunned, but quickly revealed envious and jealous expressions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was personally bestowing a marriage? How was Tuo Ba Xiao Yao worthy? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Tuo Ba Yun Tian was excited and flattered. In his opinion, for Gu Changge to propose a marriage for his son, it meant that Gu Changge valued his son. If Tuo Ba Xiao Yao could enter the eyes of Gu Changge, it was definitely a good thing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s expression was stiff and awful. The wine cup in his hand had also frozen up and was very unnatural. He had a bad premonition in his heart. Gu Change definitely didn&#8217;t have a good intention for him to bestow a marriage. Things weren&#8217;t as simple as it looked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, Young Master Changge is right. Such a young prodigy is naturally worthy for this emperor&#8217;s daughters. This is indeed a great opportunity.&#8221; Emperor Yu laughed heartily. Before Gu Changge had mentioned this, he had actually thought of it already.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After sizing up Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, he involuntarily let out a look of appreciation. He was planning to choose one of the princesses to engage with Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>

          terrifying Demonic Energy here in his hand. None of the arrays on the
          ground fazed him as he sped his way through. Although he was walking,

          many forces. When the time came, there would definitely be many
          experts who would come to rebuild the seal to prevent the demoness

          She didn&#8217;t know what Chosen Monk Jin Chan&#8217;s intention was.
          To her, that Zen Robe was something that could provide her with a
          little warmth in the dark underground. It was only when she was close
          to that Zen Robe that she could feel a sense of peace. However, she
          never understood what this emotion was. All she knew was that the Zen
          Robe was helpful to her, but the person in front of her now wanted to
          take it away.</span

          glaring hostility appeared in her befuddled eyes, and it even turned
          cold and indifferent as she saw red. Immediately, something startling
          happened in the Demon-Burying Abyss again, the terrifying malic
          covered the sky, and many stars and continents outside trembled like
          they were about to fall. Countless cultivators and Ox Spirits were

          In his previous life, it was because of sympathy that he messed up his
          Buddha Heart by stealing the Buddhist Mountain&#8217;s most valuable
          treasure, the Zen Robe, to try to expel her demonic nature. But the
          moment he was about to approach her, she pointed at the centre of his
          eyebrows and pierced through his head, killing him on the spot. For
          that reason, his Buddha Heart was more stable in this life. He only
          wanted to take the Zen Robe and leave this place without concerning
          himself with the demoness in red.</span

          erupted here. The demoness in red seemed to want to come out, but she
          had no way to resist the mighty power with the arrays under her feet.
          Even with this level of pain, her expression did not change one bit,
          and she was still trying to forcibly break out.</span

          The faces of many monks fell abruptly when they saw this. They tried
          to resist, but they ended up being blown away by the wave and coughing
          up blood. It only took a split second for them to be severely
          injured.</span

          sudden attack. As his cold eyes stared into the far distance, he saw a
          figure in a tattered black battle suit stalking over. The figure was
          glowing, but its energy was eerie. Its eyes seemed to be ablaze, and
          the figure felt as though it was dripping with prestige and power.
          Seeing the figure only further turned the monk&#8217;s face
          darker.</span

          could call their worthy opponent in the Demon-Burying Abyss. Even the
          most powerful monk Chosen Monk Jin Chan brought this time was only in
          the Sacred King Realm. The blow just now had already caused heavy
          damage. If he hadn&#8217;t dodged quickly, he might have been pierced
          by the opponent&#8217;s spear and killed right there and then.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          one of disbelief when he noticed the familiar figure behind the
          attackerâ€”Gu Changge.</span

          sort of relation Gu Changge had with the black figure. He also
          couldn&#8217;t understand what Gu Changge was up to. However, he
          didn&#8217;t notice that with the arrival of Gu Changge, the
          bewildered eyes of the demoness in red within the arrays gradually
          gained focus. Although she was still dazed and disorientated, her
          unwavering eyes were now on Gu Changge.</span

          though he hadn&#8217;t seen her. Instead, he kept staring at Chosen
          Monk Jin Chan. [As expected, she isn&#8217;t in her best state of mind
          after being sealed away for so long. Still, no matter if she is calm,
          or violent and murderous, she is not someone ordinary people could get
          close to. Her strength is so terrifying that even a True Daoist would
          not have the courage to face her. They would scamper away. I guess
          this is just how fearful she is. So feared that it seeps into
          one&#8217;s soul. But, this is good news for me.]</span

          Demoness, Chosen Monk Jin Chan?&#8221; Gu Changge lightly asked, his
          eyes falling on the Zen Robe behind Chosen Monk Jin Chan as he walked
          in its direction.

          respectfully. This was the figure who tried to surrender and follow
          him in front of the sea of blood before. With its strength, it was the
          powerful, irrefutable ruler of this place. Furthermore, in order to
          make things easier for Gu Changge, he named it Ah Da.</span

          Gu Changge had told the figure to attack him because he had
          misunderstood his intentions. Still, now wasn&#8217;t the right time

          Changge didn&#8217;t give him a chance to continue speaking. Gu
          Changge&#8217;s face was indifferent when he suddenly raised his hand
          and slapped forward. With a bang, Chosen Monk Jin Chan Buddha was sent
          flying and coughing up blood, his body almost exploding. If it
          weren&#8217;t for his Buddhist Bone emitted a faint Buddha aura around

          from the blow that almost killed him. He didn&#8217;t know if he could

          this time. With chills all over his body, he put both the

          ahead of time. This kind of event was bound to cause an uproar in the

          wear red, and would timidly tug on the hem of his clothes from his

          over her, making a sizzling sound from her body. The pain, however,
          didn&#8217;t stop her from stubbornly moving towards Gu Changge. She
          was dead-set on walking out through the seal.</span

          stopping her from moving forward. She couldn&#8217;t help the sad look
          on her face then. Gu Changge also noticed the scars on her hands from
          when she touched the arrays just now. They might have healed quickly,
          but they were still terrifying to look at.

          wanted to, he could destroy them at any time. Although it was laid by

          Even though she understood what he meant, her expression still looked
          confused. She then stretched out her fair and clean hand to test the
          arrays in front of her, but there was still a burst of brilliance that
          let out a terrifying hissing sound as a puff of green smoke appeared.

          look at her hand with a blank gaze before her eyes slowly fell on Gu
          Changge&#8217;s face again. She felt she had forgotten many things,
          but the person she was looking at used to be very important to

          might be out of sorts now, but she has another personality that wants
          to destroy me.] Gu Changge looked pensive as he fell into his
          thoughts. He had seen Chan Honyi&#8217;s other personality just now.
          If it wasn&#8217;t for the arrays here which wiped away her hostility,

          before that, he went to get the Zen Robe sealed on the top of the
          mountain. This item was effective in suppressing Chan Honyi&#8217;s

          majestic and vast force that swept in all directions. As soon as the
          Zen Robe was loosened, the countless Buddha&#8217;s images in this
          place disappeared immediately, and the Buddha&#8217;s voice permeating

          terrifying Demonic Energy suddenly soared into the sky, making it

          various forces were left frozen. It frightened them to see the red

          confusion in her eyes disappeared as coldness filled them. Even her
          pupils were dyed blood red. As her hair fluttered, the terrifying
          hostility which seemed to have been accumulated for countless years
          erupted like a mountain flood. The earth-shattering force felt like it

          would break and dissipate within half a year, and Chan Honyi would
          emerge from this place. The Zen Robe did have a miraculous effect on
          suppressing her hostility, but in conjunction with the arrays here, Gu

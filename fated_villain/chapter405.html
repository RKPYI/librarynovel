          >&#8220;Sister, I&#8217;m fine. Sorry for worrying you.&#8221; Jun Fan
          smiled and shook his head at her concerned words as if he was
          completely fine now. </span

          >Gu Changge glanced at Jun Fan with interest as he listened to the
          notification sounds from the System inside his mind. He sipped his tea
          and said neutrally, &#8220;I think Quelling Chaos King, you already
          have some clue as to the mastermind of this assassination. The Solar
          Heavenly Blade has returned, not to mention the grave of the Solar
          Demon Overlord&#8217;s son, Jun Fan, who supposedly died 6000 years
          ago is empty. So, Yao Xi suspects that Jun Bufan has merely faked his
          death and secretly plotted this in his hiding place
          somewhere.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;My guess is similar to yours too. The Night Demon is an
          important figure among the Solar Demon Overlord&#8217;s subordinates
          and is extremely powerful. No one other than the Solar
          Overlord&#8217;s descendants can make him do anything. That&#8217;s
          why I think Jun Bufan faked his death back then and had directed this
          entire operation behind the scenes.&#8221; The Quelling Chaos King
          nodded gravely.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge smiled. &#8220;Yao Xi has been searching around in the
          Demon World because of this and found some possible hiding
          places.&#8221;</span

          King&#8217;s expression shifted to shock.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Fan, who had been paying attention to Gu Changge&#8217;s
          conversation with his father, was shocked by this as well. He also
          wanted to know where Empress Yao Xi had searched. This relieved him as
          well since it seemed that she hadn&#8217;t suspected him yet.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The Solar Demon Overlord had a son and a daughter. When Jun
          Bufan faked his death 6000 years ago, his sister, Jun Ruoxi, took up
          one part of the Demon World territory after the incident and called it
          the Forbidden Area of the Demon World, despite not being involved in
          the battle. No one has dared approach all these years, and Yao Xi
          suspects that he is currently hiding out there.&#8221; Gu Changge
          smiled and continued.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >These words had nothing to do with her, of course. Yao Xi had been so
          busy investigating the young prodigies and so wouldn&#8217;t consider
          all that. He did not mind helping her a little though, since her
          hatred for Jun Bufan wasn&#8217;t deep enough to go for extreme
          measures. Similarly, Jun Bufan hadn&#8217;t looked for his sister all
          this time because he didn&#8217;t want to involve her in this, so it
          was clear they had a close relationship. However, this was also his
          weakness.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If the Solar Demon Overlord wasn&#8217;t dead, it was doubtful he
          would do nothing about his son and daughter when he realised they were
          captured by Gu Changge. [There needs to be a suitable bait to catch a
          fish, no?]</span

          >&#8220;Jun Bufan&#8217;s sister, Jun Ruoxi.&#8221; The Quelling Chaos
          King&#8217;s expression shifted once more to wariness. &#8220;May I be
          bold and assume that Empress Yao Xi wants me to lead an army there to
          clear out the place?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Fan tried to maintain his calm as he looked at Gu Changge, who
          was sitting serenely at the head of the table like a young deity.
          However, a storm raged within his heart and he felt murderous. He had
          the urge to crush the man to pieces. Never had he hated someone so
          much in both of his lives. His hatred for him even surpassed Yao Xi.
          He didn&#8217;t believe Yao Xi had said all that. It sounded more like
          Gu Changge&#8217;s own plans. The man was so cruel, that he was
          willing to use his sister as bait to draw him out!</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s true. Besides, Jun Fan&#8217;s performance at the
          peak of the Sacred Mountain was greatly praised by Yao Xi and she
          thinks he will be the champion of the Demon World. Thus, she decided
          to let the two of you go and raid the place. If you see any sign of
          Jun Bufan, that will be great, but capturing Jun Ruoxi will do just
          fine if you can&#8217;t find him.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled after
          taking a mouthful of tea.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Quelling Chaos King became serious upon hearing this and made a
          promise. &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to the Empress for favouring us. My
          son and I will never disappoint her. Fan, come here and thank the
          Empress and Young Master Changge for their kindness.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He then waved his hand as a signal for Jun Fan to approach, with a
          relieved smile on his face. No other member of the young generation in
          the Demon World had been given such a great responsibility by Empress
          Yao Xi before. If he performed well, his influence and power would
          surpass that of an army general.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Thank you, Empress and Young Master Changge, for your
          kindness. I will never disappoint you.&#8221; Jun Fan still felt cold
          hatred inside him but did not dare do anything suspicious. He walked
          forward and bowed respectfully to Gu Changge, swearing internally to
          tear this man to pieces to satisfy his anger.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If so, then I&#8217;m relieved. That&#8217;s all Yao Xi has to
          say; I&#8217;ll excuse myself now.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled at his
          words, seemingly satisfied with the Quelling Chaos King and Jun
          Fan&#8217;s attitudes. He wasn&#8217;t planning on continuing his stay
          and so prepared to leave.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Have a safe journey, Young Master Changge.&#8221; The Quelling
          Chaos King stood up to escort him.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge nodded but then paused in front of Jun Yao for a moment.
          He smiled at her sudden flustered reaction. &#8220;Is this Lady Jun
          Yao? I heard Yao Xi say that you are adept at the art of tea. If you
          have the time, I would like to learn from you.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh, Young Master Changge.&#8221; Jun Yao hadn&#8217;t expected
          Gu Changge to talk to her voluntarily or even call her by her name.
          She felt slightly dizzy and didn&#8217;t hear what he had said.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yaoâ€™er, Young Master Changge is talking to you.&#8221; The
          Quelling Chaos King was delighted at this sight and immediately
          reprimanded her, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Yao came back to herself immediately, a faint blush appearing on
          her face. She bent her head shyly, too embarrassed to look up at Gu
          Changge. &#8220;I am free any time. You can come any time you like,
          Young Master Changge.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was slightly taken aback but then smiled again. &#8220;If so,
          I&#8217;ll come to ask you regarding the art of tea after three
          days.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He did not linger any longer after that and led his cultivators away
          at once. Jun Yao&#8217;s face remained red as she watched him
          disappear, her head still a little dizzy.</span

          even knew my name! Do you think I&#8217;m dreaming?&#8221; This was
          too much of a shock to her that she wondered if she was dreaming.

          Bai Lian&#8217;er and her brother to the so-called location of the
          herb but instead returned to the palace where he usually resided. Bai
          Lian&#8217;er and Bai Hua were astounded, still stunned by what had
          transpired. No one knew Jun Fan was Jun Bufan except for them, and
          now, Gu Changge was planning to ask Jun Fan to ambush his sister. It
          was a cruel strategy.

          true identity since they were in a risky position themselves. Based on
          her intuition honed by years of managing the Nephrite Breeze Pavillion
          behind the scenes, Bai Lian&#8217;er was almost certain Gu Changge
          already knew their true identities. The things Gu Changge had said by
          the street might just be to tease them, and they nearly believed him!
          [It seems like hiding our auras, along with the jade amulet my father
          gave me, which could conceal Heavenly Secrets, had not worked at all!]

          However, she did have a burden in the form of Bai Hua and she
          couldn&#8217;t just abandon him. The only solution here was to

          >&#8220;Lian&#8217;er, save me.&#8221; Bai Hua was pale and terrified,
          coughing up blood before his bones made cracking sounds. It sounded
          like his organs were crushed as well. If not for Gu Changge
          controlling the force of the technique, he would have died on the spot
          by exploding.</span

      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s expression became pale as she glanced
          coldly at Bai Hua. If her father hadn&#8217;t assigned him to her, she
          wouldn&#8217;t even care about such a useless burden, nor would she be
          controlled by Gu Changge like this.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What do you mean by that, sir? We haven&#8217;t wronged you
          and only relied on plucking herbs to survive. We never did make any
          enemies.&#8221; She took a deep breath and continued calmly. Gu
          Changge might have already known their true identities, but she
          wasn&#8217;t going to admit that voluntarily until the end.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s good. I&#8217;ll kill him now so we can become
          enemies.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled lightly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s expression froze, not expecting him to say
          that. As the words faded, the horrifying sound of bones cracking
          filled the air and Bai Hua screamed fearfully, unable to withstand
          such torture.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Lian&#8217;er, save me!&#8221; His voice was filled with
          indescribable pain and terror.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You can&#8217;t even take such minor torture? What a loser you
          are.&#8221; Her expression was cold, but she couldn&#8217;t just watch
          him die in front of her.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She looked at Gu Changge. &#8220;Let him go or you will never get the
          thing you want. My life is worth nothing and I am unafraid of
          death.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had already disregarded her death when she founded the Nephrite
          Breeze Pavillion. An assassin&#8217;s death wasn&#8217;t determined by
          themselves; who knew if they would lose their lives while carrying out
          a mission? The responsibility her father had given her was like a
          mission and it was her choice whether she died in the process. She
          didn&#8217;t mind death anymore and left everything to fate, so she
          wasn&#8217;t afraid of his threat.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You sound reasonable. Your life is truly worth nothing to
          me.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and released Bai Hua. &#8220;Are you
          ready to prove your sincerity now?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She glared at him, her gaze unchanging. &#8220;What
          sincerity?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s simple. I hate the way you look since it makes me
          nauseated. I do have to admit you are successful in that aspect at
          least.&#8221; He shook his head.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was stunned by his reply as she hadn&#8217;t expected him to want
          that. She laughed coldly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you are such a
          frivolous man.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her appearance did change back, though. Her disguise was cunning and
          intelligent as she hadn&#8217;t only changed her physical appearance.
          Even her bones, flesh, aura, and other aspects had been remoulded
          entirely to the point that it would be hard for even a supremely
          powerful being who could see through one&#8217;s Source to notice
          anything suspicious. It was an extremely painful process and was
          considered a technique of the Killing Emperor, yet it worked as an
          effective concealment and disguise, which was hard to discern.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s better.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded, studying her
          once again. Due to her unique physique, she held a powerful ability to
          attract the favour of others. His expression did not change much
          though. &#8220;It seems that the Killing Emperor Legacy has really
          fallen into your possession. Such a concealment ability will be hard
          for even a Sacred Emperor to detect.&#8221;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So that&#8217;s your motive?&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s
          expression shifted slightly. While there had been many rumours that
          the mysterious owner of the Nephrite Breeze Pavillion had the Killing
          Emperor Legacy, they had never been confirmed.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge did not answer her question, going straight to the point.
          &#8220;I can release your father as well as make the Demon World stop
          hunting him down.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What are your conditions?&#8221; She stared at him. &#8220;If
          you keep your promise, I will obviously give the brocade bag to you.
          Otherwise, you won&#8217;t be able to get it even if you kill
          me.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No, you misunderstand me.&#8221; He waved a hand to interrupt
          her, smiling. &#8220;Compared to the bag, I&#8217;m far more
          interested in you.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She knew what he meant, of course, and began to ponder while glaring
          at him. He wasn&#8217;t worried about this, as he wanted both her and
          the brocade bag. Her abilities and leadership skills were undisputed,
          considering she had controlled the Nephrite Bronze Pavillion on her
          own for so long. Its potential might not be as superior as that of the
          older assassin guilds such as Neraka and Pagoda, but the strength it
          displayed was formidable. Besides, secretly developing an
          assassin&#8217;s guild yielded more benefits than risks for him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;How can I trust someone like you? It&#8217;s hard to
          believe.&#8221; She raised her head abruptly to stare at him coldly as
          if seeking a clear answer.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t surprised by this. &#8220;It&#8217;s not how
          you should believe me. You can only trust me now, since the survival
          of your father, your guild, and your troublesome Junior is within my
          control. Who else can you believe? Of course, you don&#8217;t have to
          care about them and it won&#8217;t be a loss for me
          anyway.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She fell silent as she began weighing the risks and benefits. Such a
          man wasn&#8217;t worth trusting but if she didn&#8217;t do so, she
          might die today while Bai Hua would definitely die. Her father would
          die as well. Besides that, the guild she had painstakingly managed for
          more than 6000 years would also soon collapse without her. But on the
          other hand, she would have to obey his orders and be used by him after
          this if she agreed. Thus, She stayed quiet for a moment and then
          nodded.</span

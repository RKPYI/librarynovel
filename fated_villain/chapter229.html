        Chapter 229-1: First let‚Äôs loot all the confidence, He thought that it
        was the third floor but it was actually the tenth floor (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "Your Master is from the Upper Realm and his knowledge and vision far
        exceeds all the cultivators in this realm. Everyone can't see your
        specialness, but he can."
      </p>
      <p>"That's why he saw at first glance that you are extraordinary."</p>
      <p>
        "And Yaoyao, why do you think he is so good to you for no reason?
        Although this brother knows that saying these words will make you sad, I
        still have to say‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang said slowly with a heavy expression, wanting to reveal Gu
        Changge's true face for Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't know what Gu Changge said to Yaoyao.</p>
      <p>
        But at this time, regardless of whether it was useful or not, he had to
        let the innocent and kind Yaoyao notice the problem of her Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You can't cultivate now, but he still treats you so well and keeps you
        by his side‚Ä¶ In fact, he has other plans."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You have to believe that in this world, no one will be nice to you for
        no reason."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Your Master is a hypocrite and a villain‚Ä¶ He must be thinking of taking
        you back to the Upper Realm, to use you to make some pills or
        something."
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is something that I found in the ancient books of Immortal Lun
        Sect last night."
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, he sighed, as if afraid of Yaoyao asking, and
        explained how he knew about this.
      </p>
      <p>In fact, this was not a false accusation.</p>
      <p>It was Jiang Yang's conclusion after careful consideration.</p>
      <p>
        With the means that Gu Changge used in the main hall that day, he could
        see that Gu Changge was not a good person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would such a person be so good, accepting Yaoyao as a disciple for no
        reason? Who didn't want something in return?
      </p>
      <p>
        From Jiang Yang's perspective on people, there was a big problem with
        this.
      </p>
      <p>This so-called Immortal had an impure purpose and ulterior motives.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yaoyao was stunned for a moment. Her face went a little
        pale, and her little hands couldn't help but clench tightly.
      </p>
      <p>But soon, anger surged into mind.</p>
      <p>With anger and coldness on her face, she scolded,</p>
      <p>
        "You are talking nonsense! How could my Master be like what you said‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Stop framing my Master!"</p>
      <p>As the words fell, Yaoyao's expression suddenly changed.</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Between her eyebrows, there was a peach-like pattern, which was
        unusually bright and started to glow, exuding a terrifying aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was full of indifference as if she was overlooking everything,
        perpetually reincarnated and regarded everything in the world as dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if the world collapsed, she was Immortal, and if the world was
        destroyed, she would live forever.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>At the same time.</p>
      <p>
        In the depths of the Immortal Lun Sect, Immortal mist was surging,
        various patterns intertwined, the rain of light was brilliant, like a
        land of flying Immortals.

          });

      <p>
        In a quiet and deep corridor. F·ªãùíèdd ùíèew updùíÇtùíÜs on n(o)v/e/lùíÉin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>"Don't try to make any noise or you'll die faster."</p>
      <p>
        With a faint smile on his face, Gu Changge approached someone
        unhurriedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The many formations on both sides began to spew out the murderous aura
        and runes that shot into the sky, turning them into all kinds of
        terrifying weapons, clanging loudly, and wanting to destroy him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with the wave of his sleeve, a monstrous aura, like a vast sky
        falling down, densely packed this place, like a heavy rain, and wiped
        out these runes.
      </p>
      <p>"Puff!"</p>
      <p>
        The two most Holy Elders in front of him flew upside down in shock and
        blood spurted out of their mouths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as soon as they came into contact with this aura, they were
        severely injured, and their bones were broken.
      </p>
      <p>"You‚Ä¶ how did you force your way into this place‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        The two elders in the Sacred Realm struggled to get up from the ground,
        unable to believe the scene in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Gu Changge broke into the deepest part of the Immortal Lun
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>This was also the place of their heritage.</p>
      <p>
        Usually, two people were responsible for guarding it to prevent
        outsiders from coming in.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were not unfamiliar with Gu Changge's identity, he was the
        mysterious Immortal from the Upper Realm who came to the Immortal Lun
        Sect during this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why did he quietly sneak into the deepest part of their Sect
        undetected
      </p>
      <p>It left them completely incomprehensible.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, they were completely suppressed by Gu Changge's aura,
        and even their souls were trembling, about to collapse, and completely
        unable to move.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, let alone resistance, it would be difficult for them to
        even move.
      </p>
      <p>The two of them were extremely desperate and couldn't believe it.</p>
      <p>"I told you to be quiet to let you live a little longer."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said casually, flicking his fingers and shaking the sword.
        With a snort, a sword energy with a terrifying edge, like an ancient
        Immortal sword, flew out from between his fingers and instantly
        penetrated between the eyebrows of the two of them.
      </p>
      <p>Annihilating their souls.</p>
      <p>
        Then one after another, runes condensed into a big treasure bottle,
        which floated up and down, and the black light fell from it, quickly
        swallowing their whole body.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wanted to sneak into the forbidden area in the depths of the Immortal
        Lun Sect, which was not a problem at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two of them wanted to die while blocking the way and Gu Changge
        naturally had to fulfill their wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge deliberately used the treasure bottle to be cautious about
        the divine soul that was related to the soul lamp, and did not intend to
        devour it first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, at this time, probably, the entire Immortal Lun Sect would be
        horrified because of the fluctuations.
      </p>
      <p>"The phantom of the Immortal Lun Supreme should be sealed here."</p>
      <p>
        "While Jiang Yang is outside, I should secretly refine his current
        biggest reliance. I'm afraid his face will be green with anger by then."
      </p>
      <p>"It would be even better if there was a Supreme weapon."</p>
      <p>
        With an intriguing smile on his face, Gu Changge walked down this
        corridor.
      </p>
      <p>After everything was arranged.</p>
      <p>
        In his eyes, the reincarnation of Human Ancestor was no different from
        Ye Ling and Lin Tian from earlier.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was now waiting for the Human Ancestor‚Äôs Luck points ??to be
        squeezed out before he could finally harvest him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, he would remove the many minions of the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor, making him useless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang could never have imagined that Gu Changge would take
        advantage of his trip to leave Immortal Lun Sect to venture into the
        depths and destroy all of his confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, Gu Changge broke down many rune formations, and finally
        arrived at the place where the forbidden place of Immortal Lun was
        sealed.
      </p>
      <p>This was a very simple and magnificent hall.</p>
      <p>
        At the top, there was a mighty aura floating up and down, like a fog
        creating a chain of laws and rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In a place like Heavenly Star Realm, there are still such techniques.
        It seems that the Immortal Lun Supreme indeed left a lot of help for the
        Human Ancestor. These are the sacred objects of the basic type of
        cultivation, and there is even a lot of Chaotic Sand‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge glanced at the many scenes in the hall.</p>
      <p>
        The Chaos aura that was in a mighty state above his head was actually
        from the Chaotic Sand.
      </p>
      <p>This kind of thing was hard to see even in the Upper Realm.</p>
      <p>
        It was impossible for the Heavenly Star Realm to give birth to it. Now
        there existed a handful of it in this location.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, there were many wonderful Roots, Holy fruits, Dragon
        Marrow, Immortal jades and other things, which were extremely profound.
        And if any one of them was lost, any cultivator would be madly
        scrambling for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "All these good things were reserved for Jiang Yang, now I can only
        laugh at him‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge revealed a faint smile, and with a roll of his sleeves, the
        terrifying power of space erupted, and even the piece of Chaotic Sand
        above the hall was taken away by him.
      </p>
      <p>Soon the place became empty, as if it had been ransacked.</p>
      <p>
        Finally, Gu Changge locked his target on the divine source in the middle
        of the great hall, suppressed by an ancient and complicated golden
        cauldron.
      </p>
      <p>"Immortal Lun Supreme‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Within his gaze, wisps of dark light began to flow, appearing extremely
        cold and demonic.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>Without hesitation.</p>
      <p>He directly made a move!</p>
      <p>
        On all sides, several flags were quickly inserted, and a vague and
        deceitful intent enveloped the place to avoid the aura from leaking out!
      </p>
      <p>From the location of Gu Changge's belly.</p>
      <p>
        A big treasure vase emanating an aura of the Great Dao fiercely emerged
        with a horrible black light, like a black hole emerging to swallow the
        universe!
      </p>
      <p>
        In that divine source, a terrifying figure was sealed as the figure was
        seated with eyes closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It looked very blurry, incomparably tall, like a god, wearing an armor
        exuding cold aura, with a pair of horns on the top of his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crack appeared on the divine source, causing the aura in it to leak
        out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge estimated that the aura Jiang Yang had induced at that time
        came from this place, causing the entire Immortal Lun Sect to respect
        him like a god.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he directly struck out with the intention of devouring
        it as his own sustenance!
      </p>
      <p>"Who is it?"</p>
      <p>
        And the moment Gu Changge made his move, the figure within the divine
        source opened his eyes, and his cold indifferent expression was like a
        large area of starry sky encapsulated within, incomparably profound.
      </p>
      <p>Then he became shocked and angry!</p>
      <p>
        He did not expect that someone would dare to make a move on him while he
        was sleeping.
      </p>
      <p>This was simply audacious.</p>
      <p>
        However, in the next moment, when he looked at the Great Dao treasure
        bottle suddenly dropping down in front of him, his expression changed
        once again!
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 229-2: First let‚Äôs loot all the confidence, He thought that it
        was the third floor but it was actually the tenth floor (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        From indifference, it became shock, disbelief, as well as a hint of fear
        and horror!
      </p>
      <p>"How is it possible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Great Dao Treasure Vase‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Recognizing the pitch-black colored bottle in front of him, his voice
        trembled a little.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed that even his divine soul was a little shaken.</p>
      <p>
        As a Supreme being, although it was only a wisp of his shadow, it also
        contained a great power that surpassed a general Quasi-Supreme being!
      </p>
      <p>
        But now the moment he saw this Great Dao treasure bottle, his whole body
        felt like it was frozen and cracked.
      </p>
      <p>This thing unexpectedly came out, and suppressed him!</p>
      <p>
        So much so that the Immortal Lun Supreme didn't even notice Gu Changge,
        who suddenly came to attack with the demonic halberd in front of him!
      </p>
      <p>
        When he reacted, the monstrous demonic aura had already drowned him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole divine source cracked and it directly split his body, like
        countless stars exploding, the fluctuations were too terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>His shoulder almost exploded.</p>
      <p>
        If it were not for the fact that this place was covered by Gu Changge
        with formation flags to hide the aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        These aura fluctuations would probably have destroyed all the nearby
        buildings.
      </p>
      <p>"You‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ You actually appeared, the inheritor of demonic art‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Immortal Lun Supreme trembled, staring deeply at Gu Changge, and his
        voice could hardly remain calm, as if to see him through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's face was covered with a layer of fog and it was incredibly
        blurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only a pair of eyes, cold as if there was no hint of emotion, more like
        looking at a lifeless object.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made his heart palpitate even more, remembering the many rumors
        that preceded his birth.
      </p>
      <p>The inheritor of demonic art ravaged all domains in the heavens.</p>
      <p>
        It was a time of despair for all races and beings, a time of grayness
        and no hope in sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Obediently hand over your origin to me, don't bring up any unnecessary
        resistance."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said indifferently, although there was a Supreme being in
        front of him, his tone was as if he was looking down with contempt and
        indifference.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's just a junior, how dare you speak wildly. How did you find your
        way to this place?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Lun Supreme was enraged and quickly reacted to the fact
        that Gu Changge in front of him was just a junior who was bluffing.
      </p>
      <p>His real cultivation level was only that of a Sacred Realm!</p>
      <p>
        But why the hell was he speaking to a Supreme being like him with this
        tone?
      </p>
      <p>
        And his existence was related to the Human Ancestor‚Äôs reincarnation
        body, at this time even the inheritor of demonic art had taken the
        initiative to find him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then it was certainly bad luck for the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made the Immortal Lun Supreme being more worried and uneasy, but it
        was just a wisp of a shadow, and there was absolutely nothing much he
        could do at this time.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>"How did I find my way here, does it really matter?"</p>
      <p>
        "What's important is that you and the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor will die soon."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said indifferently, and then directly struck out.</p>
      <p>
        The moment the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd fell, it seemed to split the
        universe, the light exploded, the divine chain of laws trembled,
        intending to subdue and devour this Supreme Phantom in this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the fall of the Great Dao Treasure Vase, runes descended like ruins
        from the sky to drown him.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, there was a trembling roar of anger and resignation.</p>
      <p>
        It was as if there was some existence, making a final deadly resistance,
        this roar, could be described as earth-shattering.
      </p>
      <p>But with the thick gray fog enveloping this place.</p>
      <p>
        Even his sound could not be transmitted, many horrible aftershocks were
        swallowed by the Great Dao treasure bottle above, without even leaving
        the slightest aura!
      </p>
      <p>
        That was like a terrifying universe extinction mill, like a dark light
        hanging down as it issued a world rumbling rotation.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the fluctuations here gradually subsided.</p>

      <p>There were no surprises.</p>
      <p>The desne gray fog dispersed.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's figure emerged from it, but he had his eyes closed, as if
        he was still recalling the aura from earlier.
      </p>
      <p>He shook his head slightly.</p>
      <p>"Tsk."</p>
      <p>
        "The taste of this Supreme Phantom is really far better than the many
        origins that I have devoured during this time."
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, it's just the right time to take advantage of this opportunity
        to throw this blame on the head of the Immortal Lun Supreme."
      </p>
      <p>Soon, thinking of this, Gu Changge opened his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Now his cultivation level had already broken through to the peak of the
        Sacred Realm, and he was only a hair's breadth away from reaching the
        Great Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>He was still very satisfied with this speed.</p>
      <p>
        It was just that he had not found the weapon of Immortal Lun Supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        So he guessed that it was not suppressed here, but in another place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now with the news of Immortal Lun Supreme's sealed phatom missing, it
        was just one more reason for him to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time arrived, he could directly tell Yaoyao that his brother
        Jiang Yang was actually seized by Immortal Lun Supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Lun Ancestor's shadow that Jiang Yang triggered at the
        beginning was just an aura released by him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, it would also explain why the people of the Immortal Lun
        Sect did not care about Jiang Yang's abnormality in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, for the Immortal Lun Sect, Jiang Yang was their disciple,
        even if he was taken over by someone, it was still their disciple,
        involving their glory.
      </p>
      <p>Who cared about these individual details?</p>
      <p>But for Yaoyao, this was completely different.</p>
      <p>
        And at this time, Gu Changge, who was planning to leave this place,
        looked slightly stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        His eyes became ghostly, and saw the sight seen by the Myriad Demonic
        Body in the jade pendant left on Yaoyao's body.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, the aura of Yaoyao changed violently, and the mark of
        Peach on her head began to glow, floating with a terrifying aura.
      </p>
      <p>His smile, for a moment, was a little intriguing.</p>
      <p>
        "Hmm? You actually said this to Yaoyao? It seems that my guess was
        really right."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thanks to my early preparation, I gave her a lot of things to confess,
        just to anticipate that you were going to say this to her."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Yang, you thought I was in the third layer, but you did not know
        that I was already on the tenth layer, I already know about all your
        means of response‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "As the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, you really let me down."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge laughed and was not surprised by this at all.</p>
      <p>
        Because Jiang Yang was completely unaware that Gu Changge's target was
        him from the beginning to the end, not Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>The fact was that she was just a front for Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>So Gu Changge had told Yaoyao very frankly.</p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, he intended to take Yaoyao as his disciple, purely
        because he saw that her aura was extraordinary, thinking that her
        background was not simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise he would not be so kind as to stop at a small village on
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Gu Changge‚Äôs statement, Yaoyao still expressed understanding at that
        time and did not say anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was very understanding and smart. She knew that Gu Changge really
        couldn't take her as a disciple for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>Everything was with the purpose of a pay back.</p>
      <p>
        Then Gu Changge told her very frankly that after seeing that she really
        could not cultivate, he really had the idea of abandoning her.
      </p>
      <p>This sentence made the young Yaoyao‚Äòs small face a little pale.</p>
      <p>But the good thing was that Gu Changge's words changed quickly.</p>
      <p>With regret and a little helplessness.</p>
      <p>
        He had been teaching her for so long anyway, so staying by her side was
        not a problem, she was also well behaved and knew how to behave anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, when she was older, pounding legs and pinching shoulders
        was also good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this explanation, Yaoyao smiled again, revealing a happy look.
      </p>

      <p>Maybe she could also cling to his thigh.</p>
      <p>Although they were only half-joking words.</p>
      <p>But Gu Changge had actually given her a lot of things to confess.</p>
      <p>The young lady was very smart and could understand this.</p>
      <p>
        So under this premise, what Jiang Yang said to Yaoyao now was no
        different from provoking discord.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Yaoyao trusted Gu Changge the most.</p>
      <p>
        In addition, she was extremely angry and hated the person who possessed
        her brother's body.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, the power of Dao Fruit was triggered.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge was not surprised, and his smile was a little playful.</p>
      <p>
        "Now I'll just watch the show, Jiang Yang, oh Jiang Yang, as the
        reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, at this time, I'll see what means
        you have to stop the angry Yaoyao‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>From the eyes of the Myriad Demons body.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge had seen a lot of sights.</p>
      <p>
        After that, he kept his footsteps and quickly left the place, the void
        blurred for a while, and he rushed to the ancient city outside the
        Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>On the street.</p>
      <p>As Jiang Yang finished speaking.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's expression changed suddenly, the aura that looked down on
        everything covered the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sky trembled, and the situation was reversed, causing all
        cultivators and creatures to have a kind of fear and trembling, and they
        couldn't help but kneel on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Silver haired granny beside her felt the change for the first time, and
        her expression suddenly changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's reaction was quick, and his expression changed rapidly,
        which was a bit unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        He sensed the dangerous aura, and runes gathered in his hands, turning
        into a large piece of gorgeous ancient text which densely covered the
        air to help him resist!
      </p>
      <p>
        But at this time, Yaoyao's eyes were like an ancient and ruthless vast
        universe, and there was nothing except indifference.
      </p>
      <p>She was floating in the void.</p>
      <p>
        As she raised her little hand, the terrifying pressure, as if the heaven
        and the earth were rolled back down, and all creatures were about to be
        wiped out!
      </p>
      <p>"Not good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        The expression of Supreme Elder Zhao Yi behind Jiang Yang changed, and
        she wanted to stop all this, but before she could do anything, she
        suddenly spurted out a mouthful of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao casually slapped down the palm of her hand, as if hitting the
        void, creating a monstrous wave!
      </p>
      <p>
        She screamed and flew out, half of her body exploded, the blood mist
        scattered, and she looked extremely miserable!
      </p>
      <p>A Great Sacred Realm existence was hit hard in an instant.</p>
      <p>"How could this be‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Jiang Yang's expression also changed rapidly. He
        suddenly ducked backwards, with extremely fast speed, and the general
        trend under his feet seemed to melt into his body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from the speed, he was not slower than Zhao Yi who just took the
        hit.
      </p>
      <p>But his means of fighting against it were much weaker.</p>
      <p><strong>Click!</strong></p>
      <p>The void immediately burst into a crack.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang also spat out a mouthful of blood as he was slapped by
        Yaoyao, and instantly smashed into a large building, stirring up a large
        cloud of dust.
      </p>
      <p>
        And after doing this, Yaoyao seemed to have exhausted all her strength
        and fell from the void.
      </p>
      <p>She opened her big, and confused eyes.</p>
      <p>
        As if she didn't know what just happened. R√™Ad latùôöSt chapters at

      </p>
      <p>
        However, instead of falling to the ground, she fell into a warm embrace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing the figure suddenly appearing behind her, Yaoyao made a
        murmur-like voice.

      <hr />
      <p>Silavin: Will be reducing the chapters to 5 per week.</p>
      <p>
        The Patreon is quite small and I&#8217;ll by putting more chapters there
        for the read ahead. It&#8217;s been quite a huge loss so far but well,
        this has been a test. The viewership for this novel is also not that
        high on DDL sadly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I don&#8217;t plan to drop this since the alternative is quite bad
        in terms of translation quality, while the other good group seems to be
        unable to keep up.

        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Proofreader: </strong><span style="color: #00ffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color><strong>Silavin </strong></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sudden change shocked and frightened the Upper Realm Forces. All of them could sense that the Principles of the world were changing. Beams of crimson light shot into the sky, reaching the heavy lead-coloured clouds which were already rolling in. A terrifying force seemed to be seeping in, which made many unable to move. Even True Daoists were affected by it.</span><span id="more-36162"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all looked stricken as they sensed the great strength within them suddenly slow down and no longer flow as easily as before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it! Neraka has already set up an ancient array and was just waiting for us to arrive and sacrifice enough people before activating it. Everyone might really die here and accompany Neraka to their grave.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many experts from the older generation, who were extremely well versed in arrays, were shocked. They quickly discerned what the crimson light was. It was a type of rune from the ancient eras, which contained unfathomable power that could completely alter the world. With so many ancient runes being activated, the world would completely meld with it, resulting in unimaginable consequences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had been paying attention to this as well but unlike everyone else who felt anxious, he wanted to see more of the Ruler of Neraka. Judging by the Palm of True World controlled by the Third Palace Lord, the Ruler of Neraka clearly had powerful origins and an unfathomable lifespan. If the World Principles allowed it, its strength would far exceed True Daoists and even reach the Immortal Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If the Ruler of Neraka is truly an Ancient Godly Spirit, then the Sources will be extremely useful to me. It might even allow me to breakthrough to the Late Stage of the Nirvana Realm.] Gu Changge seemed attracted by the idea and peered into the depths of Neraka, planning to wait for the Ruler of Neraka&#8217;s appearance. He knew that Neraka had no other paths of retreat left at this stage and their only solution was to completely eliminate the invading army, causing the attacking Forces to suffer enormous losses. So, the Ruler of Neraka wouldn&#8217;t have much of a choice left. Either it would find a way to escape, or it would attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this Neraka’s plan? To take everyone down with them!&#8221; Many True Daoists looked stricken and pale. They had a lot of experience and knew the frightening results of such a possibility. It wouldn&#8217;t be just the army backing them that would die. They might also perish here as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Dong!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chilling sound of a bell rang from a palace deep within Neraka. A long bronze bell appeared, which resonated for millions of kilometres. The world was suffused with a murderous aura before billions of beams of Sword Qi appeared, shooting in different directions towards the location.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Cick!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Immortal Sect, which was known as Purple Cloud Valley was struck first. The battleships floating in the air were immediately reduced to dust, while the experts within became blood mist, unable to even scream.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Cick!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sword Qi shot everywhere in multicoloured beams, penetrating everything in their path. Even from a faraway distance, it made one hurt physically. Their souls also waver as if they might die at any moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No…&#8221; The True Daoist of Purple Cloud Valley turned pale and was about to attempt to stop it, but he soon felt a terrifying divine sense tightly grip him. The surrounding Principles transformed into chains, which weaved around him to form a web and lock him in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Trying to stop it? Are you suicidal?&#8221; A True Daoist from Neraka stared at him and crossed an infinite distance to appear before the True Daoist from Purple Cloud Valley. The two of them immediately engaged in a fierce battle, their every move containing flowing Principles which could reduce any being to a pile of flesh and die.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the world was now surrounded by a faint blood-coloured light. The Third Palace Lord had controlled the True World and began to focus on dealing with everyone with a cold expression. Beams of sword light fell from the sky and struck groups of cultivators, reducing them to dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Zoom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A blade flashed as a True Daoist from Neraka joined in. The blade fell downwards like heaven was falling. No one had come so deep into Neraka and forced them to such a stage in countless years. Now, it was time for everyone to finally witness the might of Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reawakened bronze bell was a broken Immortal Grade Artifact, which contained a slumbering god. Its aura spread through the air with strength great enough to crush everything. Terrifying scenes took place everywhere; even if Neraka was no longer in its prime, it was still formidable. Killing intent was everywhere and whoever attacked it had to pay a price in blood. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, the Ruler of Neraka hadn&#8217;t shown up yet. As long as the Palm of True World was taken out and wielded by the Third Palace Lord, controlling and combining the ancient runes with this world to kill everyone, there was no need for the Ruler to show up. After all, even True Daoists could not escape from this. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Palm of True World was a technique from an Ancient Godly Spirit to form a divine land. Thus, the survival of anyone who stepped into it would be controlled by that Godly Spirit. Naturally, no one could avoid it once trapped. The world had not fully transformed yet, but True Daoists were already feeling oppressed and couldn&#8217;t use their full strength.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final battle was unavoidable. Everyone from Neraka now had the support of the world. They became savage, attacking the invaders without any regard for their lives. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge soon noticed that the Third Palace Lord, who had wielded the Palm of True World, had suddenly disappeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Where did he disappear to?] Gu Changge was taken aback and stepped forward. The void blurred around him as he moved. The Principles of this world weren&#8217;t powerful enough to affect him. In fact, even if the Ruler of Neraka showed up and took control of the divine land it built up, it would do nothing to him. On the contrary, he had several techniques which could affect the surrounding environment so even True Daoists couldn&#8217;t detect any trace of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deepest part of Neraka had a chilling rotten shade of colour. A dark mist flowed slowly across the world, and the entire place was characterised by deathly silence and coldness. There was no sound at all, making the place seem like a realm for the eternally dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Third Palace Lord had crossed numerous arrays and seals before arriving here and was now prostrating himself before a palace. He looked slightly pale since wielding the Palm of True World was still too difficult for him and required enormous mental and physical strength. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn&#8217;t completely exhausted yet, but it was clear he couldn&#8217;t last for much longer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How is it?&#8221; Someone else was present within the palace, who looked to be a handsome young man. He was clad completely in black and had a purple closed vertical eye between his eyebrows. He sounded somewhat frantic as he directed the question to the Third Palace Lord.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had other members of Neraka been present, they would have found that this was the current First Palace Lord, who had disappeared during the beginning of the war. He was also the Ruler of Neraka&#8217;s only disciple, which only high-ranking members of Neraka knew about. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Third Palace Lord knew better. He knew that the young man wasn&#8217;t just a disciple of the Ruler of Neraka but also the biological child. Whenever the Third Palace Lord wants to meet the Ruler of Neraka, he would actually be seeing this young man in black in front of him. Even the Palm of True World had been given to him by this man as well. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This made the Third Palace Lord secretly worried that something had happened to the Ruler of Neraka. The Ruler might have already passed on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have caused a long delay and deterred many,&#8221; murmured the Third Palace Lord after a moment, looking into the depths of the palace with a gaze full of complicated emotions.</span></p>

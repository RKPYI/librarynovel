          know about the appearance of the Tower of World Domination. I thought
          that this would go smoothly; if Yaoxing doesn&#8217;t have any news as
          well, we will have to return without any results. Will all our
          planning and efforts come to yield nothing in the end?&#8221; Ji
          Chuyue&#8217;s thin eyebrows were furrowed together as she murmured to
          herself. She had seen far too many cultivators with strong auras
          flying across the sky on clouds or mist as if looking for something.
          Their goals were obviously the same as the family&#8217;s, not to
          mention their search area was much bigger. Not even the land on the
          other side of the Sky Jade Mountain Range was left out.</span

          >She hadn&#8217;t sent anyone to check it out for fear of drawing
          attention, but the issue soon exceeded her expectations. Several
          batches of cultivators had joined the group from before, including
          some people she knew who were members of the Hidden Chen Family. Their
          family might not be as ancient as the Hidden Ji Family but some
          members had become True Daoists, reaching the Nirvana Realm. It had
          given rise to many prodigal members recently, causing their power to
          increase and leading to some friction with her own family.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If they clashed with the Hidden Chen Family, news of the commotion
          would spread and gain the attention of the other forces. The fight for
          the Tower of World Domination wouldn&#8217;t just involve the younger
          generation but also the older generation. Besides, the Tower of World
          Domination was also one of the keys to opening the Immortal Palace
          Treasury. Naturally, many cultivators desired that sort of power.
          Rumours all stated that the Seven Tools of World Domination were
          superior to the Nirvana Grade Artifacts but it was rare to see someone
          activating them or even wielding their full power.</span

          >She knew that he had a powerful physique but hadn&#8217;t informed
          him so. One reason was that it was entertaining to watch him
          pretending to be calm before ending up humiliating himself; the other
          one was because she wanted to help him secretly, getting a
          good-quality disciple for her family. That was why she would send him
          some spirit herbs via a messenger the past few days. According to her
          observations, Jiang Chen&#8217;s physique was a little mysterious and
          even exceeded her brother&#8217;s Sacred Physique of the Sun in some
          aspects. It was an innate feeling that she had.</span

          >She hadn&#8217;t mentioned her purpose for coming to Heavenly Ruin
          Gate, but any observant person would know she was seeking something.
          This was no secret, so what was his reason for asking this
          suddenly?</span

      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          little at her reaction. &#8220;I can actually assist you in your
          endeavour. Thanks to your spirit herbs, I have improved greatly in my
          cultivation and so I will never forget your kindness.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He hadn&#8217;t even officially stepped into the realm of being a
          cultivator. After all, his Spiritual Sea wasn&#8217;t even opened yet.
          Thus, it was questionable why someone like him volunteered recklessly
          to help her when her Family had no clues or any idea where exactly the
          Tower would appear. She even wondered if he had come to tease
          her.</span

          my cultivation, but I do have another identity as a Successor of a
          Divine Source Master. My ancestor has inherited the teaching of a
          Divine Source Master by chance.&#8221; Jiang Chen smiled confidently
          and uttered the words as instructed by the Celestial Boat of
          Creation.</span

          >&#8220;The Divine Source Master?&#8221; Ji Chuyue&#8217;s eyes
          widened as she froze in disbelief and amazement. She was a prodigy of
          the Hidden Ji Family, so she knew naturally what that term meant.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The unassuming Jiang Chen was claiming he was a Divine Source Master
          when they had already disappeared in this era. It was said that it was
          because they had touched something they shouldn&#8217;t have and thus
          attracted a curse and bad fortune, leading to the end of their line of
          inheritance somewhere during the passage of time. Their power and
          mystery were undeniable since they could control the mountains and
          seas as they willed it to be. Fortuity, and fates along with the
          capability of killing others with a flick of a hand. They could easily
          cause disaster and were frightening since guarding against them was
          useless.</span

          her. She was planning to meet her brother Ji Yaoxing as she needed his
          opinion on the situation. If Jiang Chen was truly a Divine Source
          Master, he might be able to help them find the Tower of World
          Domination.</span

          >In a void near Heavenly Ruin Gate, a vibration sounded along with a
          light laugh. A door then opened and several figures walked out. A man
          and a woman led the crowd. The man was tall and slender with a
          handsome face and wearing pure white clothing. His countenance
          resembled jade and his hair seemed to shimmer with a sort of glow. His
          eyes shone with an extraordinary light. The woman was ethereal, clad
          in a long gown and currently holding hands with the man. She looked
          calm and thoughtful, hair fluttering with the breeze. They stood
          shoulder-to-shoulder with an extraordinary air as if they could ride
          the winds away at any time.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The crowd behind them were their followers, who sat on rare and
          strange beasts which are either covered in armoured scales or smooth
          and surrounded by lightning. They exuded an awe-inducing energy while
          surrounded by a bright light, and the runes flickering in their eyes
          gave them a frightening air.</span

          pointed at the incomplete map shimmering in her hand.</span

          know the Tower will appear here?&#8221;</span

          either. I only managed to deduce that it will appear here based on
          this piece of paper. There are definitely abilities which can deduce
          it other than this map. The Pavillion of Heavenly Secrets and the
          Pavillion of Heaven and Earth are good at deducing things. They will
          be able to find it as long as they can pay the price, even to the
          point where it would greatly cost them.&#8221;</span

          of the Tower had really been deduced by the Pavillion of Heavenly
          Secrets and the information was sold to some forces. However, those
          forces had accidentally leaked the information and allowed many
          cultivators to know of the impending appearance of the Tower.</span

          the sky and headed towards the location for Heavenly Ruin Gate. There
          were other forces here as well but they were much weaker compared to
          Heavenly Ruin Gate; it would be too inconvenient to send these forces
          instead of the more powerful one.

          surprising to him as well since he had only told the Puppet to abandon
          Jiang Chen at any force and allow the man to develop on his own. He
          hadn&#8217;t expected Jiang Chen to show up here. [He truly is the

          >Jiang Chen, who had been brought here by Ji Chuyue to see her
          brother, froze on the spot, eyes wide with fear. He felt cold and his
          voice shook slightly, as he hadn&#8217;t anticipated seeing Gu Changge
          in such a remote location. He already knew from a glance that the
          greatly admired young man with an extraordinary and smooth countenance
          was Gu Changge, as he would never forget such an appearance and
          behaviour.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His face became pale while his steps became weak. His limbs felt cold
          as he had the urge to escape. He had already witnessed how cruel and
          terrifying the man could be. Gu Changge might look mild and gentle on
          the surface, but his abilities were extremely barbaric as he had
          killed many of his friends. If he hadn&#8217;t encountered the old man
          in black, he would have ended up like them too. He didn&#8217;t even
          know whether his best friend Niu Tian was alive or dead, nor did he
          know where he was.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ruoyin…] </span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A figure appeared in his mind, filling him with anger and
          frustration. He knew that the woman beside Gu Changge was definitely
          not Xiao Ruoyin. From her proud and imperious air, it was clear she
          had an extraordinary background. He was much weaker than an ant
          compared to her and watching the elderly cultivator who had tried to
          stop him when he first came in pander to Gu Changge like a lowly dog
          made him feel furious. His fists clenched as he gritted his teeth.
          However, he forced down the feeling and tried calming himself down,
          not brave enough to elicit any suspicion. After all, he wasn&#8217;t
          sure if Gu Changge would let him go this time when he noticed
          him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Chuyue looked at him with confusion. &#8220;What&#8217;s
          wrong?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She looked towards where he was gazing, noticing a group of powerful
          young men and women glowing with light heading in on various strange
          beasts. She did not see Gu Changge or Yue Mingkong who had been
          walking at the front of the group.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; Jiang Chen shook his head, expression
          calming down quickly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Things seem to be heating up now. That group… every single one of
          them is unfathomably strong, and all of them are heading towards
          Heavenly Ruin Gate.] Ji Chuyue frowned, feeling that things were
          becoming more complicated. She continued on her journey, taking Jiang
          Chen to the mountain range that she and Ji Yaoxing had agreed
          on.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Changge?&#8221; Yue Mingkong noticed an
          intrigued smile tugging at the corners of his mouth and became
          curious.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Nothing much, just a wandering bug. I suddenly have the
          feeling that finding the Tower of World Domination won&#8217;t be so
          difficult.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and squeezed her soft hand.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She glared at him briefly, &#8220;The way you said that makes me feel
          like you have already planned all of this out.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No no no. This is really unexpected.&#8221; Gu Changge shook
          his head. It was true that he hadn&#8217;t expected Jiang Chen to
          appear here; if he hadn&#8217;t come here and sensed the presence of
          the Demonic Puppet, he wouldn&#8217;t have known Jiang Chen was here.
          He had to allow the Fortuitous One to grow on his own so he would
          develop as a healthy leek after all.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Greetings, young prodigies. I am the Head of Heavenly Ruin
          Gate, Shen Xuzi.&#8221; Soon, the elderly cultivator led them to a
          quiet and beautiful palace. But before entering, an old man with white
          hair and beard greeted him. Even with the beard, his face still seemed
          youthful as he greeted them with high-spirits.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Behind him were the other authoritative figures of Heavenly Ruin
          Gate. They also bowed and greeted Gu Changge’s group.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge nodded slightly, but did not speak, and had no intention
          of responding. Meanwhile, Yue Mingkong&#8217;s expression was
          indifferent and calm, as if carved from flawless jade.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;My Master is looking for something in Sky Jade Mountain
          Range&#8230;&#8221; The yaksha like being, who spoke earlier, spoke
          again. He was explaining the purpose of their visit.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing this, the Head seemed solemn. Although he was secretly
          checking up Gu Changge earlier. However, he still could not recognise
          the young man.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Originally, his Sect was built on top of a ruin. That was how it got
          its name. In fact, they just added ‘Heavenly’ to make it sound better.
          Thus, it could only be regarded as an insignificant force in the vast
          Upper Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Furthermore, Heavenly Ruin Gate was just a branch of their main
          Heavenly Ruin Sect. They were far from their main Sect, and could not
          contact them. Nonetheless, Shen Xuzi could tell the unusual identities
          of Gu Changge and the others.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Not to worry. If you need help from my Heavenly Ruin Sect,
          just open your mouth. My Heavenly Ruin Sect will definitely help you
          with all our might.&#8221; Shen Xuzi solemnly declared.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He then thought of Ji Chuyue, who came over during this period of
          time. After all, she had the Hidden Ji Family behind her, which was
          also another unfathomably strong force in the Upper Realm. [I wonder
          if she will recognize this group of young prodigies?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Do well, my Master will not treat you badly.&#8221; Hearing
          this, the Yaksha like being sneered. A divine light flashed in his
          hand, and a large piece of rare item appeared. It seemed to be red
          like amber, exuding dense heavenly mist from it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The moment they saw this item appear, the eyes of those from Heavenly
          Ruin Gate were locked onto it. It widened to saucepans before they
          rushed away, hurried to make arrangements to free up the best palaces
          and pavilions for their precious guests.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yue Mingkong dismissed the rest with a wave of her hand. Once they
          were alone, she spoke.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It’s obvious that someone else had come before us and did the
          same thing.&#8221; Yue Mingkong eyes narrowed as she spoke. Her voice
          was cold but nonetheless, had a touch of tenderness in it. It was
          clear from their reaction that her group was not the first here. Those
          from Heavenly Ruin Gate were not surprised in the slightest when they
          heard of the purpose of their visit. Thus, it was easy to tell someone
          else had come before them and were after the same thing.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That’s not a problem. No matter who came here first, as long
          as they are trying to rob me of what is mine, they can never leave
          this place alive.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled, his tone as casual as
          always.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You haven&#8217;t even seen the Tower of World Domination.
          Yet, it&#8217;s all yours already?&#8221; Yue Mingkong glanced at him,
          snorting at what he said.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What I want is naturally mine, no?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled.
          With just a thought, he summoned a black-robed old man. The same man
          who left Jiang Chen here.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Greetings Master!&#8221; The black-robed old man quickly
          appeared from the void and respectfully greeted.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Keep an eye on that guy&#8217;s whereabouts, and report to me
          if there are any changes.&#8221; Gu Changge lightly ordered.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes Master!&#8221; The black-robed old man came and
          disappeared just as quickly. After all, he was in the Sacred Lord
          Realm. In such an insignificant place like Heavenly Ruin Gate, he need
          not worry about anything and could traverse anywhere with ease.

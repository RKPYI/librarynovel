        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A horrifying evil aura suddenly burst forth, spreading out in every direction like a raging river, causing everyone’s countenance to contort with shock and dismay. Jiang Chen’s sudden action caught many off guard, as no one expected he would shatter the seal placed upon mysterious jade without any hesitation.</span><span id="more-32761"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Ji Chuyue was taken aback by his uncharacteristic behaviour as he seemed to have lost his usual confidence and determination. The realisation that Jiang Chen had also concealed his true identity as the Successor of the Demonics Arts made her feel betrayed and used, causing her to tremble with anguish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn it! This guy really has an ulterior motive! He wants to kill us all and consume our Sources. As the Successor of Demonic Arts, it’s impossible for him to have come to rescue the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family with pure motives!” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an instant, a surge of murderous aura permeated the air. As everyone dodged the purple waterfall, their eyes were fixed on Jiang Chen with seething anger and intense hatred. It was as if they wished they could tear him apart. If they weren’t this busy fending off the dangerous water, they would have already murdered Jiang Chen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen paid no attention to the thoughts and expressions of those around him. A joyful grin spread across his face as he addressed the Daoist Sage in the mysterious jade, “You promised to eliminate them once you got released!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Crack!!* The mysterious jade that sealed the cavern shattered in Jiang Chen’s hand. Its fragments cascaded out and tumbled down into the cavern. The Daoist Sage in flowing robes seemed to have heard Jiang Chen’s words. His lifeless body suddenly stirred, and his tightly shut eyes were on the verge of opening. The evil aura he exuded intensified, as if condensed with countless twisted spirits of those who had been extinguished by his very hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene terrified everyone. They could feel their bodies breaking under the terrifying aura that was almost impossible to bear. Even the Sacred Emperor Realm experts were shaken to their core. It was clear that his strength was beyond measure , just as when he was still alive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am finally free…” the Daoist Sage murmured, sounding both emotional and excited. Those who heard him could feel the overpowering and suffocating presence of evil spirits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Jiang Chen, flee now, go into the cavern,&gt; the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation urged in his mind. It could sense that the Daoist Sage was not one to be trusted, especially with the evil aura emanating from him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen heeded the advice and quickly bolted toward the cavern. He knew that whatever fate befell everyone behind him was not his concern. Nonetheless, a part of him was curious to witness the moment Gu Changge died at the hands of the Daoist Sage .</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn it! That kid is running away…!” As Jiang Chen’s figure disappeared into the cavern, the expressions of everyone changed drastically, their emotions running high with fury. They watched helplessly as Jiang Chen shattered the seal on the mysterious jade and freed the Daoist Sage who had been trapped inside, before making his escape. The situation was enough to make anyone seethe with anger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, they were too occupied to chase after Jiang Chen as they had a more pressing concern. The Daoist Sage who was released from the mysterious jade did not appear friendly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stay vigilant, everyone,” one of the True Daoists from the Sky Emperor Mountain cautioned as he watched the Daoist Sage’s every move warily. The others in the group also swiftly summoned their Dao Artifacts, poised and ready for any unexpected assault.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keke&#8230; I never imagined the day of my freedom would come. You can all die in peace, knowing that you were fortunate enough to witness this moment.” The Daoist Sage was gaunt, but the sneer on his face made him appear even more sinister.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He swept his glance over everyone, but remained unfazed by the number of True Daoists present. In his opinion, all of them were insignificant and therefore unworthy of his full attention. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he was merely a manifestation of the negative energy from the corpse, he inherited all the divine arts and techniques that the Daoist Sage had learnt when he was still alive. Hence, he was confident that he could take on all the True Daoists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think I know who he is… the Ancient Feather Supreme Being! A powerful being who was defeated by the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being and vanished without a trace… I didn’t expect him to also be trapped in Kun Mountain. It appears that his corpse has gained divine consciousness. We’re definitely no match for him!” A True Daoist from the Ancient Ye Family suddenly spoke up. He was squinting at the intricate pattern on the Daoist Sage’s sleeve before a look of surprise appeared on his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Celestial Ancient Times, those who had reached the Immortal Realm were referred to as Ancient Supreme Beings. Although times had changed significantly, making it challenging to reach the Immortal Realm, the Ancient Supreme Beings remained formidable. The revelation disheartened everyone yet it also served as a reminder for everyone to stay vigilant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the corpse of an Ancient Supreme Being underwent a transformation, that meant the corpse before them was at least in the Immortal Realm. Who could possibly defeat such a formidable opponent? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the passage of time and the depletion of its energy, only few in the Upper Realm today possess the power to contend with him! No wonder Ji Shengchu, the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family, warned all of them against laying a finger on that mysterious jade earlier on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That accursed Successor of the Demonic Arts actually released such a formidable murderer! If he manages to escape from Kun Mountain, he could become as infamous as the demoness in red,” someone cursed angrily, their face contorted with disgust and a desire to tear Jiang Chen into pieces. However, Jiang Chen had already fled into the cavern, making pursuit a challenging task.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll take care of Jiang Chen. Everyone, please take care of this,” Gu Changge suddenly said with a serious expression. It was evident that he also found the situation at hand troubling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems that’s our only option. We’ll stall him and attempt to vanquish him here. Young Master Changge, please go after Jiang Chen,” The True Daoists of various Forces exchanged glances before nodding in unison. They had great confidence in Gu Changge’s strength. They were certain that should he cross paths with Jiang Chen, there would be no escape for the latter. This was merely an optimistic perspective though, for Jiang Chen was a Divine Source Master and the terrain was in his favour. Gu Changge would need to exercise caution, lest he find himself at a disadvantage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Phoenix Lady, the King with Six Crowns and the Sky Demon Sovereign sighed inwardly, realising that their abilities were insufficient to make a significant impact in the current situation. They could only rely on the powerful allies behind them for protection while they made their way toward the cave, hoping to escape the danger. If a fight were to break out, no one would be able to protect them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trying to escape? No one shall leave this place today.” The Daoist Sage in flowing robes seemed to have seen through their plans. He scoffed and with a wave of his sleeve, released evil spirits into the sky like a river of stars. Their overwhelming presence bore down on everyone and left them gasping for air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The True Daoists swiftly summoned their Dao Artifacts. The air crackled with terrifying auras, as if the Godly weapons were clashing against each other. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire Kun Mountain shook, and a brilliant burst of light pierced the sky. Countless cultivators who saw the light outside were shocked and horrified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the chaos of the battle with the Daoist Sage, Gu Changge swiftly slipped into the cave, vanishing from sight. Fortunately, the Daoist Sage was providing cover, buying him some time. If the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family was indeed trapped inside, it would save him a great deal of effort. He was in no rush to go after Jiang Chen. After all, he was the one who had sown the Demonic Seed in Jiang Chen’s body. No matter where he fled, Gu Changge was confident he could track him down, even if it meant traversing the end of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The underground cavern was a magnificent expanse, seemingly without end. The underground palace was ancient and extremely dusty. Every stone chamber and hall bore marks of the passage of time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon entering, Jiang Chen pressed forward, following the guidance of the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation. The walls were adorned with ancient arrays and divine stones, radiating a brilliant glow. Had time allowed, Jiang Chen would have eagerly claimed these treasures as his own.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you think they will catch up? Although Gu Changge is strong, he’s probably no match for that Daoist Sage, right?” As Jiang Chen descended deeper into the unknown, he spoke with the Artifact Spirit of the Creation Immortal Boat in his mind. He was aware that the Daoist Sage was a formidable opponent, but he couldn’t help but ponder the outcome of their confrontation, given the fact that Gu Changge had a lot of tricks up his sleeves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlikely, but that Daoist Sage should be able to delay Gu Changge for a while and buy you time to escape,” the Artifact Spirit of the Creation Immortal Boat said. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Artifact Spirit doubted that the Daoist Sage could kill Gu Changge, as Gu Changge was an even greater enigma compared to the Daoist Sage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen sighed inwardly and remained silent. He knew that even if he managed to escape from Kun Mountain, he would be hunted down like a common mouse and become the enemy of the entire world. After all, Gu Changge had labelled him the Successor of Demonic Arts. Although he had reservations when he first received the legacy, he had brushed it off. Now found himself trapped in the label of being the Successor of Demonic Arts, with no idea how to shake it off.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll just have to take things one step at a time and focus on escaping from this eerie place first before devising any further plans.” Jiang Chen sighed, but grew more determined to seek revenge against Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silent underground palace was extremely vast and cold, yet it was decorated with peculiar treasures that emitted a soft, ethereal glow along its four walls. It felt almost like a mysterious abyss hidden buried deep beneath the earth. Fortunately with the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation, he was able to navigate through the maze and venture deeper into it without encountering any danger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen’s heart gradually calmed down, allowing him to remain level-headed despite the intense situation. He surmised that the Daoist Sage’s incredible power would likely keep Gu Changge and the others occupied for an extended period, potentially even eliminating them all outside this cavern!</span></p>

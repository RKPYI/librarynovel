          >When Gu Changge left, the place became noisy again. Everyone was
          talking loudly about what had happened. They felt amazed and could not
          calm down. The things they had seen today, including the Scared
          Emperor Grade Weapon Gu Changge had drawn, and Chu Hao, the Third
          Prince of the Vermillion Bird Empire, had already reached the Sacred
          King Realm. Either news was enough to cause an earthquake. After all,
          it was rare enough that one could reach the Sacred Lord Realm</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Furthermore, a Peak Sacred Lord Realm expert had been forced by Gu
          Changge to the point where he ended up cutting off his own arms and
          damaging his own Source.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The news soon spread out via word of mouth, sending shockwaves
          everywhere. The Hidden Wang Family wasn&#8217;t exactly large, but no
          one would dare underestimate them. The fact that Wang Xiao, who had
          been a direct descendant from the main branch of the Hidden Wang
          Family, died after having offended Gu Changge was not a shock to many.
          After all, he had struck and hurt Gu Changge&#8217;s servant. It would
          wound Gu Changge&#8217;s reputation if he did not settle everything.
          It might even cause a great war between their different forces if he
          did not resolve this properly.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Hidden Wang Family might contain extremely ancient and powerful
          strength, but they were far inferior compared to the Immortal Gu
          Family. Many considered Gu Changge&#8217;s methods to be too violent,
          unwarranted for the situation. Yet, some thought it reasonable.
          Everyone who had offended him had never ended up well, and it
          wasn&#8217;t strange to see him do such a thing. After all, he had
          bullied and humiliated so many young prodigies before this. Even
          Ranked Disciples such as Chosen Monk Jin Chan and Sky King Zhi Yang
          had lost to him, and embarrassed themselves. Meanwhile, Wang
          Xiao&#8217;s death did not cause any shock or ripples at all.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Another thing that shocked everyone, though, was the immense strength
          Chu Hao exhibited in the confrontation. He was in the Sacred King
          Realm! Very few had even heard of this young prodigy. Even those from
          the Vermillion Bird Empire knew little about him. He had been far too
          low-profile and thus, there hadn&#8217;t been any rumours about him.
          Otherwise, such a brilliant young prodigy shouldn&#8217;t be this
          unknown.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, many cultivators found out a lot of things about Chu Hao. The
          events from his birth up to the point he showed his great Talent,
          which amazed and shocked many. On the day of his birth, many strange
          phenomena occurred, with a crane bringing a priceless gift to him.
          When he was one year old, he danced along with Dragons in the Cold
          Lake behind the palace, and thus acquired the Pill of the Cold Lake
          Water Dragon which was millions of years old. At three, he
          accidentally entered an Ancient Immortal’s Cave Mansion, thus gaining
          the Cloud-piercing Celestial Boat and the Red and Azure Dao Sword. At
          seven, he learned mysterious runes from his dreams…</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When they found out about these events, those who heard it were all
          shocked by this. They all carried feelings of admiration, hate, and
          wariness all at once. Compared to them, he was most favoured by the
          Great Dao. Someone who was practically the Son of Heaven. Such luck
          and fate silenced everyone. He was so fortunate, that it was no
          surprise that a place as small as the Empire had cultivated such a
          young prodigy.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was like a blindingly bright dark horse, gaining everyone&#8217;s
          attention at once. He was in the Sacred King Realm at merely a few
          hundred years old. Furthermore, according to several cultivators who
          had watched him, his cultivation level had already reached the Peak of
          the Ninth Minor Realms in the Sacred King Realm. In other words, he
          was just one step away from reaching the Sacred Emperor Realm.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ancient forces were immediately aware of such a great Fortuitous
          being. The mysterious and secretive Supreme Cave Heaven was soon
          placed in the spotlight. The sect might be low-profile, but their
          hidden power was no weaker than the Immortal Families and Immortal
          Sects.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Several sects even began thinking of recruiting Chu Hao. After all,
          even Ranked Disciples of the Immortal Academy might not be able to
          achieve what he had attained. The cultivation process became harder as
          one progressed, and every Minor Realm in the Sacred King Realm was
          extremely arduous. It might even require one to go into retreat and
          cultivate for millions of years. That was why the presence of a youth
          in the Sacred King Realm, only a few hundred years old, was all the
          more shocking.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, there was something that made the sects hesitate. From what
          they heard from the people present, the Vermillion Bird Empire had
          offended Gu Changge and Chu Hao had been the main cause of everything
          that had happened. These sects began to wonder if recruiting him would
          be worth it, especially if it would gain the ire of Gu Changge.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Hmm, Chu Hao&#8217;s Fortuity should be decreasing drastically after
          I humiliated him. So why is it greatly increasing instead?] Gu Changge
          noticed the change as soon as he returned to his palace and felt
          shocked. He had publicly humiliated Chu Hao and caused the latter to
          lose his citizens&#8217; confidence. Thus, it was reasonable for his
          Fortuity to drop. However, Gu Changge soon realised that the Fortuity
          he had was increasing steadily.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[This Fortuitous One, the Not Trash Archetype, is giving me many
          surprises.] Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t annoyed but pleased. This was a
          juicy, delicious fruit just waiting to be picked.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[According to the cliches, there must be another force involved in
          this. What other force is possible? Ah, the love interest.] When Gu
          Changge made the guess, his eyes flashing briefly.

          >[Although the template for almighty reincarnator is rare, it is not
          something I’ve never seen before. The words that could summarise him
          is, heaven defying luck. Though he is born as the Third Prince of the
          Vermillion Bird Empire, a background which sounds great, in the Upper
          Realm, it is basically a remote village. Even many young prodigies
          believe this place to be too desolate from the world.]</span

          >[If so, his significant other must have a special background since
          she brought him so much Fortuity.] Gu Changge smiled with interest. He
          then sent the order to his followers to closely observe the situation
          in the capital of the Empire as well as investigate any women who had
          had a close relationship with Chu Hao in the past.

          Changge held the real power there now. The entire empire, including
          the imperial palace was under his surveillance, except for Chu Hao,
          since the prince might take notice. It wasn&#8217;t realistic to
          monitor someone in the Sacred King Realm.</span

          recovered from her injuries, walked in. Her wounds had quickly healed
          after taking some pills and sacred herbs, and she was now a little
          anxious and uneasy. She was still uncertain about the situation
          despite her calm demeanour. Facing him alone, especially when she was
          concealing something, made her feel the terrifying power he radiated
          more acutely. She had never been so scared or anxious, even when she

          forces that want to gain his and his family&#8217;s favour? Your
          actions were truly reckless.&#8221; The Emperor sighed again in
          despair. Of course, he understood what his son meant, but his line of
          thought was far too simple. The Immortal Gu Family wouldn&#8217;t
          trouble themselves with them, but what about those forces who wanted
          his and his family&#8217;s favour?</span

          >&#8220;Um…&#8221; Chu Hao immediately understood the connotations and
          became pale. He had underestimated the influence and power the
          Immortal Gu Family had. Even if the Empire hadn&#8217;t done anything,
          innumerable forces would attack it to curry favour with the Immortal
          Gu Family.</span

          >&#8220;Father, I didn&#8217;t think it through…&#8221; Chu Hao said
          guiltily. &#8220;I brought this upon the Empire. His attitude was far
          too aggressive and arrogant, which had angered me and so I acted
          tactlessly…&#8221;</span

          have to discuss it. You are now in the Sacred King Realm, and anyone
          opposing us will be wary of you. I trust that the Supreme Cave Heaven
          will assist as well.&#8221;

          had reached the Sacred King REalm. Even their Ancestors had only been
          in the Sacred Lord Realm. Yet, Chu Hao had achieved this within a mere
          few hundred years. This made the Emperor glow with pride. That this
          was his son!</span

          remembering. He looked at his son with a grin. &#8220;You came back

          recalled a girl&#8217;s youthful face. How long had it been since he
          met his childhood best friend? [I wonder how is she now?]</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Outside the Palace, an attractive and charming woman was standing.
          She wore a long pale gown made of gauze, her skin flawless even
          without makeup. She looked extremely elegant and modest.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her name was Tang Wan.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She wore a polite smile as she waited, looking like a well-raised
          noble girl even without her servants accompanying her. Any stranger
          passing by would fall for her.</span

          >[Everything that happened today may have a great impact on Chu Hao,
          but I believe he will be fine] Tang Wan muttered internally, having
          witnessed the entire thing. That included when Gu Changge used the
          Sacred Emperor Grade Weapon to force Chu Hao into yielding after the
          latter showed his Sacred King Realm might.

          >In her view, Chu Hao wouldn&#8217;t have surrendered so easily if Gu
          Changge hadn&#8217;t used the people of the Empire to threaten him. It
          wasn&#8217;t that he wasn&#8217;t powerful enough, just that he was
          bound by his responsibilities and attachment to the Empire. Had it
          been somewhere else, Gu Changge would find it harder to do the same to
          Chu Hao.</span

          years, and I was the only one who had seen his brilliance back then,]
          she thought, just as she saw a tall, handsome man exit the imperial
          palace. It was Chu Hao.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They chatted after that, asking about everything that had happened
          since they separated. Chu Hao kept some things to himself but was
          honest about others, including some strange encounters. Tang Wan
          looked envious and in admiration as she listened, wishing she had been
          there.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What&#8217;s the use in that? I am still threatened no matter
          how powerful I am. I may have to isolate myself once again after this
          until I reach the Sacred Emperor Realm. At that time, no one can
          easily intimidate the Empire or my father.&#8221; He sighed, not
          concealing his woes in front of her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >&#8220;I believe in you. What about me then, Chu Hao?&#8221; She
          winked at him playfully.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No one can bully you too.&#8221; Chu Hao smiled confidently.
          He had always had special feelings towards her. He might be focused on
          cultivating, but that didn&#8217;t mean he didn&#8217;t have thoughts
          about romance. He could see that she has been waiting for him as
          well.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;But with your background, I don&#8217;t think many can bully
          you. You&#8217;ve certainly kept it a secret from me.&#8221; Chu Hao
          smiled resignedly as he recalled the past. He had always thought she
          was just a merchant&#8217;s daughter when he was younger, which was
          the reason he had treated her like a close friend and confidante. It
          was later that he knew it was the Alliance of Thousand Merchants
          backing her, and she had been concealing her true identity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was the most famous merchant alliance in the Upper Realm, with
          eyes and arms everywhere. Even though her grandfather had been the
          head of a branch of the Alliance, the power he had was far superior to
          the Empire. Chu Hao might be the Third Prince of the Vermillion Bird
          Empire, but he wouldn&#8217;t have the chance to be close to her.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t do that, how would I know how unique you are
          compared to the other young prodigies?&#8221; Tang Wan continued
          smiling at his words. She continued jokingly, &#8220;Since you are now
          in the Sacred King Realm, you will be a superior figure to whom the
          higher-ups will pay attention to. My grandfather can&#8217;t possibly
          argue anymore…&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Your Grandfather did it for your benefit. Don&#8217;t be angry
          at him.&#8221; Chu Hao waved his hands immediately.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I know. Why are you so concerned about other people&#8217;s
          feelings? If you had changed that trait of yours, you wouldn&#8217;t
          have been threatened by Gu Changge like that.&#8221; She sighed,
          smiling helplessly.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She bore no feelings when it came to Gu Changge, as she knew that
          people like him would maintain a high-and-mighty, condescending
          attitude no matter how mild-mannered and polite he behaved. The reason
          he had casually threatened the lives of the people and the Emperor,
          was that they were just mere bugs to him, who could be easily
          crushed.</span

          with him.&#8221; Chu Hao was troubled about it and clenched his
          fists.</span

          >&#8220;I have a way. Why don&#8217;t you find the other young
          prodigies who have offended Gu Changge? I heard that the Sky King Zhi
          Yang may have quarrelled with him before…&#8221; She drew a jade
          scroll from her sleeve, which contained some details she had helped
          him investigate, and handed it over.</span

          feeling touched. He couldn&#8217;t believe that she had prepared this
          before coming and even thought of a solution.</span

          Hao knew it wasn&#8217;t the time even though he felt reluctant to let
          her go. The Empire was faced with threats both inside and outside, and

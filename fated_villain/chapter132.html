        <h4>Chapter 132: Applauding her Wit; Directing Hatred at Gu Changge!</h4>
        <p> <b>[Boom!]</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er’s eyes turned cold and wings made out of light appeared behind her as she approached her target
            at breakneck speed. </p>
        <p> Her jade-like hands clenched into fists full of astonishing energy, and slammed down without hesitation.
        </p>
        <p> Pale, golden Qi permeated the surroundings like the aura of an unparalleled beast! </p>
        <p> <b>“What?!”</b> </p>
        <p> The Young Supreme of the Shark-Dragon Family was shocked — she never expected Gu Xian’er to target her so
            suddenly. Her speed was so frightening that it accelerated her to the point she couldn’t see Gu Xian’er in
            front of her. </p>
        <p> <b>[Puff!]</b> </p>
        <p> She mobilized her Spiritual Qi in a hurry to defend herself; at the same time, the fish scales on her arms
            turned into sharp heavenly knives that could cut through anything and countered Gu Xian’er’s punch. </p>
        <p> Alas! The sound of cracking bones reverberated in the surroundings. </p>
        <p> The Young Supreme of the Shark-Dragon Family flew out with a sorrowful scream and a face full of horror.
        </p>
        <p> The arms she raised to resist Gu Xian’er’s attack were directly mutilated, and the impact of her fist caused
            almost half of her body to burst apart. </p>
        <p> The cultivators in the distance couldn’t help but take in deep breaths when they witnessed the outcome of
            their exchange. Although the girl in blue appeared thin, her strength was beyond their imagination. </p>
        <p> <b>“It won’t be easy to handle her.”</b> </p>
        <p> The other Young Supreme who attacked before showed a frown and took a few steps back. Sure, his Cultivation
            Base was stronger than Gu Xian’er’s, but her defense left no way for him to take advantage of her situation.
        </p>
        <p> This left him shocked and frustrated. </p>
        <p> He was a Young Supreme in the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm, yet he couldn’t do anything against
            a little girl. </p>
        <p> The Young Supreme who joined hands with him even ended up with a gaping hole inside her body and kept
            spewing blood. </p>
        <p> Although Gu Xian’er knocked her assailants back with a single blow, one couldn’t see any trace of happiness
            from her expression. Instead, she grew even more serious as the white mist in her surroundings grew thicker
            and she couldn’t see any end to it. </p>
        <p> The mist contained ancient formations arranged by those from the Sea Families’, and those formations covered
            everything in every direction. </p>
        <p> For those from the Sea Families’, this place had turned into their natural hunting ground. </p>
        <p> <b>“What a waste!”</b> </p>
        <p> A blue-haired figure riding a golden warhorse proudly stood in the sky and looked at the scene below with an
            indifferent and contemptuous look. </p>
        <p> At the same time, she released an incomparably vast aura. </p>
        <p> Although her figure didn’t appear all that tall, her aura was far more amazing than those Sea Creatures who
            resembled hills in the sky. </p>
        <p> A long spear with golden light flowing around it could be seen in her hand, and the aura she revealed made
            it clear that she was at the Pinnacle of the Conferred King Realm! </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess didn’t act in person, and only watched the scene from the horizon, like a hunter
            watching its prey from afar. To her, it was all cat-and-mouse play. </p>
        <p> <b>“Get her for me!”</b> </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess commanded again. </p>
        <p> The reason she still didn’t make a move was because she wanted to torture the other party and make her fall
            into despair, or she wouldn’t be able to calm down the pain she felt after learning of her brother’s murder.
        </p>
        <p> She wouldn’t be able to quench her thirst for revenge if she didn’t murder the b!tch in front of her in the
            most horrible way possible. </p>
        <p> <b>“Curse you! How dare you destroy my body?!”</b> </p>
        <p> The Shark-Dragon Young Supreme howled in rage and fear; her body was almost obliterated, so she decided to
            put some distance between her and her foe to heal and reconstruct her body. </p>
        <p> She had underestimated Gu Xian’er’s strength, and never expected that she wouldn’t be able to match her
            opponent’s physical strength, and that’s what led her to suffer a massive loss. </p>
        <p> Soon, she charged towards Gu Xian’er once more, with an ugly expression. </p>
        <p> At the same time, another Young Supreme also manifested his true body with an overwhelming killing intent.
            Immediately, he turned into a massive fish that shook Heaven and Earth with every turn and wave of its
            figure. </p>
        <p> In an instant, countless brilliant runes merged together to form a blue rune that released thunder,
            lightning, rain, and fog that covered Gu Xian’er.. </p>
        <p> The battle resumed and violent turbulences of energy spread everywhere as massive explosions went off. </p>
        <p> Many of those from the younger generation couldn’t stand the turbulent winds and fluctuations, so they went
            further back to save themselves. </p>
        <p> <b>“She was able to stop two enemies far stronger than her, and even gained the upper hand in their
                exchange…this girl in blue is too strong! No wonder she was able to slaughter wave after wave of people
                from the Sea Families.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“It’s a pity that she offended someone she shouldn’t have offended.”</b> </p>
        <p> The battle in front of them shocked countless young cultivators — some showed expressions of regret, while
            others showed joy over Gu Xian’er’s misfortune. </p>
        <p> <b>[Puff!]</b> </p>
        <p> Finally, Gu Xian’er’s face paled and she spewed a mouthful of blood under the siege of the two Young
            Supremes and countless other warriors of the Sea Families. At the same time, her slender figure fell towards
            the mountain behind her like a kite with a broken string. </p>
        <p> <b>“Kill!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“She’s injured! This is our chance!”</b> </p>
        <p> All the Sea Families’ powerhouses showed joy, and even the two Young Supremes couldn’t hold back their
            happiness as they launched their strongest offensives to take down Gu Xian’er. </p>
        <p> <b>[Boom!]</b>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p> A divine flash overwhelmed Heaven and Earth, and the cultivators watching the scene couldn’t help but close
            their eyes due to the extreme brilliance. </p>
        <p> <b>“Now’s the time…”</b> </p>
        <p> A glint flashed past Gu Xian’er’s eyes as her fall halted and a golden rune appeared in her hand. Contrary
            to the thoughts of the attackers who believed she would fall, she released surging fluctuations in response
            to their offense. </p>
        <p> The golden rune in her hand turned into a dazzling sword light that radiated a terrifying killing intent.
        </p>
        <p> Although it wasn’t one of her actual trump cards, it wasn’t any worse. It was a talisman she obtained when
            she found herself in a precarious situation one time, and a blow from the talisman held the might of a True
            God Realm powerhouse. </p>
        <p> All the Sea Creatures in front of her showed a change of expression when her attack hit them, and many of
            them collapsed on the ground with their bodies torn in half from the middle. </p>
        <p> <b>“You cunning b!tch! Let me see how you escape from me.”</b> </p>
        <p> Suddenly, the Seventh Princess snorted from above and her eyes glowed with lightning as she stared at the
            golden sword talisman in Gu Xian’er’s hand. </p>
        <p> <b>“Fall!”</b> </p>
        <p> She shot out the golden spear in her hand, and it tore apart the sky and pierced through the void in one
            fell swoop. </p>
        <p> <b>[Puff!]</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er’s complexion changed drastically, and she hurriedly protected herself with a top-tier defensive
            artifact. </p>
        <p> Alas! The attack still shook her very core, and her face turned pale and bloodless. </p>
        <p> Even the golden sword talisman in her hand, which she was about to use, shattered. </p>
        <p> <b>“Holy! That was just a random blow!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“She’s too powerful! She can easily slaughter even a True God with that kind of might!”</b> </p>
        <p> Everyone in the distance was stunned and terrified by the might held by the Seventh Princess’ attack, so
            much so that those with a weaker will almost fell to their knees and fainted. </p>
        <p> The Sea King Palace was the absolute overlord of the endless sea, and dominated over countless Sea Families.
        </p>
        <p> They had never heard about the Seventh Princess’ might, so now that they witnessed it with their own eyes,
            they understood why the Sea King Palace could stand at the top of the endless sea. </p>
        <p> Not just anyone could reach the same level as her; after all, how many of the Young Supremes had broken
            through to the Pinnacle of the Conferred King Realm yet? </p>
        <p> One blow from her contained enough might to obliterate a True God. </p>
        <p> Even the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, the one known as the reincarnation of a true
            immortal, couldn’t be stronger than this, right? </p>
        <p> As a Young Supreme, he was the leader among his peers, but the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace was a
            leader among leaders of the younger generation. </p>
        <p> The slender and thin girl in blue definitely wouldn’t be her opponent anymore. </p>
        <p> Of course, the situation wasn’t fair towards the girl in blue as she wasn’t at her peak right now after
            being hunted by countless warriors from the Sea Families. </p>
        <p> No one from the younger generation stepped forward to help her, and she had to face all of the Seventh
            Princess’ followers by herself. </p>
        <p> How could this be considered a fight? </p>
        <p> It was straight-up bullying! </p>
        <p> Countless young men felt pity for the girl in blue. </p>
        <p> Her blood-stained beautiful face and icy expression gave birth to sympathy for her in their heart. </p>
        <p> Appearance made a great impact on people no matter which world you were in. </p>
        <p> <b>“Alas! I am not strong enough. If I was strong enough, I might have stepped forward to save the
                beauty…”</b> </p>
        <p> One of the Young Heavenly Genius couldn’t help but shake his head. </p>
        <p> <b>“I heard that her surname is also Gu, but it seems that the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu
                Family won’t show up; it’s clear that he doesn’t want to interfere in this matter.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“I heard that the girl in blue has a complicated relationship with the Young Master of the Ancient
                Immortal Gu Family — it’s as if they hate but don’t hate each other. It’s because of this that the
                disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace aren’t helping her.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Yeah, it won’t be good for them if they somehow enrage the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu
                Family by doing something like that.”</b> </p>
        <p> Countless cultivators discussed the matter on the surrounding mountains. All of them held different
            opinions, and many couldn’t help but sigh. </p>
        <p> The girl in blue wasn’t weak at all! </p>
        <p> She just lacked the time to grow up, otherwise, she wouldn’t be in a predicament when facing the Seventh
            Princess of the Sea King Palace. </p>
        <p> Everyone felt pity for her. </p>
        <p> <b>“You are cunning in mind and cruel in methods at such a young age, so there’s no way I will let you
                go!”</b> </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace sat on her warhorse and pointed the tip of her spear towards Gu
            Xian’er after it returned to her hands, and said in an indifferent tone. </p>
        <p> Her followers, including the two Young Supremes who stepped forward, returned in shame as they almost got
            done in by Gu Xian’er’s attack. </p>
        <p> They would be seriously injured if it weren’t for the Seventh Princess’ sudden intervention. </p>
        <p> Deep feelings of gloom filled their eyes as they thought of this and glared at Gu Xian’er. </p>
        <p> Today, they tried to capture a little girl with a Cultivation Base far worse than theirs in front of so many
            people, yet not only did they fail to capture her, but they almost died in their hands. </p>
        <p> This compounded their feelings of humiliation, and flames of rage burned in their hearts. </p>
        <p> <b>“Oh! You won’t let me go? You talk as if you are better than me, but aren’t you just a bully using her
                superior numbers?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er flew into the sky and said with a flat tone. </p>
        <div id="pf-9473-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> She stood in the air with her barefoot, snow-like feet; her hair and robes fluttered in the wind, and she
            resembled a perfect fairy created by the Heavens, with a sort of immortal temperament that gave off the aura
            of the Great Dao. </p>
        <p> She was still young, but she had a beautiful, peerless visage that couldn’t be matched by any. </p>
        <p> The discussions of the cultivators in the surroundings didn’t escape her hearing. </p>
        <p> Right now, she seemed unusually calm. Although there was a trace of blood trickling down the corner of her
            mouth, she didn’t show any fear. </p>
        <p> She recalled the words of her masters, and all sorts of thoughts went through her mind, and she calmed down.
        </p>
        <p> Since nothing seemed to work, she had no choice but to use those extremely precious artifacts left to her by
            her masters. </p>
        <p> The thought of wasting such treasures made her, a wealth-hoarding, petty girl, feel extreme pain in her
            heart. </p>
        <p> After calculating her gains and losses, Gu Xian’er naturally put all the blame on Gu Changge’s head. </p>
        <p> <b>“I am a bully? That’s interesting.”</b> </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace stood high above with a calm and satisfied expression as she
            looked down on Gu Xian’er, and it was clear that she wasn’t in a hurry to murder her prey — her eyes showed
            clear desire to tease and mock Gu Xian’er, and kick her when she was down. </p>
        <p> <b>“What would you amount to in front of me if your Cultivation Base wasn’t as high as it is?”</b> Rêađ
            lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m</p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er asked. </p>
        <p> <b>“Since my Cultivation Base is higher than yours, then there shouldn’t be any problem even if I kill you,
                right?”</b> </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace couldn’t help but sneer at her remark, and felt as if she had
            heard a joke. </p>
        <p> <b>“Right, there’s no problem, but you better not let me survive and surpass you one day!”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er looked back at her with a calm gaze. </p>
        <p> <b>“You will have no such chance! No one can save you today; little b!tch, did you ever imagine you’d fall
                into such a predicament when killing my brother?”</b> </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess’ eyes turned even frostier as she listened to her words, and she recalled the scenes
            she witnessed when she searched the souls of the beasts back then. </p>
        <p> Her younger brother was brutally murdered by this little wench in front of her eyes, and his body was
            obliterated, while his screaming Primordial Spirit was wiped from the face of this world. </p>
        <p> She was far too ruthless. </p>
        <p> <b>“He deserved to die.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er said without a change in her tone or expression. </p>
        <p> Before, she did regret her impulsive actions for a bit, but now, she was calm. </p>
        <p> With a sister like this, a brother with such a character would die at someone’s hand sooner or later, after
            all. </p>
        <p> <b>“You are courting death…”</b> </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess’ expression turned frostier than ever before, and she glared at Gu Xian’er with
            gloom-filled eyes and a distorted expression. </p>
        <p> Her followers knew full well just how much she doted on her brother. </p>
        <p> She brought him to the Ancient Immortal Continent so he could chance upon some opportunity, yet what he
            chanced upon was eternal damnation! </p>
        <p> This compounded the Seventh Princess’ fury, and she swore to not let Gu Xian’er die easily — she would
            torture her to death! </p>
        <p> <b>“You chased me for so long, but do you dare to kill me now that I am standing in front of you?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er asked with a hint of mockery in her eyes. </p>
        <p> <b>“I know your surname is Gu, and I know you are the disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace’s Great
                Elder, but so what? Who can stop me if I want to kill you?”</b> </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess sneered and looked at Gu Xian’er as if she was looking at an idiot. </p>
        <p> At the same time, she wondered what gave Gu Xian’er the confidence to stand in front of her with such calm?
        </p>
        <p> Did she still have some route of escape left? </p>
        <p> She was facing the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace, so how could she escape death now? </p>
        <p> Murder was justified inside the Ancient Immortal Continent if one wanted someone to pay for someone’s life
            with their own. </p>
        <p> <b>“If you kill me, then my brother, Gu Changge, won’t let you go! You will die a death worse than
                mine.”</b> </p>
        <p> Right then, Gu Xian’er calmed down even more and simply decided to borrow Gu Changge’s tiger skin. </p>
        <p> This way, she could shift some hatred towards Gu Changge and also prepare her escape route through a secret
            talisman that could create a channel through space. </p>
        <p> Anyway, she wouldn’t feel the slightest amount of guilt even if everyone turned their blades towards Gu
            Changge’s throat. </p>
        <p> She understood well that Gu Changge didn’t care about her, so she held no expectations towards him now that
            she had reached this point. </p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge…”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Are you really trying to use his name right now?”</b> </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess never expected Gu Xian’er to use Gu Changge’s name right now, so she couldn’t help but
            sneer. </p>
        <p> <b>“Do you think I don’t know about the deep hatred between you and Gu Changge? Why would he care about your
                life and death? Even if Gu Changge did show up somehow, do you think I am afraid of him? What
                reincarnation of a True Immortal? That’s nonsense and we will know if it’s true or false, won’t we?”</b>
        </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess’ eyes froze over, and she immediately saw through Gu Xian’er’s words. If she wasn’t
            trying to beat Gu Xian’er down into despair, she would never talk so much nonsense with her. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er sneered when she heard her words, and said with a calm tone, <b>“You are nothing but an outsider,
                so how can you be confident about my relationship with Gu Changge?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“If you dare to touch me, my beloved brother will definitely slaughter you! If you don’t believe it, then
                go ahead and try it; he’s just being held back because of something, or he would have come here
                already…”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er couldn’t help but want to applaud her wit.</p>

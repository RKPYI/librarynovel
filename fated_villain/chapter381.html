          his clothes fluttering. He looked otherworldly as he moved at a
          moderate pace down the invisible gold Great Daos under his feet. These
          Great Daos, for those who can perceive them, seemed to be made of
          different Principles and strange runes. In the next instant, he had
          already appeared in front of everyone as if from thin air. His ability
          in crossing such great distances in a flash shocked many, their pupils
          contracting. Meanwhile, the Masters of the Immortal Wang Family, Sky
          Emperor Mountain, and the Ancient Ye Family frowned deeply as they

          Xiao Ruoyin, part of the group from Skyward Schloss, looked over in
          surprise and glee. Meanwhile, Song Qin and the other disciples envied
          her behaviour, as only someone familiar and intimate with him would
          act this way.</span

          had already heard that name many times. There were many shocking
          rumours about him. The honour of being the greatest of the younger
          generation was unimaginable. His strength seemed to crush that of his
          peers like a giant mountain, making it hard for them to breathe.
          Anyone who heard his name in the Upper Realm now reacted with fear and
          reverence, not daring to show any discourtesy. She had had the thought
          of visiting him to see who exactly he was after dealing with the Godly
          Illusion Tomb but she hadn&#8217;t expected to meet him under such
          circumstances. For the first time, she felt that things have become
          way too complex.

          at him with caution, realising that they couldn&#8217;t discern his
          strength. The rumours claimed he could already fight with someone in
          the Sacred King Realm, which to them felt like strength borrowed from
          the power of a Sacred Emperor Grade Artifact. The man himself was
          probably just a little stronger than the other younger Sacred Emperor
          Realm experts.</span

          young prodigy. There was a massive chasm between them. Except for the
          Successor of Demonic Arts, no one of the younger generation in the
          entire Upper Realm could possibly win against him.</span

          face was already disguised, but who knew if Gu Changge could see
          through it? His fear for the other man was already deeply
          ingrained.</span

          preventing him from moving. He had thought he would be saved after his
          sister said those words, but who knew Gu Changge would suddenly appear
          or that his first words were to ask Gu Xianer to kill him? His back
          was damp with cold sweat, and his face became pale. He naturally knew
          who Gu Changge was, which made him feel desperate when he heard the
          order.</span

          again?&#8221; he asked after glancing at her. He had already sensed
          what was happening here from outside the Godly Illusion Tomb. So, he
          abandoned his followers to come here first. He knew all about what had
          happened and why she was so indecisive. He didn&#8217;t think there
          was anything to be pondered about here. After all, she just needed to
          kill the man.</span

          among themselves. It was obvious how much he spoiled her. On any other
          day, who else dared to speak that way to him? Only she would do that,
          and he would allow her to do so without caring. Many prodigal damsels
          began envying her, wondering why they didn&#8217;t have a brother like

          Godly Illusion Clan. However, Jiang Luoshen and the other Masters of
          the Clan felt hesitant after hearing his call for help, as they
          couldn&#8217;t just witness him getting killed without doing something
          about it. Nonetheless, were afraid of the repercussions if they did
          make a move.</span

          otherwise, he would never do this. This is just a
          misunderstanding.&#8221; Jiang Luoshen decided to let go of her pride.
          This was extremely rare since she had always been cold and

          Godly Illusion Tomb, they got to watch such an entertaining scene. It
          was like the rumours claimed; even when confronted by a group of
          Masters from the Godly Illusion Clan, Gu Changge maintained his
          forcefulness without any intention of yielding. Many Sect Masters were

          serve me drinks. What do you think of that? If you aren&#8217;t

          behind the strike made the ground shake and nearly crack from the

          The entrance to the Six Paths of Reincarnation stood tall while a
          yellow, dirty river concealing unfathomable numbers of ghosts and

          someone from the Godly Illusion Clan. Those in the Clan were beings
          whose battle strength dwarfed others within the same cultivation

          They would have refused to believe this as it was unimaginable, yet it

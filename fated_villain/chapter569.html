          >“An old friend is looking for me?” Xiao Ruoyin was sitting
          cross-legged in the chamber, her body covered with glowing silver
          runes. Her eyes snapped open when she heard the voice of a disciple
          outside reporting to her.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She furrowed her brow as she wondered if it was Jiang Chen looking
          for her. Since she had been staying inside, she was unaware of the
          events that had unfolded in the Starcatching Pavilion earlier that
          day.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Indeed, this is a letter from your old friend. Please have a look,
          Senior Ruoyin,” the disciple outside the chamber spoke with utmost
          respect, holding the letter in his hand. After some contemplation,
          Xiao Ruoyin nodded and rose from her seat. She walked toward the exit
          of the chamber, curious as to why Jiang Chen sought her out. In any
          case, she also wanted to meet him and try to reclaim her Celestial
          Boat of Creation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As she unfolded the letter, surprise filled her face before her
          delicate brow furrowed deeply. “It’s not Jiang Chen who is looking for
          me but Niu Tian?”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin’s expression changed as she recognized the writing in the
          letter, which only she and those from her world could understand. The
          message was very brief, informing her Jiang Chen was in dire need of
          assistance. She hesitated for a moment, considering whether to meet
          with Niu Tian.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After she had regained her memories as the High Priestess of Destiny,
          she had little interest in rekindling old friendships, including Niu
          Tian and Jiang Chen. Her sole focus was on restoring herself to the
          pinnacle of her strength. After all, nothing was more important to her
          than the Great Dao. She had only given Jiang Chen a little more
          attention because he was an incarnation of her Celestial Boat of
          Creation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What sort of predicament has Jiang Chen found himself in? Is it so
          dire that Niu Tian must seek my aid?” After contemplating the matter
          at hand, Xiao Ruoyin regained her composure and made the decision to
          meet with Niu Tian. She swiftly located him in the corner of the inn
          near the palace, as mentioned in the letter.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Ruoyin, you’re here!” Niu Tian’s worried expression turned into
          pleasant surprise as soon as he saw Xiao Ruoyin. Her unexpectedly
          swift arrival proved her unwavering concern for Jiang Chen’s wellbeing
          and that she would never turn a blind eye to his plight.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The current Xiao Ruoyin was a far cry from the one he once knew.
          Though her appearance remained largely unchanged, she now exuded an
          air of loneliness and detachment, as if she was an enigmatic fairy
          from the moon. Her black hair swayed gently and her white clothes
          billowed in the wind. Her face was still exquisitely beautiful and her
          crystal clear eyes seemed to hold a world of secrets within
          them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Compared to Niu Tian who had risen from his seat and was visibly
          excited, Xiao Ruoyin was calm and collected. She cast him a mere
          glance then asked, “What kind of trouble has Jiang Chen gotten into
          for you to come seeking my assistance?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her words lacked emotion, showing no interest in catching up with her
          old friend. The distant and indifferent expression on her face caused
          Niu Tian’s smile to falter, leaving him feeling a bit uneasy and
          incredulous. He slowly settled back into his seat, his wry smile
          deepening as he felt a sense of disappointment. He couldn’t help but
          recall the things Jiang Chen had mentioned to him. [Xiao Ruoyin really
          seems like a completely different person now…]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I wouldn’t have bothered you if it weren’t urgent, but I really have
          no other option. Jiang Chen’s life is in peril… and you’re the only
          one who can save him. He was captured under Gu Changge’s order at the
          Starcatching Pavilion today.” Niu Tian took a deep breath, composed
          himself, and proceeded to recount the events of the day to Xiao Ruoyin
          in a clear and concise manner.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Jiang Chen was captured by Gu Changge?” Upon hearing these words,
          Xiao Ruoyin furrowed her brow, realising that the situation was far
          more troublesome than Niu Tian had thought. Despite the perception
          that she was living a comfortable life, she was constantly walking on
          eggshells around Gu Changge every day. How could she possibly save
          Jiang Chen?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“He couldn’t help it. When we were at the Starcatching Pavilion, Gu
          Changge seemed to have already seen through Jiang Chen’s disguise.
          Jiang Chen is being held captive right now, and at the mercy of Gu
          Changge. Given how cruel and merciless he is, Jiang Chen may be
          subjected to unimaginable torture. Unless he is rescued, his chances
          of survival are grim.” Niu Tian let out a heavy sigh, his words laced
          with sadness.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin fell silent for a moment. Without much emotion on her
          face and in her voice, she asked, “What makes you think I am able to
          save him?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Niu Tian smiled wryly and said, “I believe you have a way to do it,
          given how well Gu Changge treats you. Perhaps a few well-placed words
          from you could make him consider releasing Jiang Chen for your
          sake.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin frowned, uncertain if Niu Tian was being serious or just
          jesting. He should know the true nature of Gu Changge. Persuading him
          could lead to dire repercussions and she could only imagine how Gu
          Changge would react to the situation. It might even make her current
          situation worse.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As Xiao Ruoyin remained silent, Niu Tian couldn’t help but feel
          uneasy. He feared that she might reject his proposal and hastily
          clarified, “Please don’t misunderstand, Ruoyin. I don’t have any other
          ulterior motives. When Gu Changge set us free from the dungeon, he
          must have been aware of your relationship with Jiang Chen. Given your
          friendship with him, Gu Changge would surely understand if you were to
          appeal for him. If that’s not an option, then I&#8217;ll have to come
          up with an alternative plan.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After a brief silence, Xiao Ruoyin sighed inwardly and said, “I
          understand. I’ll do everything in my power to rescue Jiang Chen, but I
          cannot make any promises.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite her reservations, she knew there was no other option. If Gu
          Changge killed Jiang Chen, she would lose the Celestial Boat of
          Creation forever. Therefore, she had no choice but to find a way to
          save Jiang Chen. At least, she must prevent his death at the hands of
          Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“That’s great, I knew you would agree.” Niu Tian’s face lit up with
          joy as he let out a long sigh of relief. After getting Xiao Ruoyin’s
          agreement, he didn’t stay for too long and quickly left to avoid
          causing Xiao Ruoyin further trouble.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He believed that she must have made certain sacrifices to attain her
          current position. Beyond her stunning appearance, he struggled to
          think of any other qualities that she could have used to her
          advantage.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“How troublesome…” Once Niu Tian had departed, Xiao Ruoyin shook her
          head. She pondered for a moment before heading toward the place where
          Gu Changge was now staying.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was aware that Gu Changge would be leading a group to Kun
          Mountain to rescue the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family the following
          day. If she didn’t hurry to meet Gu Changge today, she had no idea how
          long she would have to wait for the next opportunity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">……</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Splash!!* In the damp and dark dungeon, a young man lay unconscious
          on the floor, his body drenched in blood. Suddenly, a basin of cold
          water was poured over him, jolting him awake. His bloodshot eyes
          snapped open, ablaze with rage and resentment.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Awake?” The warden sneered as he set down the basin he had refilled
          with cold water for the next pour. Jiang Chen slowly regained his
          consciousness and attempted to get up from the ground.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He felt excruciating pain all over his body, probably caused by the
          numerous broken bones and ruptured internal organs in his body. The
          old man who was dressed like a butler had hit him so hard that he felt
          worse than getting crushed under a mountain. Had he not possessed the
          Sacred Physique of Creation, his injury would have been much
          worse.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What is this place?” Jiang Chen surveyed his surroundings, and
          noticed the bloodstains and scratches that marred the walls. Not only
          that, there were also cold chains specially used as torture device to
          discolate shoulders. It was clear that he was in a dungeon. He then
          noticed the figure of a man in black standing before him. Jiang Chen
          shuddered. Humiliation, anger, and resentment filled his eyes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Gu&#8230; Chang&#8230; ge!” With an intense gaze, he uttered the
          words through gritted teeth. Standing behind Gu Changge were Ji
          Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue, who couldn’t bring herself to meet his gaze.
          During the banquet, Jiang Chen had been staring at her, and though she
          understood his intentions, she shied away from his gaze even until
          now.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“It appears that your injury is not severe enough. You still have the
          strength to speak.” Gu Changge smiled. The warden served him a cup of
          piping hot tea, which he leisurely blew on to cool it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge’s nonchalance caused Jiang Chen to clench his teeth so
          hard that he nearly shattered them. Despite the excruciating pain
          coursing through his body, he was prepared to launch himself at Gu
          Changge with all his might. “You’re going to pay for this!”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before he could even make a move, the stern-looking warden
          intervened, delivering a swift kick to Jiang Chen. “How dare you act
          so insolently in the presence of Young Master! Cease your
          foolishness!”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Oooogggg!!” Jiang Chen was unable to withstand the force of the kick
          in his current condition. Blood and bits of his damaged internal
          organs spewed out of his mouth as he was sent flying into the wall,
          further adding to his already pathetic state. Ji Chuyue was filled
          with sympathy for him, but she did not dare to speak out of turn in Gu
          Changge’s presence.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Sister, it would be better for you to tell him yourself,” Ji Yaoxing
          shook his head and advised Ji Chuyue. He was concerned that Gu Changge
          might misunderstand the situation, so he advised Ji Chuyue to sever
          ties with Jiang Chen. This would allow both parties to move on and let
          go of any false hopes.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Chuyue’s delicate face was slightly pale. Her gaze flitted between
          her brother and the seemingly indifferent Gu Changge before she
          gritted her teeth and stepped forward resolutely. As if the
          realisation had dawned upon her, her countenance gradually relaxed
          into a peaceful composure.</span

          >“Chuyue… I know you have your own circumstances and don’t have many
          choices in this matter. I don’t blame you.” Jiang Chen got up from the
          ground, gazing at her with an understanding smile. He seemed to have
          anticipated what Ji Chuyue was about to say.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Jiang Chen, stop deceiving yourself. Haven’t you realised the truth
          yet? Why has your true identity been revealed?” Ji Chuyue shook her
          head and spoke in a chilly tone, “You’re an intelligent man. Young
          Master Gu is a merciful man. If you cooperate with him, there’s a
          possibility that he may pardon your actions and spare your
          life.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite the excruciating pain coursing through his body, Jiang Chen
          couldn’t help but laugh. He knew that Ji Chuyue was coerced into
          saying all that. She was a gentle soul who would never betray his
          trust and expose his identity. She was merely putting up an act.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Jiang Chen would just cooperate with Gu Changge, his life could be
          spared. She was determined to rescue Jiang Chen, but why couldn’t he
          see that?</span

          speaking. He then approached her and, with a swift movement, wrapped
          his arm around her slender waist, leaving her momentarily stunned and
          bewildered.</span

          me to be frank with you. The Ji Family is seeking to rescue their
          Prime Ancestor, and as the Successor of a Divine Source Master, you
          possess the ability to aid them in Kun Mountain. By rescuing the Ji
          Family’s Prime Ancestor, they will regard you as their benefactor, and
          you may even earn the gratitude of their Prime Ancestor. You have been
          considering the possibility of winning the heart of Ji Chuyue, no?
          With the support of the Ji Family’s Prime Ancestor, it may be possible
          for you to become their esteemed son-in-law.”</span

          contorted into an expression of pure rage, his eyes blazing with fury.
          He could hardly restrain himself from chopping off Gu Changge’s hand
          then and there.</span

          or more like he was intentionally ignoring it. With a gentle smile, he
          reached out to softly stroke Ji Chuyue’s delicate and fearful face.

          concubine. If you wish to prevent her from being subjected to my whims
          like today, I suggest you find a way to rescue her. Save the Prime
          Ancestor of the Ji Family, earn the opportunity to marry Ji Chuyue and
          become the respected son-in-law of the Ji Family, or be killed by me.

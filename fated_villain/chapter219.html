      <h4>
        Chapter 219-1: The routines are too old, he should come up with new
        tricks, Building the immortal road to the sky (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Through Jiang Chuchu's body, Gu Changge saw the plan against the human
        ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The faith of the beings in heaven and earth was a great source of luck
        for the human ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>And such a thing as faith was very illusory.</p>
      <p>
        The means of smearing sounded easy, but when implemented, they were
        actually very unrealistic.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the plan to replace the human ancestor failed, Gu Changge would
        consider this, reversing right and wrong, confusing black and white,
        this kind of thing was something he was always good at.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That said, the merits of the human ancestor is not that easy to
        discredit, after all, it‚Äôs kind of a brilliant role, if I really want to
        stain it, it‚Äôs not going to be easy, in the history of the long river of
        time, many truths were covered up."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Human Ancestor Hall prefers to establish such an image, so that the
        beings of heaven and earth would worship and chant for them."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's not like it's not rewarding, maybe this guy's cultivation style of
        the human ancestor is related to faith."
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge left the inner world and went back inside the
        Taixu Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Jiang Chuchu, he didn't get any effective method, but the scope of
        the Heavenly Star Realm was only eight domains.
      </p>
      <p>There was no hurry.</p>
      <p>
        If the forces of the Human Ancestor Hall really wanted to descend into
        this realm, he could consider ambushing a handful of people and
        finishing them off here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual location of the reincarnated body of the human ancestor could
        not be found by Jiang Chuchu, but she could sense the people of the
        Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge would have all the means to make her talk.</p>
      <p>
        "In addition to that, it is necessary to keep an eye on the whereabouts
        of Yue Mingkong‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge closed his eyes, the eyes on Yue Mingkong, again played a
        great role at this time. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>Soon, he sensed the exact area of Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>Flood domain.</p>
      <p>
        It was at least a hundred million miles away from the Xuan domain where
        he was now, so it wasn't too much trouble if he wanted to rush there.
      </p>
      <p>He just didn't plan to show himself in front of Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>
        In the following days, the whole Xuan domain was in a terrible turmoil.
      </p>
      <p>
        A profoundly cultivated and mysterious superior immortal descended to
        the Taixu Sect, and even had an old relationship with the ancestor of
        the Taixu Sect from 800,000 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>This news swept all around.</p>
      <p>
        For a while, it caused the other three major powers to become anxious
        and precarious, fearing that the Taixu Sect would suddenly attack and
        unify the entire Xuan domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, in this situation, no matter who it was, one would certainly
        swell up with ambition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Taixu Sect was already strong and domineering, and now with this
        Supreme Immortal sitting on top of them, they would not make a move
        towards the rest of the forces?
      </p>
      <p>In everyone's opinion, it was only a matter of time.</p>
      <p>
        And soon, along with an oracle that came out from the Taixu Sect, the
        entire Xuan Domain was in uproar.
      </p>
      <p>"The Xuan domain needs to be unified."</p>
      <p>
        It was a very simple, understated voice, delivered by the Taixu Sect
        Patriarch himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this news, all cultivators and creatures were shocked and stood
        frozen in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        To them, it seemed that although it was transmitted by the Taixu Sect
        Patriarch, it was clearly the meaning of that Upper Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        That mysterious superior immortal was going to help the Taixu Sect unify
        the Xuan domain!
      </p>
      <p>Soon, this news quickly swept through like a big earthquake!</p>
      <p>
        One of the other three forces in the Xuan Domain, the Heavenly Forest
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>Inside the main hall.</p>
      <p>
        The current Saint Lord of the Heavenly Forest Sect was speaking to a
        group of elder disciples in front of him with a grave expression,
        saying.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Taixu Sect will definitely not let us go, that superior immortal
        can easily break the barrier of realms, his strength is absolutely
        unfathomable, reaching an unknowable realm."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Even if we wake up our oldest ancestors, it probably won't help. Now it
        has reached a critical moment of survival‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>His voice was heavy, as was his mood, and he slowly finished these.</p>
      <p>
        "How can this Taixu Sect be so lucky that such a terrifying superior
        immortal has descended to help them!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm not willing! Could it be that the foundation of my Heavenly Forest
        Sect for hundreds of thousands of years is now going to be destroyed?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why? Why? Isn't it good to stay in the upper world? Why did he have to
        come down to‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "He‚Äôs clearly an immortal from the nine heavens, why is he in this
        mortal world? Meddling with the affairs among the mole crickets."
      </p>
      <p>Hearing these words, many elders had a face of despair.</p>
      <p>
        They did not want the sect that they had painstakingly operated for
        hundreds of thousands of years to fall into the hands of the Taixu Sect,
        nor did they want to submit to the Taixu Sect, but what could they do?
      </p>
      <p>Resist?</p>
      <p>
        With such actions, the consequence was tantamount to burying the entire
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire Heavenly Forest Sect was enveloped in this desperate,
        unwilling emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Against Gu Changge, they could not resist in the slightest, nor did they
        dare to resent!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Xuan domain, they were high and mighty figures who could easily
        decide the life and death of countless creatures and cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the eyes of that immortal, they were not even enough to be ants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things like the Heavenly Forest Sect were still being played out in the
        rest of the major powers today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this oracle, the entire Xuan domain was plunged into this
        oppressive atmosphere of fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the powers, except for the Taixu Sect, were incomparably
        worried, especially the cultivators who personally witnessed that Upper
        Immortal descending into the world that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >How far was the strength of an upper immortal who could give a divine
          weapon at will? Who could know?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >What should we do at this time? Naturally, it is to honestly obey the
          order, show the intention of submission, do not try to resist, because
          there is only a dead end.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        With such thoughts, many of the great powers in the Xuan domain were not
        stupid and began to take the initiative to surrender to the Taixu Sect,
        willing to submit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators realized that the Xuan domain, which had been in
        constant strife, had begun to achieve unification at this time.
      </p>
      <p>This news also alarmed several other domains.</p>
      <p>
        In terms of the entire Heavenly Star Realm, the overall power of the
        Xuan Domain could only be considered to be at the upper middle level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except the Heavenly Domain, where the Dragon Veins of the Heavenly Star
        Realm converged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the top powers of the domains, at this time, were more or
        less aware that a mysterious Immortal had appeared in the Tai Xu Sect of
        the Xuan Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many rumors about this immortal also began to spread among the
        cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some said that he was an old acquaintance of the ancestor of the Taixu
        Sect 800,000 years ago, and that he was an ancient being who had lived
        for millions of years, with an unfathomable cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others said that it was an immortal posture, divine bones of the exiled
        immortal, immortal intent dazzling, and one simply could not see the
        appearance.
      </p>
      <p>For a time, the Heavenly Star Realm became dark and turbulent.</p>
      <p>
        The forces led by the Taixu Sect also searched for all kinds of talented
        and powerful young heavenly talents during this period of time under the
        pretext of recruiting disciples.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one suffered a setback when he was young and then soared to the sky,
        it was even better, and would be given preferential treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Xuan domain was vast and boundless, and the number of cultivators
        and living beings was simply too many to count.
      </p>
      <p>But there were very few young talents who met these conditions.</p>
      <p>
        The Taixu Sect would do this, in many people's opinion, there was no
        excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, after the unification of the Xuan domain, they urgently
        needed a lot of manpower and wide recruitment of disciples or something
        was too normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        "His luck is indeed quite a bit more than the average geniuses, but
        obviously compared with the reincarnation of human ancestor, it's still
        far from the same, it's simply a difference of the worlds."
      </p>
      <p>"There is no comparison."</p>
      <p>
        "However, it is better than nothing, a few thousand luck points are
        better than nothing."
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the main hall, Gu Changge shook his head slightly, looking a
        little disappointed, and waved his hand to let the Taixu Sect Patriarch
        go back.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stared at the young genius who looked shocked and appalled, still
        unaware of what was about to happen, and looked a bit puzzled.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Hearing this young genius's origin, Gu Changge was a little interested
        at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this young genius had also been down and out for a while,
        suffering a fianc√©e's withdrawal and betrayal by his childhood
        sweetheart.
      </p>
      <p>
        His mother, a young lady from a large family, was passing through a
        certain place and was attacked by the enemy and was seriously injured.
      </p>
      <p>As a result, his father stepped forward and saved her.</p>
      <p>
        The two then got attached, got married, and gave birth to this young
        genius, and then the usual drama.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mother's identity was discovered, the clan forcibly sent people to
        take her away, seriously hurt his father, but cut the grass and not
        remove the root, forcibly pulled a brainless hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bitter teenager carried the powerful bloodline of his mother's clan,
        but because of his father, resulting in meridian depression, was treated
        as a waste of time for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not easy to get a divine blood grass by chance, and was cheated
        by his childhood friend.
      </p>
      <p>What happened after that, Gu Changge di not ask anymore.</p>
      <p>
        He had thought that it would be good leeks, but it turned out that there
        were not many luck points at all, no, for him now, the luck points could
        only stuff his teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know what‚Äôs the matter that the superior immortal summoned me
        here?"
      </p>
      <p>
        This young genius still looked somewhat calm in front of Gu Changge, and
        did not panic.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he was a son of luck, and still had an edge in terms of guts.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge was too lazy to talk nonsense, and didn't even
        bother to pay attention to him.
      </p>
      <p>With a puff!</p>
      <p>A palm directly covered down!</p>
      <p>
        After casually harvesting the thousands of luck points of this scrappy
        reverse stream son of luck, Gu Changge soon fell into thinking again.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked thoughtful and began to consider what went wrong, looking
        around, but not many sons of luck appeared.
      </p>
      <p>Still the usual routine was too old.</p>
      <p>
        This time the reincarnation of the human ancestor should have some new
        tricks, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that waiting for the rabbit is not going to work, I have to go
        around to do it, if I only rely on these people, I'm afraid it will not
        work."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Gu Changge then got up and left the Taixu Sect,
        appearing outside in the high sky.
      </p>
      <p>With a single step, he blurred the void and was gone in an instant.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>At the same time, the Heavenly Star Realm, the Heavenly Domain.</p>
      <p>
        In the middle of a remote and vast deep mountain, the mountain was lofty
        and stretched endlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spiritual aura was dense, ancient trees were in the sky, the aroma of
        divine medicine was incomparably fragrant, and the spiritual aura of
        heaven and earth was rising up everywhere, transforming into various
        fierce beasts.
      </p>
      <p>True Dragon, divine Phoenix, Black Tortoise, Qilin ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        If there were proficient in the direction of the terrain, dragon line
        cultivators here would certainly be shocked to stare at this place to
        find the anomaly to come.
      </p>
      <p>The various mountains were like resurrected and appear majestic.</p>
      <p>
        Looking down from high altitude, a dragon vein converged and warms this
        place.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it were in the upper world, it would definitely be a place to fly to
        immortality, which would attract all parties to fight for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this moment, many cultivators and creatures were gathered here,
        all kind of races with majestic bloodlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the excavation of the mountains below, they seemed to be building
        something.
      </p>
      <p>
        High in the sky, a strong man shrouded in divine glory and aura was
        standing.
      </p>
      <p>He was wielding a whip, and scolding the cultivators below.</p>
      <p>
        Apparently, the crowd of cultivators and living beings below were all
        treated as slaves and were doing hard labor here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their expressions were dull and indifferent, just like the walking dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        They only knew to build altars and other things here, seemingly unaware
        of the hard work.
      </p>
      <p>
        A powerful being with two wings on his back, like a blue-colored stern
        ghost, looked down on the people below, and with a smug face, said to
        the few people next to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Today I have captured another group of slaves, this merit, when the
        time comes, I must let the patriarch give me a reward!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Definitely take note, definitely take note, Brother Qing Gui just don't
        worry."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You have joined my Immortal Lun Sect for less than a hundred years, and
        you have already made great achievements, and you have been promoted to
        the position of deacon, which makes us envious."
      </p>
      <p>
        "In the future, when the road to immortality opens, among the great
        events of my Immortal Lun Sect, Brother Qing Gui will definitely take
        the lead and soar to the upper realm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 219-2: The routines are too old, he should come up with new
        tricks, Building the immortal road to the sky (2)
      </h4>
      <p>Next to several strong people, they heard the words and laughed.</p>
      <p>
        In the words of this strong man named green ghost, there was a little
        flattering and ingratiating.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason was also very simple, because the creature named Green Ghost,
        had already reached the cultivation level of the God King realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were only at the Heavenly God realm, which was more than a chip
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, this Green Ghost was now highly valued by the
        Immortal Lun Sect, and his future success was unlimited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now he was responsible for guarding this place of the old antiquities,
        which was also very important to its reassurance.
      </p>
      <p>Many important things were given to him.</p>
      <p>
        On hearing this, the green ghost also smiled smugly, after getting
        bragged about, he appeared to be in a good mood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, remembering what the Sect master had explained, he looked right
        and said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There is no mistaking the echo this time, this is the perfect time for
        us to raise our clan to ascend to the upper realm, the ancestors of
        Immortal Lun are waiting for us up there!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Forge the road to immortality, cut down the sky and ascend, today!"
      </p>
      <p>
        His words also ignited the emotions in the hearts of the people beside
        him, and when they thought of what was going to happen in the future,
        they couldn't help but become overwhelmed with emotions.
      </p>
      <p>They also became incomparably excited.</p>
      <p>
        The rest of the people also spoke up, their expressions were angry and
        resigned, but with emotions such as yearning and longing.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes! Forging the path to immortality, such great achievements, who can
        think of it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Nowadays, it is difficult to ascend to the upper realm, in the entire
        Heavenly Star Realm, it has been almost 200,000 years since anyone has
        ascended, and now they are all wondering if the path to the upper realm
        is broken?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since the heaven wants to stop us, then why should we obey the heaven!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Casting the road to immortality is the best chance for our Immortal Lun
        Sect to raise our faction to the upper realm! No one will know that we
        have found the perfect place to fly to immortality in the canon here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, thinking about this matter, they all had hot eyes and could
        not wait for that day to come soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ascend to the upper world, that was almost all cultivators' lifelong
        dream and pursuit.
      </p>
      <p>They were naturally no exception.</p>
      <p>
        Now, there was such an opportunity in front of them, how could they not
        be excited and thrilled?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Lun Sect was an extremely mysterious and powerful force in
        the current Heavenly Star Realm, with an incomparably long heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sacred realm elders known to the world alone were nearly ten,
        sitting in the secr, no one dared to offend them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to this, there were also the Great Sacred realm ancestors
        and other existences, and it was suspected that there was a great sacred
        realm existence sealed deep in the sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of heritage was astonishing in the Heavenly Star Realm, strong
        and prosperous!
      </p>
      <p>
        And at its peak, there were rumors that there was a supreme being in the
        Immortal Lun Sect, the ancestor of the current Immortal Lun Sect!
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the rumors, it seemed that this Immortal Lun Supreme was not the
        original character of the Heavenly Star Realm, and had a very odd
        origin, not a human race.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, it was a kind of congenital birth, born with an
        extremely terrifying strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, he created the Immortal Lun Sect and disappeared, and he is said
        to have left this realm and ascended.
      </p>
      <p>Under the many rumors, no one was clear about the truth.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        But about the powerful mystery of the Immortal Lun Sect, there was no
        doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Heavenly domain, only a few forces dared to provoke the Immortal
        Lun Sect, and had also disappeared into the dust and smoke of history.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I heard that an incomparably mysterious upper immortal has recently
        appeared in the Xuan domain, could it be that he came down here because
        he sensed movement in the upper realm?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, a strong person suddenly spoke up and mentioned this
        matter, instantly attracting everyone's attention.
      </p>
      <p>The Green Ghost was no exception.</p>
      <p>
        An immortal coming from the upper realm, just these words alone gave an
        unparalleled terrifying deterrent effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's unlikely, if the ancestor didn't have a feeling and entrusted a
        dream to the patriarch to let us forge the path to immortality. How
        could we possibly know such things? I think this matter should be a
        coincidence, right?"
      </p>
      <p>The person next to him shook his head.</p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, it's better to be careful, don't let anyone notice what's going
        on here in the Flying Immortal Mountain. Especially that immortal of the
        Xuan domain, I just hope it leaves soon!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Understood, the matter is important, when catching the hard labor, I
        will also be careful. The repercussions and ominousness of destroying
        the terrain of the Flying Immortal Mountain is not something that
        ordinary cultivators can bear, several batches of hard laborers have
        died‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on nùíê/v/ùíÜ/l(b)iùíè(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>
        They said, with a worried gaze, swept over the crowd of toilers below
        who were reclaiming and digging to build the altar, intending to forge
        the road to immortality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The matter of casting into the immortal road, in fact, began more than
        ten years ago, except that the natural terrain of the Flying Immortal
        Mountain, involving a lot of mysteries.
      </p>
      <p>
        It always invited a lot of ominous, causing the process to push back.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hey, how is this guy still alive! I remember the toilers who came with
        him, all died, and he had boiled three groups of people to death‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, a strong man suddenly noticed a tall youth with a pale
        face and tattered and blood-stained clothes below, but with an
        incomparably resolute look, and could not help but be a little
        surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        This somewhat tall youth, who looked 18 or 19 years old, was gritting
        his teeth and digging at the mountain rocks in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        His face was full of stains and looked dirty, but it was hard to hide
        his beautiful face.
      </p>
      <p>
        And there was an inexplicable aura about him that could not be concealed
        even in the midst of a crowd, and one could not help but notice him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh? Isn't this the young man I took when I passed by a small village? I
        still remember that his name was Jiang Yang."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, the strong man named Green Ghost said with a dazed
        expression, carefully identifying and recognizing the youth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "At that time, I found that his physique seemed to be a bit special, his
        aura and strength far exceeded that of ordinary people, so I thought I
        might have found a miracle talent and brought him back to the Sect. But
        I did not expect that it would be the kind of cursed desolate sacred
        body, difficult to break the shackles of cultivation‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Even with the resources of my Immortal Lun Sect, he can not be
        cultivated, that is a bottomless pit, thinking that he has good
        strength, thrown here to cut the mountain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>He continued, explaining the origins of that youth for the crowd.</p>
      <p>At these words, the crowd all dawned.</p>
      <p>
        They turned to look at that youth's eyes, which have changed, with a
        strong regret.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the Desolate Sacred Body, as can be seen from the name, was a
        waste physique, cursed by a certain existence in ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how many resources were consumed, there was no possibility of
        a breakthrough in cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This kind of physique, how long has it been seen? No wonder it could
        boil so many batches of hard labor to death, this strength is indeed
        amazing."
      </p>
      <p>
        Several people nodded their heads and soon did not continue to care.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, a small cricket-like character would, sooner or later exhaust
        their essence and strength, and die here.
      </p>
      <p>It was not worth their care.</p>
      <p>
        If it was the Desolate Sacred Body without curse, they would probably
        still treat it as a treasure and do their best to cultivate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after being cursed, this was a wastrel, without power and authority,
        only worthy of being a albor here!
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "I can't die here, I have to go back, I have to see my sister and
        granny‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Sister is still so young, if I die here, what will she do?"</p>
      <p>
        "Grandma is also so old, frail and sickly, older, but there is no one
        who can take care of her."
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this moment, the young man named Jiang Yang below, his eyes
        muddled, his body stained with blood, was struggling to reclaim the
        mountain rocks in front of him, his mouth muttering.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was like a walking corpse, his fingers were already bloody, but he
        still didn't give up, there was a belief and strength that was holding
        him up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strong man in charge of this place told him that if he survived
        three years, he would be able to leave.
      </p>
      <p>There were still one year and 300 days left until three years.</p>
      <p>He kept that in mind for all this time.</p>
      <p>
        "Why bother? You just need to accept my existence and you don't have to
        suffer this torture anymore."
      </p>
      <p>At this time, a voice rang out in Jiang Yang's mind.</p>
      <p>
        Like with helplessness and sigh, more like a kind of compassion for the
        world sublime and great.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I am me, why should I accept you? Who the hell are you? Get the hell
        out of my body!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this voice, Jiang Yang's spirit, which was still a bit muddled,
        was suddenly shaken.
      </p>
      <p>
        He shouted in his heart with anger, telling this voice to get the hell
        out of his body.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is obviously my body, except that before I awakened, this
        consciousness of yours was born. I don't want to do anything to erase
        you."
      </p>
      <p>
        This voice, with helplessness and a few vicissitudes, sounded again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faintly, an arrogant figure with his hands on his back appeared in Jiang
        Yang's mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stared in shock, this was the first time since this voice appeared
        and explained.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You just need to accept my existence, then I can fulfill all your
        long-cherished wishes for you, and take care of your young sister as
        well as your aged grandmother."
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to say, this voice, directly poked Jiang Yang's weak point, so
        that his expression greatly changed up.
      </p>
      <p>"Sister and granny‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" He was muttering, looking torn.</p>
      <p>And the voice, too, was bland and seemed to be in no hurry.</p>
      <p>
        Then, Jiang Yang asked in his mind, "Accept you, or be erased by you,
        does it make a difference? By then, I'll already be gone, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "There is a difference, there is a difference between you accepting me
        voluntarily, and being erased by me."
      </p>
      <p>"What is not the same?"</p>
      <p>"The principle is not the same."</p>
      <p>
        At these words, Jiang Yang was silent, then smiled bitterly, "So in the
        end, I will still not be there, right? At that time, am I still the real
        me? I won't promise you that."
      </p>
      <p>This voice, seemingly slightly stunned, then asked rhetorically.</p>
      <p>"Do you know who I am? What will you gain by accepting me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang was silent for a moment, and his face flashed with a touch of
        determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thought of his sister, and the elderly grandmother who took care of
        both of them growing up.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know who you are, but I know you are not simple, but as long as
        there is still a glimmer of chance, I will not give up!" He said
        steadfastly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You are a stubborn kid, it‚Äôs just that this body is not going to last a
        few days, when the time comes, you will understand‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Letting out a disinterested laugh, this voice faded away.</p>
      <p>No one could stop his return in this life.</p>
      <p>
        Although many of his reincarnation memories had not been fused yet, it
        would not affect him in the least.

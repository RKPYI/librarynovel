        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, the Daoist Sage laughed loudly, as if he had heard a joke. </span><span id="more-32764"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This old Daoist is just a corpse, where exactly is my Dao Heart?” With a tone of disdain, he sneered and mocked, as if he was looking at a fool. He didn’t think that Jiang Chen would actually believe him when he was just fooling around back then. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You…” Jiang Chen’s face twisted in fury. He felt insulted, aggrieved and his heart was filled with unbelievable rage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the point of all this?” Ji Shengchu looked on coldly. He couldn’t help but ask as the situation unravelled itself in his eyes. Jiang Chen releasing the Daoist Sage was not what he wanted, but it had been planned by Gu Changge. This made his heart tremble, he no longer dared to underestimate Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Old friend, let me settle the grievances between us.” The Daoist Sage stepped forward and interrupted with a cold laugh. Although he wasn’t the original Ancient Feather Supreme Being, he still inherited some memories from him. Of which, included how he was attacked, killed and sealed outside of this cave by Ji Shengchu. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, he went silent and rushed towards Ji Shengchu. He could tell that Ji Shengchu was extremely weak. Of course he had made full use of this opportunity! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How dare a mere spirit born from a corpse be this bold!?” Ji Shengchu’s face went stoic. Even though he didn’t have much strength left, he was not someone a mere Corpse Spirit could underestimate. As he rolled up his sleeves, a small jet-black sword that was no more than a metre flew out. It was crystal-clear with dragon arrays wrapped around it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it pierced through the air, it clanged loudly with terrifying Sword Qi. This was an indestructible artifact that he forged from the golden dragon arrays he had obtained from Kun Mountain. It was so powerful that it could expel frightening Principles without his powers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think you’re much better. You look fierce, but I know you’re all talk and no action.&#8221; The Daoist Sage laughed as he showed off the best of his skills. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of nowhere, a whisk appeared. Thunder reverberated through the air. The void exploded and collapsed. Even Chaos Qi was ejected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, both beings fought. The mere fluctuations from their moves was horrifying. All types of rays shot up the sky, as if the earth was about to shatter. If this place wasn’t covered with many intricate arrays, due to it being the bedchamber of the ‘Immortal King’, also known as the Dragon King, it couldn’t have withstood such impact. It would have exploded into powder on the first hit. At the same time, the exchange seemed to palpitate and disrupt time itself. Many ghostly figures emerged and made the place even more frenzied, as if the sky had fallen and the universe had collapsed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Turns out the one who is supposed to back you is too unreliable.” Gu Changge smiled nonchalantly as he gazed at Jiang Chen. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, as Ji Shengchu and the Daoist Sage battled, Jiang Chen, who was rooted to the ground, was as pale as a ghost. His entire body trembled in cold sweat. He suffocated with fear and his blood seemed to flow backwards. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before this, he never imagined that this day would come. Only death awaited him, he had no hope! By no means could he measure up to Gu Changge’s abilities. Even if he exhausted all means, nothing could change his fate. The gap between them was too wide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge strolled towards him casually and sighed, “Initially, I wanted to keep you for later. Unfortunately, you insisted on your own doom.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen didn’t understand his words, but he could feel the undisguised malice that emanated off Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as I don’t die, I will definitely kill you for the sake of revenge in the future!” Jiang Chen gritted his teeth. His eyes were bloodshot and he was full of hatred.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How are you going to kill me? With your Celestial Boat of Creation? Or with those lame Demonic Arts of yours?” Gu Changge smiled gleefully. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What… how do you know about these?” Jiang Chen’s mind went blank as his eyes widened. It was as if he was hit on the head. He went into a daze as he never thought that one day, his biggest secret would come out of his enemy’s mouth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Doesn’t this mean that Gu Changge had known about the existence of the Celestial Boat of Creation a long time ago? That would mean, he knew my identity as a Successor of a Divine Source Master to be fake. I only could get so far due to the Artifact Spirit’s help!] Jiang Chen couldn’t believe it. A terrifying chill swept over his entire body and he shivered uncontrollably. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you realised how pathetic you are? Not only do I know your biggest secret, even your Demonic Arts were gifted by me.” Gu Changge chuckled as his eyes remained calm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean? My Demonic Arts were gifted by you?” Jiang Chen’s entire body turned ice cold. He didn’t even realise that his voice was quivering with fear. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Isn’t this the Master who bestowed you what you know about the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everchanging Demonic Arts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” As Gu Changge scoffed and waved his sleeve, a familiar figure materialised in front of Jiang Chen. It caused his pupils to constrict out of shock as he stumbled backwards. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen’s face lost all colour and was left with only fear and disbelief. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Senior Black…” He gritted his teeth tightly as his entire body trembled. These days, he had inquired about Senior Black, who had rescued him and bestowed him with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everchanging Demonic Arts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it was to no avail. It was as if Senior Black had evaporated off the face of earth, as if he didn’t exist at all. This even depressed Jiang Chen for some time as he thought that Senior Black had encountered some misfortune. However, he never expected that the Senior Black who had saved him back then was arranged by Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen was out of breath. He felt as though he was drowning in a never-ending vortex. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn’t escape his fate of drowning to his death. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Jiang Chen thought things through and he couldn’t help but say with despair in his eyes, “Turns out, you are the most well-hidden Successor of the Demonic Arts. Your maid is just a means for you to cover up your true identity&#8230;” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation was also terrified to the extreme. It never expected that they had lived their entire lives in Gu Changge’s palm this whole time! From the beginning to the end, everything had been planned! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feeling of being manipulated like puppets on string, made both of them feel dejected and hopeless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smiled gently, without anymore explanation. “After watching the show for so long, when are you going to show yourself? I will kill him if you aren’t going to save him. By then, you won’t be able to have the Celestial Boat of Creation.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Gu Changge looked towards a corner of the void with a glint in his eyes. Even the trembling Jiang Chen couldn’t help but look towards the corner as he heard Gu Changge’s words. Aside from them, was there someone else here?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*  The next second, the void vibrated with gentle ripples like a pebble dropped in a lake. A slender and graceful white-clothed figure stepped out of the void. She had blue hair like a waterfall. Meanwhile, her dress fluttered in the air, highlighting her exquisite features. As for her aura, she was just like a fairy from the Moon Palace. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ruoyin…” Jiang Chen’s eyes widened as he looked at this familiar yet foreign figure. He couldn’t believe his eyes. [Why is she also in Kun Mountain? Did she come here to save me?] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Jiang Chen’s glabella glowed and the thing inside him appeared.The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation burst forth and morphed into the shape of a bronze flying boat, which was the size of a palm. It exclaimed with excitement, “Master!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was extremely sensitive towards energy. Naturally, that meant the aura from a person as well. Thus, immediately after realising that the Ruoyin before its eyes was no longer the Ruoyin from before, it quickly exposed itself. After all, this was its real Master! The High Priestess of Destiny who had recovered her memories!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Xiao Ruoyin showed herself, she did not speak to Jiang Chen, but instead looked at Gu Changge and sighed, “I was still caught by you.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I should’ve realised earlier. Gu Changge probably discovered me when he killed those from the Hidden An Clan and War Immortal Manor. It was just that he didn’t point it out and I didn’t think too much about it. I just carelessly just followed him here…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, she witnessed everything that happened. Even if Gu Changge didn’t say anything, she would still show herself and rack her brains to save Jiang Chen so that the Celestial Boat of Creation wouldn’t be destroyed by Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ruoyin, you have really disappointed me.” There was no change in Gu Changge’s expression, he merely shook his head as if to express his pity. “Now, should I address you as Ruoyin? Or as the High Priestess of Destiny?” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Ruoyin remained calm, like she wasn’t happy nor sad. Without Gu Changge’s words having any impact on her, she replied, “A name is just a name, I am still me.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, if she wasn’t this desperate, she wouldn’t have exposed her identity in front of Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You aren’t being honest at all, do you still remember what you said to me that night?” Gu Changge smiled and his tone remained casual, as if he didn’t care about the change in Ruoyin’s identity.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruoyin sensed his intention and recalled what happened that night. There was a faint look of bewilderment on her face, but it quickly dissipated as she regained her confidence, “My identity has changed since back then, so of course, the words I say will also change.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, what a change in identity? If so, are you trying to get in my way now? Should I also kill you together with him?” Gu Changge asked. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jiang Chen was created from the Celestial Boat of Creation. If you kill him, you will destroy the my artifact, so I must save him.” Ruoyin shook her head and explained her intentions. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you think you can stop me?” With a tone of intrigue, Gu Changge looked towards her. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruoyin shook her head, “With my current ability, I can’t stop you.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like you aren’t that dumb.” Gu Changge chuckled and suddenly walked towards her. He stretched out his hand and grabbed her chin that was as smooth as jade, just so that they would make close and direct eye contact. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, I will give you two options. After All, being married for a day creates a hundred days of love, I also can’t bear to kill you. Hand over the secret to refining the Celestial Boat of Creation and I will let bygones be bygones. If not, I will kill you together with him.”</span></p>

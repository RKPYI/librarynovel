      <h4>
        Chapter 263-1: Brother Gu is really a true man, Maybe I should let the
        Great Dao Treasure Bottle evolve (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's words, let alone Jiang Chuchu, even Wang Ziji
        couldn't help being stunned for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>"You‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu stared at Gu Changge's eyes, and her pupils couldn't help
        but widen again as if she hadn't reacted yet. However, Gu Changge's
        expression was still as calm as water, without the slightest turbulence.
        Anyone could feel the indifference of his hard heart.
      </p>
      <p>"What do I need to say again?"</p>
      <p>
        He stared at Jiang Chuchu again and said in an unhurried tone, "If you
        want to die, don't die in front of me."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Do you really think I'm here to save you? It's ridiculous. What are you
        still fantasizing about? Do you need me to repeat what I said back then?
        Jiang Chuchu, you still can't change your self-righteous temperament.
        Did you think that I would care even if you died?"
      </p>
      <p>
        His expression was slightly mocking, and his tone was even ruder. He
        almost pointed at Jiang Chuchu and scolded her for being amorous.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, you bastard‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        In response, Jiang Chuchu could not help but grit her teeth in anger,
        her body trembled slightly, her expression was full of hatred, and she
        became colder. She really thought Gu Changge was here to save her.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to his temperament, she never got along with Gu Changge
        before. Although Gu Changge said that he didn't care about her life or
        death. But when it came to her life and death, it was impossible for him
        to ignore her.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, what Gu Changge said now could be said to have broken her
        fantasy. And he was still merciless, not giving her any face at all. Her
        death did not have any effect on Gu Changge, and there would be one less
        person in the world who knew his true identity.
      </p>
      <p>It was too late for Gu Changge to be happy.</p>
      <p>
        "I'm really an asshole, so are you done with scolding? You can get out
        then. It's really annoying to see you standing in front of me. I've
        never seen someone as stupid as you, with a brain that can't be used or
        something‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge interrupted her, the expression in his eyes seemed more
        indifferent than Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>"You‚Ä¶ you can't scold me‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was suddenly stunned. For a time, she was a little dazed,
        and she couldn't help swallowing the words she wanted to yell at Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in her heart, there was a sense of grievance that made her feel
        incredible. What right did Gu Changge have to scold herself? Wasn't it
        all his fault that she was like this now?
      </p>
      <p>
        But at this time, Gu Changge was too lazy to care about her. He looked
        up at the crack in the sky, and there was a black and white light in his
        eyes. DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

          });

      </div>
      <p>
        Under the power of Reincarnation, the terrifying and turbulent gray aura
        of Absolute Heavenly Extinction became thinner and thinner, and some
        silhouettes and shadows could be seen there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from a large number of beings that were contaminated by the Aura
        of Heavenly Extinction, there was only a terrifying crack that stretched
        across it, like a wound between heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Aura of Absolute Heavenly Extinction was leaking from it. Gu
        Changge's expectations were correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        This crack did lead to Absolute Heavenly Extinction, but it was only a
        small part, and it was estimated to be hundreds of millions of times
        worse than the entire Realm of Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        His plan was to go there and see if he could refine this small piece of
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction first. Now it seemed that the only
        difficulty was that there were endless beings in the shadows, and there
        were quite a few of them in the Sacred Realm alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of Jiang Chuchu, a few terrifying beings that had reached the
        Sacred Realm were also drawn here, wrapped in a strong Heavenly
        Extinction Aura, and the gray fog was overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Gu is really a real man."</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Wang Ziji, who had an expression of eating melons,
        couldn't help but mutter softly. She never expected that Gu Changge
        would say such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the situation just now, there must be something hidden
        between Jiang Chuchu and Gu Changge, otherwise, why would Jiang Chuchu
        say such words to Gu Changge that she did not want him to save herself?
      </p>
      <p>
        She thought that Gu Changge would comfort her for a while, and calm down
        Jiang Chuchu with his soft words. As a result, Gu Changge's answer made
        Wang Ziji sluggish for a long time, and then she couldn't help admiring
        it, and just wanted to say that it was worthy of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of him, a peerless beauty as if she was far from enough to
        describe the beauty of the world and the beauty of the moon, was scolded
        by him like this. It was simply incomprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, he would have stepped forward and hugged Jiang Chuchu at
        this time, and then a gentle comfort of Balabala‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge's approach seemed to be quite useful. Didn't Jiang
        Chuchu calm down now? But now, what Wang Ziji wanted to know more about
        was what happened between Jiang Chuchu and Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was really curious, and it stood to reason that the two of them had
        only met twice, so why were they so familiar? But she also knew that she
        couldn't ask anything about this kind of thing, neither Gu Changge nor
        Jiang Chuchu would be the kind of people who would answer her.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, accompanied by a divine light reaching the sky, a
        monstrous sword light emerged from the front, like a mountain peak
        breaking through the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wisps of sword light bloomed from the heavens and the earth, as if
        hundreds of millions of divine swords emerged from all directions, and
        then cut directly into the terrifying gray fog ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sky crumbled and the earth trembled. The vast swathes of Heavenly
        Extinction beings were like snow melting under the scorching sun, in the
        presence of this aura. Before even their screams could be heard, they
        turned into ashes in an instant, vanished, and both their body and
        spirit were destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying creature that had just stretched out its palm from it
        couldn't help screaming, with rotten blood falling from the heavens and
        the earth, containing terrifying corrosiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a thud, even the void was corroded into an astonishingly large
        hole. This kind of scene was really amazing, ordinary Sacred Realm
        beings had to change their expression and they did not dare to approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji and Jiang Chuchu couldn't help being stunned. Beneath this
        crack, Gu Changge walked away, his body was dazzling with colorful
        divine lights, wrapped in a thick chaotic mist, like a young god.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        At this moment, many terrifying visions appeared beside him, the True
        Dragon bowed his head, the Immortal Phoenix drooped his wings, the
        universe was destroyed, and thousands of calamities turned into ashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was even a faint mysterious and vast world emerging, in which the
        immortal wood was tall, the divine mountain was boundless, and the
        immortal lake was vast.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he took a step, a golden channel spread out from under Gu Changge's
        feet, and the power of the vast laws extended to the crack in the sky.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Behind him, many golden Dao treasures unfolded, and among them, densely
        packed divine weapons and sacred artifacts appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sword, spear, sword and halberd, ax, hook and fork, bell, tripod, and
        mirror seal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The divine might surge, containing unparalleled power,
        killing the Heavenly Extinction beings in the surrounding.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fight that was many times more terrifying than Jiang Chu Chu's fight
        just now was staged here. Looking at the countless Heavenly Extinction
        beings that came in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>"Get lost!"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shouted lightly, his expression was indifferent and calm, and
        many divine weapons emerged above his head, dropping down terrifying
        laws and orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, he looked like he wanted to stop the Heavenly Extinction
        beings from descending for the sake of the beings of the world with an
        awe-inspiring look of justice, and killed them without the slightest
        fear!
      </p>
      <p>
        All the Heavenly Extinction beings along the way could not even get
        close to him, and they were blown to pieces in mid-air by the various
        terrifying aura around his body.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing his actions, Jiang Chu Chu and Wang Ziji both could not help but
        freeze, completely unable to figure it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Wang Ziji's face, a touch of surprise surfaced, and it was hard for
        her to believe it. She even thought that she had thought wrong, in fact,
        Gu Changge's purpose for coming here was actually to stop the Heavenly
        Extinction beings from descending?
      </p>
      <p>His purpose was exactly the same as Jiang Chuchu's?</p>
      <p>
        "What exactly is Gu Changge doing? Could it really be that he is going
        to fight against the Heavenly Extinction beings just like that fellow
        Jiang Chu Chu, right? This is endless‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is he crazy? Does he really think he will have a way, this is something
        that gives many Ancient existences a headache and they avoid them like
        snakes and scorpions. This is no different from going to your own
        death!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji was shocked and couldn't understand Gu Changge's move. In her
        opinion, Gu Changge was an absolute egoist, not going to do things that
        would harm his self-interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was absolutely no need to say how dangerous it was within the
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction. Like the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield
        they encountered before, it was only caused by some of the aura leaking
        out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dangers within the Absolute Heavenly Extinction, probably far
        exceeded the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield by a million times. The
        actual fact was, at this time, Gu Changge should not be far away, like
        the rest of the cultivators, afraid to get near, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that my thoughts of brother Gu are wrong, he is a true man, is
        not completely selfish and self-serving, and still has the world's great
        righteousness in mind ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji thought so and could not help but feel a sense of admiration
        for Gu Changge. With this point alone, the rest of the younger
        generation couldn't catch up with Gu Changge even if they beat their
        horses.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 263-2: Brother Gu is really a true man, Maybe I should let the
        Great Dao Treasure Bottle evolve (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        As a transmigrator, she couldn't understand Gu Changge's heart for the
        world. But it did not affect her admiration for Gu Changge. Even she
        didn‚Äôt have such guts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother Gu is not a reckless person, since he dares to do so, then he
        must have the confidence‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Wang Ziji was worried, at this time, she had no choice but to
        wait. And contrary to Wang Ziji's thoughts, at this time, Jiang Chuchu
        was stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, Gu Changge was such a cold and desperate Great Demon,
        who did all the bad things and lost his heart. How could he possibly
        regard the safety and security of the world as a responsibility like
        herself?
      </p>
      <p>
        He was stopping the Heavenly Extinction beings from descending? This was
        simply impossible. However, now he went to do so, and even went to it in
        front of the two descendants of Human Ancestor Hall, to stop the descent
        of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge why are you doing this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was frozen, her eyes couldn't help but stare, completely
        unable to understand. Finally, she thought of a possibility that was
        most likely and that made her heart and soul tremble lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's purpose for doing so had a lot to do with her. Just now, he
        scolded her so much, it was actually because of the worry. After all,
        with Gu Changge's temperament, he couldn't possibly show anything, so he
        could only show his anger and worry through such a method.
      </p>
      <p>
        And he was now going to stop the Absolute Heavenly Extinction from
        descending, in fact, he wanted to help herself, afraid that she would
        still stay here and end up losing her life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking like this, Jiang Chuchu could not help but bite her lips
        tightly. Her face could no longer show that cold look. Just now Gu
        Changge was scolding her a lot, but his behavior was not at all
        ambiguous either.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was actually tough-mouthed, even though his mouth was scolding people
        without mercy, but there was actually warmth in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Jiang Chuchu look incomparably complicated, remembering the
        time when she was held in his small space by Gu Changge. He was actually
        like this, but in the end, it was because of her own actions that were
        too disappointing for him, and also exhausted his last bit of patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was why he said those irresponsible words that he didn't care if
        she lived or died and there was no more connection between the two of
        them.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu couldn't help but murmur. For a while, she felt so confused
        in her mind, she obviously hated him so much, and she could not wait for
        him to die in the middle like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way, the world would have one less horrible scourge. But why
        couldn't she help but feel worried?
      </p>

      <p>
        "Jiang Chuchu, as the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall, how can you be in
        love with a Great Demon? You and him are destined to go on opposite
        sides."
      </p>
      <p>
        She silently recited the Clear Heart Mantra in her heart, trying to calm
        herself down, but all the things she had learned after so many years of
        cultivation seemed to be useless at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her heart was in turmoil. This made Jiang Chuchu couldn't help but be
        bewildered.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        Deep in the Absolute Heavenly Extinction, the gray mist surged. Gu
        Changge looked somewhat interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, he had actually vaguely guessed the thoughts of the two
        people outside, after all, it was his intention, whether it was Jiang
        Chuchu or Wang Ziji. It was impossible to guess his real purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since ancient times, as soon as the Absolute Heavenly Extinction
        descended, the first reaction of cultivators was to pull out their legs
        and run away.
      </p>
      <p>Who would dare to go in it?</p>
      <p>
        First of all, not to mention that in the Absolute Heavenly Extinction,
        there was no opportunity, and the degree of danger was much higher as
        compared to many ancient forbidden places.
      </p>
      <p>Unless they wanted to die, who would come here?</p>
      <p>
        So no one would think about his intentions, instead, they would think
        that he came here to stop the descent of the Absolute Heavenly
        Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thinking like that, that's good, and it will save me from going through
        all the trouble of pulling the big flag again."
      </p>
      <p>
        The corner of Gu Changge's mouth could not help but reveal some smiles.
        Then, as he raised his hand, many divine weapons emerged, bursting out
        with terrifying divine might, shattering all the Heavenly Extinction
        beings around him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stepped towards it. The closer he got to it, the more powerful the
        creatures he encountered, who long lost their spirituality and only had
        the intention of killing and destroying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Extinction Aura here was actually very dense. A Sacred
        Realm cultivator would be corrupted even if he comes in, and if he
        stayed here for a long time, he was bound to be affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it did not affect him much. At this time, on the surface of Gu
        Changge's body, pitch-black vortexes appeared one after another, and the
        terrifying and heart-pounding runes of the Great Dao circulated. FOlloow

      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, there seemed to be indescribable ancient gods sitting
        cross-legged, and the sounds of the world, sacrifices, and chanting
        reverberated. All the Heavenly Extinction Aura was swallowed up by these
        vortexes as soon as it got close to him and could not affect him at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, there were more and more Heavenly Extinction beings
        here, which made him frown. If there was no Wang Ziji outside, it would
        be fine. But if he used the forbidden demonic art, it was very likely
        that some aura would leak out and attract her attention.

        Then, Gu Changge sacrificed something, the golden light surged, and it
        opened from this space in an instant, like a big seal of mountains and
        seas, but it was actually the Immortal Lun Seal that Gu Changge
        concealed.
      </p>
      <p>This was a real Supreme Weapon.</p>
      <p>
        With his current cultivation base, it was almost impossible to activate
        it with all his strength, but a single ray of divine power from the
        Supreme Artifact was enough to disperse the nearby Heavenly Extinction
        beings.
      </p>
      <p>Then, there was also the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd.</p>
      <p>
        The immortal seal appeared above his head, and a terrifying divine light
        hung down, like a galaxy, incomparably vast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge raised his hand and slashed down, and a creature in the
        Sacred Realm in front of him immediately collapsed and exploded, making
        it difficult to stop his pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, this gray fog in the vast and boundless space was cleared by him
        to a clean road, leading directly to the deepest part!
      </p>
      <p>That was the source of the Heavenly Extinction Aura!</p>
      <p>
        Not long after that. Gu Changge found the place where the gray fog was
        most dense in the depths of that crack. The nearby Heavenly Extinction
        beings had been swept away by him, and almost no figures were seen.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, it seemed a bit strangely peaceful.</p>
      <p>
        "It seems that this is the source. As long as this place is refined, I
        can control this part of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge whispered to himself.</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly. In his eyes, black and white divine lights flowed, and the
        power of time emerged, turning into two peerless immortal swords,
        clanging loudly, and slashing away!
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying gray fog exploded from it as if it was torn apart by a
        terrifying power, and the increasingly dense and startling black
        substance slowly flowed in it. It was a substance like life, black as a
        starry sky, but it could devour the world barrier and cover everything!
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, if a cultivator was here, he would be so frightened that
        his skull would explode. This kind of aura clearly had not approached
        yet, but it was enough to break everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even after the death of the Supreme Being, or even the corpse of the
        Emperor, it was impossible to have such aura. A single strand seemed to
        be enough to devour the heavens and crush all matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is an extremely rare source of Heavenly Extinction Aura in the
        core area of ??Heavenly Extinction. I didn't expect my luck to be good.
        Oh no, it should be attributed to Wang Ziji, thanks to her, I was able
        to find this thing."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's expression showed a little interest, at this time, there
        was also a sense of fear even with the Immortal Lun Seal. The gods in it
        sensed the danger, and were extremely afraid of the source of Absolute
        Heavenly Extinction, for fear of being swallowed and covered by it.
      </p>
      <p>On the contrary, the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd was very quiet.</p>
      <p>
        "I just don't know whether this source of absolute Heavenly Extinction
        is stronger or weaker than my Great Dao Treasure Bottle‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Maybe I can take this opportunity to make the it evolve again."</p>

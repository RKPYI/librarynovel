          on the walls and in the air. Never had Su Qingge thought Ji Qingxuan
          would one day kill her for her identity, and as the older sister, she
          felt deeply disappointed, heartbroken, and livid.</span

          together, but they should be supporting each other in the foreign

          You&#8217;re very ambitious, and staying in the Ji Family Residence
          will hinder you from realising your ambitions. But our identity switch
          has given you a chance,&#8221; Su Qingge said, gradually recovering
          her composure after coming around.</span

          the fact that they shouldn&#8217;t have switched identities in the
          first place and that she shouldn&#8217;t mention switching back now.
          Perhaps the best solution now was that she lived as Ji Qingxuan for
          the rest of her life while Ji Qingxuan continued to stay by Gu
          Changge&#8217;s side as Su Qingge.</span

          nice anymore if you continue to be insistent,&#8221; warned Su Qingge
          as frost laced her expressionless face. She was actually seething with
          rage. However, she was still hesitant to attack her sister.</span

          >She had advanced to the Sacred Noble Realm, having powers enough to
          match many young prodigies. More importantly, the arrays in this
          palace were under her control. Even cultivators of the Sacred King
          Realm would be apprehensive. Hence, Ji Qingxuan believed the present
          Su Qingge had nothing on her.

          Su Qingge icily as several glowing lights emerged from her sleeve and
          merged on her palm. It was a somewhat damaged horn. Though it looked
          ancient and quaint with dried blood stains on the edge, the dragon
          bellows one could vaguely hear caused the entire palace to slightly
          shake.</span

          object. That said, she recovered very quickly and commented plainly,
          &#8220;You do have quite a few neat treasures, Sister. To think you
          even have a broken dragon horn… But if you think a mere broken dragon
          horn can destroy my array, think again.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Though a dragon horn had the power to destroy an array, it had to be
          a perfectly fine dragon horn with immense Qi injected into it. As
          powerful as Su Qingge was, it would be impossible for her to break a
          Sacred King Grade array with a damaged horn.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          against the array in front of her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the Successor of Demonic Arts, her powers advanced with breakneck
          speed. Even a powerful expert like the Successor of War Immortal
          Manor, who was recognised as one of the strongest cultivators among
          the young generation, had nearly died in her hands.</span

          >*Buzz!* The next second, a brilliant light exploded, creating a
          powerful shock wave that caused the entire palace to shake violently.
          The glowing dragon horn was so dense and powerful that even the space
          exploded with a boom, and many runes were wiped out from that strike
          alone, causing the brilliant light in the room to gradually dim.</span

          multitudes as she watched the scene develop. Things were seemingly
          getting out of her hand as her sister was far more powerful than she
          had imagined. It seemed that the array couldn&#8217;t defeat Su
          Qingge. Instead, it was obliterated by the broken dragon horn.</span

          down, &#8220;I admit I have underestimated you, Sister, but… you
          seemed to have underestimated me too.&#8221;</span

          forever?&#8221; Su Qingge was somewhat surprised that Ji Qingxuan had
          a Plan B. However, a simple space artifact wouldn&#8217;t be enough to
          contain her.</span

          commented Ji Qingxuan while keeping a watchful eye on Su
          Qingge&#8217;s expression, only to be surprised that the latter was
          merely somewhat surprised after she activated the palace.</span

          telepathically linked, they could vaguely feel each other&#8217;s

          and various talismans against each other, creating a brilliant scene
          as various spells were cast and techniques were thrown.</span

          >The two were incredibly powerful, enough to be regarded as champions
          among their peers, especially Su Qingge, who was able to give Ji
          Qingxuan a hard time. She could force her younger sister to cough up
          blood after a few dozen exchanges of attacks without ever using her
          strongest attack.</span

          down the corner of her lips. She had a hard time accepting the fact
          that her powers were beneath Su Qingge, who lived in the Lower Realm,
          when she was born in the Upper Realm and had assiduously cultivated
          since she was little. The notion left her doubtful and
          frustrated.</span

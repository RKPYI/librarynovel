          >During this time, Su Qingge lived a pretty decent life in the Ji
          Family Residence and also sorted out many of Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s
          worries. Of course, it was primarily because many Elders of the Ji
          Family had gotten to know that Ji Qingxuan had an older blood sister,
          Su Qingge, who had become Gu Changge&#8217;s maid. Hence, many in the
          Ji Family treated her immensely differently now. However, it
          didn&#8217;t affect Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s grand ambitions.</span

          also wanted to become the matriarch of the Hidden Ji Family, and only
          Gu Changge could provide her with this chance.</span

          >&#8220;Ji Family&#8217;s issue?&#8221; A glimmer flashed across Su
          Qingge&#8217;s eyes as well. She knew what Ji Qingxuan was talking
          about, for the latter had told her about her desire to take over the
          entire family before they were literally at each other&#8217;s
          throats.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, as the family once bore someone titled as a Human Ancestor,
          the Ji Family had an extensive history. It had to be noted that such a
          title was only given to people like the Mortal One. Thus, many
          Immortal or Formidable Forces of the Upper Realm were beneath them.
          Even when they were facing decline, their heritage was not to be
          underestimated.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With such a behemoth facing her, Ji Qingxuan never settled on a
          definitive answer. She believe should contemplate more. After all, the
          waters in the Ji Family were deep. One wrong step would leave her
          sinking into the abyss.</span

          >&#8220;I can naturally help you two out if you have the
          ambition.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled plainly. When he found Su Qingge
          shocked by the news, he knew she had likely been prudent and
          didn&#8217;t reveal her face. That said, he still decided to order his
          men to silence the Successor of War Immortal Manor just to be
          safe.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Certainly, even when on decline, the Hidden Ji Family was influential
          and powerful. In fact, it might even fall to a second-class family.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then again, they were a Hidden Family; a sleeping lion was still
          stronger than a barking dog. What was more, a ‘Human Ancestor’ had
          existed among their Ancestors. Thus, not all Forces dared belittle the
          Ji Family as they were far less influential and powerful than the
          latter.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Furthermore, because her mother had bailed on her arranged marriage,
          leaving the Ji Family humiliated, she had been imprisoned in her
          quarters despite having been born from a senior branch. All these
          years, her mother had been living a miserable life and could barely
          provide her with any aid.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Currently, the leader of the Ji Family was none other than her
          maternal uncle. Hence, it would be justifiable if she succeeded in the
          role of the leader of the Ji Family. However, there was another
          problem right in front of her.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Ji Family&#8217;s current Successor, Ji Yaoxing, was popular,
          influential, and reputable among the members of the Ji Family. In
          fact, he had many Elders&#8217; support in becoming the next family
          head.</span

          Yaoxing.</span

          as she looked at Su Qingge, signalling for her to say something.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Though the sisters had turned their backs on each other, they had to
          admit that their minds were synced as one gaze was all it took for
          them to understand each other.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just like that, Su Qingge nodded and added, &#8220;Like Qingge said,
          I&#8217;m rather confident that I can seize the chance to become the
          head of the family.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was now the prodigal damsel of the Ji Family, arguably a notable
          character in the Upper Realm. Taking over the Ji Family would allow
          her another layer of disguise.</span

          ended up for nothing.&#8221; Gu Changge chucked, looking very relaxed.
          It wouldn&#8217;t be right for him to directly get involved in the Ji
          Family&#8217;s issues as he was an outsider after all. However, if he
          were to accompany Ji Qingxuan and Su Qingge, things would be
          different.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >By then, the entire Ji Family would know Ji Qingxuan had his support.
          Given Gu Changge&#8217;s immense power in the Upper Realm, the Ji
          Family would know what it meant if they weren&#8217;t idiots.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very quickly, Ji Qingxuan made the arrangements, intending to head
          towards the Hidden Ji Family Residence the next day. She had to tag
          along on the trip, as she didn&#8217;t trust Su Qingge.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge, on the other hand, tossed and turned in bed that night,
          for she couldn&#8217;t calm down, much less stay still. She hardly
          ever encountered such a situation, and this night was a complete
          exception. Many thoughts came to her, causing her to sigh.</span

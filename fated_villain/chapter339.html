          Family in the palace, whose cultivation levels were at least in the
          Sacred King Realm, were discussing matters related to Purple Mansion.
          Although, to them, this was a trivial, unimportant matter. In fact,
          they wouldn&#8217;t have bothered themselves with it if it
          weren&#8217;t for Gu Changge&#8217;s involvement.</span

          Ancestor, but due to the tremendous number of Ancestors in the Gu
          Family, it was most likely impossible. Similarly, the Elders most
          likely had little to no chances of meeting an Ancestor even once,
          despite having cultivated for millions of years. The Ancestor before
          them was one perfect example. Nevertheless, they didn&#8217;t dare to
          be disrespectful even though he was a stranger to them.</span

          were shaking with astoundment as they had the instinctive urge to

          guesses, the Ancestor suddenly introduced himself. There was even
          Chaos Mist wafting between his hair, as if he just crawled out from
          his tomb. He sounded rather amicable, and he seemed satisfied after
          taking a good look at his Juniors.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          fist-and-palm salute, &#8220;Honoured to meet you, Eighteenth
          Ancestor! I am the current Head of the Gu Family.&#8221; In spite of
          his identity as the Head of the family, he appeared notably humbler

          had already been lost track of, and there was no telling what era he
          was from. In fact, his only record of battle, was his encounter with
          Sky Emperor Shen from Sky Emperor Mountain.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Back when Sky Emperor Shen ruled the world and the Ancient Immortal
          Races, his ambitions grew out of control. He travelled using radiant
          golden light from the Great Dao, and arrived at the territory of the
          Immortal Gu Family. He had attempted to provoke the family, intending
          to take a peek at their unfathomable secrets.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ultimately, before he could even set his foot through the gate, he
          was sent flying away with a palm by an Ancestor, who happened to be
          taking a stroll near the gates. Since the incident was so major that
          it shocked the world, and had been recorded down, it indubitably
          became a permanent stain in Sky Emperor Shen&#8217;s history.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, as time went by, the forces that witnessed the incident were
          engulfed in the River of Time. And now, hardly a handful of them still
          remembered the event. Even so, in the Gu Family, anyone who studied
          the true history would know about it.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >But of course, those from Sky Emperor Mountain were also aware of it.
          Otherwise, Ying Yu wouldn&#8217;t have come to the Gu Family Residence
          to visit Gu Changge, only to wait outside the gates for half a month
          without getting to meet him and eventually left out of vexation. As a
          matter of fact, no Immortal Sect or Immortal Family would instil this
          much fear in the daughter of Sky Emperor Ying except for the Immortal
          Gu Family.</span

          >&#8220;Not bad, not bad. But Eighteenth Ancestor? It&#8217;s been a
          long time since I last heard that. With how I&#8217;ve been slacking
          off when cultivating, I&#8217;m afraid that I won&#8217;t make it to
          &#8216;Twentieth Ancestor.'&#8221; Pleased, Gu Lang shook his head and
          responded with a smile. He sensed the energy of his branch from Gu
          Lintian, and judging by the latter&#8217;s cultivation level, he was
          quite close to achieving the Great Dao. As such, Gu Lang felt
          gratified as the Head of the Gu Family of this generation had reached
          such a high cultivation level. A level which other Heads in the past
          had not reached, which just indicated how excellent Gu Lintian&#8217;s
          Talents were.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon those words, the Elders in the palace were puzzled. [What does
          he mean by slacking off from cultivating? That he won&#8217;t make it
          to becoming the Twentieth Ancestor? He wants the other Ancestors to
          surpass him?]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The reason Gu Lang was referred to as Eighteenth Ancestor was
          because, in terms of strength, he was the eighteenth most powerful
          among the Ancestors of the Gu Family. However, this variable ranking
          was something created in the past, since none could tell what
          cultivation level he had achieved by now.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As noted before, the Ancestors of the Immortal Gu Family rarely
          showed themselves in the outside world. Leaving aside those that had
          left for the Immortal World, his existence in the Upper Realm was
          enough to baffle the entire Gu Family.</span

          Nature&#8217;s judgments are inevitable, but men will never survive
          their own misdeeds, so don&#8217;t worry about it. Though, I must
          admit that I am quite interested in the next Successor of our
          family.&#8221; While the crowd were still pondering over what he said,
          Gu Lang suddenly spoke. His eyes deepened as terrifying scenes, the
          disintegration and devastation of worlds, surged in them. It was as if
          his gaze pierced through layers of space, landing on the territory of
          Purple Mansion. His words were so direct they were overflowing with
          his indifference towards Purple Mansion.</span

          regardless of their significance since they were all neatly tended to

          the Dao Bone of his own cousin as a child. Although his attempt at
          mending their relationship wasn&#8217;t exactly smart, he managed to
          thoroughly settle the conflict in the end.</span

          their own..</span

          were one in a million, and if one managed to gain his liking, they
          might receive some reward from him. Furthermore, even the smallest
          reward could be extremely useful for the Juniors.</span

          man. Nonetheless, rumours and stories of him even reached back to the
          family. Truthfully, when he heard Gu Changge had fought against
          someone in the Sacred King Realm, Gu Lintian was utterly dumbfounded.
          The latter did not expect such alarming strength from him, but of
          course, he was delighted and reassured by that at the same time.</span

          >Lately, Gu Changge laid out his plans in the Communication Rune quite
          clearly, claiming that the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s involvement in
          his fight with Purple Mansion was not needed, as he could easily
          subdue his enemy on his own. Besides, he had Gu Qingyi with him, whose
          cultivation level was a fearsome warning to the ancient beings

          as his own sister. He could no longer perceive her cultivation level.
          He could still remember back when Gu Qingyi came to the outside world,
          she was merely a little girl around the age of seven, but in the blink
          of an eye, her cultivation level was no longer measurable, putting

          won&#8217;t be returning to retreat for a while. In the meantime, I
          shall await the boy&#8217;s response.&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Lang

          Instead, she was frantic with fear and distress, worried that upon
          Purple Mansion&#8217;s destruction, the Tang Family would be the next
          to fall. Although Purple Mansion had yet to go down, its ruination was
          pretty much nearing.</span

          >On the other hand, even if Chu Hao were to become the Sect Master of
          Supreme Cave Heaven, he would still die if he faced off against Gu
          Changge.</span

          >Forget Gu Changge&#8217;s hidden strength, the methods he displayed
          on the surface was enough to traumatise anyone. Although Tang Wan had
          known of might of the Immortal Gu Family, she never expected it to be
          this terrorizing. After all, the situation of the entire Upper Realm
          was drastically changed by the military force sent by the Immortal Gu
          Family alone.</span

          >&#8220;Lately, Chu Hao still seems to be scheming against me. I have
          previously stated that as long as he stays out of my way, I&#8217;ll
          never go out of my way to engage him. Killing him would prove much
          more effortless than destroying Purple Mansion.&#8221; Gu Changge
          turned to Tang Wan with a grin, retaining the ever so leisurely look
          on his face.</span

          >Upon those words, Tang Wan&#8217;s face blanched as dread arose in
          her heart, uncertain how Gu Changge obtained the information. Though
          he wasn&#8217;t mistaken as Chu Hao, indeed, didn&#8217;t heed her
          warning. Instead, he was still planning to take down Gu Changge,
          insistent on exacting revenge for the humiliation he was treated
          with.</span

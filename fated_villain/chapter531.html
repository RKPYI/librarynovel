          but who&#8217;d have thought he&#8217;s actually trapped somewhere out
          there. Looks like the Ji Family plans to spread the word and ask the

          Ji Shengchu to return at this time. After all, the man also once stood
          at the apex of the Upper Realm, and his powers were unfathomable. If
          he were to repossess leadership of the Ji Family, the situation in the
          Upper Realm would inevitably be impacted. Furthermore, Gu Changge
          wasn&#8217;t certain if Ji Shengchu, a Human Ancestor, had any
          connections to Jiang Yang, the Mortal One Gu Changge killed.</span

          and scheme in secret. After all, Ji Shengchu might be able to resolve
          the issue with the Eternal Overcast if he&#8217;s saved, and no doubt
          most of the Forces of the Upper Realm would think so too. What’s more,
          most owe Ji Shengchu a favour, so they would very likely agree to
          help.] A glimmer flashed across Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes as he fell

          >At that, they heaved a sigh of relief. Everyone was shocked, shaken,
          and even worried upon realising Gu Changge had arrived. After all, the
          Ji Family were barely acquainted with Gu Changge. The only real
          interaction they had was during the search for the Tower of World
          Domination, where the Ji siblings crossed him, and to absolve the
          worry of the man seeking vengeance, the many Elders of the Ji Family
          voluntarily gifted him the Wheel of World Domination.</span

          If necessary, we will do whatever we can to assist you.&#8221; The
          head of the Ji Family already had a guess as to Gu Changge&#8217;s
          visit after taking a gander at Su Qingge, but he still asked.</span

          visit.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled while gesturing to Ji Qingxuan, who
          stood beside him. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure all of you have heard about Su
          Qingge and Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s relationship. I&#8217;ve brought Qingge
          up from the Lower Realm. She was separated from her mother since she
          was a child and had never once seen her mother in the past twenty-over
          years. I happened to have time lately, so I thought I should bring her
          to her mother.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The countenances of many Ji Family members shifted, and they worried
          Gu Changge would fault them. Of course, they knew Ji Qingxuan and Su
          Qingge&#8217;s relationship. Many Elders had even personally met
          &#8216;Su Qingge&#8217; at Chaos City.</span

          >Later, the Ji Family found out about it and thus went to the Lower
          Realm to capture her. It was only because of Ji Xue&#8217;s pleading
          and begging that they spared the husband and the baby. However, after
          returning to the Upper Realm, the Ji Family found out Ji Xue was
          pregnant with another child.</span

          might be livid about the matter, but he didn&#8217;t reproach her at
          length either. In fact, he even let her conceive Ji Qingxuan.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          her quarters since then. After all, she had disgraced the entire Ji
          Family with what she did. It was already merciful of them not to kill
          her.</span

          mother as she pleases. As her uncle, how can I stop her from doing
          that?&#8221; Ji Hao promised soberly. &#8220;Ji Xue might have done
          wrong, but so many years have passed. I&#8217;m sure she has come
          around.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          out Gu Changge&#8217;s purpose of visiting upon seeing &#8216;Su
          Qingge&#8217;. He could also tell the young woman was likely high in
          favour with Gu Changge, or why would someone like him personally come
          for something so minor? In fact, no one in the entire Ji Family would
          dare oppose him even if he just sent a request message.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          agreement, indicating they had no issue with it and dared not stop Su

          say another word right now.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, ill-conceived mixed emotions enveloped Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s
          face as she watched the scene unfold. She remembered full well how she
          and her mother were treated in the Ji Family Residence. Many family
          members would disparage them and even wish for the mother and daughter
          to die. Because of it, she had to thread her steps in order to
          survive. However, she was still turned into a tool for the Ji Family
          in the end. They planned to set up an arranged marriage to create an
          alliance with another family. But now, one request from Gu Changge was
          all it took to stop the members of the Ji Family from giving her and
          her mother a hard time.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was true power.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Followingly, the members of the Ji Family escorted Gu Changge and the
          sisters inside. Many descendants of the senior branch appeared as
          well, watching from afar with shock. Amongst them, a beautiful young
          woman in light yellow with cunningness in her big round eyes was
          overlooking the scene on the mountain peak. Beside her was a dashing
          young man in a golden robe. In his eyes, golden runes surged, making
          him look like a young god.</span

          >&#8220;Brother, do you think Gu Changge has really only come for Ji
          Qingxuan&#8217;s mother? My instinct tells me that things aren&#8217;t
          as simple as it seems,&#8221; the young woman in light yellow
          couldn&#8217;t help but say this as she shook her head.</span

          with Gu Changge during the search for the Tower of World Domination.
          Naturally, the young man beside her was, of course, the Young Master
          of the Ji Family, Ji Yaoxing.</span

          involved in this. Someone like him wouldn&#8217;t do anything stupid
          at this time,&#8221; Ji Yaoxing remarked gravely with a piercing

          Mountain for countless years. Of course we have to save him.&#8221; Ji
          Chuyue nodded, feeling like what happened some time ago was nothing

          once titled as a Human Ancestor, and the Hidden Ji Family got its

          him. &#8220;That so-called friend of yours, stay away from him for the

          the auction house some time ago,&#8221; Ji Yaoxing said plainly as the

          the Ji Family, have to consider everything for the good of the family.
          What can befriending Jiang Chen bring you and the family, and what
          will happen to the family after offending Gu Changge? I hope you can
          think wisely. You can exploit Jiang Chen, but don&#8217;t treat him as

          by saying that he was just following the rules, he would probably be

          a nobody before this because any cultivator with a good eye would
          notice how special she is. Could it be that these two siblings have a
          secret hidden in their bodies? However, when I examined her brother,
          there wasn&#8217;t any obvious change of Fortuity, but with a sister
          like her, he should have higher Fortuity than most of the people

          gate was just a minor hiccup to him. Before this, he had vaguely heard
          about the Celestial Demonic Physique, and it was rumoured to have only
          appeared once in the ages.</span

          >The special nature of this physique lay in its ability to merge both
          Celestial and Demon, reversing Yin and Yang, and breaking through the
          cycle of reincarnation. Anyone with the Celestial Demon Physique would
          be nourished by any substance from the earth, surpassing an average
          cultivator, even if he or she had never done any cultivation
          before.</span

          something to do with reversing life and death, or it might be the
          reversing of time and nature itself. In short, he needed to keep a
          close eye on Qing Xiaoyi.</span

          >Soon, news about Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival at the Immortal Academy
          spread from the mouths of many young prodigies and caused quite a huge
          uproar.</span

          because of his status, he drew the attention of a lot of people, and
          before this, there were even rumours long ago that he had been
          confirmed as one of the Ten Great Ranked Disciples. However, in the
          eyes of most people, his strength had even far surpassed the other Ten
          Great Ranked Disciples.</span

          Immortal Academy was stunned as many young beings emerged to get a
          glimpse of the real thing. The terrain of the Immortal Academy was
          vast and boundless with divine trees penetrating the sky and immortal
          hills floating above, as if it was an ancient world that existed since
          the beginning of the universe.</span

          all of them were the best among the younger generation with their own
          private cave and mountain. As for some of the unranked disciples, they
          even owned large pieces of land such as ancient cities. In its
          vicinity were residential palaces which housed the followers, and the
          structure was majestic and imposing with divine springwater hanging
          down and celestial flowers blooming. The spiritual energy in the place
          was dense as it all came from the mountain peak and waterfall,
          creating visions such as phoenixes, black tortoises and Qilins.</span

          Changge&#8217;s figure was nowhere to be seen at the entrance of the
          mountain, so they went back in a low even though they came in high
          spirits.</span

          the ownership of the respective areas were determined, no one knew
          where the other young prodigies were. In order to provide a lot of
          opportunities for the young prodigies who came here to train and
          compete, the Immortal Academy could be said to have gone to great
          lengths to create a world based on the survival of the fittest, which
          meant that the cultivators would have to fight for a place for rest
          and cultivate.</span

          straight for the palace complex deep within the Immortal Academy. The
          place had chaotic mist floating around and blurring the land, as if a
          mysterious and ancient celestial palace had suddenly emerged.</span

          >Back when he was in the Peach Village of the Land of Abandoned
          Celestials, Yao Tao gave him a token, saying that it could help solve
          his Demonic Heart problem. After receiving the token, Gu Changge was
          told by her that the person who owed her a favour resided in the
          Immortal Academy, and he could come find him when he arrived
          here.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, to Gu Changge, the Demonic Heart was a non-issue, so now,
          what he cared about was how to put this favour to good use. Even
          though Yao Tao&#8217;s state at that time was problematic and her
          memories were incomplete, she mentioned that the favour was owed to
          her when she was at her peak, which meant that the person within the
          Immortal Academy should be someone extraordinary.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, Gu Changge went past many divine mountains and arrived at a
          solitary peak in the void without anyone stopping him on the way. At
          the moment, there was no one in the entire Upper Realm who
          couldn&#8217;t recognise him, and the place he was in now was
          considered a forbidden area in the Immortal Academy that could only be
          accessed by Elders, usually.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His body landed from the high sky and appeared in front of the palace
          gate. The palace on the solitary peak was ancient and covered a radius
          of nearly a hundred kilometres, but he knew clearly that the strength
          that lay within wouldn&#8217;t be simple.</span

          golden divine armour with swords crossed in front of their knees as
          they guarded the place. Every one of them were in the Sacred Lord
          Realm, and there were wisps of terrifying divine light between their
          eyes while their strong will of the Sacred Realm filled every inch of
          space.</span

          Immortal Academy in this generation, and without a doubt, the young
          man in front of them was one of the most powerful beings in the
          Immortal Academy. Even some of the Elders wouldn&#8217;t dare to

          presence since he angered him quite a lot when he was in Skyward
          Schloss. Even now, he still remembered how Gu Changge specifically
          went to the mountain peak he resided in before leaving Skyward Schloss
          so that he could remind him that he owed him a favour, as if he was
          afraid that he would deny such a thing.</span

          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, you don&#8217;t have to be polite with
          me. Even though I&#8217;m far away in the Demon World, I still heard a
          lot of rumours about you. Seeing you today, I realise that these
          rumours aren&#8217;t all true. I&#8217;m afraid that you now have
          two-thirds of the younger generation&#8217;s Fortuity all to
          yourself.&#8221;</span

          >Yao Xi couldn&#8217;t help but smile lightly while still showing her
          gracefulness and nobility. As the current Empress of the Demon World,
          she naturally wouldn&#8217;t be as flattering as any ordinary woman,
          but the words that she had chosen still showed some goodwill.</span

          >With her status and strength, she actually didn&#8217;t have to do
          so, but after seeing how her master acted in front of him, she was
          shocked inside her heart.</span

          >There were many factions in the Upper Realm, but not many had the
          power that was comparable to the Demon World. This was because the
          Demon World was an independent world situated right in the heart of
          the Upper Realm, where dragon-like veins converge to fuel the land
          with Fortuity. In short, Gu Changge was nothing but a Junior in front
          of her.</span

          receive such praises from you.&#8221; Listening to her, Gu Changge
          calmly said, &#8220;However, I also heard many rumours about you
          previously, but after seeing you today, I realise that these rumours
          are indeed nonsense.&#8221;</span

          stared at him curiously and asked, &#8220;I wonder what these rumours
          are, Young Master Changge.&#8221;</span

      <h4>Chapter 209: The Perfect Plan; No Choice But to Take the Blame!</h4>
      <p>
        Hearing the conversation of old antiques and big shot’s group in the
        sky, many cultivators fell silent and a shiver ran down their spine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts appeared and was
        suspected of having the backing of a large organisation. He even
        blatantly infiltrated the banquet of the Immortal Gu Family and planned
        to kill the mysterious woman of the Immortal Wang family.
      </p>
      <p>Many people still didn’t know Wang Zijin’s true identity.</p>
      <p>
        But many people speculated that the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor
        was trying to incite a conflict between Immortal Gu and Immortal Wang
        Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because if something happens to Wang Zijin, then the Immortal Gu Family
        was bound to take the majority of the blame.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, people with discerning eyes can see that the Immortal Gu
        Family cannot do such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Judging from the aura of the Secret Technique, it contains the aura
          of Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain. Now, this is going to be
          problematic!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Could the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ inheritor be in the Heavenly
          Emperor’s Mountain?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Young Supremes were shocked when they heard the conversation of the
        older generation’s group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, a very prestigious old antique said that the aura of Secret
        Technique in the battle resembled the aura from the Heavenly Emperor’s
        Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>This terrified them even more and a chill ran through their spine.</p>
      <p>
        In particular, the creatures of the Primordial Ten Thousand Races were
        appalled and in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        For them, the status of Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain simply went without
        saying, and when the Heavenly Emperor Mountain was mentioned, they
        usually had a look of reverence and did not dare to be disrespectful in
        the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, when they heard that Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain might be
        related to the Inheritors of Forbidden Demonic Arts, their brains
        started buzzing and almost exploded.
      </p>
      <p>How was this possible?</p>
      <p>
        The Emperor’s Mountain was above all, and was worshipped and looked up
        to by many clans. It was a force established by several emperors and was
        incomparably transcendent.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, how could it be related to the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor?
      </p>
      <p>They dare not imagine!</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Could it be that Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain is the mastermind
          behind this…? This is too horrifying…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>A Young Supreme said with a gloomy expression.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, who had already taken the core of the puppet inside the
        Inner World under the eyes of these old antiques, flew down from the sky
        at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression on his face looks similar to many Young Supremes, gloomy
        and in deep thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, he shook his head and said,
        <b
          >“If this matter is related to Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain, then why
          did he use the Secret Technique of Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain during
          the battle? By doing this isn’t he just telling everyone that Heavenly
          Emperor’s Mountain is related to Forbidden Demonic Art’s
          Inheritor?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“I don’t believe anyone would be so stupid.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Speaking of this, Gu Changge sighed slightly, as if he was also
        confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Brother Gu’s words are reasonable, and exactly what I suspected
          too.” </b
        >Wang Wushuang, who had calmed down, said this while nodding slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian and other Young Supreme on the side were not stupid either,
        they could obviously see this loophole as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge took in everyone's expressions, and a strange glint flickered
        in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>The effect he wanted has been initially achieved.</p>
      <p>
        He wanted to frame the Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain and put the black pot
        on it, but still not make it look very obvious so that he could make a
        better plan for the next step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of whether they believe it or not, Heavenly Emperor’s
        Mountain has been dragged into this fishy mess for no reason today.
      </p>
      <p>And this was what Gu Changge expected and planned for.</p>
      <p>But… he wasn’t going to leave it at that.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing that Gu Changge took the initiative to defend Heavenly Emperor’s
        Mountain, many creatures from the Primordial Ten Thousand Races looked
        at him with gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they heard that the matter was related to Heavenly Emperor’s
        Mountain, they actually broke out in a cold sweat, worried that Gu
        Changge would unleash his wrath onto the Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain for
        no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his current power, although Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain was
        respected, its status was not to the point that it can quell Gu
        Changge's wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, there were many terrifying forces behind Gu Changge. The Gu
        Family had a boundless heritage, not to mention the Primordial Divine
        Sect, the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace, and the Ancient Immortal Races.
      </p>
      <p>Which one of these forces could be taken lightly?</p>
      <p>
        Although the number of Primordial Ten Thousand Races was huge, before
        this matter was clearly investigated, Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain was
        the most obvious suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, taking the initiative to help clear the suspicion of
        Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain, made them heave a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p>As for Gu Changge being the perpetrator?</p>
      <p>
        Unless there was something really wrong with their brains, no one would
        dare to imagine it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, many older generation powerhouses came from different
        directions, gathering in the vicinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        when they heard him, they sighed and nodded,
        <b
          >“What the Young Master Changge said is right. The aura similar to
          Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain’s Secret Technique is really too
          obvious.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Yeah, it seems that someone is deliberately framing Heavenly
          Emperor's Mountain, making us suspect them. No one is so stupid that
          they can’t see it?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Another old antique who was tall, with a nonchalant face, and came from
        a major sect, spoke with grandeur.
      </p>
      <p>
        He agreed with Gu Changge’s opinion and felt that this matter was most
        likely someone framing the Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, this statement was recognized by almost all the people here. After
        all, this kind of loophole was too obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was impossible for Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain to be so stupid to
        leave such traces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing that everyone was talking about the need to find the True
        Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts and give justice to the Heavenly
        Emperor’s Mountain, Gu Changge’s expression couldn’t help but become a
        little playful.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that look soon disappeared and his expression returned to normal.
      </p>
      <p>But was his plan that simple?</p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge frowned slightly, and he took the initiative to ask
        Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        There seems to be some inexplicable meaning in his deep eyes,
        <b>“I wonder what Miss Zijin thinks about this matter?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, the place suddenly became quiet.</p>
      <p>
        Including the clansmen of the Immortal Gu family, and the guests from
        the Daoist forces, and they could not help but look over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s words now carried a lot of weight and many people wanted to
        hear his opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang, Ye Langtian, and the Young Supreme of the Great
        Golden-Winged Peng Clan all had different expressions, ready to hear
        what Gu Changge had to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Why did Young Master Changge ask this woman’s opinion? Is there
          anything special about this woman’s identity?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people still didn’t know Wang Zijin’s identity, so they couldn't
        help asking curiously.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be able to persist against the Great Sacred Realm Assassin for so
        long was a terrifying ability, even more for someone still this young.
      </p>
      <p>
        This caused many people's hearts to palpitate and they couldn't help but
        admire her.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Be quiet.”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“Saintess Zijin is not someone whom you can freely talk about!”</b>
        When some old antiques heard this, they immediately scolded others and
        showed respect to Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she wasn’t the descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall, how could she
        have been assassinated by the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts for no
        reason? Ordinary Young Supreme would have been crushed to death in the
        first place!
      </p>
      <p><b>Hiss!</b></p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, everyone understood now, their eyes widened, and they
        gasped.
      </p>
      <p>No wonder she was so close to Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        It turned out that this mysterious woman from the Immortal Wang Family
        was actually a descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall, which made them
        astonished and flabbergasted.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Wang Zijin didn’t care what the cultivators next to her
        thought about her.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>She glanced at Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing his expression, she felt that although he didn’t say anything, he
        was thinking the same thing as her, so she couldn’t help but smile and
        said,<b>
          “Actually, my opinion is similar to that of Brother Gu, and now
          everyone is subconsciously thinking that Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain
          is being framed and has nothing to do with the inferior of the
          forbidden Demonic Arts.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“But in my opinion, that’s the most problematic thing.”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“After all, everyone will rule out Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain as a
          suspect first, and instead start to find another suspect… But what if
          the real perpetrator is missed due to that? Wouldn’t this be exactly
          what he wanted?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Her words were light and gentle.</p>
      <p>
        But it was like hundreds of thousands of mountains, crashing at
        everyone’s heart.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        Especially the group of old antiquities, their faces were horrified, as
        if layers of fog had been uncovered and they were instantly awakened.
      </p>
      <p>
        They found that… what they had thought and what Wang Zijin said were
        actually not much different!
      </p>
      <p>
        That is to say, they have already taken the initiative to rule out the
        Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain as a suspect, thinking that it cannot be
        related to the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Art.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, for such an obvious lingering aura, other than being framed,
        what other explanation can there be?.
      </p>
      <p>But what if… this was actually intentional!</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, many people felt chills all over their body. If Wang
        Zijin hadn’t pointed this out, they would’ve started in the wrong
        direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“As expected of the Saintess of the Human Ancestral Hall! She is
          exceptionally smart, and she figured out the key in an instant, which
          makes the old man admire you endlessly.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        An old cultivator agreed with this statement, and it was more convincing
        than at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“No matter what we say it is all in theory and although we are
          suspicious, there is no evidence to prove that it is related to
          Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain. Anyway, if this plan was really arranged
          by Heavenly Emperor's Mountain, then it is really frightening, and I
          was almost fooled by it.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Thanks to Saintess Zijin, otherwise I wouldn’t be able to figure it
          out.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, everyone began to compliment Wang Zijin, and their words
        were full of admiration and praise.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a young age, her cultivation was unfathomable, and she was also close
        to Gu Changge, her future prospects were simply limitless!
      </p>
      <p>The younger generation also nodded, with different expressions.</p>
      <p>
        When they heard Wang Zijin’s words they couldn’t help but admire her,
        her perspective of things was very different, helping her analyse the
        crucial point, something they couldn’t do.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, many creatures of the Primordial Ten Thousand Races
        turned pale after hearing this, unable to accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Brother Gu’s opinion should be similar to mine, right?”</b> Wang
        Zijin smiled and asked Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded, with a hint of admiration, and said,
        <b
          >“Yes, I didn't expect that Miss Zijin's thoughts would coincide with
          mine, even though I was almost fooled at first, no matter what,
          Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain is still the most suspicious.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Hearing what he said, Wang Zijin seemed to smile even more deeply.</p>
      <p>
        At these words, all the cultivators were silent, feeling an even greater
        gloom, coming over their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain was involved, the days were about to
        change!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“But now the descendants of the Human Ancestral Hall have left
          seclusion and we have Young Master Changge with the talent of the True
          Immortal on our side. So it is not hopeless…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>

          >“Forbidden Demonic Art’s Inheritors are ravaging the world, it's time
          to find a way to track down their location and eliminate them all in
          one fell swoop.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone’s minds were coincidentally thinking the same, the younger
        generation had Young Master Changge, so they see hope in fighting
        against the Inheritors of Forbidden Demonic Arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching everyone, Gu Changge’s expression was natural and no one knew
        that he was laughing in his heart right now.
      </p>
      <p>‘Tonight’s goal has finally been achieved.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘This black pot has finally reached the Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain didn’t want to, they had to bear and
        accept it.
      </p>
      <p>Humiliating them to death.</p>
      <p>
        They would have never imagined that they were calculated by Gu Changge
        until the day they die.

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge also heard the message prompt from the system.
      </p>
      <p>He couldn’t help but smile in his heart.</p>
      <p>
        It seems that there was no problem with his plan. Even the flapping of a
        butterfly's wings can cause a storm on the other side of the ocean, not
        to mention his actions.
        <i><strong>1 It is a reference to the butterfly effect.</strong></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it seems to be very small, the sensation it caused in the
        entire Upper Realm was absolutely huge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This little horse feeder was going to walk toward his death, controlled
        in the palm of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, what happened at Immortal Gu’s house tonight spread out
        immediately, causing a great sensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the guests witnessed the scene with their own eyes, and they have
        nothing to say about the news, proving its authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>For a time, the whole Upper Realm was in turmoil.</p>
      <p>
        The reappearance of the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic arts caused
        everyone to tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially this time, they were even more daring. He even wanted to
        assassinate the descendant of the Human ancestral hall. Fortunately, he
        was stopped by the powerhouses of the Gu family. Otherwise, the
        consequences would be unfathomable.

      </p>
      <p>
        This matter triggered the fear and attention of the major forces and
        Daoist Sects, and Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain was the first to bear the
        brunt of it, being instantly pushed into the limelight.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, the sensation caused by this matter was too horrendous and
        terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        That day the scene of a Great Sacred Realm assassinating the descendant
        of the Human Ancestral Hall spread out, and the aura of the Secret
        Technique of the Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain couldn’t be mistaken
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, various opinions were circulated all over the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it was the human race or the creatures of the other races, they
        were all cautious and afraid of this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        After tens of millions of years, the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts
        had reappeared in the world and was more terrifying and hidden than any
        previous Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n

      </p>
      <p>And just when all the major powers were shaken up.</p>
      <p>Another news story broke out!</p>
      <p>
        Emperor Ying’s heir, the Heavenly Prince, Ying Shuang came out of
        seclusion!
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as this news came out, it immediately triggered a terrifying
        wave, and the sensation it caused was tremendous.
      </p>
      <p>
        After investigation, people found out that the day it was announced that
        Heavenly Prince Ying Shuang would come out of seclusion was the same day
        on which Mother Gu held the birthday banquet. It was also the same day
        on which the descendant of Human Ancestral Hall was almost killed.
      </p>
      <p>This timing was incredibly coincidental.</p>
      <p>
        This shocked many Daoist Sects, and many people even felt anger in their
        hearts.
      </p>
      <p>‘This is too coincidental, right?’</p>
      <p>
        In the eyes of people, this was the provocation of Heavenly Emperor’s
        Mountain to many Daoist Sects!
      </p>
      <p>Simply Brazen and reckless!</p>
      <p>Especially the White Tiger Clan, they were simply mad with hatred.</p>
      <p>
        After all, their heir died in the hands of the Forbidden Demonic Arts’
        Inheritor and even his origin was devoured.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although they also belong to Primordial Ten Thousand Races and should
        respect the Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain but… the news about the
        connection between the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor and Heavenly
        Emperor’s Mountain made them furious, wishing to go seek justice in
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their patriarch, with anger and red eyes, roared up to the sky, unable
        to vent his anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Damn, I didn’t expect that my son’s death would be related to the
          Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain, which we deeply respected.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Many clan elders on the side hurriedly stopped him and said,
        <b
          >“The patriarch is not allowed to do this, how could you be so
          reckless? We must seek justice for the death of the Young Master, but
          there’s no evidence against the Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain. It’s all
          just speculation in the end!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn’t want to cause trouble for the White Tiger Clan for no
        reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heritage of the White Tiger Clan was not comparable to that of the
        Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain. There have been many emperors who have been
        in charge of it. Who knows how many were still left?
      </p>
      <p>They hate it too!</p>
      <p>
        However, Heavenly Emperor's Mountain has stood high for many years, so
        they naturally had many supporters. Many clans thought that Heavenly
        Emperor's Mountain was just being framed by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emperor Mountain is high, transcendent, and respected by all races, why
        would they need to do such a self-deprecating thing?
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a deliberate frame-up by the Young Master of the Immortal Gu
        Family and the descendants of the Human Ancestral Hall!
      </p>
      <p>In short, there were all kinds of opinions and accusations.</p>

      <p>
        <b
          >“What’s going on? Could it be that Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain is
          really related to the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Damn, I don’t have any memories at all. Is it true? Or is someone
          deliberately framing me?”</b

      </p>
      <p>
        An incomparably luxurious and lofty phoenix boat with flickering runes
        was racing through the middle of the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the pavilion, sitting cross-legged, dressed in exquisite and
        luxurious clothes, and surrounded by the immortal aura, Ying Shuang’s
        face was full of shock and disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>He frowned, as he heard the news from the outside world.</p>
      <p>
        Against the opposition of the entire Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain, he
        planned to roam the world, but he did not expect that what greeted him
        was not the respect and awe of the people, but all kinds of abuse and
        anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Ying Shuang was stunned, and his expression became
        extremely ugly.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was now the Emperor’s heir with high status, who in this world dares
        to despise and underestimate him?
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter where he went, he would surely be revered and respected by
        cultivators and other creatures alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the identity of being the Heavenly Prince, was there anyone above
        him?
      </p>
      <p>
        However, once the name of the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts
        was mentioned, let alone the heir of Emperor Ying, even if Emperor Ying
        himself appeared, it’d be useless.
      </p>
      <p>This made Ying Shuang angry, unwilling, and even fearful.</p>
      <p>
        After all, he was not the real heir of Emperor Ying! He was just an
        imposter, wearing this body, with little memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, if someone really doubts him and wants to do something to
        him, what should he do?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang was panicking, and his palms were covered in a cold sweat.
      </p>
      <p>
        This required even more skill than just pretending to be the heir of the
        emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts was the greatest enemy
        recognized by all the Daoist Sects and Immortal Clans in the world since
        the Immortal Period!
      </p>
      <p>
        He has lost the confidence he had in the beginning, his heart was
        uneasy, and his back was covered in a cold sweat.
      </p>
      <p>
        He even felt a little regretful and unwilling. Who knew that after
        becoming the Emperor’s heir, rather than enjoying it, he would take the
        blame for the Emperor’s heir?
      </p>
      <p>
        It would have been easier to feed the horses, at least he didn’t have to
        be worried about his life at all times!
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Ying Shuang even began to resent the unknown existence who
        replaced him and the Emperor’s heir in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Oh god, if you wanted me to enjoy all this, then why do I have to
          bear all this?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang’s voice trembled slightly, and he understood that there was
        no point in complaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, he calmed down and began to talk to himself,<b>
          “Right now, I can’t panic, let alone show weakness, otherwise, the
          wrath of all people will be vented into the Heavenly Emperor's
          Mountain.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Whether I am a Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor or not, I can’t
          admit it at all, I have to find a way to clear the suspicion…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Various thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
      <p>
        But in the end, there was no way he could prove his innocence… unless he
        found the true Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“All of this is because I was framed by that Gu Changge and the
          descendants of the Human Ancestral Hall…f*****g bastards”</b
        >
        Ying Shuang has already formed a grudge against these two people,
        waiting for the identity of the Inheritors of the Forbidden Demonic Arts
        to be cleared. After that, he will definitely settle the account with
        them.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Brother, are the rumours true?”</b></p>
      <p>
        At this moment, the soft voice of a girl suddenly came from outside Ying
        Shuang’s door.
      </p>
      <p>
        A tall girl with shoulder-length silver hair and a beautiful face,
        dressed in Immortal clothes, was standing there, asked with a frown on
        her face.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >3Mohking: Just thinking of the amount of time I have to write
          Immortal in the Immortal Realm is making me shudder.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>It was Ying Shuang’s sister, Ying Yu.</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, she did not know how many waves of
        cultivators and creatures who came to attack them had been killed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of her brother’s high profile, their whereabouts have been
        noticed by many forces, and these forces had more or less irreconcilable
        grudges with the Forbidden Demon Arts’ Inheritors.
      </p>
      <p>As a result, they all came one by one, intending to take revenge!</p>
      <p>This made Ying Yu feel very troubled.</p>
      <p>
        Now she was very confused, she felt that this kind of stupid thing was
        not something the brother she knows can do.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for being the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts? Since her brother
        broke the seal, he has been practising in the palace all these years,
        not even taking a step outside.
      </p>
      <p>The Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic power was her brother?</p>
      <p>How could this be possible?</p>
      <p><b>“What do you think?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Ying Shuang, who was across the door, panicked in his
        heart, but he deliberately kept calm and asked.
      </p>
      <p>Ying Yu stood outside the pavilion and did not go in.</p>
      <p>
        Since some time ago, she felt that Ying Shuang’s behaviour has been a
        little strange, and he asked her about many things he already knew.
      </p>
      <p>She couldn’t tell what was going on, but it was definitely strange.</p>
      <p>
        However, she only thought that recently Ying Shuang's cultivation had
        hit a bottleneck and his temperament had slightly changed due to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It’s fine if brother doesn't say anything, but this matter has to be
          resolved sooner or later.” </b
        >Ying Yu said softly and left.
      </p>
      <p>
        She pondered in her mind, feeling that it was unrealistic to clear the
        suspicion of being the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts and that it
        was impossible for her to fight against all the major Daoist forces.
      </p>
      <p>How vast and boundless was the Upper World?</p>
      <p>
        Who knows how many powerhouses and masters were hidden in it, although
        the status of the Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain was transcendent, no
        matter how confident she was, it was impossible to be the enemy of
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“So the best way is to block it rather than stopping it. The rumours
          were spread from the Immortal Gu Family that night. Gu Changge and the
          descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall…” </b
        >Ying Yu said to herself, thinking of two very important people.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also did not think that there was a problem with the two's claims…
        but the key thing was that Heavenly Emperor’s Mountain was really
        framed, and the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor was incomparably
        subtle in staging the suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It seems that I have to meet Gu Changge. I'm afraid the only way to
          clear the suspicion is to get him to act. In today's younger
          generation, only he is powerful enough to turn this situation around
          instantly.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Ying Yu thought of a solution. She had to tell Gu Changge that he
        had misunderstood.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Thanks to the amazing means of this sister of mine, otherwise I
          wouldn't really know what to do at this time.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the pavilion, Ying Shuang could not help but breathe a sigh of
        relief when he felt his sister leave. In addition, the clans around him
        were also powerful people with powerful means.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, he really wouldn’t know what to do!</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Gu Changge, the descendant of Human Ancestral Hall…”</b> Soon, there
        was deep hatred and anger in his eyes, and a strong resentment and
        jealousy rose for Gu Changge, who had been dazzling and bigger than him
        from birth.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘How dare he put me in such a dangerous situation with just a few
        words!’

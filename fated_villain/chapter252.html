      <h4>
        Chapter 252-1: A premonition of sibling‚Äôs rebellion, About another
        inheritor of demonic art (1)
      </h4>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>At this time, Ying Yu was the first to speak.</p>
      <p>
        This was the first time she had seen Gu Changge in person, and he was
        far more terrifying and powerful than the rumors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just the mighty group of followers behind him was enough to explain
        everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that even if she was in the Quasi-Sacred Realm, she
        couldn't see Gu Changge's cultivation, as if there was a layer of fog.
        This reminded Ying Yu of the rumor that Gu Changge had a fight with the
        Great Sacred Realm in the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This man was far more unfathomable than she imagined. This made Ying Yu
        much more cautious in her heart, she originally planned to ask about the
        humiliation she suffered in front of Gu family's Mountain Gate that day.
      </p>
      <p>But at this time, she had already left behind that matter.</p>
      <p>"Oh, what advice does Miss Ying Yu have?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Ying Yu calling her name, Gu Changge seemed to notice her, and
        was slightly surprised. When he first investigated Ying Shuang, he knew
        the existence of his sister Ying Yu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unexpectedly, she just arrived in Southern Heaven and she took the
        initiative to send herself to his door.
      </p>
      <p>This made Gu Changge a little surprised.</p>
      <p>
        <i
          >It‚Äôs been a long time since the leeks were delivered to my door in
          person.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, you said that my brother is the inheritor of the demonic
        art. Wouldn't that be too arbitrary?" Ying Yu was also very direct at
        this time, with her silver eyes staring at him.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was straight to the point and asked this sentence in front of
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was a little surprised to hear this, "Did thai Gu said this?
        Maybe Miss Ying Yu made a mistake?"
      </p>
      <p>
        He was telling the truth. He really didn't say that. But it was not that
        he didn't say anything, it was just that he didn't mention Ying Shuang
        at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back then, when he was in the Ancient Immortal Gu family, he placed the
        blame on Ying Shuang's head. Gu Changge was just echoing the speculation
        of Wang Ziji, the descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if Ying Yu wanted to find someone to settle the bill, she should go
        to Wang Ziji. It had nothing to do with him, Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" Ying Yu's face changed slightly, and at this time she also
        realized that this sentence was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge did not say that. But under the circumstances at the time,
        everyone felt that someone was framing Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        It was just that Gu Changge and Wang Ziji acted in the opposite
        direction, thinking that this was an intentional attempt for Heavenly
        Emperor Mountain to confuse the public and make everyone ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, everyone felt that Heavenly Emperor Mountain was framed by
        someone. Then, when tracking down the inheritor of demonic arts, they
        would definitely ignore the Heavenly Emperor Mountain first, thinking
        that they were also victims.
      </p>
      <p>
        This method was more despicable than directly saying that Emperor
        Mountain was related to the inheritor of demonic art. It just happened
        that they couldn't find a way to wash it all away.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, that's what you meant at the time, but now you still want
        to argue. My brother and you have no grievances or enmity, why did you
        frame him?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu still didn't give up, after all she finally saw Gu Changge, so
        she would not give up so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she hoped that her brother would come here with her and
        confront Gu Changge. But after Ying Shuang came to Southern Heaven, he
        never left his mansion, saying that he was waiting for the news of the
        Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Ying Yu very helpless, and there was no other way. N√™ww
        ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why do I have to argue? I haven't made a direct conclusion as to who is
        the inheritor of the demonic art. Could it be that Miss Ying Yu thinks
        that finding the inheritor of the demonic art is like a child's play,
        and one can cover the coffin at will?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "And as you said, I have no grudges with Prince Ying, do I have to do
        this? What I said to Holy Maiden Ziji was just a possibility."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Even if you want to blame, you have to blame the Holy Maiden, right?
        Did you come to trouble Gu, thinking that Gu's temperament is gentle, so
        you can deal with it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled lightly, but at his last words, his smile also
        subsided. His expression was profound and indifferent.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I don't have such an idea, Gu Changge, you think too much." Ying Yu
        gritted her teeth, her soul trembled as she felt the terrifying power
        that seemed to be suffocating her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was fine when he spoke just now. Now when he changed his
        expression, she could feel the palpitating feeling more intuitively.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Gu Changge said at this time caused the pavilion and the many
        cultivators in the vicinity to pay close attention to this place, and
        their expressions changed greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the matter of the inheritor of demonic arts was of great
        importance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the eyes of everyone, what Ying Yu was doing now was the same as
        making trouble out of nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge and the descendant of Human Ancestor Hall did not say that
        Prince Ying was the inheritor of demonic arts, but they just put forward
        their own ideas at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After many cultivators discussed it, they thought so. And no one was a
        fool who would do thankless things.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Human Ancestor Hall had been fighting against the inheritor
        of demonic arts for many years, and Wang Ziji's words had convinced many
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that some time ago, another descendant of the Human
        Ancestor Hall also stopped outside the Emperor Mountain and finally
        left.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the surface of all these signs, Emperor Mountain had the biggest
        suspicion. What else did Ying Yu want to wash?
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, in the ancient city of Southern Heaven, there were many
        strong people. Even if Ying Yu was the daughter of the Emperor, she did
        not dare to cause public anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In my opinion, it's obvious that she couldn't find a solution, so she
        found the young master Changge, and she was already anxious."
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "Wait until the day when her brother's identity as the inheritor of
        demonic arts is really revealed, I will see how she will look‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I think she is completely covering up the inheritor of demonic power
        and intends to be the enemy of the whole world."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Either kill him here today, and avoid leaving a scourge in the future."
      </p>
      <p>
        The discussion voices of the cultivators around that was icy cold along
        with a killing intent, also entered Ying Yu's ears, making her
        complexion a little pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Gu Changge said this, her actions just now obviously caused public
        anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Forget it, it seems that Miss Ying Yu has a simple temperament and is a
        straightforward person. Gu will not care about today's affairs. You
        should figure it out yourself."
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, Gu Changge sighed helplessly and waved his hand.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, the followers behind him immediately understood what he
        meant and began to drive away the cultivators who were looking around.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge even did this. At this time, everyone nearby also understood
        that he didn't want to pursue anything, and they didn't dare to give him
        face at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the anger dissipated, the man in black and the others also breathed
        a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p>Inexplicably, they were grateful to Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        They also knew that if the public anger broke out, with their strength,
        they would not be able to stop so many cultivators, and they would be
        killed or injured today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who told them to be so unlucky, and have a relationship with the
        inheritor of demonic art?
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, only Wang Wushuang, Ye Langtian, Chi Ling and other young supreme
        beings were left in the pavilion, as well as Ying Yu, whose face was
        still a little pale, and the people around her.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's sudden relief made her a little surprised and puzzled.</p>
      <p>
        Logically, she was so aggressive and asked directly, Gu Changge should
        be angry and attack her, right?
      </p>
      <p>Why would he help her?</p>
      <p>
        "Since everyone is here, why don't Miss Ying Yu sit down and have a
        drink."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge sat down calmly and naturally, and then
        greeted Ying Yu who was a little dazed.
      </p>
      <p>"Miss‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        "Miss, this is a request from the Young Master Changge. Don't be
        stubborn. By the way, I apologize to the Young Master Changge for being
        disrespectful just now."
      </p>
      <p>
        The man in black beside Ying Yu immediately whispered beside her when he
        saw this, and at the same time looked at Gu Changge slightly
        flatteringly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although he was asked by his parents to follow Prince Ying, he was not
        stupid. He understood that Ying Shuang was now a mud bodhisattva
        crossing the river and he could not protect himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the issue of the inheritor of demonic art was resolved, there was
        no second possibility other than being beaten like a rat crossing the
        street with Ying Shuang.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was better to take the opportunity to show goodwill to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of identity or strength, Gu Changge was far better than Ying
        Shuang.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 252-2: A premonition of sibling‚Äôs rebellion, About another
        inheritor of demonic art (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        This scene shocked all the young supreme beings who were injured by this
        ancient freak just now. When would they be able to be like Gu Changge.
        Who could deter many beings by doing nothing, and relying on power
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, thank you for your rescue just now."</p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu was not someone who didn't know the good and the bad, and could
        distinguish the priorities. She felt grateful towards Gu Changge for the
        current situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone was also very sensible, and gave her the seat beside Gu
        Changge. She hesitated first, and then sat down. If one sat too far away
        from Gu Changge, it would inevitably be a little rude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't seem to care about this either. After Ying Yu sat
        down, he stopped paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gradually, Ying Yu felt a bit like sitting on the edge of a needle and
        was uncomfortable, which reminded her of the scene of waiting in front
        of Ancient Immortal Gu Family's mountain gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also thought that Gu Changge had some intentions when he made a move
        to save her just now. But now it seemed that Gu Changge did it without
        any hesitation, she thought too much, otherwise why would he ignore her
        after letting him sit down.
      </p>
      <p>For a while, Ying Yu couldn't understand Gu Changge's actions.</p>
      <p>
        He also didn't look like he had any ill will towards her and her
        brother. At this time, it was the man in black behind Ying Yu who kept
        giving her a wink, signaling her to take the initiative to toast.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, at this time, sticking there like a wooden pier, doing
        nothing, was not only stupid but very much stupid. Ying Yu also reacted
        suddenly, when did she become so stupid?
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, this cup is for helping me handle the situation."</p>
      <p>
        However, this was obviously her first toast, and she seemed very
        unfamiliar, and her words were also very blunt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge glanced sideways at her, his eyes were somewhat
        interested, but it was not unexpected. After all, it was all within his
        expectations.
      </p>
      <p>"There's no need for this wine."</p>
      <p>
        Then, he waved his hand and said casually, "I just saw your simple and
        straightforward personality and knew that you had no malicious
        intentions."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you came here with malice, believe it or not, you would have been
        crushed by me now, right?" His words were understated, but with a
        piercing chill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu shivered uncontrollably, and her face turned pale. She knew that
        Gu Changge's words were not false. Gu Changge indeed had the ability to
        do so.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "If you have time to waste on me, you might as well ask your brother
        more. Maybe he has something to hide from you? He didn't come out to
        confront me." Afterwards, Gu Changge smiled nonchalantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course Ying Shuang did not dare to come out and confront him. After
        all, Gu Changge still had the handle on his body. In this regard, Ying
        Shuang was also very clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I understand‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" Afterwards, Ying Yu quickly recovered. From Gu
        Changge's various actions, it was shown that he had no hostility toward
        Ying Shuang and Heavenly Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason why there was such a guess was only based on the most
        appropriate possibility at the time. Therefore, the problem did not lie
        with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>Who would it be on?</p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu fell into contemplation. Looking at this scene, Gu Changge's
        expression was somewhat intriguing.
      </p>
      <p>
        To seize the Luck points from the Son of Luck, the greatest target was
        the person around him who was most familiar with him. All he had to do
        was point out a few things..
      </p>
      <p>
        For the rest, as long as Ying Yu was not stupid, she could find out‚Ä¶
        Ying Shuang had been deceiving her!
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had already vaguely seen the drama between the siblings. With
        that he began to drink wine on Ying Yu's own initiative as it could be
        seen that she rarely drank wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the wine here, even if the cultivator resolved it with cultivation,
        had great effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu didn't expect Gu Changge to pour wine for her, and was a little
        flattered for a while. Although she couldn't drink too much, at this
        time, it was not easy to save Gu Changge's face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, she drank a few cups. She was a little dizzy and almost fell.
        Fortunately, Gu Changge was quick-witted and gave her a hand.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Young Master Gu."</p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu's head was even more dizzy at this time, and her face was
        slightly red. However, the name of Gu Changge was also changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shook his head a little helplessly, "Miss Ying Yu, you drank
        too much‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        The black-clothed man named Agu scratched his head and said
        flatteringly, "Young lady rarely drinks wine, so I hope Young Master
        Changge doesn't blame her."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge waved his hand, "Then you can take Miss Ying Yu back."</p>
      <p>Ying Yu's two maids stepped forward and took her away.</p>

        "Young Master Changge, then we'll leave first." The black-clothed man
        smiled back, and then led people away.
      </p>
      <p>
        A strange color flashed in Gu Changge's eyes. Except for him, the rest
        of the people did not see the slightest abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he was helping Ying Yu just now, he took the opportunity to leave a
        rune mark, just to determine where she and Ying Shuang were.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, when Ying Yu returned drunk, what would her brother think?
        After all, the person who drank with her was himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, the rest of the young supreme also said their goodbyes. But
        in the end, Ye Langtian and Ye Liuli chose to stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        They told Gu Changge a lot of news about True Immortal Academy, and even
        said another thing that made Gu Changge more interested.
      </p>
      <p>"Another inheritor of demonic art appeared?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge raised his eyebrows and asked without much change, "Are you
        sure this is true?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "My sister and I have seen it with our own eyes, and based on my
        understanding of the inheritor of demonic art during this period of
        time, we should not be wrong."
      </p>
      <p>
        "At that time, that mysterious man should be cultivating when he was in
        the wilderness. He was cultivating the essence of some ancient corpses
        and swallowing their aura. All kinds of scenes were exactly the same as
        the forbidden demonic arts in the records."
      </p>
      <p>Ye Langtian said with a heavy expression.</p>
      <p>
        "An ancient artifact that was auctioned at that time also involved
        forbidden art‚Ä¶ It just happened to be taken away by that mysterious
        person." Ye Liuli also said.
      </p>
      <p>"I see."</p>
      <p>
        After listening to this, Gu Changge nodded, while looking a little
        thoughtful.
      </p>
      <p><i>Interesting.</i></p>
      <p>Various thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
      <p>
        Was the inheritor of demonic arts other than him in this world real? Or
        disguised? He was born with the demonic art he possessed, and it was not
        someone's inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did that person accept the inheritance of demonic art from the inheritor
        of a certain generation?
      </p>
      <p>
        But‚Ä¶ in Gu Changge's mind, a figure appeared inexplicably. T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl
        updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com
      </p>
      <p>In the end he was not sure, and was determined to know.</p>

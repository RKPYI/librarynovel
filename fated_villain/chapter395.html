        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Jun Fan said was simply too shocking. Hearing him say such things, Qing
                Zhu&#8217;s fingers were uncontrollably shaking; her face paled as her mind was ringing. Although she
                prepared herself to betray the Empress, she never expected to have to murder her.</span><span
                id="more-29574"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, Empress Yao Xi raised her for so many years, so she
                was indebted to the Empress, and if it weren&#8217;t for the Empress, she wouldn&#8217;t have been able
                to enjoy her current position. Thus, she might be capable of betraying the Empress, but there was no way
                she could bring herself to murder her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Qing Zhu, don&#8217;t fret. You won&#8217;t be related to this matter.
                This flask of pill powder does not comprise any poisonous content. No one will notice it. I know
                you&#8217;re too kind to pull this off, but even you know how ruthless and heartless Yao Xi is. If she
                were to know about our relationship, do you think she would forgive you over sentiments? No one will be
                able to save you then.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at Qing Zhu&#8217;s perturbed expression, Jun Fan, as though he
                predicted this, heaved a sigh and continued persuading.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y—You&#8217;re right. Her Majesty won&#8217;t let us off if she were
                to know about us.&#8221; Qing Zhu widened her eyes as her face blanched. After listening to Jun Fan, she
                could feel her heart wavering, knowing that she was left with no choice now. Back when she agreed to be
                Jun Fan&#8217;s spy by Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s side, she should have expected the coming of this day.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was reluctant to be an officer who would eventually be handed away by the
                Empress to a random powerful man, just as how it was with Gu Changge. She believed that in the
                Empress&#8217;s eyes, she was nothing but a tool that could be abandoned anytime.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How confident are you?&#8221; Quickly, Qing Zhu calmed herself down,
                staring at Jun Fan as she questioned him. Betrayal or not, her loyalty wouldn&#8217;t matter if she
                couldn&#8217;t protect her life with it. Simultaneously, she accepted the white clay flask from Jun
                Fan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you succeed, then I&#8217;m ninety percent certain.&#8221; Seeing
                that, Jun Fan was pleasantly surprised, after which, he assured, &#8220;I&#8217;m also in control of
                certain powerful individuals. Everything but the last piece is ready. The pill powder in your hand by
                itself functions as a supplement, so the failure of the remaining steps won&#8217;t affect you in any
                way.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Jun Fan implied that whatever Qing Zhu was to do
                wouldn&#8217;t be noticed by anyone else.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding his insinuation, Qing Zhu nodded. A supplement like this
                wouldn&#8217;t be poisonous if it was consumed alone, and instead, it would be good for one&#8217;s
                health.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, even Empress Yao Xi were to doubt her daily meal, she wouldn&#8217;t
                be able to trace back to any poison component, so Qing Zhu was safe from any risk of exposure.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, I shall trust you.&#8221; Qing Zhu grew visibly determined as
                some kind of insanity arose in her eyes. If she were to succeed, she would become a historic force that
                overthrew the Empress, her name would live for generations to come.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, the two continued discussing their strategies before Qing Zhu
                eventually stood up and walked away with a heavy heart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jun Fan watched as she departed before faintly heaving a sigh, muttering,
                &#8220;Forgive me, Qing Zhu. If you were to succeed, I&#8217;ll give you the antidote.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finished, he turned to the cup of tea on the stone table, from which, vapour
                was wafting along with a subtle tinge of fragrance.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Jun Fan seemed restless as well, but he was not to blame.
                Essentially, given his identity, he was destined to stay away from the light of the sun and remain
                hidden in the shadows, but things might change should the assassination turn out to be successful.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, if the assassination was failed, there was no telling what risk would
                haunt him. Since Qing Zhu was aware of his identity, if Empress Yao Xi were to know about him, he would
                definitely be exposed. By then, he couldn&#8217;t fathom what he could do for his family of this life,
                and he couldn&#8217;t even imagine what sort of terror would come for him. Therefore, for safety
                purposes, he poisoned the tea and quietly had Qing Zhu, who never doubted him, consume it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the assassination were to fail by then, Qing Zhu, naturally,
                wouldn&#8217;t survive without the antidote, which others would perceive as a suicide, so none would
                think of blaming Jun Fan. If the assassination were to succeed, he would give her the antidote and beg
                her for forgiveness.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This plan of mine must succeed. As long as Yao Xi shows up to the Banquet of
                Prodigies, there won&#8217;t be any miscalculations.] With that in mind, Juin Fan&#8217;s face grew
                emotionlessly cold.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, the woman in purple you instructed us to keep watch on
                has left the imperial palace and was headed to another direction. She headed towards Black and White
                Academy, but she swiftly left without staying for long.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in a spectacular palace, Gu Changge was leisurely playing chess,
                and he was fascinated by the report.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beside him, there was a menacing, intimidating man, who was the one voicing
                the report. The man&#8217;s name was Tian Ze, and he was a subordinate chosen by Gu Changge from Chaos
                Star Territory. Tian Ze was in the Sacred Lord Realm, and had rich experience in fighting and
                slaughter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If I recall correctly, Black and White Academy was founded by Empress Yao Xi
                6000 years ago in order to gather and raise the most talented.] Gu Changge casually moved his chess
                piece. [Then, it is clear that she was looking for someone in Black and White Academy. Judging by the
                short duration of her stay, she must be sending some sort of message.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking that, he let out a chuckle. If he hadn&#8217;t paid attention back
                then, he probably wouldn&#8217;t have noticed such a detail.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, Empress Yao Xi must not have predicted that one of her most
                trusted subordinates, whom she raised for so long, would become a spy of others in her midst. As such,
                every movement and whereabouts of hers was continuously known by her enemy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensely furrowing her brows, Jiang Luoshen stared at the checkmate on the
                chessboard and turned to Gu Changge, only to see his irritating grin. She wasn&#8217;t particularly bad
                at chess, yet she stood no chance against him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Besides, if Jun Bufan doubles his aggressiveness, it&#8217;s possible for
                him to poison Empress Yao Xi during her daily cultivation and meals, but the odds are low. Given her
                vigilance, it&#8217;s going to be hard to pull off.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wait, no.] Gu Changge ignored Jiang Luoshen as he continued tapping on his
                chess piece. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, he thought of a way that Jun Bufan could poison Empress Yao
                Xi without getting exposed to the world, but that would require Qing Zhu to be bold enough to pull it
                off.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Demon World&#8217;s Banquet of Prodigies is in three days. The major Clans
                across various Domains will be attending it in Black and White Academy, and Empress Yao Xi, too, will
                show up. Trying to cause trouble during that time would be the best opportunity he has. If I was him,
                I&#8217;d definitely pick that moment to make my move. Besides, If my inference is right, Jun Bufan is
                now in Black and White Academy.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge squinted his eyes as he came to the answer. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, Black and White Academy harboured more than 100,000
                disciples, so it would be burdensome to search one by one. Therefore, he wasn&#8217;t hasty. Given the
                small area, the Heir of the Demon Overlord needed only to appear before him and he would be able to
                detect him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Heh&#8230; Still, Empress Yao Xi sure is miserable, being betrayed without
                knowing it. If this were the ordinary timeline, Jun Bufan might just be the victor in the Banquet of
                Prodigies.] Gu Changge thought, but doubted that Empress Yao Xi didn&#8217;t have any defensive
                measures. Although he saw through everything, he had no intention of informing her as he was planning to
                manipulate the Empress, and to do that, the most crucial part was to let her completely rely on
                him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the way to secure such a goal, it would depend on whether Jun Bufan
                would create an opportunity for him. On the other hand, the subordinate named Qing Zhu might possibly be
                a key person who would affect the Banquet of Prodigies three days later.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Keep watching her every move. Shall any oddities occur, report
                to me immediately.&#8221; After a moment of contemplation, Gu Changge commanded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Young Master.&#8221; Upon the order, Tian Ze&#8217;s body
                flickered and instantly disappeared.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, Gu Changge continued steadily tapping on his chess piece. [Right
                now, Bai Kun&#8217;s daughter, Bai Lian&#8217;er, and her disciple are in the Demon World, but they have
                yet to locate Jun Bufan. I wonder if there will be any other variables.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the owner of Nephrite Breeze Pavillion, Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s
                cultivation level was at least in the Sacred King Realm, which was by no means insignificant regardless
                of the place she was in.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge.&#8221; Out of nowhere, Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s dissatisfied
                voice interrupted Gu Changge&#8217;s thoughts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, you’ve lost again.&#8221; Gu Changge breezily shot her a glance.
                &#8220;Time to pay up.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gritting her teeth, Jiang Luoshen wordlessly walked over and started
                massaging his shoulders. As expected, practice makes perfect. After some time, her massaging technique
                grew more and more advanced, unlike that when she first started. As her snowy, delicate hands landed on
                his shoulders, she appeared especially beguiling with her golden hair resting on his back, resembling
                the vibrance of the sun. Furthermore, there was a waft of a pleasant aroma.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re not that incompetent after all. You sure have learned how
                to give a good massage.&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Jiang Luoshen icily glared at him before rolling her eyes on
                him. Never had she expected to learn to serve someone like this given her identity. This would have been
                a miraculous surprise to her in the past.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So when are you going to learn how to warm my bed?&#8221; Gu Changge
                fascinatedly asked.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s pale, slender neck subtly
                reddened, as though it was a ruby of superior grade, and one could even see her golden veins. The blood
                of the members of Godly Illusion Clan was of gold colour, as they possessed incomparable Divinity in
                them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, her face remained cold without much change as she scoffed,
                &#8220;Gu Changge, don&#8217;t try to force me into doing such things, or I&#8217;ll kill you.”</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Changge sounded somewhat helpless and disconcerted, though
                he never forced her. &#8220;Is that so? You&#8217;re so beautiful. It&#8217;s such a waste that
                you&#8217;re unwilling to learn to warm my bed.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receiving the compliment regarding her beauty from Gu Changge, Jiang Luoshen
                couldn&#8217;t help but feel happy, but those words somehow felt strange. [I should bed him just because
                I&#8217;m pretty? What logic is that?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, it doesn&#8217;t matter how you try to manipulate me with
                compliments. I&#8217;ll never agree to it.&#8221; She let out a snicker.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really?&#8221; Gu Changge mindlessly smiled and his tone was ever so
                natural. &#8220;There&#8217;s no rush. Besides, I remember you saying similar words previously, but look
                at you, you&#8217;re a master massager now.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221; Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s face froze as she was flustered,
                after which she coldly replied, &#8220;How is that relevant to this?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge then chuckled, having no intention to tease her any
                longer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a flash, three days had passed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The influential members of major Clans across the Nine Domains of the Demon
                World came to attend the Banquet of Prodigies. After all, it was an event that only took place every two
                decades, so almost all powerful figures of the Demon World would be present.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the fact that Empress Yao Xi would personally present the royal
                wine to the victorious young prodigies was an honour like no other. Not only could they showcase their
                abilities in the banquet and make a name for themselves, if they were to gain Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s
                recognition, they would be admitted as honoured royal guards.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, it was rumoured that Gu Changge would also be attending the coming
                Banquet of Prodigies and presenting rewards to the victorious young prodigies.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon countless rumours, countless in the Demon World grew more attracted to
                attending the banquet. Though, many of them only desired to take a glimpse of Gu Changge&#8217;s true
                appearance, as they wanted to see what the current most known figure of the Upper Realm looked
                like.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The territory of Black and White Academy was more than 150,000 kilometres
                wide. Composed by towering mountain ranges filled with Divine Mountains, full of soaring Divine Birds
                and roaring Divine Beasts. It resembled the sceneries of heavenly paradise. Within, the grandest
                mountain range, containing the Sacred Mountain of Black and White Academy, which was said to harbour
                Fortuity Dragon Veins of a million square kilometres. This was also where shockingly blinding, vibrant
                Immortal Mists drifted.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, many figures appeared near the mountain range. Regardless of genders,
                ages, or cultivation level, many were swarming to the region to seize the best vantage point. Other than
                that, young prodigies of different forces were also gathered here. There weren&#8217;t just the
                disciples of Black and White Academy, but disciples raised by other forces as well.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As its name suggested, the Banquet of Prodigies was an opportunity for all
                young prodigies of the Demon World to thrive to glory, and anyone of the younger generation was eligible
                for participation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, on a route between the mountains, a man and a woman were in a
                hurry. The man wore a linen garment and carried a straw basket on his back, bearing the resemblance of
                an herb gatherer, while the woman beside him also donned a linen garment; her face was dry and
                yellowish, and somewhat hideous.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, her body was unparalleled, as every curve emitted charm like no
                other. It left the young men passing by subconsciously peeking at her, only to have grimaces on their
                faces as they hastily fled in disgust once they saw her face.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lian&#8217;er, do you think we can finally meet the person Master
                mentioned this time?&#8221; The basket-carrying man suddenly asked out of curiosity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the woman glanced at her and answered, &#8220;If we can&#8217;t
                find him here, then we&#8217;ll probably never find him in all corners of the Demon World. But for some
                reason, my intuition tells me that he must be there, doing something that would shock the
                world.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, after this, do we get to return to save Master once we hand the
                item over to that man?&#8221; The man&#8217;s eyes were filled with hope.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, the woman wordlessly shook her head.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those two were no other than Bai Lian&#8217;er and Bai Hua, who came from the
                Upper Realm to the Demon World to accomplish a mission given by Bai Kun. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hurried to the region of the Sacred Mountain before them and like
                others, they, too, looked for an advantageous vantage point.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, many young prodigies covered in formidable auras and brilliant
                lights had arrived at the foot of the Sacred Mountain, waiting eagerly for what was to come. Missions
                were attending the Banquet of Prodigies to witness the flamboyant event.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* All of a sudden, dazzling beams surged in the sky, grabbing the
                eyes of all guests as those beams gradually descended to the Sacred Mountain. Atop, there were four
                striking women, carrying quill, ink, and paper in their hands. Their footsteps were graceful, resembling
                that of the divine damsels of the Nine Heavens.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are the four subordinates of Empress Yao Xi!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They have come! Her Majesty must be arriving soon!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, many grew thrilled as they recognised the four women in the
                sky.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near the Sacred Mountain, more and more high-ranking officers appeared with
                their families and servants before getting to their seats in the guest area. Other than that, menacing
                knights were patrolling the region and they were on standby to attack anyone they deemed
                suspicious.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At such a moment, the safety of their Empress must be ensured. Although her
                cultivation level was high, she had yet to be truly peerless, so it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to be
                careful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, young prodigies of the Demon World, those with the highest cultivation
                level, showed up one by one, catching the attention and cheers from the crowd.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, a bewitching woman in a yellow dress also appeared at the
                foot of the Sacred Mountain, along with a breeze of elegant fragrance. She was gorgeous and seemed to
                have a heart of gold. She was none other than Song Youwei, the sole Heiress of the Grand Tutor. </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her appearance instantly caught the attention of the other young prodigies,
                as they turned to her at once, eyeing her with all sorts of emotions in their hearts, be it amazement,
                appreciation, admiration, or fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Grand Tutor, your daughter possesses such jaw-dropping gracefulness
                despite her age. One is sure to be envious of her.&#8221; The Quelling Chaos King chortled aloud as he
                was joking around with the Grand Tutor, though his tone still carried respect for the latter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grand Tutor then softly laughed, saying, &#8220;How humbling. Though,
                I&#8217;ve heard that your third son is not to be underestimated as well, leaving the world impressed in
                such a short amount of time. He hid for years, yet he stunned the world once he emerged. Youwei has
                mentioned him many times to me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the Quelling Chaos King obviously grew gleeful. He never
                expected his third son, whom others were less fond of, to be able to experience such a day. Be it hidden
                Talents or encountered opportunities, to the Quelling Chaos King, none of that mattered. All that
                mattered was he could feel proud of what his son had done. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, an idea arose in the Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s mind. Since
                Song Youwei didn&#8217;t have an arrangement of marriage, and she seemed to be good friends with his
                third sons, it would be beneficial to him if he could pair them up.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they were chatting, an individual arrived from afar. Sporting a blue
                garment, the individual was blessed with a handsome visage and a muscular body, and he was carrying
                confidence and serenity. The man was none other than Jun Fan himself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he observed his surroundings, he revealed a subtle grin, talking in his
                heart. [Yao Xi, the day has come! You better brace yourself!]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right at that moment, shrieks that thundered across the region came from the
                sky, followed by the appearance of a charging nine-headed Divine Beast that resembled a Qilin. As its
                hooves stomped the air, the contact let out a thunderous sound.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Divine Beast was dragging a black jade carriage behind it, as it
                exuberantly dashed through the skies. It was approaching with dense, stupefying intimidation.
                Simultaneously, a daunting cavalry on battle chariots and beasts were following behind the
                carriage.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Her Majesty is here!&#8221; An anonymous shout was heard, directing
                the attention of the others towards the sky as their eyes were filled with reverence.</span></p>

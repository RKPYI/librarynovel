          >The incident was related to the Wasteland Realm, which was the name
          given before Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains came into existence.
          Back then, the Immortal Gu Family owned a powerful subservient clan
          that was notorious in the entire Upper Realm—the Bone Clan. However,
          after committing an atrocious mistake, they were exiled to Wasteland
          Realm.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Bone Race had been trying to flee from the Wasteland Realm and
          return to the Upper Realm. Coincidentally, they encountered an
          opportunity during the previous wars between the Upper Realm and Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains. It was during this opportunity that the
          Immortal Gu Family came to an agreement with the Bone Clan, to forgive
          the latter&#8217;s sins and allowed them back to the Upper
          Realm.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With this, the Immortal Gu Family set the entire Bone Clan all over
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains as secret pawns, which could
          contribute in unimaginable ways at crucial moments.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At this point, the Bone Clan had taken over White Bone Great
          Domain—one of the Ten Great Domains. Although their number
          wasn&#8217;t big, the irresistible strength of their Ancestor allowed
          them to survive for a long time, and none dared to defy them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This time, Gu Changge intended to utilise these secret pawns and
          determine whether he could thoroughly eliminate whatever was left of
          the Family of Protectors. [The Bone Clan must be crafty, given how
          they almost obliterated the Family of Protectors twenty years ago.]

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After departing from Sky Deer City, Gu Changge headed to White Bone
          Domain. He brought along nobody else except Ah Da. Given his current
          strength, having too many followers with him wouldn&#8217;t be of any
          use.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for the Sky Deer Goddess, due to her identity, Gu Changge allowed
          her to remain in Sky Deer City. Thanks to her familiarity with the
          city, she could swiftly help him deal with the war prisoners.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Altogether, the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains included Ten Great
          Domains. Among the Ten, the vastest ones were Great Cloud Domain and
          Crimson Shack Domain, while the remaining were significantly smaller
          in size.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the other hand, the Eight Wastelands were isolated regions
          engulfed by miasma and Mists of Chaos. Filled with mountains and
          bodies of water, the Eight Wastelands harboured countless menacing
          beasts and was home to only a few clans.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for the Leaders of the Eight Great Wastelands, they were
          terrifyingly formidable beings whose cultivation level was
          immeasurable. After all, they had to dominate all living beings of the
          entire Eight Wastelands, including beasts that were close to Immortal.
          Those beasts might not be intellectual, but they managed to accumulate
          frightening cultivation power.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the current war against the Upper Realm, the Leaders of the Eight
          Great Wastelands refrained from participating in it. Nonetheless, a
          number of them visited Sky Deer City and witnessed the terror of the
          Upper Realm Army. And so, they, too, moved far away from Sky Deer City
          and returned to their respective bases.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          significantly less damage from the war.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the eyes of the forces from the Upper Realm, the Eight
          Wastelands&#8217; threat was inferior to that of the Ten Great
          Domains.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >From above the sky, one could perceive that Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains seemed like a complete continent that was separated into lands
          that were far apart from one another. Nevertheless, the size of each
          domain exceeded millions and might even reach billions of square
          kilometres.</span

          that moment, in one of the infinitely vast Eight Great Wastelands,
          where ancient trees towered through the sky while dense miasma wafted

          after a certain incident, Xiao Yao&#8217;s hostility towards Gu Wudi
          had notably diminished, especially after how Gu Wudi rescued him when

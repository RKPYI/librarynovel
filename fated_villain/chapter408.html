        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s words, Jun Fan nodded as he began to think of
                a way to persuade her. Nonetheless, at this moment, he suddenly detected a minor change in the terrain
                of the mountains around him.</span><span id="more-29804"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is this?&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er furrowed her brows as she also
                sensed the same disturbance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bufan, is that you?&#8221; A vague, hollow voice sounded and entered
                the ears of Jun Fan and Bai Lian&#8217;er.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;T—That&#8217;s Ruoxi&#8217;s voice!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that you, Ruoxi?&#8221; Hearing the voice, Jun Fan was dazed for a
                moment before appearing delighted as he asked. He was planning to look for Jun Ruoxi, but the pleasant
                surprise was that she found him first. He might have not heard the voice for over six thousand years,
                but it felt ever so familiar to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ruoxi, it&#8217;s me. Where are you right now?&#8221; Jun Fan&#8217;s
                voice contained uncontrollable happiness and excitement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Follow the voice, and you will find me.&#8221; The vague, hollow voice
                sounded again, also filled with joy and thrill.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jun Ruoxi…&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s eyes subtly changed. She
                then followed Jun Fei to track down the voice and followed it to its source.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, in the depths of the Life Forbidden Area, there was a short
                bluestone ancient well with steam of purple mists gushing deeper into the well. Inside of this well,
                there was a figure sitting in the air, which seemed to be cultivating and also sealed within at the same
                time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figure belonged to a woman, who was so still that she wasn&#8217;t
                showing any sign of life. Her skin was as fair as snow and her unkempt white hair concealed her face. If
                any cultivators were here, they would be stunned. The water flowing in the bluestone ancient well was of
                divine origins, creating vibrant mists and mysterious interlocking Principles with it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the surrounding aura was immensely chaotic and terrifying. Even
                a cultivator in the Sacred Realm would be instantaneously blown up into ashes upon laying foot into the
                well. But, there was a shockingly strong aura of life coming from the ancient well, which resembled the
                legendary Fountain of Life.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, the white-haired woman had her eyes shut, remaining very
                still, though she seemed as though she was about to open her eyes. Finally, a pair of frightening
                heavenly beams were dazzlingly shot out of her eyes, harbouring the devastating might of the
                gods.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bufan, you&#8217;re finally here. I&#8217;ve been waiting for you for
                six thousand years.&#8221; The gaze of the woman grew benign. She seemed to have a hard time moving as
                she remained seated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ruoxi, are you in the well?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, Jun Fan&#8217;s surprised voice was heard. He swiftly arrived at
                the place as he followed the voice, but all he found was an ancient well. Jun Ruoxi was nowhere to be
                seen. This made him stupefied.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing behind him, Bai Lian&#8217;er was holding a jade-like photographic
                stone underneath her sleeves, silently recording the surroundings and etching them into the stone. She
                noticed that the ancient well was quite unusual, as though it harboured endless lifeforce given even the
                vapour from it celestial energy, which even caused slight fluctuations in her cultivation level.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, she had been stuck in the Peak Sacred King Realm for
                many years without any signs of a breakthrough. Yet, she felt a wondrous sensation upon encountering
                this well, which left her very startled. [What&#8217;s hiding beneath this well? Is Jun Ruoxi really
                down there?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m here. But, Bufan, don&#8217;t get too close. You can&#8217;t
                do that given your current cultivation level,&#8221; Jun Ruoxi, who was deep inside the well, stated in
                response to Jun Fan&#8217;s question. Her eyes were gentle as usual. Though there was only emptiness in
                the air before her, her gaze seemed to have fallen upon Jun Fan&#8217;s face.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understood, Ruoxi.&#8221; Jun Fan nodded, though his heart remained
                tense as he could also feel the wondrous sensation rising from the ancient well. Quickly, as he
                remembered the important purpose he came here for, he was about to warn Jun Ruoxi to keep her guards
                up.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before he could speak a word, Jun Ruoxi shook her head and said,
                &#8220;I know what you wish to tell me. As long as I&#8217;m down here, no one will be able to find me.
                None shall find me unless I desire to see them myself. The contract I made with Yao Xi back then was
                merely to hold her off.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know you are confused, but it&#8217;s not the time for explanations
                yet. All you need to know is that you can only find father by opening the Gates of Death with a key, and
                only by then can you ask him for the truth. There is not much I can tell you.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jun Fan was absolutely dumbfounded. [Is there some kind of
                unknown secret behind the incident six thousand years ago? Is there a deeper story to Yao Xi&#8217;s
                assassination of me and my resurrection?]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What key are you talking about, and where are the Gates of Death you
                mentioned?&#8217; Extremely perplexed, Jun Fan was overwhelmed by thoughts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe Father has passed down the key to you. As for the Gates of
                Death, I, too, am clueless about where it is. Only the holder of the key may find the Gates of
                Death,&#8221; Jun Ruoxi slowly claimed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gates of Life, Gates of Death… Ruoxi, is the well you&#8217;re in
                perhaps the Gates of Life?&#8221; Jun Fan subconsciously asked as he suddenly recalled a phrase from his
                father, &#8216;In through the Gates of Death; out through the Gates of Life.&#8217;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, he even deliberately asked his father about the phrase&#8217;s
                meaning, but the latter merely laughed it off without giving an explanation. And now, these two matters
                seemed to share a significant correlation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, Jun Ruoxi nodded and replied, &#8220;You&#8217;re right. As
                of now, I&#8217;m in charge of guarding the Gates of Life, so until it opens, I won&#8217;t be able to
                take one step out of here. There&#8217;s not much time for me left. Hurry, look for father, he probably
                has something important to pass on to you.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Bai Lian&#8217;er listened to the conversation, the suspicion in her heart
                grew even deeper. She was aware of the rumours in Demon World regarding the existence of two gates, the
                Gates of Life and the Gates of Death. They were the set-up by Absolute Beings of the Demon Race in
                ancient times. They harboured countless arrays that were enigmatic. They also took the lives of
                countless careless wanderers. In fact, these two gates also carried the greatest secret of Demon
                World.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of nowhere, she grew curious given how Jun Ruoxi obviously knew
                something, and it seemed the disappearance of the Six Demon Overlords was more than meets the
                eye.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, her father&#8217;s life as a refugee for such a long time,
                her mother&#8217;s death. All of these were related to the Six Demon Overlords. All this time, her
                father so foolishly saw the Solar Demon Lord as someone akin to his own brother, guarded the brocade bag
                for over six thousand years, and at last, ordered her to send it to Jun Bufan. He did all that for
                someone who used him as a pawn.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It made the past six thousand years of hardship, living life in hiding, a
                cruel joke.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s face grew colder.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separated by the ancient well, Jun Fan and Jun Ruoxi began to reminisce and
                catch up about the recent years, while Bai Lian&#8217;er icily witnessed their exchange as she grasped
                the photographic stone in her eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a minute, Bai Lian&#8217;er was worried that Jun Ruoxi might notice
                something off about her, but fortunately, the jade talisman appeared to have worked its magic as it
                evidently prevented Jun Ruoxi from detecting her inconspicuous gestures.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s gaze was faint. Just a while ago, Jun Fan was even
                contemplating whether or not to rescue her father, as if he never considered it before. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To her, compared to Gu Changge and his apathy, Jun Fan was more
                insufferable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, Jun Fan and Jun Ruoxi parted ways as the former was headed to
                find the Quelling Chaos King.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he requested, Bai Lian&#8217;er hid herself in the void without showing
                herself. Simultaneously, she summoned out her Dharma Body to transfer the photographic stone to Gu
                Changge in order to fulfil Gu Changge&#8217;s order.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the clearing of the Life Forbidden Area came to its end. Despite
                having led a big army to scour the entire area, the Quelling Chaos King found no traces of Jun Ruoxi and
                Jun Bufan and could only give up on the search.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, he believes that Jun Ruoxi and Jun Bufan must have received
                news regarding his arrival before fleeing. Although he was disappointed, he wasn&#8217;t at all
                surprised, given that the two were no fools that would linger around and wait for their enemies to
                capture them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Jun Fan, instead of returning to the capital with the army, intended
                to locate the Gates of Death. According to Jun Ruoxi, his father left the key to the Gates of Death for
                him, and only with the key could he find where the Gates of Death was.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the location of the key, he had a good guess. In the meantime, he
                opened the brocade bag the Solar Demon Overlord left behind for him, only to find himself stunned by the
                message carried within it. After regaining his senses, he caught himself perturbed by his emotions and
                his heart overwhelmed by feelings, be it relief, anger, reluctance, or confusion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He let out a final, long sigh. [If the brocade bag carries the truth,
                everything so far has been a huge misunderstanding. Then, is there even a point in revenge?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Majesty, a few soldiers and I have been clearing the Life
                Forbidden Area for a week now, but the tracks of Jun Ruoxi and Jun Bufan remain to be unseen. I suspect
                that, instead of staying around, they&#8217;ve escaped a long time ago. Please forgive my tardiness,
                Your Majesty.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the dazzling, spectacular palace, the Quelling Chaos King, who returned
                from the Life Forbidden Area, was reporting his findings.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donning a phoenix dress, Empress Yao Xi was sitting on her throne, and upon
                the report, her expression became peculiar. It carried a hint of anger veiled in coldness as she
                remained wordless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the faces of the rest in the palace were awfully solemn as their
                foreheads were wetted by cold sweat. Not daring to make a sound, they could tell that Empress Yao Xi was
                not in a good mood. Even the Grand Tutor and the Military Commander kept quiet as they silently watched
                the scene before them unfold.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, the forehead of the Quelling Chaos King was sweating
                profusely. In his eyes, it was his incompetence that brought upon the Empress&#8217;s fury.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Men, take the Quelling Chaos King down and put him into prison.
                Capture all under his command, and kill anyone that dares disobey!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s stone cold voice suddenly sounded,
                possessing unrelenting ruthlessness and murderous intent.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, everyone in the palace was dumbfounded. As if they were struck
                by a giant, golden bell, their minds went blank amid violent rings. Widening their eyes in stupefaction,
                they revealed a dramatic expression of dismay, unable to believe that the Empress had voiced such a
                command.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, the Quelling Chaos King was the Empress&#8217;s most
                competent servant, as though he was the sharp blade that won her countless victories and eliminated all
                obstacles before her. In other words, the Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s contributions to Empress Yao
                Xi&#8217;s achievements today was unignorable.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, now, over such a trivial matter, she was punishing not only the
                Quelling Chaos King himself, but also all of his personnel. Such a punishment only occurred a few times
                over the past six thousand years, and it was for the most abysmal, treacherous sins committed by the
                remaining Five Demon Overlords. As such, the rest couldn&#8217;t help but think that Empress Yao Xi was
                trying to eliminate him due to his growing influence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Majesty, what is this…&#8221; The Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s
                face drastically changed, as he even began to doubt her ears, given that it was highly unreasonable of
                Empress Yao Xi to punish him so severely over such a trivial matter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;See for yourself.&#8221; In that instant, Empress Yao Xi, having
                composed herself, tossed a delicate photographic stone to the Quelling Chaos King.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filled with suspicion, the Quelling Chaos King picked it up and concentrated
                on it. With that, right when he saw the first footage of the stone, he came to his senses as his face
                instantly paled into a white visage.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thump!* His fingers were trembling. As he couldn&#8217;t hold the
                photographic stone steadily, he immediately dropped it to the floor.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-Impossible&#8230;&#8221; His voice shivered as he was unable to
                believe his eyes. Given his current cultivation level, he could discern whether the footage of the
                photographic stone was real.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the sight, everyone in the palace grew fearful. Although the footage
                merely flashed for a split second, they clearly saw what was shown, hence understanding what it
                indicated. After a moment of shock, they turned to the Quelling Chaos King with sympathetic and
                sentimental expressions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How can this be…&#8221; The Grand Tutor let out a sigh. [No one would
                have thought Jun Fan, the third son of the Quelling Chaos King, would hold such an identity. How
                terrifying!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you have to say for yourself?&#8221; Empress Yao Xi said with
                a stone cold face. &#8220;You truly disappoint me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a dispirited, disbelieving face, the Quelling Chaos King could only let
                out a bitter chuckle, sitting on the floor without a care in his mind. It didn&#8217;t matter whether
                the revelation was related to him. All the foundations he had spent millenia building were now brought
                to ruin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a single clue about this.&#8221; Even now, his mind
                was still in a blank state as he was overwhelmed by dismay. He never expected the true identity of his
                third son, Jun Fan, to be Jun Bufan, the heir of the Solar Demon Overlord six thousand years ago. The
                news thoroughly stunned him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the palace, the higher-ups were visibly troubled as they were too taken
                aback by the relevance of the matter. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No wonder, Jun Ruoxi would disappear in the Life Forbidden Area. Jun Bufan
                must have warned her beforehand.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was dumbfounded by Jun Fan&#8217;s perfectly hidden secret and how
                he managed to keep it unravelled for so many years. It appeared that it was also Jun Fan who
                orchestrated Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s assassination some time ago. Feeling chills up their spines, the
                crowd thought that they would still be blind to the truth if Empress Yao Xi did not reveal the
                evidence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, the Quelling Chaos King was dragged to prison. As someone in the
                Sacred EKing Realm, he could easily shake the constriction off if he wanted, but doing that would only
                imply that he was on Jun Bufan&#8217;s side, so he didn&#8217;t dare to move recklessly as he obediently
                cooperated with the guards.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What happened here today stays here. Violators will be executed by
                solicitation and treachery.&#8221; Empress Yao Xi swept the crowd with a stony glare before getting up
                and leaving the palace.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Farewell, Your Majesty.&#8221; The Grand Tutor and rest could only don
                bitter grins as they peered at each other, not daring to go against the Empress&#8217;s will. If such
                news were to spread to the outside world, a great turmoil would definitely erupt. Though, the
                confinement of the Quelling Chaos King and his entire personnel was no small event, and any vigilant one
                would certainly figure something was up.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in another palace, Gu Changge was leisurely drinking his tea,
                seemingly especially unbothered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, an ambiguous figure standing before him, bearing semblance no
                different to that of Bai Lian&#8217;er. It was her Dharma Body, who was currently answering Gu
                Changge&#8217;s questions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is all. I can&#8217;t convince you any further if you don&#8217;t
                believe me,&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s Dharma Body blandly stated. It was also her who brought
                back the photographic stone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Lady Lian&#8217;er. How can I not believe you?&#8221; Gu Changge
                laughed in response. &#8220;The Gates of Life, the Gates of Death, and their keys. It seems the biggest
                secret of Demon World is about to surface.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Were Jun Bufan a little smarter, he would have realised that you
                betrayed him, but I already told Yao Xi to forbid all higher-ups from spreading the word, so we can
                still contain it for a while. So, Jun Bufan won&#8217;t suspect you just yet,&#8221; Gu Changge then
                continued.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, should I thank you for your consideration?&#8221; Bai
                Lian&#8217;er scoffed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge shook his head and replied, &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be courteous,
                Lady Lian&#8217;er. No need for that between the two of us.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing the patience to entertain him, Bai Lian&#8217;er rolled her eyes on
                him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, footsteps could be heard coming from outside the palace. Empress
                Yao Xi was coming, and she swiftly identified Bai Lian&#8217;er, given that they were quite acquainted.
                In her eyes, Bai Lian&#8217;er was once nothing but Jun Bufan&#8217;s lapdog. She was nothing more than
                a fragile, pitiful busybody. None would have assumed that she was the emotionless woman now.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As you requested, I have imprisoned the Quelling Chaos King as well as
                his family.&#8221; Straight to the point, Empress Yao Xi withdrew her gaze after taking a glance at Bai
                Lian&#8217;er.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Bai Lian&#8217;er had no interest in even looking at her,
                treating her as an unknown stranger. If it weren&#8217;t for Gu Changge, she wouldn&#8217;t have come to
                the imperial palace.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm, alright.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded without giving any
                explanation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Empress Yao Xi was somewhat baffled, as tactful as she was, she knew
                not to question him. In her opinion, the Quelling Chaos King was undoubtedly oblivious to Jun
                Fan&#8217;s true identity. Since he was ignorant, he should be innocent as well. Knowing this, Yao Xi
                knew that she could not bring herself to really throw her anger at the Quelling Chaos King.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, it was the Quelling Chaos King who helped her secure the throne
                after a great deal of effort. She was also not an ungrateful and unfaithful woman. However, since Gu
                Changge asked for the confinement of the Quelling Chaos King and his family, she, naturally did as he
                asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did you get Bai Lian&#8217;er to cooperate with you?&#8221;
                Though, one thing confused Empress Yao Xi. From what she knew, Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s relationship
                with Jun Bufan was the same as that of a pair of siblings. Yet, Bai Lian&#8217;er was willing to sell
                Jun Bufan out and become Gu Changge&#8217;s spy, handing the photographic stone to her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s all thanks to Lady Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s wisdom
                and rationalism as well as her sense of justice,&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly answered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s all thanks to this scum threatening me with my
                father&#8217;s life.&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er sneered and interrupted Gu Changge before turning to
                Empress Yao Xi and coldly stated. &#8220;You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be so kind as to help
                you?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Empress Yao Xi revealed an expression that insinuated her
                knowledge regarding the real reason.</span></p>

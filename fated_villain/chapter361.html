          now, they were all in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands, and he had even
          refined them. [What would the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being

          said Gu Changge matter-of-factly with a smile after hearing her bleat.

          he would certainly become the enemy of the world, and by then, not
          even his family could save him.</span

          To her, whatever happened in her past life was irrelevant a long time
          ago, and it was more than enough for her to know that she meant
          something to him.</span

          flawless, and her eyes were clear like the autumn river in contrast to
          her red lips. Though stunning, people would think she was lofty with

          young men and women up after landing. He had to admit that every one
          of them was powerful and shrouded in all shades of heavenly light.
          Though it stressed him out, he was still confident, so he remained
          composed.</span

          Ji Chuyue snorted after glancing at Chen Ning&#8217;er, having no
          intention of greeting the latter. Clearly, the two had long known each
          other but weren&#8217;t on friendly terms.</span

          already been here for nearly a month and yet, we&#8217;ve found
          nothing. It&#8217;ll be great if we can get some information out of
          them. Besides, is this Jiang Chen really trustworthy? What can a mere
          mortal do? Chuyue happens to be staying at Heavenly Ruin Gate for now,

          seeing so. He had genuinely wanted to tell Ji Chuyue the man was Gu
          Changge, but that would lead her to suspect his affiliation with Gu
          Changge.</span

          spoke up while he was pondering. &lt;You can hint the Ji girl about
          your animosity with Gu. The Hidden Ji Family was one of the families
          the Mortal One had reincarnated into, after all. They&#8217;d at least
          have this bit of guts. Plus, you&#8217;re now the Successor of a

          no intentions of using the man for his own benefit. He just wanted to

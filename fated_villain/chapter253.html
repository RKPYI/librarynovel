      <h4>
        Chapter 253-1: The vengeful witch in red, The unresolvable hatred (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        After Ye Langtian and Ye Liuli finished talking about this, they bid
        farewell.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, their purpose was only to inform Gu Changge. The inheritor of
        the demonic art was of great importance, and even sharing it with Gu
        Changge made them very uneasy. DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels on
        n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge was strong, he didn't necessarily have a way to deal
        with the two inheritors of demonic art. Lately, this was an eventful
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Battlefield of Heavenly Extinction attracted countless cultivators
        with the fishes and dragons mixed amongst. There was not only the most
        suspected Prince Ying Shuang, but now there might even be another
        inheritor of demonic art mixed in.
      </p>
      <p>
        After entering the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, they not only had to
        beware of Heavenly Extinction beings but also had to worry about the
        hidden inheritors of demonic art. It was really bad luck.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Ye, be careful."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded slightly, and after seeing the two leave, he couldn't
        help but have a strange look in his eyes. In any case, he must find out
        who was the inheritor of the demonic art who suddenly appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although he had some guesses in his heart, he could not confirm it,
        until he saw them with his eyes. Then, he thought about it and wrote a
        letter, explaining some things to Yan Ji, and asking her to check it
        first.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Although the entrance to the Battlefield of Heavenly Extinction is
        still uncertain, the place where Absolute Heavenly Extinction is located
        can be narrowed down. By the way, I need to find a pathfinder tool."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge then couldn't help but fall into thought.</p>
      <p>
        He was bound to conquer the Absolutely Heavenly Extinction, even if that
        meant exposing his demonic art in the future. As long as he occupied the
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction, he could still make the entire Upper Realm
        fear him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that there was no risk of his demonic art being exposed
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occupying the Absolute Heavenly Extinction was only just in case, and it
        could become his extremely strong trump card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge thought of one person. Wang Ziji, his fellow
        transmigrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Wang Wushuang's words, Wang Ziji had actually come to
        Southern Heaven. But for some reason, she left. But Gu Changge had a way
        to make her appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Daughter of Luck with an Immortal body, Wang Ziji's own Luck points
        were amazing enough. With such Luck points, Wang Ziji's own Luck was
        definitely not bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from her cultivation base far exceeding that of her peers, she
        definitely had a lot of opportunities. So now Gu Changge was thinking
        about how to make Wang Ziji his pathfinder tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a transmigrator, Wang Ziji was a ghost, but she also brought with her
        the salted fish and melon-eating character of her previous life. When
        she had nothing to do, she liked to spit out a few words and liked to
        join in the fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had a deep understanding of this point with his previous
        contact with her. Others don't know what Wang Ziji was talking about,
        but he listened very clearly and knew what her character was like.
      </p>
      <p>
        So it wasn‚Äôt difficult to plot against her, not to mention that Wang
        Ziji seemed to be very interested in him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ye Han, deliver a message to Wang Wushuang. Tell him to inform me of
        his sister's whereabouts."
      </p>
      <p>Afterward, Gu Changge summoned Ye Han and ordered.</p>
      <p>"Yes, Master." Ye Han accepted and left.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Not long after, Gu Changge also heard the prompt from the system. The
        Luck of Ying Shuang was damaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was within his expectation. Although this Luck point was not a lot,
        Gu Changge didn't like it at all, but it was enough to show that Ying
        Shuang's Luck points were declining.
      </p>
      <p>Everything was going according to his plan.</p>
      <p>
        "System, is the picture you saw in Tao Village a few days ago a
        harbinger of the next Son of Luck?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Gu Changge remembered something important and asked the
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the picture he saw at the beginning, a woman with blue silk was
        holding her knees, looking very lonely, waiting for something under the
        dead Peach Tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt that the picture was related to Taoyao. But since he was
        allowed to see it, it meant that nine out of ten times, it had something
        to do with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet Gu Changge wasn't sure about this. Because even he didn't know what
        would pop up in his memory one day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like the Immortal Devouring Demonic Art, one day, it suddenly
        appeared in his mind. Who could say clearly about the past life?
      </p>
      <p>Who was not a vest maniac?</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's question, the system couldn't help but reply, "This
        matter is beyond the scope of the system's deduction, for the time
        being. Asking the host to change the question."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't expect it to answer so bluntly. But the answer was
        really indescribable.
      </p>
      <p>
        What did it mean to be out of the scope of the deduction for the time
        being, it meant that the deduction could only be done later, right?
      </p>
      <p>This dog system was still unreliable at critical times.</p>
      <p>
        "Then what happened to the memory that emerged when I took Yaoyao as a
        disciple in the Heavenly Star Realm? That should be the next Daughter of
        Luck, right?" Gu Changge asked again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time he encountered this kind of thing, he had to notice the Child
        of Luck first, and only then would the system give him a hint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or the system‚Äôs quest could only be triggered when he was very close to
        the Child of Luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge might as well try it out directly. The feeling of being
        familiar and unfamiliar at that time was really fresh in his memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at this moment, when it heard Gu Changge's question, the system
        directly prompted,
      </p>
      <p>"Ding, you triggered the red-clothed witch, the Daughter of Luck."</p>
      <p>
        "She turned out to have died from time, and her body sank into the
        endless abyss."
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, even in the most terrifying hell, her hatred for you cannot be
        erased."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Her consciousness has returned from the darkness, and she can wash the
        whole world with hatred at any time, just to have her revenge."
      </p>
      <p>"‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing the system prompt sound, Gu Changge couldn't help but raise his
        eyebrows.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        What kind of Child of Luck was this? How was it different from the
        routine he was familiar with? Just how much did she hate him in order to
        return from the boundless darkness, just for revenge?
      </p>
      <p>Could it be because of love and hate?</p>
      <p>
        For one month, Yue Mingkong took revenge on him and Gu Changge felt that
        it was enough. Now there was another red-clothed witch who wanted to
        seek revenge on him?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, every Child of Luck represented God's deep malice towards
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "System, what about the reminder this time?" Then, Gu Changge asked
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the newly-appeared Child of Luck always represented a new
        reminder.
      </p>
      <p>To him, it was nothing but leeks waiting to be harvested.</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>And the next moment, as Gu Changge spoke.</p>
      <p>
        A burst of brilliance flashed in front of his eyes, followed by some
        images, but it was more like a profound memory revived in his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the foot of the mountain, the little girl who liked to wear red
        tugged at her sleeves, timidly. She knelt in front of a group of bandits
        who looked terrified and desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
        "These are your enemies, your relatives were killed by them, and your
        village was set on fire by them‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now I've caught them all, you can do whatever you want with them‚Ä¶ Kill
        them or let them go, it's up to you‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>He touched her head and said softly.</p>
      <p>So, the little girl cut off their heads with one sword.</p>
      <p>"Master, when I grow up, I want to marry you‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Then he smiled to himself, "I'll talk about it when you grow up."</p>
      <p>
        Twenty years later, the grown-up girl came to him with a face full of
        pain, "Master, you actually arranged the bandits back then, right?"
      </p>
      <p>His expression didn't change at all, "Yeah, you knew all this?"</p>
      <p>
        The girl was stabbed with a sword but did not fall. She burst into
        tears, "I can't let go, Master, can you tell me the reason‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>His expression still didn't change, "No."</p>
      <p>
        And the picture ended here. Gu Changge was silent for a while, and there
        was only one bloody thing he had to say about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why was it such a bitter drama again? Now he didn't even know who the
        witch in red was.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing he knew was that he was her master, and then she hated
        himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For no reason, there was another apprentice who wanted to avenge
        himself. In terms of strength, it was definitely not comparable to the
        reincarnation of Ye Ling, Long Teng, and Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, combined with the memory of the time when he was in the Lower
        Realm, a figure in red was knocked down into the abyss by him while
        holding the demonic halberd.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge almost guessed something.</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 253-2: The vengeful witch in red, The unresolvable hatred (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Judging from many clues, he might also have the title of a Demon Lord.
        So maybe that figure in red was related to his title at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that it was one step ahead. He was not worried about debt.
        It was not like there existed too many leeks, so he was not in any
        hurry.
      </p>
      <p>
        "According to the current clues, I shouldn't be able to meet the
        red-clothed witch‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge thought of this and put this matter aside for the time being.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>At the same time, in a magnificent and tall palace, runes flashed.</p>
      <p>A young man in gorgeous robes was cultivating. It was Ying Shuang.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, and
        wisps of heaven and earth aura were gathering here along with his
        breathing.
      </p>
      <p>
        A faint shadow of the Immortal path, incomparably majestic, like it was
        standing proudly above nine heavens, revealing an unparalleled vast
        divine might.
      </p>
      <p>He looked extremely miraculous.</p>
      <p>
        "I have already figured out almost all the powers that Ying Shuang knew
        before. Even if others have doubts, they will not be able to find out
        that I am a fake."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang breathed a sigh of relief in his heart, said softly as he
        finally felt relieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he opened his eyes, his eyes were extremely calm and peaceful, and
        there was a sense of dignity that was indescribable.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, he had been very handy in pretending to be
        Prince Ying, and even his demeanor and tone had gradually become
        indistinguishable from the previous Ying Shuang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, what he said to his sister Ying Yu was that he had recovered
        some of his memories, and he had almost solved the shortcomings of his
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this statement, Ying Yu herself did not have much doubt. As for the
        rest of the people within the Heavenly Emperor Mountain who noticed that
        something was wrong with Ying Shuang, they were almost none.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, during this period of time, Ying Shuang stayed in the
        Emperor's Palace honestly and did not dare to go out at will. FiNd
        ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>
        For an outside cultivator who thought that he was the inheritor of
        demonic art, Ying Shuang was used to it. Anyway, this suspicion was not
        clear at present.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also didn't believe that after reaching Southern Heaven, there were
        still people who dared to do anything to him. After all, no one had seen
        him use any forbidden art to kill people.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was all guesswork. Before this, as long as there was no sufficient
        evidence to prove that he was the inheritor of demonic art, he would
        have nothing to do.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        And Ying Shuang was clear. In Southern Heaven, whether it was a
        cultivator or any other creature, they were actually here for the quota
        in the True Immortal Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were all focused on finding the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield,
        and they would not pay attention to him at all and waste time on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to him, there were many ancient freaks here, and this was
        what he needed to pay attention to.
      </p>
      <p>
        "And there is also Gu Changge. I don't know if he discovered the
        abnormality of the servant‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of Gu Changge, Ying Shuang's face darkened and he was very
        jealous.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was still not very clear, whether the servant who was possessed by
        Prince Ying, the former him, fell into Gu Changge‚Äôs hands or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it was, then Gu Changge probably already knew about him. This made
        Ying Shuang very uneasy. If it was someone else, then it was okay, but
        that person was Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opponent's power was far above him. With his current means, how
        could he deal with him?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ying Yu has been out for so long, saying that she was looking for news,
        but why hasn't she come back yet, is there an accident?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Ying Shuang suddenly thought of Ying Yu, and was a
        little worried.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time. He was still very satisfied with this
        younger sister. Although Ying Yu's character was somewhat
        straightforward and even liked to doubt him, it did not affect his love
        for Ying Yu.
      </p>
      <p>
        He now completely regarded Ying Yu as his sister. Before, he was just a
        horse feeder with no relatives and no reason. Except for Miss Yin Mei,
        who would treat him well, while everyone looked down on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now there was such a family member. So he naturally cherished Ying
        Yu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, he got up and walked out of the hall, intending to ask Ying Yu's
        whereabouts. However, as soon as Ying Shuang went out, he met Agu and
        the others returning from outside the mansion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu, who was completely drunk, was being supported by two maids and
        brought back.
      </p>
      <p>"Greetings, young master."</p>
      <p>
        Seeing Ying Shuang standing here with a blank expression. Everyone's
        expressions couldn't help changing, and they hurriedly greeted him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Ying Shuang usually lived in the shallows, his power was still
        terrifying in the hearts of every one of the Heavenly Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>"What's the matter? How did Xiaoyu get drunk like this?"</p>
      <p>
        Looking at Ying Yu, Ying Shuang asked with a frown. He could smell a
        strong odor of alcohol even from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu, who never drank alcohol, how could she get drunk for the first
        time today? And become so drunk.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Reporting to Young Master, this is what happened. Miss Yu happened to
        meet Young Master Changge in a pavilion not long after she went out, and
        something happened at that time. Young Master Changge invited her, but
        it was not easy for her to refuse. ‚Ä¶"

      <p>"So‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        A maid immediately explained with a slight change in expression, and
        explained the ins and outs of the matter, for fear of being blamed by
        Ying Shuang.
      </p>
      <p>"What happened‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        After hearing this, Ying Shuang's expression changed, and there was a
        sense of shock and fear in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then it quickly went dark. He never imagined that Ying Yu had only been
        out for a short time before she met Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        And she was left behind by Gu Changge to be forced to accompany the
        banquet.
      </p>
      <p>
        No wonder Ying Yu, who usually didn't drink alcohol, was so drunk today.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶ You are simply deceiving too much!"</p>
      <p>
        For a moment, Ying Shuang's expression was extremely ugly and gloomy,
        his fists clenched tightly, and he was very angry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest were even more silent. It was just that Agu, who was an ancient
        freak who lived in the same period as Ying Shuang, was not as afraid of
        Ying Shuang as others.
      </p>
      <p>
        He took the initiative to speak, his expression changed slightly and
        said, "Young Master, the situation was very special at that time, and
        the young lady's words and actions accidentally caused public anger, but
        thanks to the young master Changge who cleared the situation and
        dispersed everyone, it would be difficult for us to come back safely. ."
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, he glanced at Ying Shuang's increasingly ugly face and
        shook his head in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't know what happened to Ying Shuang during this time, and he
        lost the sharp-edged confidence and arrogance he used to have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a thing would make him angry. The current Ying Shuang has become
        just as rumored by the outside world, like a mouse crossing the street,
        extremely embarrassed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Prince, his patience was gone. He didn't even dare to go out and
        confront Gu Changge, and he only dared to curse in secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        "They believed what Gu Changge said, if it wasn't for his actions, why
        would Xiaoyu attract public anger‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Hearing Agu defending Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang's face turned even more ugly, and he couldn't help shouting,
        "You guys are stupid. Will Gu Changge feel at ease? Xiaoyu is not
        sensible, so are you also stupid when you are with her?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing Ying Shuang getting angry, everyone was even more silent, even
        Agu smiled bitterly and chose to shut up.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he was just a follower, and his words could not affect Ying
        Shuang's judgment of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Forget it, forget about today's affairs, I don't want to see you next
        time."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang waved his hand, and knew that it was useless to blame them.
        He was so angry just now because he was worried about what Gu Changge
        had said to Ying Yu.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at this moment, even Ying Shuang didn't know it, and before he knew
        it, the attitude of his followers towards him had changed a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agu's expression changed several times, and finally he seemed to have
        made up his mind.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were located in the eastmost part of the
                Upper Realm, comprising isolated terrains filled with deserts and mountains. As it neighboured many
                worlds, it became a vital common border between those lands in the Lower Realm. Although it wasn&#8217;t
                as prosperous as the Inner Domain, it contained the cohabitation of good and bad individuals and many
                ancient beings lived in hiding there.</span><span id="more-30001"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, outside the Boundary Marker Sea, there were innumerable fragments
                of an ancient world. Collateral damage caused by the great war between the Upper Realm and Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains a long time ago. And now, the Boundary Marker Sea became a hiding place for
                terrifying beings, creating menacing waves that render ordinary cultivators afraid to enter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Forces of the Upper Realm have dispatched their armies, intending to
                travel across Boundary Marker Sea, and their leaders are even from the various Immortal Sects and
                Immortal Families. There are even True Daoists volunteering to take the lead, desiring to pave the
                way.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, Gu Lintian was sitting on the throne. As he opened his eyes,
                there were rays of heavenly beams in forms of alarming scenery. As the head of the Immortal Gu Family,
                he carried remarkably more knowledge and wisdom than the other members. Therefore, he was well aware
                that the drying of Boundary Marker Sea was an impeccable opportunity for the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So will the Gu Family be sending men over as well?&#8221; After a
                moment of pondering, Gu Changge asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be frank, he wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in Eight Wastelands and
                Ten Domains, but as he was returning to the Upper Realm, he saw ancient battleships of various forces
                soaring through the sky through Space Tunnels, which left him wondering. Regardless, since his focus was
                now on the Demon-Burying Abyss, he figured he could put everything else on pause.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Gu Family has yet to make a move at the moment. Though, I plan to
                have your second uncle lead the young ones of the family there. Judging by your strength, I suppose
                competition between the younger generation doesn&#8217;t excite you anymore. Still, the chaos in Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains will greatly affect the growth of all forces in the Upper Realm. Since both
                parties have amassed their hatred against each other for countless years, there is no way Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains can secure their vast territory. To all forces in the Upper Realm, they are
                just the biggest, most scrumptious chunk of meat,&#8221; Gu Lintian slowly explained.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he had yet to intervene in the matter, his abstinence was not
                guaranteed, since he was now merely watching. In other words, he was just waiting and looking for an
                opportunity. Furthermore, it had been so many years. So, the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains&#8217;
                current state was currently unknown. Thus, he would need the rest of the forces to investigate before
                coming to a decision.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, by doing that, there would be a risk of loss, as the forces
                that invaded Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains ahead would seize most of the prizes. Nevertheless, Gu
                Lintian valued stability, so he didn&#8217;t see the need for unnecessary sacrifices.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Indeed, it is an opportunity for the Upper Realm.&#8221; Gu Changge
                nodded. Since his father put it that way, he figured he didn&#8217;t need to worry about it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the opportunity arise, the Gu Family would unquestionably send their
                men over, and in the meantime, he could tend to his own matters.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, the war between Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and the Upper
                Realm would definitely be the fiercest one of the epoch yet.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, after talking with Gu Lintian about something else, Gu Changge
                got up and left.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that the Immortal Path still had not appeared, the drying of Boundary
                Marker Sea was an indication, in the eyes of the forces of the Upper Realm, that only by merging both
                realms could the World Principles be whole. It might lead to the awaited appearance of the Immortal
                Path, which had disappeared for a long time. By then, true ascension to Immortality would be able to
                occur, marking a new era. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning to his residential Divine Island, Gu Changge instructed his
                servants to deliver the Indestructible Robe to Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty before planning for his next
                moves.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Gu Lintian, he was now aware of the positions of other forces as
                well as how complicated the situation was due to the fact that Boundary Marker Sea was surrounded by
                neighbouring Lower Realm Worlds.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From time to time, there would be frighteningly thunderous, raging waves.
                Although it was a hazardous region, the opportunities it offered were substantial. For instance, once,
                the legacy of an ancient emperor and the tome of an Immortal were found. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, to Gu Changge, the coming war was a fine opportunity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Perhaps I can enhance the Grand Flask as well. But before that,
                I&#8217;ll have to have Yin Mei manage the Tang Family. With her handling the Alliance of Thousand
                Merchants, I will be more at ease.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some time of contemplating, Gu Changge grabbed his quill and started
                writing, jotting down certain matters Yin Mei should be wary of.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the entire Tang Family was under his grasp with Entanglement
                Immortal Might, he retained control over their life and death. This was regardless of distance.
                Therefore, he wasn&#8217;t exactly concerned about the occurrence of unwanted accidents.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, after pondering for a while, Gu Changge decided to have his
                servant deliver the Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact of the Blood Demon Overlord as well.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Yin Mei was extraordinarily talented, she didn&#8217;t cultivate her
                abilities intensively, given that she had been assisting him in the dark in order to alleviate his
                burden, so her cultivation level was indeed inferior to that of her peers. Thus, to compensate for that,
                a Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact would be more than sufficient.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After settling some arrangements, Gu Changge began to think about Jiang Chen,
                Chu Hao, and Qin Wuya.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Jiang Chen was accompanied by Gu Changge&#8217;s Demonic Puppet,
                whereas Qin Wuya was under Tang Wan&#8217;s surveillance, Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t worried about
                them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Chu Hao, he should be hiding in Supreme Cave Heaven, preparing to
                break through to the Sacred Emperor Realm. Back in Vermilion Bird Empire, he was already at Peak Sacred
                King Realm, and given his diligence, he should be attaining Sacred Emperor Realm some time soon. [If my
                prediction is correct, Chu Hao and his men will most likely participate in the attack on Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, the Supreme Cave Heaven was looking to grow Chu Hao&#8217;s
                influence, so the attack would probably help him make a name. As the future Sect Master of Supreme Cave
                Heaven, Chu Hao was almost at Sacred Emperor Realm despite being merely a few hundred years old. Such
                news would certainly cause an unimaginable commotion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I suppose now is the time to harvest all my leeks in one fell swoop.]</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge used his Communication Rune to ask Yan Ji about Xiao
                Ruoyin&#8217;s recent situation. At the same time, he had another Quasi-Nirvana Grade Artifact of that
                other Demon Overlord delivered over by another servant without being biassed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the artifacts of the Six Demon Overlords of Demon World, except that
                of the Demon Overlord who was slaughtered by the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord thousands of years ago,
                were basically now in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lunar Demon Overlord&#8217;s Lunar Wheel was left behind for Empress Yao
                Xi, and should have been her ultimate trump card. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had still yet to discover the tracks of the Crimson Cloud Demon
                Overlord&#8217;s Cloud Lance though. Back when the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord entered Mirror World, he
                bequeathed the lance to someone else.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Gu Changge had his men search for it, only to find out that the
                descendant of the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord fled from Demon World six thousand years ago and
                completely vanished since then. Thus, Gu Changge decided to put a stop to the search.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Gu Changge was done with giving instructions, he decided to take the
                time to visit Lin Qiuhan in Violet Supreme Alchemy Sect. Unlike in the past, Lin Qiuhan was now the Vice
                Sect Master of Violet Supreme Alchemy Sect, whose Alchemy Talents were terrifyingly superior to that of
                many Elders of the Sect.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when Gu Changge arrived, she was in the middle of studying an
                ancient alchemy formula. Therefore, he simply left some items behind and left without waiting for
                her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was done with those trivial tasks, Gu Qingyi returned home from
                Demon-Burying Abyss at the same time. As Gu Changge instructed, she took a look at the seal within the
                abyss.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The beings sealed within will be breaking out in at most half a
                year.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was her answer to Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Half a year, huh?&#8221; There wasn&#8217;t visible change on Gu
                Changge&#8217;s face. In other words, he would have half a year of time to prepare himself, which was
                honestly more than enough.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days later, horns were sounded across the Divine Islands and Mystic
                Mountains of the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s territory. Celestial Mists floated about as daunting figures
                with repressing aura rose to the sky, gathering all members of the family.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the vast, boundless territory, forces affiliated with the Immortal Gu
                Family received an order as well. Spiritual mists arose amid giant cities as formidable cultivators and
                their underlings rushed as divine rainbows or inside ancient battleships.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in the bronze palace, which signified absolute power in the
                Immortal Gu Family, heavenly light surged, seemingly ancient and dense. Simultaneously, extremely
                powerful individuals, whose faces were veiled in horrifying auras and figures were covered in Chaos Qi,
                appeared. Their gazes were as piercing as a divine blade, and they seemed more serious than during the
                battle against Purple Mansion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Gu Family shall dispatch an army of ten million in the battle
                against Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.&#8221; Gu Lintian sat on a throne, and his aura was as deep as
                an abyss.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the divine brush in his hand, he wrote a Divine Commandment. Each word
                was shimmering exuberantly like stars, emitting a dreadful energy. Upon completing it, he sent the
                commandment away as the Elders of the family solemnly watched.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an instant, an ancient aura gushed out of the territory. At once, shocking
                disturbances filled the sky as the shockwaves travelled millions of kilometres, quaking numberless
                territories.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the territory of the Gu Family, countless reverently knelt down as they
                bowed and continuously kowtowed towards the Absolute Commandment, all while their souls shivered.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time since the Immortal Gu Family last drew an
                Absolute Commandment. They did not even do it when going again Purple Mansion!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is it perhaps related to the war with Eight Wastelands and Ten
                Domains?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They must be gathering formidable cultivators!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the mountains and valleys, formidable cultivators walked out of ancient
                palaces with stern, trembling voices as their hearts were filled with fear and respect. What they were
                seeing was the Absolute Commandment of the Immortal Gu Family â€” the most ancient commandment in all of
                the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was once an Absolute Commandment, which was said to have travelled
                across many epochs and appeared. It harboured peerless godly might. Within was the overbearing power of
                the Immortal Gu Family, which even True Daoists would be scared to face directly. They could only watch
                as the Absolute Commandment traverses across the five Domains to reveal itself to the world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, the same Absolute Commandment was appearing once again, along with
                the symbol of the Immortal Gu Family imprinted on it. It was to gather all formidable cultivators in the
                territory as the Immortal Gu Family intended to send off an army of ten million to the battle against
                Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* Between Divine Islands, radiant doors began to open as Celestial
                Mists gushed out of them. Ancient soldiers, surrounded by the forces of teleportation rushed out of
                those radiant doors, as though they were from a battlefield filled with seas of blood and mountains of
                corpses. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the domineering, prominent Immortal Guards, each having
                overwhelming auras, who participated in the Immortal War against Purple Mansion, were gathered once
                again.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* As the Absolute Commandment travelled across regions, a massive
                number of ancient battleships and flying boats were amassed within various giant cities.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instinctively, innumerable beasts stampeded and birds soared to the skies,
                covering the sun as heavenly beams were shot through the clouds, seemingly incomparably grand.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, deathsworn soldiers of immeasurable numbers charged forward
                in dense packs. They were all ready-to-die warriors trained by forces affiliated with the Immortal Gu
                Family.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Wu! Wu! Wu!* </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the air, amid the wailing of storms and horns, as gargantuan purple bronze
                ancient battleships speedily flew across the sky, approaching the territory of the Immortal Gu Family.
                On those battleships, there were countless cultivators, whose murderous intent and aura rose to the
                skies. They were people from the Primal Celestial Temple! </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They came from a distant place on ancient battleships, which resembled the
                clouds covering the entire sky.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, thousands of giant ships and millions were readily awaiting
                orders as endless shadows veiled the skies. It was certainly a fathomless, astounding sight.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is the Absolute Commandment of the Immortal Gu Family, exacting
                obedience from the whole world! One day, we, too, must send our Absolute Commandment to the entire
                world. For the glory of the Gu Family!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a platform atop the most spectacular Mystic Mountain of the Immortal Gu
                Family&#8217;s territory, there were numerous young prodigies present. These prided young elites of the
                Immortal Gu Family were all standing at attention. They were shrouded in blinding lights and vibrant
                mists, appearing dominant and powerful. At this moment, they were witnessing everything played out, all
                enthusiastic about fighting against the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains are nothing but a hiding place for
                losers! How will they ever withstand the steel might of the Immortal Gu Family!?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Once we&#8217;re there, we&#8217;ll wreak havoc upon Eight Wastelands
                and Ten Domains!&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrying innate boastfulness on their faces, the young prodigies were direct
                disciples of the Gu Family, hence their identities were high. They were completely confident. After all,
                each of them possessed great Talents and abilities, and their strengths were inferior to none.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they were speaking, they would subconsciously turn to the young man on the
                peak of the Mystic Mountain with faces filled with deep respect and reverence. This was regardless of
                their genders.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Direct Disciples of the Immortal Gu Family, they also possessed
                precious bloodlines, which were considered as the most ancient bloodline in the Upper Realm. As pompous
                as they were, with not even the successors of other forces being able to automatically gain their
                respect, it was only under this Young Master that they would reveal their willing subservience.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is said that Young Master Changge will not be joining us as he has
                other matters to tend to. Perhaps he&#8217;s only here to see us off,&#8221; one of the young talents
                whispered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even the Elders can no longer perceive Young Master Changge&#8217;s
                true strength. That must mean they&#8217;re no longer able to beat him.&#8221; Another nodded.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge is only in his twenties and he&#8217;s already
                drawn such praises from the Elders in the Sacred Emperor Realm. Incredible!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the current generation of Upper Realm- No, in all generations of
                the Upper Realm, is there anyone who rivals his strength?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        </p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their hearts were filled with reverence and enthusiasm as they looked at the
                young man on the peak of the Mystic Mountain, whose back was facing the rest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, upon the glaring sounds of horns, all of the young
                cultivators immediately turned into divine rainbows and headed towards the ancient battleships, along
                with their servants and followers, intending to tear up space in order to travel to Boundary Marker
                Sea.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wonder if there&#8217;ll be anything amiss that happens during the war.
                Even though Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains have been on the losing side, variants tend to show up at
                such moments. The Upper Realm may seem guaranteed to win, but dangers often lurk in the unknown.]
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the horns, Gu Changge snapped out of his thoughts before turning over
                with an expressionless face. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching as the cultivators departed through Space Tunnels, he swiftly
                vanished from the mountaintop. To be fair, there was no need for him to send off these young prodigies,
                other than instilling motivations within them. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Gu Changge was reputable across all worlds, his name no longer
                signified merely his own identity. To the younger generation, his name was an incomparable honour. In
                their eyes, across all worlds and times, he was one and only, and no other could ever reach such a
                level.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, what took place within the territory of the Immortal Gu Family
                instantly left the world shocked as the war against Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains quickly attracted
                all eyes. In fact, many forces already sent their men over early on. Upon the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s
                aggressive approach, every corner of the Upper Realm was dumbfounded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other forces were basically in an alliance in order to take down Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains as one, but Boundary Marker Sea wasn&#8217;t exactly cooperating with them.
                Although there were signs of drying, it still retained irresistible might.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extremely formidable True Daoists who took the lead attempted to repel
                the power in order to pave the way for the army, got crushed by the waves of Boundary Marker Sea. Since
                that person was grievously injured, the armyâ€™s progress was halted.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formidable cultivators of high cultivation level found a hard time trying to
                cross the Boundary Marker Sea. Yet, the younger generation was rather at ease while doing so as the
                suppression they experienced was relatively minor, especially the young prodigies who possessed
                extraordinary Talents and ferocious strength, though still not on par with that of the older
                generations. Hence, the young cultivators became the first batch of leading attackers to invade Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand of the intense war, Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were
                giving everything they had in defence as various forces dispatched formidable cultivators to fend off
                the invaders from the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â€¦</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t leave the Immortal Gu Family Residence,
                hence he grew somewhat bored as he was raising the World Tree seedling while planning the reshaping of
                his Inner World at the same time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, the keepsake left behind by the Eternal Overcast Kingdom
                suddenly lit up. Apparently, an accident occurred in Eternal Overcast Kingdom, so his agreement with the
                Princess of Eternal Overcast Kingdom, Jia Lan, would have to be postponed for a little longer. It took
                him by surprise. but he wasn&#8217;t particularly bothered by it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that he had reached the Peak Sacred Emperor Realm, he was just one step
                away from reaching the Quasi-Nirvana Realm. Sadly, unless in substantial amounts, Eternal Overcast
                Sources wouldn&#8217;t be of significant use. They would at most only be a cherry on top.</span></p>

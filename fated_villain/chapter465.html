          >The Youngest Junior Brother whom Chen Suyun and Gu Wudi were talking
          about was called Xiao Yang. He had been found more than 20 years ago
          below the waterfall of the Nine Great Mountains by Chen Suyun, who
          took him back with her. </span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang, still a tiny baby at that time and had been placed in a
          basket. He looked close to death while covered in blood. There was an
          old piece of jade with him containing two words, and it had been those
          words which told her of his name. After that, Xiao Yang had been
          pitied by her Master, the Second Mountain Elder. Thus, he got accepted
          as his disciple since he felt the boy was now alone. That was how Xiao
          Yang had become the most junior disciple in the Nine Great Mountains
          and thus called Youngest Junior Brother by everyone else.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the reason Xiao Yang had been abandoned below the Mountains
          was a mystery. His identity was still unknown now, and many felt he
          had been burdened by some sort of grievous hatred.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, no one really cared about that, as they felt there had
          to be some sort of fated connection between him and the Nine Great
          Mountains which brought him here. Besides, he had a delightful
          attitude, worked hard, and was gifted in cultivating, which made him
          really likeable. Everyone acquainted with him was friendly with him.
          Chen Suyun was both a sister and mother to Xiao Yang, since she had
          raised him on her own and taught him a lot about the world and
          cultivation techniques.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Chosen One, you want to ask him about the Celestial Seal of
          the Nine Mountains, right? There&#8217;s no use asking him; you have
          to see Master instead. He&#8217;s only been here for around twenty
          years, so how would he know about it?&#8221; Chen Suyun frowned after
          seeing Gu Wudi&#8217;s expression. It was no secret here that he
          coveted the Celestial Seal, but her Master had already said clearly
          that he wasn&#8217;t suited to guard it. Instead, it had been Junior
          Brother Xiao Yang who was deemed most suitable all those years.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She did not doubt her Master&#8217;s words, naturally, but Gu Wudi
          was arrogant and proud. How could he accept that the Celestial Seal
          was in the possession of someone inferior to him? That Celestial Seal
          was the most precious treasure of the Nine Great Mountains, having
          collected the Mountain&#8217;s Power of Faith, Fortuity, and destiny
          all this time. It was mysterious and unfathomable.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ever since the Supreme Mountain Elder had started cultivating in
          isolation and had not appeared, the Celestial Seal had fallen under
          the guardianship of the Second Mountain Elder. This meant he now
          controlled the stability of the arrays, essence and Principles, pretty
          much the whole environment of the Nine Mountains.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why do you say that, Eldest Senior Sister? My Master said that
          the Celestial Seal should be guarded by someone moralistic. When the
          Supreme Mountain Elder relinquished the Seal and every Elder fought
          over it, my Master, the Third Mountain Elder, missed a move and thus
          lost to the Second Elder. That was how he managed to acquire it. How
          can he not allow the disciples to compete for it? Rather, give it
          directly to someone else? This decision isn&#8217;t convincing in the
          slightest and I&#8217;m not satisfied with it.&#8221; Gu Wudi looked
          slightly annoyed as his brows furrowed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was extremely frustrated; if he lost in a fair fight with Xiao
          Yang and the latter acquired the Celestial Seal as a result, he
          wouldn&#8217;t argue against it. But now, he wasn&#8217;t given a
          chance to fight for the recognition and was immediately considered
          unsuitable for the role. How could he possibly be happy with this?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was haughty and had a high opinion of himself, having cultivated
          in the Nine Great Mountains for so long that his strength had caught
          up to many disciples before him. The Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s
          decision meant that he didn&#8217;t think Xiao Yang was weaker than
          him, when Xiao Yang had only cultivated here for around twenty
          years.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That’s my Master&#8217;s decision. Go talk to him if you have
          something to say about that. You are so much stronger than Youngest
          Junior Brother, so won’t be fair to him if there was a fair fight,
          right?&#8221; Chen Suyun continued frowning as she spoke.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Wudi was undeniably extremely talented and was deemed the most
          brilliant disciple of the Nine Great Mountains in recent times. The
          only issue was that he was too self-centred and considered himself
          unrivalled. His usual gentle and polite behaviour was all just a
          ruse.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I can suppress my cultivation level to be the same as his. If
          you still think it&#8217;s unfair, then I&#8217;ll allow him to be in
          one realm higher than me. Or let him take three of my attacks while we
          are in the same realm. What about that?&#8221; Gu Wudi&#8217;s
          expression turned dark, and his voice sounded unfriendly.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;ve cultivated long enough that your knowledge
          regarding techniques and Principles are so much more superior to him.
          You fighting him will be unfair to him.&#8221; Chen Suyun did not
          budge. &#8220;This is Master&#8217;s decision, so it&#8217;s more
          useful talking to him.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had watched Xiao Yang grow up, so she was on his side. Meanwhile,
          Gu Wudi was already in the Sacred Emperor Realm due to so many years
          of cultivating. Xiao Yang had only been cultivating for more than
          twenty years, so how were they comparable?</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Great. That&#8217;s great.&#8221; Gu Wudi&#8217;s expression
          was dark now, having abandoned his warm demeanour. &#8220;If so,
          don&#8217;t blame me for anything I do.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          cultivators away, his fury impalpable.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Chen Suyun shook her head, thinking that it was just bluster, and did
          not take it seriously. Soon, she transformed into a divine rainbow and
          left for the Second Mountain.

          >The Blue Cloud Flying Boat cut through the misty waterfall and headed
          towards its destination, bearing a terrifying force which swirled the
          air. Runes flickered and remained unmoving like an enormous rock.

          >The Deep Cloud Graveyard, also called the Deep Cloud Area of No
          Return, was known as the burial ground for clouds. It was easy for one
          to get lost here, and even accomplished cultivators found it hard to
          exit. That was why the Nine Great Mountains used it as a natural
          barrier against any contact with the outside world.

          smiled and added teasingly, &#8220;Tell me about your grudge against
          the Nine Great Mountains. I&#8217;m suddenly interested.&#8221;</span

          repay such a favour, but sadly you didn&#8217;t accept it when I
          offered myself up,&#8221; she replied, a slight smile on her lips.
          However, her tone was mocking, which would have shocked anyone
          acquainted with her who was present. They wouldn&#8217;t believe this
          woman was the sacred, elegant, and Zen-like Sky Deer Goddess.</span

          already gotten used to her many seduction attempts, and he knew she
          did it deliberately. It didn&#8217;t matter if it was the result of
          her Dao Heart changing after the rise of her demonic nature, and thus
          revealing her true personality, or if it was just a disguise.
          Nonetheless, it didn&#8217;t change the fact that he couldn&#8217;t
          ‘eat’ her.</span

          snuff out all their attacks with just a palm. Its power hadn&#8217;t
          waned and continued its path towards the group of cultivators. Their
          skins nearly split open from its force and they already started
          seeping blood.</span

          >&#8220;Stop!&#8221; He disdainfully roared, and his aura transformed
          immediately. A True Dragon then emerged from behind him while exuding
          Chaos Qi. Its viciousness complemented his golden armour, making him
          look like a golden warrior god, who condescendingly looked down on the
          world.</span

          >That palm did not pause in its descent, the Chaos Qi spreading out as
          it fell on him like a collapsing sky. It made his True Dragon collapse
          at once and he coughed up blood, his body nearly exploding from the
          force.</span

          >&#8220;How is this possible!?&#8221; Gu Wudi was taken aback as he
          realised everything had gone wrong. He turned to escape, but the palm
          seemed to have transformed into its own universe and trapped him
          inside. It was impossible for him to move.</span

          >In the depths of the continent, the atmosphere inside the ancient yet
          majestic Second Mountain was weighty. The palace was enormous, with
          white jade pillars and glass roof tiles. Every surface shimmered with
          divine light, making the palace resemble one from the Celestial Realm.

          >A white-robed Elder with white hair and white beard as well as a
          slight hump in his back was saying something to the others with
          narrowed eyes. Behind him was an attractive, tall youth with a green
          tinge to his eyes, who had a green light swirling around him and
          looked like an accomplished cultivator.</span

          >&#8220;Forgive me, Second Mountain Elder, but I disagree with your
          decision. Now that the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains have the Upper
          Realm army closing in on their borders, it is a good opportunity for
          the disciples of Nine Great Mountains to show themselves and rally
          support around the world. How can we seal up the Nine Mountains? We
          may regret it forever if we miss such a fantastic chance from
          heaven.&#8221;

          >A black-clothed Elder frowned unhappily from opposite the white-robed
          Elder. He had white hair and looked young, with a sparkling gaze,
          Chaos Qi exuding from his eyes with every blink. This was the Third
          Mountain Elder, also the Master of the Chosen One, Gu Wudi. The
          white-robed Elder was the Second Mountain Elder, and the young man was
          his youngest disciple, Xiao Yang.</span

          male and female. Their figures were indistinct, yet their auras were
          all frightening.

          >All the most powerful cultivators of the Nine Great Mountains were
          already there and agreed with the Third Mountain Elder as they
          weren&#8217;t happy with the Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s decision to
          seal the Mountains. Only a few maintained their silence as they felt
          there had to be a reason for this.</span

          >&#8220;I used the Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains to divine the
          future and look into the River of Time. The signs show that the Nine
          Great Mountains are in danger of going extinction very soon. The only
          solution is to seal the Mountains. I did this for everyone&#8217;s
          sake, as this isn&#8217;t just disastrous to the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains but also the Nine Great Mountains.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;How many times have you used that explanation? Every time the
          Upper Realm invades us, you call it an impending disaster. However, it
          was nothing every single time. When have our disciples ever
          encountered danger in the outside world? Did you know that if you seal
          the mountain, the reputation and faith we&#8217;ve painstakingly built
          over the years will be reduced to nothing? What will everyone think of
          us? They will think we are scared of the Upper Realm and can only hide
          away from the frontlines!&#8221; The Third Mountain Elder sneered
          scornfully at the so-called divination the Second Elder
          performed.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The palace fell silent immediately, and even the Second Elder tried
          opening his mouth to speak but ended up swallowing his words with a
          sigh. He was extremely cautious since he had sensed that the
          conditions were different from before. However, the others refused to
          believe him.</span

          >&#8220;Besides, I cannot concur with your determination to hand the
          Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains to Xiao Yang. Wudi is so much
          better in terms of strength and ability, so why won&#8217;t you give
          him a chance? If there was a fair competition for the Seal, I
          wouldn&#8217;t argue against the result. However, you are obviously
          favouring your junior disciple, and I have to speak up for
          Wudi!&#8221; The Third Mountain Elder continued speaking, his eyes
          glittering as he stared at the Second Mountain Elder. He wanted to
          seek justice for his disciple. The other Mountain Elders nodded
          agreeably at this too.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Master, the Third Mountain Elder is right. Senior Wudi is so
          much stronger than me. He&#8217;s better suited to the role of
          possessing the Celestial Seal, and besides, I won&#8217;t be able to
          win against him in a fight when he has already reached the Sacred
          Emperor Realm. Please rescind your order. It is best to let Senior
          Wudi have the Celestial Seal instead.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The silent young man behind the Second Mountain Elder suddenly spoke.
          He rubbed his nose and laughed bitterly, as if he was too weak and had
          to make sacrifices for the bigger picture.</span

          >&#8220;Xiao Yang, you…&#8221; The Second Mountain Elder turned to him
          before shaking his head and not saying anything else.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The others immediately understood what Xiao Yang meant, and their
          eyes were filled with astonishment. On the surface, it sounded like he
          was humbly refusing the role, yet the real meaning was that this was
          unfair to him. He might be young, but he had a calculating and
          manipulative mind.</span

        Chapter 254-1: Girl, please respect yourself, You imposter, let‚Äôs see
        how you pretend at this time (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Not long after that, Ying Yu woke up. She opened her eyes, looking a
        little confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was still a little vague about the events in the pavilion. She
        remembered the matter of her finally drinking, and even taking the
        initiative to offer a lot of wine to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        And he didn't refuse. In the end, she was the one who drank first and
        fell down, or he helped her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's so embarrassing to be drunk in front of people. Fortunately I
        didn't say any nonsense at that time‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu breathed a sigh of relief, but thinking of this, she couldn't
        help but blush a little. Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>"Xiaoyu‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Ying Shuang, who had come to visit Ying Yu just now,
        happened to see this scene and frowned.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Who was Ying Yu thinking about? Why does she look a little shy?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Ying Shuang's face look bad, and he subconsciously thought of
        Gu Changge. Even after being out, Ying Yu was thinking about Gu Changge?
      </p>
      <p>"Elder brother."</p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu also noticed Ying Shuang at the door at this time, her
        expression quickly turned to normal, and she asked, "What are you doing
        here?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I was here to see how you are, but it seems that I was a bit
        redundant‚Ä¶" Ying Shuang said lightly, holding a bowl of soup to sober
        up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu didn't notice the emotions in Ying Shuang's words and said, "By
        the way, there is one thing that I have to tell you. It is very likely
        that Heavenly Emperor Mountain was calculated by other people, including
        Young Master Gu. We were actually used‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>This was the last truth she came up with.</p>
      <p>Why did Gu Changge harm them for no reason?</p>
      <p>
        Including that, the other two descendants of the Human Ancestor Hall
        also had the same attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless Ying Shuang had been hiding something from her. Or it was the
        real inheritor of demonic art in the dark, who was using the
        calculations to make Ying Shuang take the blame, and Gu Changge was also
        used in this process.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, hearing Ying Yu say this, Ying Shuang's complexion turned even
        more ugly, and he categorically retorted, "Impossible. What did Gu
        Changge tell you, so that you even call him Young Master Gu?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu was stunned for a moment, not knowing why Ying Shuang was so
        decisive, thinking that it was impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, her eyes became suspicious. But she didn't have to say
        anything more.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that Ying Shuang was still hiding a lot of things from her,
        and his attitude toward Gu Changge was full of hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Logically, knowing that someone was plotting against them, Gu Changge
        had no grudge against Ying Shuang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang only needed to show his face and take the initiative to
        calmly say all this, Gu Changge must also understand this.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, Emperor Mountain could clear the suspicion of the inheritor
        of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>Why didn't he do this?</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>Inside a pavilion.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji was wearing a light blue long dress, her face was
        unparalleled, and her whole body looked flawless and perfect as she was
        sitting by the window.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Supporting her chin, she looked at the table in front of her again and
        again, and looked bored. Xiu‚Äôer was diligently pouring tea for her.
      </p>
      <p>"Elder sister‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Wang Wushuang stood in front of her with a smirk on his face.</p>
      <p>With an honest look. He touched the back of his head with his hand.</p>
      <p>
        There was no such capable and reliable appearance in front of everyone
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What‚Äôs the matter?" Wang Ziji looked at his cheap brother and asked
        angrily before continuing, "If it's not a big deal, how dare you use the
        amulet I gave you! I'll let you know why the flowers are so red in a
        while."
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't expect that Wang Wushuang's purpose for using the amulet was
        not during an encounter with any danger at all. Instead, it was used to
        call her.
      </p>
      <p>He dare use this amulet as a summoning charm!</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji felt that it was in vain to give him this amulet at first, and
        she was not going to give it next time. Hearing all kinds of nonsense
        words from his sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang had gotten used to it for a while. Although he didn't
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>But he also knew that this was meant to teach him a lesson.</p>
      <p>
        Yet he still hurriedly said, "Wasn't Elder sister who said that she will
        come when I encountered an emergency, and you asked me to activate the
        amulet?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's what I said. But the emergency is when your life is in danger‚Ä¶
        Don‚Äôt you know that I'm busy right now? That guy Jiang Chuchu recklessly
        rushed to the place of Heavenly Extinction." Wang Zijin was speechless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu, who was one of the few who could talk to her and had a
        good relationship, was barely a best friend but was actually quite
        attentive.
      </p>
      <p>
        On that day, she left the Ancient Immortal Wang Family and went to find
        Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wanted to ask something from Jiang Chuchu's mouth. But she didn't
        want her to mention Gu Changge in front of Jiang Chuchu, Jiang Chuchu's
        expression became even colder, at least a hundred times colder than
        usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, after hearing that Absolute Heavenly Extinction had been birthed,
        Jiang Chuchu rushed away. She had no choice but to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two of them had a lot of secret techniques, but they had also found
        a place where the aura of Absolute Heavenly Extinction permeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, Jiang Chuchu rushed there regardless of her obstruction. This made
        her very helpless.
      </p>
      <p>
        While afraid of being blamed by his Elder sister, Wang Wushuang
        hurriedly said, "Sister, this is what you said. If there is anything
        about the young master Changge, I will tell you immediately. This time,
        Young Master Changge took the initiative to ask me to inform him of your
        whereabouts.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        "I know the importance of this matter, so I immediately informed you‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p><i>Gu Changge?</i></p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Wang Ziji suddenly became interested and stopped blaming
        Wang Wushuang.
      </p>
      <p>"You said he was asking about my whereabouts?"</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji naturally paid special attention to this man who looked very
        impressed but wasn't impressed at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        She and Gu Changge never saw each other again after they said goodbye at
        the Ancient Immortal Gu Family that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unexpectedly, Gu Changge would take the initiative to contact her. By
        his character, it could only be said that there was nothing as a free
        meal.
      </p>
      <p>"Could it be that this guy wants help with something?"</p>
      <p>
        Soon, Wang Ziji put Jiang Chuchu's affairs aside. At this time, it was
        important to have a boyfriend or something to have her own object of
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she knew that Gu Changge was probably just asking her for
        something. But it still made Wang Ziji a little happy.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        After all, it meant that Gu Changge still remembered her and didn‚Äôt
        forget her without blinking an eye.
      </p>
      <p>"Okay, then tell Gu Changge that I'll be waiting for him here."</p>
      <p>
        Then Wang Ziji thought about it and said with a smile. Gu Changge was a
        smart person, and he would definitely come after he found out.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>"Is this the entrance to the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield?"</p>
      <p>
        In Southern Heaven, in a very desolate mountain range. In the sky, two
        figures appeared and came here.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge raised his eyebrows and asked in confusion.</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, if you don't pay attention, you can't find where it is, right? But
        there should be more than one entrance like this."
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside him was Wang Ziji. She placed her hands behind her back and
        smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had already heard a lot of information from her about the
        location of the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        After receiving Wang Wushuang's reply, he did not hesitate at all, and
        set off to meet Wang Ziji, and learned a lot from her. Wang Ziji herself
        did not hide it from him, she told him everything one by one, saving Gu
        Changge a lot of trouble.
      </p>
      <p>Among them was the entrance to the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was too lazy to send someone to investigate, so he directly
        asked her. The existence of the Heavenly Extinction battlefield was
        similar to the small secret realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because when the Absolute Heavenly Extinction arrives, it would
        penetrate and devour many worlds, and when the Heavenly Extinction aura
        permeates, it would cause cracks within the obstacles made of many
        worlds, and a small world-like area would be born.
      </p>
      <p>This had also become a battlefield of Heavenly Extinction.</p>
      <p>"Shouldn't you appreciate my words?"</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji looked at him with a faint smile on her face, "There are very
        few people who know about the existence of the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you very much." Gu Changge smiled slightly, with a three-point
        thank you on his face, "Just take this opportunity to get a few more
        places."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother Gu's gratitude doesn't seem sincere to me. Just one sentence is
        perfunctory." Wang Ziji shook her head with a distressed look, "It took
        us a lot of time to find this place."
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't intend to let Gu Changge empty the gloves of the white wolf.
      </p>
      <p>Only a thank you?</p>
      <p>She didn't need this.</p>
      <p>Us?</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's eyes moved slightly, clearly capturing the word.</p>
      <p>
        He guessed that it might be related to another descendant of Human
        Ancestor Hall, namely Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>How did Jiang Chuchu escape to the land of Heavenly Extinction?</p>
      <p>
        However, the expression on his face still did not change much, and he
        said in surprise, "How does Miss Ziji want to thank Gu?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "How about making a promise?" Wang Ziji said with a smile, she didn't
        believe that under such a posture, Gu Changge could still be as calm as
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though she knew that Gu Changge might have already wished to
        strangle her to death by himself, for throwing out such a question.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she didn't care, after all, this kind of strategy was interesting.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was slightly taken aback, and seemed a little surprised.</p>
      <p>
        Then he shook his head, and said with a look of "Girl, please respect
        yourself. This Gu has a fianc√©e, Miss Ziji, this kind of joke is not
        allowed."
      </p>
      <p>"If Mingkong hears it, her jealousy will be overturned."</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji looked at him like this. She just wanted to roll her eyes.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 254-2: Girl, please respect yourself, You imposter, let‚Äôs see
        how you pretend at this time (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Pretending to be a serious person, she still looked righteous and
        awe-inspiring. However, she showed a thoughtful look, and then asked in
        a different tone,
      </p>
      <p>
        "In ancient times, men had multiple wives and concubines. I didn't
        expect Brother Gu to be such a single-minded person. I was abrupt.
        Otherwise, Brother Gu, give me something close to you."
      </p>
      <p>"Is that so? That's fine." Gu Changge didn't hesitate to hear that.</p>
      <p>
        He directly took off the crystal jade pendant that was tied to his
        waist, and the pattern in the middle that waved, which was quite
        extraordinary. He handed it to Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If I have something to do in the future, can I use this jade pendant to
        come to Brother Gu?" Wang Ziji took it with a smile, and seemed very
        happy.
      </p>
      <p>"Of course, you can." Gu Changge smiled and nodded.</p>
      <p>
        However, he was laughing in his heart. It was okay for you to come to
        me, but if you want me to help you, then you would lose more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, the two of them found an obscure spatial fluctuation in this
        desolate mountain range. There was an extremely cold aura in it,
        circulating and permeating, causing the nearby vegetation to wither, and
        they were stained with a kind of black-brown small particles.
      </p>
      <p>
        With nine days in the air, it was difficult to dispel this gloomy cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The aura of Heavenly Extinction, although it is not very pure‚Ä¶ but it
        does permeate from here."
      </p>
      <p>Looking at these substances, Gu Changge said involuntarily.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji also nodded and said, "From here, you can go to the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield. As for the entrance in the other direction, I
        don't know." Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's eyes narrowed.</p>
      <p>
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction's true location was actually very difficult
        to judge, but it was very simple to find it according to the direction
        of Heavenly Extinction Aura of the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>Afterward, the two of them returned along the same path.</p>
      <p>
        On the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, apart from the younger
        generation, the cultivators of the older generation were hardly seen,
        unless it was the kind of righteous people who had a strong sense of
        justice and intended to sacrifice themselves to prevent the outbreak of
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of the younger generation cultivators had also come here with a
        hard scalp. After all, if they wanted to have a place in the True
        Immortal Academy, they had to kill certain Heavenly Extinction beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn't want to come here. Therefore, Gu Changge was not worried
        that there would be any powerful existence in it, which would disturb
        his plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I heard that Brother Gu has been in contact with Ying Yu of Emperor
        Mountain. How do you feel about her brother?"
      </p>
      <p>On the way, Wang Ziji suddenly opened her mouth and asked.</p>
      <p>
        When she was in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, she was suddenly
        attacked by the inheritor of the demonic art, and she was seriously
        injured.
      </p>
      <p>
        She always remembered this hatred. And in her opinion, no matter what
        the possibility was, the inheritor of demonic art was inseparable from
        the relationship between Emperor Mountain and Prince Ying.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Miss Ying Yu is quite frank and honest. I don't know her brother, since
        I haven't seen him before."
      </p>
      <p>
        When Gu Changge heard these words, his expression was natural and
        authentic.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is that Prince Ying really planning to be a tortoise for the rest of
        his life? If he is not the inheritor of demonic art, why does he dare
        not show up‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji was convinced of her judgment, and when she asked Jiang
        Chuchu, the answer she got was silence.

      <p>
        If there was no problem with Emperor Mountain, Jiang Chuchu's fair
        character would definitely defend it. But she chose to remain silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This meant that even she felt that there was something wrong with
        Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>"In that case, I have a way to make Ying Shuang show up‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        When Gu Changge heard her say that, he appeared to be thinking seriously
        for a while, and then said, "When the time comes, whether it is true or
        not, everything will be known."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji nodded, but she didn't doubt it. The inheritor of demonic art
        caused the Gu family to lose a lot of face at that time.
      </p>
      <p>It was normal for Gu Changge to choose to do this.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        In the following days, Ye Langtian, Ye Liuli, Chi Ling, and others all
        learned from Gu Changge about the location of the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>This made them shocked, followed by joy.</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, they worked hard to search for news from all
        sides, but they could not find the location of the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Gu Changge had just arrived in Southern Heaven for a few days,
        he had already figured out everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, they didn't know that this news came from Wang Ziji and had
        nothing to do with Gu Changge. They simply felt that there must be a few
        acquaintances of his in the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield so that he
        could have an alibi.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Ying Yu also received the news from Gu Changge. Her
        silver eyes widened in surprise. She had been inquiring about the news
        of the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, but it was all in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it involved the quota of True Immortal Academy. The less one
        person knew, the more chance they would have. Gu Changge actually gave
        her one more chance now.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Ying Yu a little moved, but in the news, Gu Changge also made
        a request. If you meet him on the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, give
        him a chance. In this regard, Ying Yu naturally felt that there was no
        problem. It was just a trivial matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this incident, she also saw Gu Changge's generous and confident
        character. Because he knew that no one else could compete with him for
        the quota of True Immortal Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, Ying Yu told the news to the rest of the younger generation of
        Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she did not say that Gu Changge told her, for fear of causing
        Ying Shuang's dissatisfaction, who would choose to stay in the mansion
        and not go anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>He would not fight for a place in the True Immortal Academy.</p>
      <p>
        "It seems like god's will, since we have found this Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield, then we can go."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang himself did not know the source of the news. Hearing what
        Ying Yu said, he thought for a moment and decided to leave. If he didn't
        go at this time then not only his face would be lost but also the face
        of Emperor Mountain. Some people would probably doubt the authenticity
        of his identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, days passed. According to the position provided by Wang Ziji,
        everyone finally came to the heavenly extinction battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sky here was gray, with bleak clouds floating, and even though there
        was sunshine, the atmosphere was very cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mountains were vast and the terrain was endless, but the only
        feature was that it was desolate and had no life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The so-called Heavenly Extinction beings were actually normal
        cultivators and creatures infected with Heavenly Extinction aura and
        finally transformed into Heavenly Extinction beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many would lose consciousness and become walking corpses who only know
        how to devour life. Only a few were born with consciousness, but they
        were also incompatible with the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>"Some people have already arrived here‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian and the others were very surprised and found that the
        Heavenly Extinction beings near the entrance had been cleaned up. The
        Heavenly Extinction aura here had already made them feel very
        uncomfortable.

      <p>If they went deeper, their life might be in danger.</p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge didn't come with us, he should have gone in early‚Ä¶" Ye Liuli
        looked around and said so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then they left this place and went to the place where the beings of the
        Heavenly Extinction were. After a while, fluctuations appeared again
        here.
      </p>
      <p>The cultivators of Emperor Mountain had arrived.</p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang, Ying Yu and others were all there, and there were several
        ancient freaks like Agu, the man in black, all of which had been sealed
        up to this day and were their followers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang was dressed in a long robe, standing with his hands behind
        his back, swept the vicinity, and said calmly, "It seems that someone
        came first. Let's see who is so daring and jumps ahead of us."
      </p>
      <p>
        Now was the time to consolidate his majesty as a prince. Just in time to
        make a move, shocking Little Ying Yu.
      </p>
      <p>"Look, he really couldn't help coming."</p>
      <p>
        "No matter from which aspect, the current Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield is the greatest breeding ground for the inheritor of demonic
        art."
      </p>
      <p>"There's no reason not to come."</p>
      <p>
        In the other direction, Gu Changge, who had been staring at the
        entrance, couldn't help but smile. Wang Ziji nodded in agreement.
      </p>
      <p>"But‚Ä¶ he seems to have noticed us both."</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWhat a powerful consciousness."</p>
      <p>
        Afterward, she was a little surprised and felt that Ying Shuang's
        spiritual sense seemed to be very powerful, and he could sense where she
        was from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        "As expected of prince Ying." Gu Changge smiled slightly, "Then I will
        leave the next thing to Miss Ziji."
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, the void in front of him became blurred, and his figure
        disappeared into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin rolled her eyes in her heart, knowing that Gu Changge planned
        to stand by and watch the play. But she didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she must take revenge against Ying Shuang, and even if
        there was no evidence to prove that he was the inheritor of demonic
        arts, it would have no effect.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>Soon, Wang Zijin's figure disappeared like a wisp of blue smoke.</p>
      <p>
        In the area where Ying Shuang and others were located, terrifying
        fluctuations suddenly appeared, and splendid runes erupted directly
        there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang was the first to bear the brunt, but he didn't react, and
        his face changed suddenly, "Who are you‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        But before he could finish his words, he was punched by Wang Ziji, and
        he suddenly let out a muffled groan, flew out backward while spurting
        blood, and shattered a lot of bones.
      </p>
      <p>"Little Lord‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"Elder brother‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        The entire group of the Heavenly Emperor Mountain changed their
        expressions, and they were extremely shocked.
      </p>
      <p>"Imposter, let‚Äôs see how you pretend at this time?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's figure was hidden in the void. Looking at this scene, he
        couldn't help but say with interest.

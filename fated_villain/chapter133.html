      <h4>
        Chapter 133: Suppressing Her at the Bottom of an Abyss; How Dare You
        Target My People?!
      </h4>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s calm tone and indifferent expression made her words sound
        quite credible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, only Gu Xian’er knew the truth, and that filled her heart
        with a feeling of loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        She hoped for her words to be the truth, but…she bothered Gu Changge so
        much that he no longer cared about her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, she had no idea about Gu Changge’s current whereabouts; the
        Ancient Immortal Continent was massive, so no one could tell where he
        might be scrambling for opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>Her life and death meant nothing to him.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s heart and expression turned colder and colder as she
        thought about that, and then she watch the Seventh Princess with a look
        that said, ‘Seventh Princess, you are finished.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“You are courting death! If Gu Changge finds out you tried to hunt
          and murder me, all of you here will die without a single one getting
          away with their life.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“You think you are strong? You are nothing but a Pinnacle Conferred
          King — that might allow you to bully me, but before my brother, you
          are no different from an ant; he only needs one slap to obliterate
          you.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian’er still spoke with a calm tone.</p>
      <p>
        Her words seemed to reveal a lot of information, and made everyone think
        that Gu Changge was indeed mighty beyond measure…
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, her words showed everyone just how much she admired
        and worshipped Gu Changge as his younger sister…
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality, however, she prepared to escape using her hidden talisman
        while directing everyone’s hatred towards Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er wouldn’t feel an iota of guilt even if the Seventh Princess
        put all of her hatred on Gu Changge’s head.
      </p>
      <p>
        She knew Gu Changge was plenty strong and wouldn’t have any trouble
        dealing with the Seventh Princess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course…even still, she was exaggerating her description of his might.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her words caused a great sensation throughout the region and countless
        Young Heavenly Geniuses showed surprise and a change of complexion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ones showing the greatest surprise were the disciples of the
        Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in the Palace, they only saw a complicated relationship between Gu
        Xian’er and Gu Changge, and nothing showed that they were close…
      </p>
      <p>They couldn’t tell reality from imagination anymore.</p>
      <p>‘Are her claims credible? Are they really siblings on good terms?’</p>
      <p>
        Some of the disciples couldn’t help but ask themselves with weird
        feelings.
      </p>
      <p>The way Gu Xian’er spoke made it hard for them to doubt her words.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I am like an ant in front of him? I would love to see his might
          then.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess planned to torture Gu Xian’er before, but now, she
        didn’t care about that at all.
      </p>
      <p>Right now, her eyes showed extreme rage.</p>
      <p>
        She, who walked unhindered since the moment of her birth, was made out
        to be an ant by Gu Xian’er!
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn’t bear such naked insult, and wished to tear the calm and
        collected little wench’s mouth to shreds!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Since you wish to die today, then let me fulfill your desire!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess took the initiative to murder Gu Xian’er, and urged
        her warhorse to rush forward and stomp her under its feet.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        The golden warhorse trampled the sky underneath its hooves and charged
        towards Gu Xian’er.
      </p>
      <p>
        It had a monstrous momentum that made it resemble a cavalry of a
        thousand warriors rushing towards its prey with boundless killing
        intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clouds parted, and brilliant runes flickered throughout the
        formation set up by the Sea King Palace’s underlings to create a pathway
        in the sky for the warhorse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Golden flames sparked in all directions, and everyone in the
        surroundings could see the scene without any obstruction.
      </p>
      <p>Golden light shone across the sky.</p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess radiated a gallant aura and resembled an invincible
        goddess of war. She swept her spear in front of her, and it radiated a
        might that could make the Heavens fall!
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        The surroundings boiled and mountains crumbled, and terror struck the
        hearts of the onlooking cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        They never expected such tyrannical and boundless force of oppression to
        descend upon them once the Seventh Princess went all out.
      </p>
      <p><b>“This is not good…”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Xian’er’s complexion paled further.</p>
      <p>
        She made her move and used a supreme Mystical Ability that created a
        giant bell made of immortal aura around her; the bell released an
        earth-shattering sound that was so loud, it could obliterate anything in
        its path just with that.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Immediately, the surroundings exploded and mountains crumbled and turned
        into dust that obstructed everyone’s vision.
      </p>
      <p><b>“She’s too strong! That’s the strength of a True God—”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I don’t think any other Young Supreme can rival the Seventh Princess
          now; with her strength, she can easily sweep through the Ancient
          Immortal Continent and subdue all her peers.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The exchange stunned everyone in the surroundings while terrifying
        fluctuations spread everywhere through the void.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Argh…”</b></p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, the giant bell crumbled and Gu Xian’er’s figure flew
        out like a kite with a broken string, spilling blood everywhere in the
        air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her Mystical Ability was strong, but the Seventh Princess was far
        stronger than her.

      </div>
      <p>
        This was no longer a fight she could stand, especially when the Seventh
        Princess went all out in rage!
      </p>
      <p><b>“Die!”</b></p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess still sat atop her warhorse and looked down on Gu
        Xian’er with a sneer. Instead of diminishing, the brilliance around her
        spear gave it an even sharper edge.
      </p>
      <p><b>“I have no more choice…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s face paled even more, and her blood and organs rumbled. A
        sweetness assaulted her throat, and blood gushed out from countless
        wounds on her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        She never expected the Seventh Princess to suddenly go all out with the
        intent to murder her, and that fact maddened her.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>Right then, the Seventh Princess attacked again.</p>
      <p>
        She glared at Gu Xian’er with a murderous gaze, and said with a tone
        that could chill the listener’s heart,
        <b>“Go to hell! A scourge like you can’t be spared!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The golden brilliance around her spear intensified, and dazzling runes
        flashed in the surroundings as the spear filled with murderous aura
        charged at Gu Xian’er.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b> Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com</p>
      <p>
        Another large area of a mountain range turned into powder under her
        blow, and her attack even affected countless cultivators in the distance
        who couldn’t help but spew a mouthful of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s face paled to the point of having almost no blood, and she
        prepared to use her trump card, but just then, she widened her eyes and
        froze on her spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        She seemed to be dumbfounded and couldn’t believe her eyes as she
        murmured, <b>“Gu Changge, why are you…”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er couldn’t help but open her eyes wide, and felt that the scene
        in front of her was nothing short of incredible — it was as if she was
        in a dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        High above in the sky in front of her, the void blurred and a youth in
        white walked out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
        A terrifying tempest raged around him as he looked down on everything
        with eyes full of indifference, and waves formed by a golden light shot
        into the sky.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        A huge, powerful, and intimidating golden palm resembling the palm of a
        god materialized in the sky out of nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>It was an unprecedented Mystical Ability.</p>
      <p>
        The palm was like the palm of the Heavenly Emperor. Although it appeared
        simple, it was actually the embodiment of the natural laws of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the Ancient Immortal Gu Family’s famous palm technique, the
        [Heavenly God’s Palm]!
      </p>
      <p>
        The palm fell with a bang, and made it seem as if the sky was about to
        fall on everyone’s head.
      </p>
      <p>
        The golden spear trembled in response, and the terrifying pressure that
        descended contained endless power that could shatter the universe
        itself. [metaphorically]
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, the golden warhorse let out a mournful neigh.</p>
      <p><b>[Puff!]</b></p>
      <p>An extremely bright light bloomed in the void.</p>
      <p><b>“How is this possib—”</b></p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess’ arm trembled violently, and the terrifying might
        bearing down on her almost made her arm burst as her face twisted in
        pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn’t for her Rune Bones, her Natural Talent, glowing and
        protecting her right now, then half of her body would have exploded
        under the assault.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made the Seventh Princess show a dramatic change in her expression
        that now showed horror and disbelief, so much so that…she felt her scalp
        tingle.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        The golden palm finally fell and golden light burst into the
        surroundings. Massive craters appeared on the ground as multiple
        mountains collapsed and smoke and dust rose into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many onlookers failed to escape the aftermath of the attack and turned
        into meat paste.
      </p>
      <p><b>“How dare you target my people?!”</b></p>
      <p>
        A low and indifferent voice resounded through Heaven and Earth, and
        brought pin-drop silence to the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the cultivators stared at the figure walking out of the void with
        blank expressions, and felt horrified.
      </p>
      <p>Many even felt chills go down their backs as their scalps tingled.</p>
      <p><b>“We pay our respect to the Heir!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Many disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace on the surrounding
        mountains showed drastic changes in their expressions, and hurriedly
        greeted the newcomer with frightened and shocked expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        They naturally recognized the young man who suddenly appeared as the
        Heir of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.
      </p>
      <p>He was Gu Changge!</p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace, who was at the Pinnacle of
        the Conferred King Realm, was severely injured under a single palm
        attack from him, and even had her warhorse explode.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her right arm dripped blood, and one couldn’t see any signs of blood on
        her pale face.
      </p>
      <p>It shocked everyone.</p>
      <p>
        Her current appearance formed a strong contrast with her previous
        aggressive, murderous, and arrogant appearance when she tried to murder
        Gu Xian’er from high above, and that made the hearts of the cultivators
        jump to their throats.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an instant, she was knocked down from Heaven with a single palm — and
        it was just as Gu Xian’er described — without the slightest resistance.
      </p>
      <p>She was no match for Gu Changge!</p>
      <p>This stunned them and they wondered just how strong Gu Changge was?</p>
      <p>Was it really as Gu Xian’er said?</p>
      <p>
        Everyone from the Sea Families’ showed a drastic change in expression.
        They rushed from every direction to protect the Seventh Princess and
        glared at Gu Changge with extreme vigilance.

        The fact that he could appear here even with their formation locked down
        the surroundings showed just how mighty he was.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more? The scene they witnessed just now made their heads buzz,
        and their minds went blank — for a while, they had no idea about how to
        react.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their invincible Seventh Princess had never suffered such humiliation,
        especially when it came at the hands of someone from the same
        generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was far too strong…the rumors they heard about him increased
        their vigilance.
      </p>
      <p>‘Interesting…’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge appeared in the sky and looked down at the Seventh Princess
        of the Sea King Palace, who showed a fearful expression right now, and
        said,
        <b
          >“This Gu has appeared, so why do you look like that, Seventh
          Princess?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Or is it that you only dare to bully this Gu’s little sister?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked at her with a calm expression, but the deep, cold indifference
        in his tone deepened the fear in the Seventh Princess’ heart and her
        complexion showed a drastic change, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had healed her injury, but the pain remained…it was difficult for
        her to forget that pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge made a move out of nowhere and caught her off guard,
        it still showed her his might, and this made her frown.
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn’t suppress the fear in her heart, and a gloomy expression
        appeared on her face.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had investigated and discovered that there were a lot of grudges
        between Gu Xian’er and Gu Changge, and that the matter even involved a
        massive secret of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family…yet now, Gu Changge
        showed up to help Gu Xian’er!
      </p>
      <p>Why was that?</p>
      <p>Was it really as Gu Xian’er claimed?</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, I admit that you are strong, but don’t think you are
          invincible! In a battle of life and death, it won’t be easy to tell
          who’s weaker and who’s stronger.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Coldness flashed past the Seventh Princess’ face as she said those
        words, and then she tightly grasped her spear and golden runes
        circulated around it once more to give it a peerless edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        She said through her attitude: ‘if you want to fight, then good, I will
        fight with you! I am not afraid to fight.’
      </p>
      <p>
        As a leader among the Young Supremes, she couldn’t shy away from the
        fight, or it would be a huge blow to her confidence, heart, and face.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, it wasn’t a guarantee that she would definitely lose
        even if Gu Changge was as mighty as he was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er, on the other hand, finally reacted and flew up from below
        with an expression of shock and disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        She never expected that Gu Changge would actually show up, and this made
        her head buzz, and she didn’t know what to say.
      </p>
      <p>She was bewildered, confused, delighted, excited, happy, and…</p>
      <p>
        All kinds of emotions flooded her heart and made her fall into
        complicated thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, her expression recovered at a quick pace, even though her mind
        was turned upside-down.
      </p>
      <p>
        She believed that Gu Changge didn’t care about her anymore, and wouldn’t
        give a damn about her life and death, yet right now, he was standing
        right in front of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Gu Xian’er feel an inexplicable peace of mind, and her
        thoughts turned her face somewhat red out of shame.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, she said all those words just now before everyone in the
        world, and tried to direct everyone’s hatred towards Gu Changge, so
        wouldn’t Gu Changge have heard her boasting if he was hiding among the
        crowd?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge would probably die of laughter at her words, and then, he
        would most-likely not let her off easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge naturally noticed Gu Xian’er behind her, but now wasn’t the
        time for him to deal with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, he had been on the scene for a while, but decided to hide in
        the void and not show up because he was waiting for the right moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, only when he made his move at the right moment would he be
        able to achieve the desired effect, or his actions wouldn’t mean
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s calm remarks had stunned even him as he never expected a
        girl as foolish as her to use tricks to direct everyone’s hatred to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace was nothing in his
        eyes, he still wished to throw Gu Xian’er down an abyss and suppress her
        there for three to five years.

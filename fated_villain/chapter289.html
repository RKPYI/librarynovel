          followed suit. Even Jiang Chuchu trailed several steps behind him, as

          generals realised that too and immediately greeted him, feeling
          relieved. There had been too many rumours surrounding the man which
          even they had often heard of. His reputation as the greatest of the
          young generation, the Avatar of the True Immortal, and many others
          belied his mysterious strength and demeanour.</span

          dignified.</span

          me.&#8221; The Vermillion Bird Emperor looked a little surprised and
          pleased. He hadn&#8217;t expected the group to be led by Gu Changge.
          This made him feel thankful and relieved. All the rumours painted him
          as an extraordinary, polite, and mild-mannered man, which was now
          proven to be true. He had even been courteous to a mere emperor of a
          small kingdom like him. He didn&#8217;t have to worry about any other
          problems arising as long as they did not do anything to enrage or
          offend these young prodigies, or the Empire would be in trouble.</span

          >The beautiful princesses of the Empire also found the courage to
          raise their heads secretly, and study Young Master Changge. It allowed
          their imaginations to go wild. Some of them had even decided on their
          descendants&#8217; surnames. They all showed respect and praised him.
          Gu Changge&#8217;s polite behaviour showed that he was a perfect
          example of how the Successor of the Immortal Gu Family behaved.</span

          >Of course, only Jiang Chuchu knew clearly that Gu Changge&#8217;s
          behaviour was all just an act. Everyone who had witnessed his cruelty
          knew how cold he could be, and she didn&#8217;t even know sometimes if
          his behaviour with her was also just a pretence in order to capture
          her heart. If that was true, then he was truly terrifying.</span

          towards me…] She shook her head and dismissed the thought. She felt
          that he still had some kindness in his heart, or he wouldn&#8217;t
          have asked her to find the location of the Eternal Overcast Source or
          saved her life. His cruelty though, thoroughly overshadows his
          kindness.</span

          >The Empire quickly made an order to vacate the best palace for Gu
          Changge and his entourage. The news of his arrival quickly spread
          through the Empire and led to great commotion. He was just about the
          only young prodigy everyone could recall; even a young child beginning
          to cultivate would have heard of him. His name was legendary among the
          young generation, so the news seemed to resolve the chaos and panic
          within the empire. The people were all excited and happy as they felt
          they were saved.</span

          current Fortuitous One should be the Third Prince who has abruptly
          returned.] Within the palace, Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes were sparkling
          with black and white light. A strange strength seemed to evolve from
          the World Principles, like coming out of a cocoon. The Fortuity of the
          Empire was changing before his very eyes. He quickly knew of the Third
          Prince&#8217;s background after sending someone to look into it.</span

          strange phenomena occurring and also a crane bringing a priceless gift
          on the day of his birth. After that, he showed great Talent, which the
          Empire couldn&#8217;t cultivate well. Thus, he had no choice but to
          leave his home and lead a life of wandering. It was unknown which
          Master or Sect he now cultivates under though. Nonetheless, he has now
          returned after a few hundred years with an unknown cultivation
          level.]</span

          Fortuity of his has a hint of purple, which only the Mortal One’s
          reincarnation possess.] Gu Changge closed the scroll containing the
          information he had investigated. [Does that mean he might be a
          reincarnation of some ancient powerful being?]</span

          >He had some thoughts about this now. These Fortuitous Ones with
          purple Fortuity were the best to harvest but drew out more from his
          hand. After all, there were several types of reincarnations. including
          those who were so severely injured that they had no choice but to shed
          their weapons and reincarnate or those like the Mortal One, who did it
          voluntarily while leaving behind cards to play, to prepare for his
          eventual rise to the peak again. He wasn&#8217;t sure which one the
          Third Prince was.</span

          Overcast. Her diligence saved me a lot of trouble, but it seems like
          she doesn&#8217;t want to see me.] Gu Changge did not take this to
          heart, quickly sending down the order for the Immortal Academy’s
          prodigies to begin their trial, to kill the Eternal Overcast creatures
          and end this crisis.

          he was working hard, even though he had no interest in doing such a
          stupid thing that even his followers could do on their own. He
          wasn&#8217;t going to protect them either, as he wasn&#8217;t their

          didn&#8217;t have to worry too much about it. After all, she would
          tell him of her own accord in her own time.</span

          Thoughts flashed through his mind. The Black Tortoise, White Tiger,
          and the other Empires were not that far from here, and his prey was in
          these locations.</span

          Chu Hao about Gu Changge. Ji Qingxuan and Wang Xiao listened with
          different expressions on their faces. Wang Xiao was unhappy about how
          remote the palace they were residing in was, while the young prodigies
          from the Immortal Academy stayed in the best location, with the
          thickest spiritual energy. However, he became quiet when the Emperor
          approached. Meanwhile, Ji Qingxuan listened closely to every word, a

          situation, but it looked like that hadn&#8217;t happened. Gu Changge
          had been polite and mild-mannered without displaying any arrogance,
          which somehow made his initial dislike for the man disappear. He had
          intuitively decided at first, that these highborn young prodigies were
          egoistic and proud. It had caused him to dislike them. After all, he
          hadn&#8217;t been born into a good family and had run into many

          rumours about Gu Changge from when the latter was in the Celestial
          Ancient Continent and Skyward Schloss, and some of his behaviour
          couldn&#8217;t be called humble. That meant they weren&#8217;t

          >&#8220;Old Xuan, have you seen Ji Qingxuan?&#8221; He had no choice
          but to summon his guardian. The Supreme Cave Heaven had sent guardians
          with them in fear that something bad might happen. These guardians
          were in a faraway space most of the time, only appearing when they
          sensed that the disciples were in danger. After all, no one wanted
          their privacy invaded.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No.&#8221; Old Xuan&#8217;s voice uttered into his ear, making
          his expression darken further.
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Hmm? Is that Ji Qingxuan?] Wang Xiao&#8217;s gaze became shocked as
          he spotted a familiar figure disappear into a mansion by the street.
          He remembered that she hadn&#8217;t been wearing those clothes when
          she left. [Did she find someplace to change her outfit?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Why is she so secretive? Who is she meeting? She has a suspicious
          expression on her face when they mention the Successor of the Immortal
          Gu Family, so does that mean she has met him before? But isn&#8217;t
          the Successor of the Immortal Gu Family in the opposite
          direction?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He felt suspicious about everything and his fists clenched. [Had she
          gotten to know someone without my knowledge? She hadn&#8217;t left the
          Cave Heaven before this, though.]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If I head there recklessly, she would notice me. I should see
          who she&#8217;s meeting first.&#8221; Making a decision, he appeared
          inside a tower with a dark expression. He could see the mansion she
          had entered from here perfectly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Currently, within that mansion, Su Qingge was looking at the woman
          before her with fascination and confusion. She then spoke.
          &#8220;It&#8217;s you.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s you,&#8221; the woman opposite her, who was Ji
          Qingxuan, replied with the same words. Her voice was calm but her mind
          was overwhelmed. She hadn&#8217;t expected her older sister, who lived
          in the Lower Realm, to appear before her like this. It was too
          surprising. She had heard her mother talk about a sister she had in
          the Lower Realm, who was a year older than her.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She now knew what that strange feeling was, as it had led her to this
          place. She muttered quietly, &#8220;I was wondering what that feeling
          was…&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I think that feeling you had is the same as mine. Should I
          call you my little sister or…&#8221; Su Qingge smiled, her expression
          open and neutral. At a closer glance, the girl before her held a 70%
          resemblance to herself, in terms of height and looks. With some clever
          disguises, even the most familiar person wouldn&#8217;t be able to
          tell them apart. It was like there was another one of her standing
          there, with a strange link between them. She just wasn&#8217;t sure if
          the girl also had two Souls inside her body.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Sister, my name is Ji Qingxuan. I know your name is Su Qingge,
          Mother told me before.&#8221; Ji Qingxuan took the initiative and
          introduced herself in a cool manner. The way she spoke was no
          different from how Su Qingge did. No one would suspect anything if
          they were claimed to be twins.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Ji Qingxuan. What a pretty name. How&#8217;s Mother?&#8221; Su
          Qingge asked after some silence. Her mother had always been her
          Achilles&#8217; heel and held a special meaning for her, although she
          had no memory of her mother.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;She misses you. She&#8217;s never left our home all these
          years because she had gone against the family prohibitions. Except for
          me, only my uncle has gone to visit her . Her escaping her arranged
          marriage had been a family embarrassment,&#8221; she explained
          neutrally. &#8220;She was already pregnant with me when she was taken
          back to our family. I would&#8217;ve been aborted if she hadn&#8217;t
          pleaded them.&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her voice was unruffled as she continued like it did not concern her.
          &#8220;I showed great potential after my birth, which made them
          finally pay attention.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Your life must have been hard.&#8221; Su Qingge felt a little
          moved by the story, knowing that her life hadn&#8217;t been easy
          despite living in the Upper Realm. Since she didn&#8217;t have a
          father and her mother had made a mistake, which resulted in house
          arrest, the things she had to go through were far worse than anyone
          her age. She might have been born in the Lower Realm, but her father
          was the Archbishop of the Supreme Stygian Holy Land, who had always
          given her the best life he could.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What about you, Qingge? How did you come to the Upper Realm?
          It may be extremely hard for someone of your level of cultivation to
          do that,&#8221; Ji Qingxuan asked curiously.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I was just lucky enough to meet the Young Master…&#8221; Su
          Qingge smiled, not concealing that fact.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master? Does that mean…&#8221; Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s
          murderous aura increased and she looked cold with anger. She knew that
          some attractive women from the Lower Realm were often taken up to the
          Upper Realm by cultivators with border-shattering artifacts, and ended
          up becoming sold as slaves at a large auctions. Her sister&#8217;s
          beauty would be considered ethereal even in the Upper Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;ve misunderstood,&#8221; Su Qingge elaborated
          further. &#8220;I was really lucky, as I encountered Young Master Gu
          in the Supreme Stygian Holy Land when he was searching for something
          in the Lower Realm…&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You know him, Qingge?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan looked surprised, not
          expecting it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Su Qingge explained the entire situation,
          excluding some unimportant details as well as the fact that she had
          become the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I envy you, Qingge. Your life seems great.&#8221; Ji
          Qingxuan&#8217;s gaze was envious. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always lived for
          my family, doing everything for their attention so I could eventually
          save my mother.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh…&#8221; Su Qingge looked at her slightly
          sympathetically.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I want a life like yours too.&#8221; Ji Qingxuan sounded
          dejected.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge was stunned, her gaze dimming. What can she do as the older
          sister? Fight against Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s family and save her mother?
          She couldn&#8217;t do that at her current cultivation level.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Qingxuan. I will be here during this time. Why don&#8217;t we
          do this: you can pretend to be me for a while and do what you want
          without considering the consequences, while I can pretend to be you.
          We look alike anyway and no one can tell the difference. As long as we
          don&#8217;t show our cultivation level, it should be fine.&#8221; She
          thought of an idea and suggested it to Ji Qingxuan. This was the only
          way she could allow her younger sister to feel free.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Is that fine? What if we get exposed?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan froze
          as if not expecting that suggestion, then shook her head.
          &#8220;No.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes, we can. You just need to make sure that Young Master
          doesn&#8217;t notice anything suspicious. He&#8217;s extremely smart
          and nothing gets past him. I will tell you anything that you need to
          know. You can leave at any time and no one will blame you.&#8221; Su
          Qingge smiled resignedly.</span

          an intriguing look in her eyes, before agreeing.</span

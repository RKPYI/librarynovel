          Purple Mansion…” There was a faint smile on Gu Changge’s face as he
          descended, heading towards the vast mountain range before him. When he
          fought against Qin Wuya, he left behind an aura on Qin Wuya.
          Naturally, it wasn’t a rune nor a mark, otherwise it would have been
          discovered too easily by Qin Wuya.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          find Qin Wuya’s whereabouts. Qin Wuya thought he was one step ahead
          but Gu Changge was actually ten steps ahead of him.</span

          days; he was just too lazy to chase him down. Doing so before killing
          Sky King Zhi Yang would only alert the snakes in the grass.

          Zhi Yang. After all, that man was someone who reincarnated from that
          Forbidden Epoch. He was extremely intelligent, and possessed the
          extremely rare Chaos Dao Bone. In fact, if Purple Mansion intends to
          rise up, Sky King Zhi Yang was indispensable to them.</span

          >Although the Purple Mansion was known as an Immortal Sect, since
          their creation, they had not produced a single Immortal. They still
          possessed an unfathomable foundation that would shock the world.
          However, with not a single Immortal, they were still lacking. Thus,
          from Sky King Zhi Yang, they saw the hope that an Immortal could be
          produced, which would raise Purple Mansion up to the next level.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, even knowing they would offend numerous forces, Purple Mansion
          would still choose to protect Zhi Yang and did not hesitate to place
          the current Purple Mansion Sect Master under house arrest. From these
          actions, Zhi Yang’s importance to the Purple Mansion was obvious.

          on opposing me, I can just leave it to the Immortal Gu Family. Well,
          if all else fails, I still have my own guardian, who is tasked to
          protect me. It’s just that I have been using my taboo Demonic Arts,
          and couldn’t let others find out about it, so I made her stay back in
          the Gu Family. But, I can still call on her when needed.]

          such titles are all forces with long histories. However, the hidden
          powers amongst them differed greatly. They either truly had the
          strength of an Immortal or they were weaker than an Immortal.
          Nonetheless, there is a huge difference between the two, one which is
          extremely hard to describe.]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >During this period of time, Gu Changge had consulted with many
          ancient books, trying to make sense of the fuzzy memories he recalled.
          Thus, he has a better understanding of the different time
          periods.</span

          marker, in other words, the Forbidden Epoch was a marker. Before that,
          it was the Immortal epoch. Before this epoch, there were real,
          unfettered Immortals roaming about freely. It had to be said that the
          Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being and the Ancient Celestial Races
          had stemmed from this era. However, buried in the long flow of time
          after the Forbidden Epoch.

          off at the root. Since it could not even be recorded on paper, it did
          not exist in the world. That was up till the present. In fact, if
          there were thoughts of the Forbidden Epoch, the desire to uncover what
          happened back then, there would be unknown consequences.</span

          Forbidden Epoch. The Buddha wept over the death of the Immortals, that
          the Heavenly Way was damaged and everyone was unable to reach
          Immortality. Thus, if the Heavenly way was no repaired, it was
          impossible for someone to become an Immortal.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          the Forbidden Epoch, the True Immortals in this world, for some
          reasons, must have gone to another world. It was similar to the
          ascension that he knew of in his past life.

          World. From what he knew, the Immortal Gu Family was actually deeply
          related to that world. After all, the creation of the Immortal Gu
          Family was even before the Immortal Epoch.

          they wouldn’t stay here for long. After all, forces which could claim
          the label as Immortal Sects or Immortal Families, hardly had any
          traces of the inheritances those True Immortals left behind.

          young prodigies passing through, there are no other movements.”
          Afterward, the two people exchanged greetings, with an appearance as
          if they haven’t seen each other in ages. They inquired about each

          out of sight. Her icy eyes stared at the two people’s movements, not
          missing a single word of their conversation. However, soon after, she
          furrowed her brows, seeming to discover that something was amiss. As
          the two people talked, they often brought up Gu Changge. Eight out of
          ten sentences they said, Gu Changge’s name would be mentioned.

          sake, as if to tell her Gu Changge and the Successor of Demonic Arts

          countless lives, for what seemed to be eternity, it had four palaces
          which took control of each of the four directions. Namely the Eastern
          Palace, Southern Palace, Northern Palace and Western Palace. In
          addition to the Master Immortal, there were also four Sovereign

          Palace. It would deduce the fate and direction of the Heavenly Path,
          and trek through the River of Time. The High Priestess of Destiny,
          from the Sanctum of Destiny, was the one who had such a physique at

          result. Although the High Priestess of Destiny was mysterious, she
          most likely also fell in response to the calamity, and ended up
          reincarnating.</span

          >&#8220;Young Master Gu, I don&#8217;t know how to thank you for
          helping me like this…&#8221; She couldn&#8217;t continue her words
          after that, as she was at a loss of how she could thank him. Thus, her
          thoughts started to wander. [Do we have to do it like the olden days?
          When a man and a woman would get married to express their gratitude.
          But… but… do I even meet his standard to get wedded to him?]</span

          >&#8220;If you are thinking of marriage, you can scratch the idea of
          thanking me.&#8221; Seemingly seeing through her thoughts, Gu Changge
          smiled and waved her off as he joked. &#8220;Perhaps I feel that you
          and I are destined to meet. The techniques and resources are just
          insignificant things to me. They are not worth
          mentioning.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;&#8230; Thank you, Young Master Gu,&#8221; she said before
          falling silent. Xiao Ruoyin looked red from embarrassment as she
          lifted her gaze to look at him. After all, even a fool would know the
          importance of cultivation techniques and resources in this world. Even
          so, when she considered Gu Changge’s status, those things might really
          be of no importance to him. In significant to the point he was willing
          to help her without asking for something in return.</span

          >&#8220;En! En&#8221; She bobbed her head like a chicken, her heart
          already filled with joy and relief. She didn&#8217;t think there would
          come a day she would realise her dream of embarking on the Path of C

          physique. Of course, he already knew that she could cultivate before
          doing all that. After all, she had the Nihility Destiny

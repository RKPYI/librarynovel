        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the courtyard, bamboo crackled upon a gentle breeze. The atmosphere was
                rather tranquil.</span><span id="more-28827"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so? Why do I still feel that Chu Hao is still persistently
                wishing for my death? Am I overthinking, or is Chu Hao being overconfident? If I were to allow you the
                time, how many days do you need? Or do I need to deal with this myself? I honestly abhor troublesome
                matters, but Chu Hao seems interested in continuing to trouble me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the table, Gu Changge, whose eyes were emotionless, was gently blowing
                the steam off his tea as he leisurely asked. He spoke so casually as if he wasn&#8217;t at all
                bothered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ji Qingxuan’s crystal-like eyes seem to reveal astonishment, as
                she was serving Gu Changge. She was obediently massaging his back, seemingly used to her role as his
                maid. In her eyes, given Gu Changge&#8217;s identity, there was no way he would be troubled by Chu Hao,
                and the reason he said those things was because he merely felt discomforted by a bug that was trying to
                get on his back.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, please allow me some more time. I only need at max, half a
                month. I&#8217;ll make sure Chu Hao understands everything and give up on his quest for revenge. I beg
                your forgiveness for his obtrusive ignorance. Please do not take it to heart.&#8221; Tang Wan&#8217;s
                voice was shaky and her eyes were filled with dread. She was obviously overwhelmed by fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from Gu Changge&#8217;s words, he seemed to be intending to go after
                Chu Hao. Tang Wan didn&#8217;t dare to even imagine how Chu Hao could survive if that happens.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, no matter how hard she tries to convince Chu Hao, he would
                remain confident that he could make Gu Changge pay. Thus, he would always ignore Tang Wan&#8217;s
                numerous warnings.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that mindset, Chu Hao indeed came up with quite a number of strategies,
                but each of them were stupid to Tang Wan. as they wouldn&#8217;t affect Gu Changge in the
                slightest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, Chu Hao was merely a small prince, from a puny kingdom
                called the Vermilion Bird Empire. To the massive Immortal Gu Family, the entirety of the Vermilion Bird
                Empire was closer to a fragile ant than an actual force.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, she couldn&#8217;t help but wonder, [Given such an enormous
                disparity, does Hao’er still think he stands a chance? And now, I can&#8217;t even consciously lend him
                a hand. When will he finally realise this?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tang Wan was deeply disappointed by Chu Hao. She had been racking her brain
                to save him. Yet, not only did he disregard her efforts, but he was even digging his grave
                deeper.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge genuinely plans to annihilate the Vermilion Bird Empire, it
                would only be a matter of an order. He wouldn&#8217;t even need to do it himself as the various forces
                that were trying to please him, would be more than happy to do it in his stead. Even with Supreme Cave
                Heaven shielding Chu Hao, he would only end up facing the same fate as Purple Mansion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nevermind. You may stop worrying about Chu Hao. I have another task
                for you.&#8221; Then, Gu Changge cut in and faintly continued, &#8220;Recently, someone named Qin Wuya
                may come looking for you. By then, do not panic no matter what, and all you need to do is follow my
                instructions.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Qin Wuya…&#8221; Tang Wan was taken aback. For some reason, the name
                felt awfully familiar to her, as if she heard it somewhere before.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s Senior? One of Master&#8217;s
                enemies?&#8221; All of a sudden, she came to remember him and her face changed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when she heard Qin Wuya&#8217;s name, she felt as though the name was
                very close to her heart. However, she couldn&#8217;t figure out why Gu Changge would say that Qin Wuya
                would be coming for her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Indeed. Since you were his Dao Partner in your previous lives, he will
                surely want to reunite with you after knowing about your existence.&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at Tang
                Wan and causally replied.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dao Partners in our previous lives?&#8221; Hearing that, Tang Wan
                suddenly gasped, widening her eyes as her face paled.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late, hazy visions would ambiguously pop up in her mind. These visions
                included a scenario that took place at an ancient, spectacular gate from a distant past. Everything was
                different. Vast wonders existed amid grand, magnificent Mystic Mountains, and such enormity was
                incomparable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In those visions, she had a benign, dignified father, who was the Sect
                Master. She also had a mature Eldest Senior Brother as her Dao Partner. In addition, she had a Junior
                Brother and a Junior Sister, who wished to restore the prosperity of their Sect.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Tang Wan would convince herself that these visions were merely a
                dream, she couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether reincarnation existed in this world. When she heard
                what Gu Changge said, she was thoroughly stupefied, as if a giant bell was struck, ringing violently in
                her mind.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was baffled as to how Gu Changge knew about all this, and was so
                confident that Qin Wuya was unquestionably her Dao Partner from her previous life. She was shocked till
                she became muted, unable to believe this. She then pondered what kind of being Gu Changge was, to know
                of such matters.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Ji Qingxuan, who heard the conversation, was also shocked.
                Even so, her face remained unchanged as she pretended not to have heard anything. Though, in her heart,
                Gu Changge had become even more enigmatic than ever, given how he was so knowledgeable about
                reincarnation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, how do you know all this?&#8221; Regardless, Tang Wan, having
                been trained in the Alliance of Thousand Merchants, and gone through all sorts of hardship. Thus, she
                quickly calmed down and asked. Even so, her voice was still filled with fear, which she was reluctant to
                admit.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glancing at her, Gu Changge shook his head without revealing much. &#8220;You
                don&#8217;t have to know that. Just remember what I assigned you to do.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Master.&#8221; Tang Wan nodded as her heart was filled with
                sorrow. Recalling another identity of Gu Changge, the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme
                Being, she was no longer as puzzled by how familiar he was with the Dao of Reincarnation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, she couldn&#8217;t fathom why all the men that were related to
                her would eventually end up opposing Gu Changge. Both Chu Hao and the man named Qin Wuya, who was
                claimed to be her Dao Partner in her previous life. In the end, she would have to deal with them
                personally, and that feeling devastated her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Return to the Vermilion Bird Empire for now. I&#8217;ll summon you if
                anything else arises,&#8221; Gu Changge casually ordered. Despite knowing what Tang Wan was thinking, he
                wasn&#8217;t bothered by it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As you wish, Master.&#8221; Tang Wan was in despair as she lowered her
                head.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Tang Wan left, Gu Changge waved to dismiss Ji Qingxuan before staring
                at the piece of paper in his hand with a pondering look.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m sure Purple Mansion won&#8217;t give up on Sky King Zhi Yang, even
                now. Despite being sieged by numerous forces, they would certainly send formidable experts to come and
                rescue him. If Supreme Cave Heaven is tactful, they would know what to do; if they aren&#8217;t,
                I&#8217;ll have to get involved…] Gu Changge muttered to himself as his eyes became more
                profound.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, Gu Changge began ordering his followers to imprison those
                from Purple Mansion in the Vermilion Bird Empire. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was planning to wreak some havoc. He wanted to stir up conflict between
                Supreme cave Heaven and Purple Mansion, which would certainly save him some energy. Even if he failed to
                do so, the Vermilion Bird Empire would still fall as a casualty from collateral damage between the two
                behemoths.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge was targeting the Vermilion Bird Empire solely because of
                Chu Hao, him doing so without a good reason would only place him under scrutinising light. Besides,
                given the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s flaunting of power, his rampancy would only intimidate the rest of
                the world, instilling unintended ideas in their minds. Thus, upon thorough contemplation, he decided to
                kill with a borrowed sword.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Chu Hao, Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t quite interested in him for the time
                being since Chu Hao&#8217;s identity was completely inferior to that of Sky King Zhi Yang. Also, Gu
                Changge could take all the time he wanted to torment Chu Hao since the latter, as a Fortuitous One,
                would prove much more useful than Sky King Zhi Yang.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, harvesting a leek that had yet to fully grow would only be a
                waste. Furthermore, leeks were so hard to find. Now that he found two, Chu Hao and Qin Wuya, he wanted
                to carefully harvest them to get the best yield. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My plans would go much smoother if the Vermillion Bird Empire and the
                enraged Purple Mansion collapses at the same time. By then, I&#8217;ll only have to feign remorse and
                claim that I never expected Purple Mansion to be this conniving.] Thinking that, Gu Changge
                subconsciously chuckled before heading to the Vermilion Empire.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, the Black Tortoise Emperor and his men, who were closely
                observing Gu Changge&#8217;s every move, revealed a long lost smile, tempted to throw a major
                celebration with the people of the empire.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having feared that they might be dragged into the battle between Gu Changge
                and Purple Mansion, those in the Black Tortoise Empire were immediately relieved. Now that Gu Changge
                was absent from the Black Tortoise Empire, it was now a remarkably safer place as its people no longer
                needed to live in fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uncle Master, did Wan’er go to see Gu Changge after she left?&#8221;
                Meanwhile, in the Capital of the Black Tortoise Empire, in an extravagant manor, in which two
                individuals were in a discussion. The stunning, muscular man with an extraordinary aura who asked the
                question was none other than Chu Hao, and the Elder with a white beard before him was his Uncle-Master,
                Bai Yang.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since the two departed from Vermilion Bird Empire, they had been tailing
                Tang Wan as Chu Hao was anxious to know the purpose of her meeting with Gu Changge. He was abysmally
                distressed, given that he was unable to get to the bottom of the matter. In fact, he couldn&#8217;t even
                meditate in peace while he cultivated due to the tainted thoughts in his mind.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wan’er will never betray me. She must have her reason. She must be
                threatened by Gu Changge!&#8221; Chu Hao furiously muttered, as if his heart was pricked by
                thorns.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever the thought of Tang Wan secretly meeting Gu Changge behind his back
                arose in his mind, he would be vexed and frustrated. This was despite knowing that given Tang
                Wan&#8217;s personality, she would never betray him. However, to be fair, any man would reach the limit
                of their patience if they were to face such a problem. Yet, he could only forgive Tang Wan and pretend
                as if he wasn&#8217;t affected by it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Bai Yang was also visibly upset. With a frown, he heaved a sigh
                and said, &#8220;If Tang Wan doesn&#8217;t change course, she must be going to see Gu Changge.
                He&#8217;s currently staying in that palace right there.&#8221; He glanced at Chu Hao with a sympathetic
                look, and he couldn&#8217;t think of anything to say to comfort him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did you not follow her, Uncle Master?&#8221; Although Chu Hao already
                had his guesses, listening to his Uncle Master’s answer left him even more perturbed. He even took deep
                breaths in order to desperately control his emotions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right now, Gu Changge is being guarded by a mysterious being in the
                Nirvana Realm. If I were to proceed rashly, that mighty expert would take it the wrong way and see me as
                an ally of Purple Mansion who came to assassinate him,&#8221; Bai Yang clarified with a fearful
                face.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, he was rather knowledgeable about that deceased Sacred
                Emperor Realm Master Purple Mansion had sent to rescue Sky King Zhi Yang. Although he was more powerful
                than that old man, the disparity was hardly discernible. Therefore, if he were to bump into that
                mysterious, formidable expert in the Nirvana Realm, he would only be walking into his death.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uncle Master, that had not crossed my mind. I have been
                negligent.&#8221; Hearing that, Chu Hao clenched his fists as reluctance surged in his heart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since he was a child, cultivating had always gone smoothly, and he would
                encounter significantly more opportunities than adversities. He was only a few hundred years old and he
                already reached the Peak Sacred King Realm. His future was bright, and as long as he remained
                unwavering, he would sooner or later become the most powerful figure in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, he was gravely impacted by Gu Changge, and even his Uncle Master, who
                was in the Sacred Emperor Realm, was unable to contain Gu Changge, not daring to investigate the matter
                by himself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hao’er, don&#8217;t need to worry. After she is done meeting with Gu
                Changge, she will eventually come back out. What happens in between is nothing worth mentioning.
                I&#8217;m sure nothing will happen between the two of them. Besides, Tang Wan&#8217;s aura is as pure as
                ever. Her body remains unsullied.&#8221; Seeing Chu Hao&#8217;s miserable expression, Bai Yang
                couldn&#8217;t help but feel worried yet helpless. He patted Chu Hao&#8217;s shoulder, fearing his great
                potential would be ruined this way. Hence, he decided to convince him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know. Rest assured, Uncle Master, I&#8217;m aware of it.&#8221;
                Having calmed down at that moment, Chu Hao knew blaming Tang Wan wasn&#8217;t the right move.
                Regardless, he must put an end to the matter as Gu Changge&#8217;s rampancy might one day lead to him
                overstepping boundaries, and Tang Wan, as a fragile lady, wouldn&#8217;t be able to defend
                herself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, Chu Hao&#8217;s face changed when he sensed that a message
                from the Vermilion Bird Empire was sent to his Communication Rune in his storage ring. Typically, the
                Vermilion Bird Emperor wouldn&#8217;t contact him if nothing major happened.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Bai Yang noticed the dramatic change on Chu
                Hao&#8217;s face and inquired.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Vermilion Bird Empire is in trouble… D*mn! Gu Changge and I
                can&#8217;t coexist in this world!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, Chu Hao took out his Communication Rune and speedily checked
                through the messages he received, only to find himself dumbfounded. His face grew gloomier as he spoke
                those abhorrence-filled words through gritted teeth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uncle Master, we must return to the Vermilion Bird Empire at
                once!&#8221; After he spoke, he immediately moved. [To think Gu Changge would still mess with the
                Vermilion Bird Empire while on the brink of war with Purple Mansion… How despicable!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me…&#8221; Bai Yang&#8217;s face slightly changed as
                he realised the direness of the matter after making a rough guess. Intuitively, he felt a chilly
                sensation all over his body when he thought of Gu Changge&#8217;s methods.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right when Chu Hao was discussing his plans against Gu Changge, the latter
                had already made his first move. Worse, his execution was terrifying and swift. Not to mention,
                spine-chilling and vicious.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late, the attention of the entire Upper Realm was amassed on the
                territory of Purple Mansion. After all, this was a battle that not a single cultivator would miss. Even
                the ever aloof Buddhist Mountain and Mortal Palace were closely following up on it. After all, since the
                dawn of time, occurrences of Immortal Wars and Everlasting Tragedies were few and far in between. Thus,
                everyone’s blood was rapidly pumping as their hearts palpitated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vast military forces on ancient battleships from various forces, such as Sky
                Emperor Mountain and the Ancient Ye Family, aggressively charged with the intention to take down the
                Successor of Demonic Arts as well as to eliminate anything related to Sky King Zhi Yang.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the attackers, if they were to successfully bring Purple Mansion to ruin,
                they could split the rewards among themselves. After all, having stood for innumerable millenia, Purple
                Mansion had accumulated an infinite amount of resources and secrets.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the eyes of those participating in the war, Purple Mansion must be
                banished, and there was no other way around it. The commotion this great war caused was definitely
                alarming, as even stars in the distant sky were quivering. Such a scene was simply
                unimaginable.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To the fall of Purple Mansion!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of millions was overwhelming. The seas were grew chaotic as
                their hostility and murderous intent engulfed the entire world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless spectating forces were horrified, hiding in their territories and
                dared not to make a sound. They could only watch as the various factions pass by in the sky, so numerous
                that they covered the sky. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The army of millions marched forth menacingly, as if they were a sharp godly
                weapon formed by the might of heaven, capable of tearing everything apart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in Purple Mansion, disciples and Elders, all wore solemn faces.
                activated all sorts of divine abilities. Godly beams shot through the skies as protective arrays and
                barriers were erected. Vibrant lights shot through the clouds, intertwining in the sky before
                coagulating into an enormous net to fend off the attackers.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the number of attackers was too tremendous. The aura elites just
                from the Ancient Immortal Races alone, sent by Sky Emperor Mountain, were as dense as the thickest
                clouds. The siege from this force alone could turn the world inside out. A rare sight to behold.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another direction, those present could only feel a shocking, overbearing
                pressure in the sky as giant stars trembled, leaving the universe quaking and twisting. Battle cries
                could be heard thundering from there, startling the surrounding forces. Evidently, a horrifying war, a
                battle between those in the Sacred Emperor Realm, was taking place over there.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One after another, peerless Dharma Bodies were summoned, with Purple Qi
                wafting around them. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavenly mists were drifting all over the sky as experts were fighting
                against each other, as if they were standing on top of the universe.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vague blinding cauldron could be seen floating in the air, as well as a
                glaring bell and an azure seal. These were all Sacred Emperor Grade artifacts, and in the instant they
                were summoned, Principles of the world were turned hazy, as stars exploded and instantaneously
                disintegrated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who saw that were completely taken aback.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who knew Purple Mansion was this powerful… They can even block off the
                combined attacks of Sky Emperor and the Ancient Ye Family…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To think they&#8217;ve been hiding such strength… Though, that Sacred
                Emperor must have come out from their Ancestral Land. His aura is too ancient to be from this
                era.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attentively observing, formidable cultivators from different factions were
                stupefied as their expectation of witnessing a one-sided battle was shattered. The true strength of
                Purple Mansion completely exceeded anyone&#8217;s imagination, and it was at that moment cultivators
                realised that Purple Mansion didn&#8217;t welcome the war unprepared.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of nowhere, in the starry sky far away, booming noises were released.
                Those who heard it trembled. Just the sound alone was so powerful that it felt as if their souls were
                getting ripped apart. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an ancient banner was waving, tearing everything apart. It was attached to
                a domain-breaking battleship, the size of a colossal ancient continent, which shadow seemed to be
                endless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its arrival, the sky opened up and Chaos Energy gushed out of it, as the
                battleship crashed into everything before it. It had completely dominated the sky. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that one instant, one gigantic word stood out, wavering in the sky. It was
                the word ‘Gu!’ </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, right in front of that domain-breaking battleship was the very
                territory of Purple Mansion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Immortal Gu Family has arrived! Purple Mansion&#8217;s had run out
                of time! They may be able to take on the combined attacks of several forces, but will they be able to
                withstand the Immortal Gu Family?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems Purple Mansion is really done for now!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was dumbfounded as they watched the army of millions arrive. They
                could see no end to the attackers, as their presence covered the skies and the stars. Such unrivalled
                power was surely to intimidate anyone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For the fall of Purple Mansion! All hail the might of the Immortal Gu
                Family!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Elder on the ancient battleship blew his horn, sending a frightening
                shockwave in the direction he was facing.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The massive army immediately joined the battle. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, from the depths of the starry sky, bright runes filled the
                sky, causing it to tremble. The runes formed a divine sword above the ancient battleship before it was
                thrusted down. This attack caused the air around it to tremble. Even space itself got torn apart as it
                the divine sword pierced through.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the arrays shielding Purple Mansion almost broke down, barely able
                to hold on.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, those who were observing the war from afar felt a chill down
                their spines. [That was only one blow! Will Purple Mansion be able to take more of it?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* At the very next moment, the Sacred Emperor Realm Masters from the
                Immortal Gu Family took the initiative to attack. As they raised their hands, the might of the Sacred
                Emperor Realm arose, covering the world and causing stars to tremble.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge!&#8221; In retaliation, three more in the Sacred Emperor Realm
                appeared from Purple Mansion. Their auras were superior to those Sacred Emperor Realm Masters from Sky
                Emperor Mountain and the other forces.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Immortal Gu Family is insufferable! Working with Gu Changge to
                seize the legacies of Purple Mansion and subdue our future Successor! Such sacrilege shall not be
                forgiven! The legacies of Purple Mansion are for us to protect and none shall take even one glimpse at
                them!&#8221; The three Sacred Emperor Realm Masters soared to the skies with their grudge-filled stone
                cold faces as they roared.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you really think the three of you alone are suited to offend the
                Immortal Gu Family!? You know very well your deaths are inevitable, yet you dare come to stop us! We
                praise you for your valour, so we shall grant you your wish and send you to the gods with your loved
                ones! That shall be your eternal reward!&#8221; Simultaneously, a terrifying aura swirled amid the
                military forces of the Immortal Gu Family. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavenly beams dispersed everywhere. Ten experts in the Sacred Emperor Realm
                had appeared, encircling the sky. Their faces were concealed, yet their might remained overwhelming as
                their tone was overflowing with coldness and domineering.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant these ten showed themselves, their auras almost broke the sky, as
                they were set on slaughtering the three from Purple Mansion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, dread filled the hearts of those observing. Prior to this, they
                had detected that the Immortal Gu Family had sent ten experts in the Sacred Emperor Realm. However, many
                of them thought that given the number, there were most likely a few to be only in the Sacred King Realm,
                hiding in the group.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, when they saw all ten appear, they were greatly taken aback. All
                ten were in the Peak Sacred Emperor Realm! Not one was in the Early or Intermediate Stage of the Sacred
                Emperor Realm!</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was known that there were Nine Minor Realms in the Sacred Emperor Realm.
                Those who attained the Seventh-Order would be referred to as High Rank Sacred Emperor Realm Masters.
                Such powerful individuals could kill just by exposing their aura. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No way…&#8221; Countless disciples and Elders of Purple Mansion were
                devastated by the sight. Dejection, resentment and rage overloaded their hearts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thump!* </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, a horrid battle broke out, causing everyone’s soul to
                tremble.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, the three from Purple Mansion remained resolute. They kept charging
                forward fearlessly, displaying the most powerful abilities they could.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid explosions of stars and blaring noises, everything before them
                collapsed. It was as though the sky shattered while the ground quaked upon the raging chaos. A powerful
                attack, which could not be resisted, then fell.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the very next moment, the three in the Sacred Emperor Realm
                instantaneously burst out blood as their bodies exploded and turned into dust.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opposing ten Sacred Emperors drew their hands. Their eyes were filled
                with disdain. After all, unless someone in the Nirvana Realm was to get involved, they were basically
                peerless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, the various forces were thoroughly stunned as they felt
                goosebumps all over their bodies. The overbearing might of the Immortal Gu Family had been shown. They
                had easily obliterated Purple Mansion forces without even needing the assistance of others.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, with the Immortal Gu Family alone, the war was already one-sided.
            </span></p>

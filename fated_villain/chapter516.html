          Yang&#8217;s side—Gu Wudi. Since the pawn had been planted for so
          long, he figured it was time for it to flaunt its function.</span

          his eyes and ordered the other members of the Gu Family to spread the

          especially after the Blood Dragon War God Clan was annihilated by him
          and the army he led. As such, the remaining clans had only two
          choices—to submit as slaves of the Upper Realm for the rest of their
          lives, or to be obliterated by the Upper Realm.</span

          for no further bloodbath in order to restore peace to both Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains and the Upper Realm. And so, he could
          invite eminent leaders of each noteworthy clan across the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains to a conference.</span

          the latter was the pride of the Nine Great Mountains, he could easily
          win over the hearts of the people of Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains.</span

          Changge revealed a faint grin.

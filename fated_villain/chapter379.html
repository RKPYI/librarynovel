        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The look on Pu Du&#8217;s face became an unnatural one when he heard Jiang
                Chen&#8217;s words. The Jiang Luoshen that Jiang Chen was talking about was the princess of the Godly
                Illusion Clan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he took Jiang Chen to find her the other day, he firmly made a
                promise that he would find the real tomb of the Godly Illusion Clan&#8217;s Ancestor, who had passed
                away.</span><span id="more-29442"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Jiang Luoshen trusted Monk Pu Du, she agreed to them, and promised to
                give them a generous reward afterwards. That was all right before the two of them set off on their
                journey here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of
                Creation, Jiang Chen quickly found a way out and broke many restrictions and arrays, which made many
                experts of the Godly Illusion Clan look at him in a different light. They now thought that he was
                considerably capable.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, an accident happened just when they thought they would find the
                tomb. As if the sky and earth collapsed, the terrifying restrictions erupted in an instant. Many Godly
                Illusion Clan Masters didn&#8217;t even have time to escape, and their bodies and souls were destroyed
                on the spot.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Jiang Luoshen, the princess of the Godly Illusion Clan, was left
                gravely injured and furious.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen was rescued by the Monk Pu Du who took him away from the
                tomb.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only after that that he realised the crowd had been looking at the
                wrong place. It was hard to distinguish between the real and fake tomb in this Godly Illusion Tomb, as
                they were mixed together.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They happened to be unlucky enough to stumble upon the fake one. And
                in that fake tomb laid many dangers which were shockingly lethal.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the princess of the Godly Illusion Clan planned to
                suppress and kill them to curb her anger. However, she agreed to give them another chance after she was
                calmed down by Pu Du&#8217;s pleas.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be difficult for both Jiang Chen and Pu Du to stay alive if
                they messed this up again. After all, the one that held a knife to their necks was the Godly Illusion
                Clan, a force alone which made many other factions feel fear.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kind Sir Jiang, whether we can survive this time depends on
                you. Please don&#8217;t let me down.&#8221; Pu Du was also worried at this moment. With his ability, he
                didn&#8217;t dare to fool and offend the Godly Illusion Clan. He wouldn&#8217;t have so willingly agreed
                if he had known it would be so troublesome.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen nodded while he communicated with the Artifact Spirit of
                the Celestial Boat of Creation in his mind. Just as Jiang Chen was talking with Pu Du, a burst of golden
                clouds rushed over in the sky.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many beings appeared. There was a few feet tall giant with arms
                covered with scales and dazzling beings with strong vitality and aura, who ressemble giant serpents that
                had feet under their bellies.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a group of terrifying beings came with the golden clouds. And on
                top of the golden clouds, there were dozens of humanoid beings who were golden from head to toe. They
                were of all genders and ages.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their appearance was similar to that of humans. However, on top of
                having handsome features and incredible strength, there were a pair of golden wings on their
                backs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four beautiful female beings with indifferent faces stood like golden
                armoured guards holding their mystical weapons.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind them was a curtain of clouds where a delicate figure sat. Even
                though it was impossible to see their face clearly, the figure was oozing with inherent regality. One
                could easily tell that the figure was a peerless beauty from this vague outline alone.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The golden cloud contained members of the Godly Illusion Clan, and
                the woman was their princess, Jiang Luoshen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Princess Luoshen,&#8221; Jiang Chen and Pudu
                immediately greeted her, their faces turning solemn.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What have you found?&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s voice rang out from behind the clouds. It was
                calm, revealing her natural born aloofness. She then looked at the two of them with a look of
                indifference.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nothing so far,&#8221; Pu Du smilingly replied. &#8220;But in
                my humble opinion, we might find other clues when we enter deeper into the tomb.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen, on the other hand, quietly stood there with his chin
                timidly lowered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Pu Du went to visit Jiang Luoshen in the mansion, he was hurt by
                the cold snort of the maid beside him just because he looked up at Jiang Luoshen. That was why he could
                only hold it in even though he was angry about it. He was merely a pathfinding tool to Master
                Cultivators like her!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t let me down. You won&#8217;t have such
                good luck this time,&#8221; Jiang Luoshen said lightly, her eyes indifferent.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pu Du couldn&#8217;t help but smile wryly. </span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwards, the Godly Illusion Clan, Jiang Chen, and Pu Du set off
                again and continued to go deeper.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh* The sky was filled with sounds of divine rainbows as more
                cultivators and forces rushed over. Many saw the Godly Illusion Clan. Even though their expressions
                changed slightly, they quickly ignored them and continued to venture deeper.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Immortal Sects and Immortal Families had also made their
                move.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sky Emperor Mountain, Buddhist Mountain, Mortal Palace, the Immortal
                Gu Family, the Immortal Wang Family, Skyward Schloss, the Ancient Ye Family, Primordial Lake and other
                weaker forces naturally wanted to get a share.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They might not be able to get a bite of that steak, but they would be
                satisfied chewing off the leftover meat from the bones.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, everyone in the Godly Illusion Clan turned
                grim.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a boy of sixteen or seventeen years old with a pair of
                golden wings and fluttering blond hair above the golden clouds. He looked rebellious. However, his face
                was sour as well at this moment as he couldn&#8217;t help but snort. &#8220;This tomb belongs to the
                Godly Illusion Clan! But now, everyone wants to claim it!? They don&#8217;t take us seriously, do they!?
                Sister! we have to teach them a lesson!&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy was Jiang Ming, and he was Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s younger
                brother. Of course, not a biological one.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Ming was from the royal family of the Godly Illusion Clan, and
                was the heir of the emperor&#8217;s sibling. Thus, they were cousins and he had a good relationship with
                Jiang Luoshen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jiang Luoshen heard those words, her sleek eyebrows pulled
                together as her face became cold. &#8220;They dare touch the place where our Ancestor got buried. They
                will regret their actions.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess, the forces involved this time shouldn&#8217;t be
                underestimated. We need to be cautious,&#8221; a blond old woman with an unfathomable cultivation level
                persuaded beside Jiang Luoshen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Luoshen nodded despite how her eyes remained cold. &#8220;I
                know, but still they need to be taught a lesson. They can&#8217;t blame us for that.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, there was a brilliance that suddenly soared to the sky
                from the depths of the tomb. Colourful divine light accompanied by bursts of sounds that resounded in
                all directions shocked everyone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All they saw was the divine light shoot up and crack the sky open
                before brilliant rosy clouds erupted while the earth split open. An endless glow emerged
                then.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faintly, everyone saw a crystal-clear palace that shone with
                brilliance floating in the air as if it was built using rainbow celestial jades. A melodious sound could
                be heard surrounding the place.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a huge commotion broke out.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone rushed over the source as if they had lost their minds. Not
                only that, they could also see all kinds of artifacts spewing out of the cracks. Swords, guns, halberds,
                axes, hooks and forks, bells, cauldron, and pagodas; there were too many to clearly see.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This aura… It is unmistakably the place where our Ancestor
                laid to rest.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Godly Illusion Clan members&#8217; faces immediately changed when they
                sensed the fluctuations and aura there. They were rushing in the direction before they could even
                process what was going on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, Jiang Chen frowned and communicated with the Artifact
                Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation in his mind. He had a feeling the fluctuation was strange.
                Dangerous, even. But before he had time to say anything, he was grabbed by Pu Du beside him who turned
                into a divine rainbow and rushed forward, seemingly fearing even a one-second of delay.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This must be the tomb of the Godly Illusion Clan Ancestor.
                This is definitely it. We are rich!&#8221; Pu Du&#8217;s eyes were greedily glowing as he
                cheered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike him, Jiang Chen was speechless. He didn&#8217;t feel like
                saying anything else.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, many had already arrived near the cracked earth. With
                Devil Mountain hanging mid-air, Ancient Battle Chariots began to descend from the sky as rickshaws
                fell.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of leaders, big figures who could be deemed as Masters
                appeared, their eyes burning as they stared at the scene.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind them were many young prodigies.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Booming between the cracks was the floating ancient crystal palace.
                It was a majestic sight to behold. Anyone could tell at a glance that the colourful divine light was
                extraordinary.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious artifacts wrapped with various divine light gushed out of it
                like rain. Seeing this, many cultivators fought over them. They knew these artifacts were out of the
                ordinary.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were even Quasi-Sacred Grade Artifacts dripping with
                Quasi-Sacred pressure that immediately turned the cultivators fighting for them into Bloodmist, their
                bodies and souls wiped out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, no one care at all. It was as if they had gone
                insane.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a ray of divine light in the eyes of a Master-level figure,
                who was solemnly observing the situation. He then took a breath and exclaimed, &#8220;This is definitely
                the tomb of the Godly Illusion Clan Ancestor. He was buried here after his death. It suddenly cracked
                open because we have triggered the Great Shi here.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His cultivation level had already reached the peak of the Sacred Lord
                Realm. Even though he wasn&#8217;t in the Sacred King Realm yet, he was only a short step
                away.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many were shocked when they heard his words. They might have guessed
                it, but it felt different having their guess confirmed. But even more were excited about it. After all,
                this was the tomb of the Godly Illusion Clan Ancestor! That man was someone who had surpassed the Sacred
                Emperor Realm! He might even reach the Nirvana Realm and become a True Daoist!</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was hard to imagine how many burial treasures had been buried in
                this tomb. The artifacts scattered in front of them were the best evidence.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An old man with a hunched waist soon appeared in the
                mountains.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding a compass in his hand, he looked at the palace carefully, and
                said fearfully, &#8220;Even though that Ancestor has been buried, this place is extremely dangerous.
                There are many arrays hidden in the palace. Once touched, and even a Sacred Realm Master cannot
                escape.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a huge uproar among the crowd as soon as those words were
                uttered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many young prodigies&#8217; complexions changed, and they took a few
                steps back in fear. The opportunities here clearly no longer belonged to them.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Master-level figures often destroyed the world when they
                fought, and the aftermath alone was enough to kill them countless times.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal Gu Family had also sent a lot of experts with high
                cultivation levels here. They were currently conversing in hushed voices amongst themselves, as they
                planned to share a piece of the pie.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The younger generation of the Immortal Gu Family also had dazzling
                young prodigies rushing in, their aura and vitality astonishing, and their eyes looked confident and
                calm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many experts of the different forces who noticed them, couldn&#8217;t
                help but show the unnatural and apprehensive expressions on their faces.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as everyone stared at the crack in the ground with different
                emotions bubbling in them, golden clouds accompanied by a loud sound lighting rumbling moved in their
                direction, and members of the Godly Illusion Clan rushed over.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few of them glanced around coldly and spoke first, &#8220;This is
                the resting place of a Godly Illusion Clan Ancestor. We hope no one disturbs the peace here, otherwise
                don&#8217;t blame us for not holding back.&#8221; At the same time, an incomparable golden power
                erupted, and the monstrous aura shattered the sky and all the surroundings.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many cultivators with weaker cultivation levels couldn&#8217;t bear the
                pressure and their complexions turned pale. Some almost collapsed to the ground as they had to force
                their aura and vitality to resist.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Luoshen, Jiang Ming and the others only looked around
                indifferently, as if they wanted to take everyone head-on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the experts of Sky Emperor Mountain, Buddhist Mountain,
                Mortal Palace, the Immortal Wang Family, Skyward Schloss, the Ancient Ye Family, Primordial Lake and
                other forces weren&#8217;t perturbed at all.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were still staring at the ancient palace in front of them as
                they waited for any unexpected development so that they could break in.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Luoshen and the others all had an abnormally cold expression on
                their faces now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How intimidating.&#8221; Jiang Chen, who came afterward, was
                also stunned by the scene in front of him. He had never seen so many experts who could easily crush him
                into pieces.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he saw Xiao Ruoyin here again. She was being protected by the
                experts of Skyward Schloss, and she didn&#8217;t notice him.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, a Godly Illusion Clan expert came forward and hissed,
                &#8220;This is the resting ground of a Godly Illusion Clan Ancestor. Are you planning to fight for
                it?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terrifying coercion of the Sacred Lord Realm swept in all
                directions, suppressing many young prodigies, and rendering them pale and breathless. At the same time,
                something appeared in his hand. It was a bright, golden token with ancient divine glyphs carved on
                it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vast and majestic aura then emerged from the token. Vaguely, many
                arrays around the tomb began to gather and interweave like stars in the sky.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is what the Godly Illusion Clan Ancestor left behind. It
                can shift all the arrays here,&#8221; gasped an ashen and frightened Sect Master, who recognised the
                item.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since ancient times, treasures and virtuous people have lived
                here. This place might be where a Godly Illusion Clan Ancestor had been laid to rest, but countless
                years have passed. Why have you never come, and are only here when the tomb has appeared here recently?
                In my humble opinion, these are things that have no owner. Everyone can take them if they are able to.
                If not, why did the Godly Illusion Clan ancestor choose to be laid to rest here?&#8221; an Elder from
                Sky Emperor Mountain chuckled. One could only predict what level his cultivation was at, with how
                ancient he was.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people immediately agreed with his words. After all, this
                wasn&#8217;t the Godly Illusion Clan&#8217;s territory now. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, chances came to those who grabbed it.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Godly Illusion Clan would have to go through the other forces if
                they wanted to keep the treasures for themselves.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jiang Luoshen finally spoke up. &#8220;What nonsense! This
                place was left by an Ancestor of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">our </span></i><span
                style="font-weight: 400;">clan. You broke in by force and disturbed the peace of our Ancestor in heaven.
                And now, you want to rob the relics left by him. Robbers!&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite her frigid voice, it sounded pleasant, like ice falling on a
                jade plate.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group of young prodigies from the Immortal Academy led by the
                King with Six Crowns, Jun Yao, was also on the hilltop not far away at this moment.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone immediately sneered when they heard those words. &#8220;How
                absurd. Could it be that the Godly Illusion Clan is planning to use its own power to fight against all
                other forces?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yue Mingkong, the Phoenix Lady, Jin Chan, Jiang Chuchu and the others
                were all here, but they were not that close to the front.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The true tomb is within the tomb. The real tomb is not this one, but
                deep underground. That’s where the Ancestor’s Divinity Crystal is.] A thoughtful look flashed across Yue
                Mingkong&#8217;s eyes then, but she didn&#8217;t say anything. She planned to find the right time to
                enter the tomb.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were just the younger generation after all, and the appearance
                of the Godly Illusion Tomb had shocked and moved the older generation. Even Sect Masters of other forces
                came. Thus, Even with their identities, it was difficult to intervene at this moment, and they could
                only wait and see from a distance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom* The frightening sound of an explosion could be
                heard.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the crack ahead, there was a sudden brilliance that shot to the
                sky. That crystal clear palace seemed to be touched.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mist of Chaos that shrouded it gradually dissipated, and many
                arrays also disappeared as they began to fall to the ground. The faces of all the big figures in front
                changed immediately. They felt that the aura in the ancient palace had weakened a lot, and it was much
                safer than before.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the majority of the crowd turned into divine rainbows
                and rushed towards it without hesitation, not bothering to continue conversing with the Godly Illusion
                Clan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, Jiang Luoshen became alarmed, and she was about to rush
                into it when Jiang Chen, who was below, felt something was off. He hurriedly warned, &#8220;Wait a
                minute, Princess Luoshen!&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Luoshen swiftly let out a displeased frown upon hearing this.
                However, thinking of the mysterious methods Jiang Chen had shown before, she huffed coldly and stopped
                in her tracks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will not forgive you if my Ancestor&#8217;s relics are taken
                away.&#8221; She peered at him, earning a bitter laugh from the man.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess Luoshen, it is just that I suddenly felt something
                was wrong. You might get hurt if you rushed in rashly.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She only glanced at him without saying anything else. However, she
                had more confidence in his words now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though there were quite a few big shots who broke into the
                ancient palace, there were still many who chose to wait and see from outside.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal Gu Family, the Immortal Wanf Family, the Ancient Ye
                Family, Sky Emperor Mountain and a few other forces were among the ones who hadn&#8217;t acted on
                impulse. Their eyes flickered with strange colours as they stared at the ancient palace.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom* There came a sudden, more intense sound from the crack in
                front. It was as if there was a dreadful river flowing in it. Immediately afterwards, a beam of light
                burst out from the crack when everyone watched on with astonished eyes.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As colourful lights reflected the sky, many wonderful artifacts,
                Sacred Herb, and jade pots gushed out of it like a volcano.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was frozen in place in that instant. However, they soon snapped back
                to reality and started to fight over the items.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the many Elders, who were calm just now, had a greedy look in
                their eyes. They could tell how precious these dazzling items were. They couldn&#8217;t possibly let an
                opportunity like this slip by.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The younger generation was even worse. Even the young prodigies of
                the Immortal Academy. They had begun to turn into divine rainbows as they fought over the
                items.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excited and anxious, the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of
                Creation in Jiang Chen&#8217;s mind was constantly urging Jiang Chen to make a move as well. &lt;Do you
                see that lavender ruined stele over there? That is definitely a great treasure! Go and get it before
                anyone else sees it!&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jiang Chen heard this, his eyes narrowed, and he immediately
                noticed the ruined stele the Artifact Spirit was talking about. Sure enough, because of the mediocre
                appearance, there was no one fighting for it at this moment.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it flew out of that crack, Jiang Chen hurriedly chased in the direction it
                was about to fall to. Fortunately, there were so many treasures in the sky that no one was looking at
                him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did he see something nice?] That unruly young man from the Godly
                Illusion Clan was also among the people vying for these treasures. He, however, had noticed Jiang Chen.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Luoshen noticed how his gaze had turned malicious, and she asked in her
                indifferent voice, &#8220;Jiang Ming, what do you want to do to him?&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Ming smiled bashfully, &#8220;Sister, that guy must have seen
                something good.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Luoshen only frowned upon hearing that.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is this lavender ruined stele about?] Jiang Chen quietly asked
                the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation without stopping as he dashed after the
                item.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don&#8217;t know, but something good must be hidden inside that
                stele. The appearance is just a disguise], the Artifact Spirit replied.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen&#8217;s gaze only turned more fiery and determined as he
                stared at the stele when he heard those words. While he watched it fall from the sky and land in a
                certain direction, he quickly landed on the ground, but the excited expression on his face soon froze as
                he came to a halt.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pair of small hands as white as jade had reached over and picked up
                the lavender ruined stele. She was wearing a wide-sleeved flowy dress with soft locks. She was beautiful
                and breath-taking. Her facial features were clear and delicate without a flaw, and her skin was as white
                and smooth as the most perfect suet jade.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a cold look on her face, her whole body exuded celestial energy.
                It was as if she could ride the wind and turn into an Immortal at any time, to go to the legendary Moon
                Palace.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you trying to do?&#8221; The girl peered at him as
                she demanded an answer. Even though she had a pleasant voice, he could feel the coldness dripping from
                it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The red, big bird on her shoulder was also staring at Jiang Chen with
                an unfriendly gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge was not surprised that Lan Yifei would agree to her terms. In the face of Forbidden Demonic Arts, even those Ancient Beings would covet it for themselves and wouldn&#8217;t stay put. Meanwhile, Lan Yifei was only a young cultivator. No matter how indifferent and confident he appeared to be, it was impossible for him to hide his ambition. It made no sense for him to hold back when the Forbidden Demonic Arts were terrifying enough to frighten the entire Upper World.</span><span id="more-34841"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the first half of the Forbidden Demonic Arts. I can pass it on to you now&#8230; and naturally, I&#8217;ll pass you the second half when the time is right. You can rest assured about this,&#8221; Su Qingge calmly told him. As she gently waved a slender arm, black light that looked like a seed fell towards Lan Yifei.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lan Yifei had a glint in his eyes when he saw this, and yet he didn&#8217;t completely believe her. He only nodded after carefully examining the seed. He was worried that Su Qingge would do something to this black seed. However, it eased him when it seemed that she was quite sincere about this and never thought of causing him harm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he closed his eyes and absorbed the black seed, his whole body trembled. Suddenly, he felt a sense of enlightenment that excited him. It felt as if he had opened the door to a new world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So who exactly is the real Successor of Demonic Arts&#8230;&#8221; Still, he asked again as he hadn&#8217;t set it aside. The true Successor of Demonic Arts was his end goal. He even had a feeling that Su Qingge herself had never possessed the complete Forbidden Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge glanced at Lan Yifei when she heard the words with somewhat disdainful eyes and stated, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;re insatiable? The scripture I gave you today should be enough. Regarding the identity of the Successor of Demonic Arts, I will let you know sooner or later.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lan Yifei didn&#8217;t continue asking after she said that. After all, he had to appear sincere. &#8220;Sure. Since you want a Source, I know just the place for you to devour one. To the east of the Ashen Immortal Star Domain is the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. Young prodigies from all walks of life go there to fight almost every day. You may be able to enter it,&#8221; Lan Yifei spoke, his eyes moving slightly. He then took out a simple commandment token with the words ‘Immortal Dao’ on it from his bosom and handed it to Su Qingge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was a general term. In actuality, there were more worlds involved than one could count. It definitely was not only a hundred of them. Some of those worlds were various Upper Realm Forces affiliated with the Lower Realm, and their territories were also vast. Many young prodigies and even supreme figures were born amongst them. The Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was such a place where young prodigies from all walks of life fought to compete for the qualification to join the Upper Realm Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one could stand out in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, not only would they be valued by the Forces in the Upper Realm, but they would also be accepted as one of their disciples immediately. They would even glorify the Family backing them by ascending to the top in one fell swoop. That was why there would always be cultivators from the Lower Realm who even crossed to the Upper Realm using the teleportation array to fight even though the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was an extremely cruel place where countless had died in it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, treasures were abundant on the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. Artifacts from Sacred Emperor Realm experts from ancient times, lost Immortal Scriptures, Emperor Runes, and Immortal cultivation techniques were among the many.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the descendants of the various Immortal Forces of the Upper Realm had met their demise there when they lost to some of the terrifying monstrosity that spawn from this place. After all, unimaginable ‘monsters’ would be born in the Lower Realm every once in a while, and they would be unstoppable as they carried the Fortuity from their entire world up to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the puzzlement on Su Qingge&#8217;s face, Lan Yifei smiled lightly and explained, &#8220;Everyone else has to be interrogated and examined by the All-Encompassing Border City if they want to enter the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, but if you bring my identity commandment token with you, no one will look into your background.&#8221; He wasn&#8217;t an idiot who would directly help Su Qingge find someone else’s Source. After all, that would definitely leave traces, and that would be bad for him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay.&#8221; After thinking for a while, Su Qingge agreed to accept the token before she promptly disappeared from the place. She knew there was definitely a divine sense left by Lan Yifei which could track her whereabouts in this token. So after leaving the courtyard, she wrapped the token with Qi and kept it in her storage ring.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was very far away from here. It would take her nearly a month to arrive even if she went through the major teleportation arrays. She wanted to be in the  Sacred Lord Realm the next time she saw Gu Changge. That way, she would at least be qualified to stand in front of Gu Changge and question him about a lot of things that had happened over the years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He will marry his fiancée Yue Mingkong in half a year.] Su Qingge took a deep breath to calm her emotions. She had heard rumours that Chan Hongyi might do something during the grand wedding. However, she didn&#8217;t know whether Chan Hongyi would be there to cause a disruption or attend the ceremony. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lan Yifei, who was in the courtyard, was not surprised when he sensed Su Qingge&#8217;s actions. It wasn&#8217;t like he had time to think much about it. For now, he only wanted to delve into half of the Forbidden Demonic Arts and put everything else on hold. That black seed contained an extremely mysterious technique which hugely related to and even subverted his imagination and understanding. However, Lan Yifei thought about on his strength, how it would greatly increase as long as he studied it thoroughly, to the point he would defeat the many overlords of the younger generation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time in the headquarters of the Nephrite Breeze Pavilion, Gu Changge asked Bai Lianer&#8217;s father, Bai Kun, and his disciple, Bai Hua, to deduce the location of the Immortal Domain. The result did not surprise him at all. Both of them suffered from heavy backlash. The blind Bai Kun almost died. If it weren&#8217;t for Gu Changge&#8217;s action at a critical moment by obscuring this Heavenly Secret for him and preventing an injury, he would definitely have died tragically on the spot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Bai Hua, he suffered less when it backfired as he had his Heaven&#8217;s Physique. However, the deduced clues were also extremely vague, and it only said that the Immortal Domain was related to a tree. He didn&#8217;t know what kind of tree it was. He soon passed out as blood trickled from his mouth and nose. Seven days had passed by the time he woke up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge guessed that the tree must be the Tree of Epoch. The Immortal Domain would only emerge when the Era Dao Fruit ripened and the convergence of the World Principles of the Upper Realm was complete. However, it wasn&#8217;t known where exactly the Immortal Domain would appear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The matter about the Immortal Domain can be put aside for the time being. Neraka and Pagado must be dealt with first.] Gu Changge thought about another thing. Before leaving the Upper Realm, he must annex and wipe out these Forces, or they would affect his subsequent plans. In the end, he thought of Bai Hua again. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[With his Heaven&#8217;s Physique, Bai Hua had the ability to spy on Heavenly Secrets. If he were to combine his ability with my Chaos Purple Scripture, we might be able to deduce something. It might just be enough to find the hiding spots of Neraka and Pagoda. Maybe even their headquarters…]</span></p>

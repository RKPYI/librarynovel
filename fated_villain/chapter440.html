          their men hide in preparation for an ambush. After the Demoness
          arrives, they would go all out to attack and trap her here. By then,

          to deal with eventually. That Demoness was set to appear in six months
          even if the Buddhist Mountain incident hadn&#8217;t happened,&#8221;
          an elderly man with pale golden wings of a roc smiled and replied in a

          Sacred King Realm. In fact, the Golden-Winged Roc Clan and the
          Buddhist Mountain were close because they went way back. Now that the
          Buddhist Mountain was going to hold a Demon Slaying Event, the
          Golden-Winged Roc Clan immediately showed their support by sending
          many experts from their Clan here.</span

          agreement. There were the Ancestors from the Golden Immortal Armadillo
          Clan, the Nine-Headed Lions Clan, the Sky Demon Clan, and the Feather
          Clan, all of whom had a close relationship with the Buddhist

          blurry faces and tall figures made them seem as if they were standing
          in another time and space. The wisps of divine light that lingered
          made many tremble, prompting them to worship these experts. They were
          real Sect Masters who had unfathomable strength. Even though their
          true appearance was hidden, their aura showed just how unfathomably
          strong they were.</span

          cultivation was once unrivalled in the world, I&#8217;m sure
          there&#8217;s barely anything left in her now. It will be advantageous

          have other plans for the Demoness. Even though they planned to
          eliminate a threat to the people and get rid of her, they were also
          doing it with their benefits in mind.</span

          >The cultivation level of the Demoness had probably surpassed that of
          Immortals. It would truly be a blessing for them if they could get a
          small piece of her, especially now when the Immortal Path was closed.
          It might be possible to get a glimpse of the Road to Immortality if
          they had her. Thus, this was a rare opportunity that they
          wouldn&#8217;t just pass up on.</span

          one, other than those who were not afraid of death, dared to stay
          here. Of course, there were still some young prodigies behind them who
          wanted to gain some real-life experiences. Though their cultivation
          might not be enough to help out, they held important artifacts which
          they could use to fight at critical times. In fact, It would still be
          a priceless lesson for them if they could hide somewhere and observe
          without participating in this battle. Naturally, it was because these
          young prodigies were greatly favoured that they were brought here at
          such a dangerous time.</span

          robes, and he had handsome features on top of that otherworldly air he
          exuded. He was a young man whose age could be easily disregarded. In

          made of Hell Iron. His eyes were golden, and he stood there like a
          bodyguard with a black spear in his hand. There was a terrifying and
          majestic aura about him that made everyone present turn grim as their

          Changge back then. With one palm, Jin Yuntian, who was in the Sacred
          King Realm, was slapped to death. Gu Changge&#8217;s strength may have

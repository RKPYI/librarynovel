      <p>
        Obviously, it made sense that Lu Luo and the others would be fearful.
        Anyone who knew about what happened that day would know how terrifying
        this leading figure from the other realm was.<span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Earlier, they had been guessing who the figure sitting on top of the
        Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon was, but never had the possibility
        crossed their minds, for it was unrealistic when the Boundary Marker Sea
        has yet to dry up.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      [How did such a terrifying person traverse over!?]
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Don&#8217;t do anything rash, Lin Wu,&#8221; urged Huo Rong as he
        held Lin Wu back, worried that he would expose their location if he
        charged out. He was close with Lin Wu, so he could understand the
        latter&#8217;s frustration at seeing the man who killed his brother.
        However, the opponent was far stronger than them. They were absolutely
        no match for him.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Calm down, Lin Wu,&#8221; The Elders added as they looked towards
        the figure shrouded in never-ending divine light with great fear.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;How can he be here?! Can the Boundary Marker Sea not stop them
        anymore!?&#8221; Apprehension enveloped Huo Rong as the thought came to
        him. After all, they would inevitably face endless attacks from the
        Upper Realm if the Boundary Marker Sea dried up.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;I won&#8217;t do anything rash,&#8221; Lin Wu reassured through
        gnashed teeth and seething rage despite having calmed down.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;We should get out of here quickly, or we won&#8217;t be able to
        go anywhere once we are discovered.&#8221; Lu Luo&#8217;s face was
        somewhat blanched, and the closer she was, the more she could feel the
        constantly-pervading terrifying aura that was profound and suffocating.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Many agreed with her suggestion and intended to sneak off.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        As precious and rare as the Supreme Dao Diagram was, they still needed
        to have what it took to claim it for themselves. They could tell the
        other man would likely die a terrible death here. They might be both
        from the Upper Realm, but it was evident the man in white would leave no
        survivors.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Let&#8217;s go. No sudden movements. Don&#8217;t let that guy see
        us.&#8221; Lin Wu nodded in agreement as well, and he carefully hid his
        aura away, not daring to show a sliver of abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        They had other things to do. Since the man in white wanted the Supreme
        Dao Diagram, they could take this chance to retrieve the gourd of the
        Spirit Gourd Master. It was coincidentally perfect timing.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        While Lin Wu and the others were planning to sneak off, the Supreme Dao
        Diagram rustled noisily in the sky as it stretched out like a scroll,
        enveloping the world. The strange phenomenon evolving within it caused
        the universe to disintegrate and the sky and earth to crumble as grand
        runes emerged, scattering endless light across the place.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It was the Principles of the World.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Before everyone knew it, they saw a page of scripture containing
        all-powerful essence manifesting in the air.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Gu Changge was standing silently on top of the middle
        of the lake, in the pillar of light. Every inch of his skin was glowing
        like a flawless jade. There was even chaotic divine light shining in
        between his hair. He didn&#8217;t care about the people nearby as the
        Supreme Dao Diagram was far more important to him right now.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The object was clearly beyond Nirvana Grade. It contained innate runes
        that circulated between Yin and Yang, displaying the evolution and
        manifestation of the Great Dao. It was an unimaginably terrifying
        phenomenon. Balls of fire that seemingly contained Supreme Worlds
        surrounded it and paid their respect.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge silenced his mind to comprehend the essence and learned more
        about the Path of the Supreme Dao &#8211; Dao is like a blade,
        incredibly heartless.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        *Roar!* Meanwhile, the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon suddenly roared
        as he fought Chu Hao in the air. He felt pain from where blood poured
        ceaselessly as he had been injured by Chu Hao. The two were going all
        out in this battle, using every ability they had on their opponents.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Multicoloured divine light that could obliterate a mountain ejected from
        jos three mouths.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Despite being at a far higher cultivation level than Chu Hao, he
        remained at a disadvantage as his scales exploded, causing blood to
        splatter like rain. He was surprisingly no match for Chu Hao at all.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Chu Hao&#8217;s powers were very odd, as his fighting technique was
        unlike any other, like a kind of long-lost, unparalleled fighting
        technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Die!&#8221; The Flood Dragon cast his greatest ability, opening
        his three mouths so wide it looked like he could swallow the entire
        world. Each mouth manifested a divine technique, gathering into red
        flames, purple lightning and black wind before blasting towards Chu Hao.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        However, the young man, whose gaze was beyond impassive, remained
        unmoved.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The next second, golden light surged as Qi and vitality erupted like
        wild smoke, and a golden fist descended from above, sending a major blow
        directly to the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon&#8217;s ginormous
        mouths.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Blood splattered like rain as the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon roared
        in pain and anger. However, it couldn&#8217;t hold off Chua Hao&#8217;s
        punch at all. Many of his bones were crushed, and his scales cracked.
        The impressiveness he possessed earlier was now gone as he was soaked in
        his own blood.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;This bastard is really strongâ€¦ I&#8217;m no match for him. He
        will kill me if I let this continue.&#8221; Fear laced the Three-Headed
        Black Flood Dragon&#8217;s eyes. He had volunteered to kill Chu Hao
        because he thought the man was an easy kill, but it turned out that he
        was no match for the Fortuitous One at all. He was overwhelmed by Chu
        Hao&#8217;s attacks the entire time and nearly brought himself to death.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        At that, he retreated at once, no longer daring to fight Chu Hao
        anymore, lest he really would die.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Where are you going!?&#8221; However, the man had no intention of
        letting him escape. Being interrupted repeatedly left him seething with
        rage, and he wanted nothing more than to kill the three-headed beast to
        vent his rage.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Lin Wu and the others might be sneaking off, but they were still keeping
        tabs on the action, and Chu Hao&#8217;s strength shook them to their
        core, and they were unable to calm down. He was another character they
        had underestimated.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        They had long heard of the infamous Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon. It
        was a formidable being that barely had any foes amongst those in the
        Sacred Emperor Realm. However, the creature was outmatched and brutally
        defeated by Chu Hao.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      [To think we were thinking about taking the Supreme Dao Diagram from him.
      We were really too full of ourselves!]
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Just then, fear arose on the fleeing Flood Dragon&#8217;s faces as he
        cried out in a desperate plea, seeing the Fortuitous One gaining on him
        with impassiveness. &#8220;Master, save me!&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Even Chu Hao, who was chasing after the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon
        impassively, was stupefied upon hearing his plea. He knew there was
        another presence within the battlefield, but he didn&#8217;t ask or
        bother himself with it and instead focused on fighting the Three-Headed
        Black Flood Dragon.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      [A Sacred Emperor Realm dragon called the figure &#8216;Master&#8217;?!]
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The notion shocked him, and his heart skipped a beat as he thought of
        the figure that suddenly dashed over.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        In that instant, chills ran down his spine as a strange sensation crept
        up to him, and he turned around hurriedly to look at the figure standing
        in the middle of the lake with divine lights shining brightly in his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Just then, Gu Changge, who was silently comprehending the Supreme Dao
        Diagram in the middle of the lake, opened his eyes and sighed under his
        breath. &#8220;What use do I have for you when you can&#8217;t even kill
        him?&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon shuddered in fear and hurriedly
        knelt with reverence, not daring to refute Gu Changge&#8217;s
        questioning at all. &#8220;I can be your steed, Master.&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Lin Wu, Lu Luo, and the others, too, shuddered in fear as the hair on
        the back of their necks stood involuntarily upon hearing the Flood
        Dragon&#8217;s words.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      [To think a fearsome Sacred Emperor Realm beast would willingly offer
      himself as a steed?!]
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It was something unfathomable to them, yet it was happening right before
        their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      [Is this the invincible might of the leading figure from the other realm?]
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Youâ€¦ Gu Changge!&#8221; Incredulity overcame Chu Hao as his
        pupils shrank when he finally made out the figure standing in that
        pillar of light. &#8220;Why are you here? Looks like that Demoness
        failed to kill you and even let you escape.&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        He, too, believed Gu Changge had met his demise as the latter was there
        when the Demoness massacred many great experts during the hunt at the
        Divine City. But who&#8217;d have thought he would reappear trillions of
        kilometres away in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains!?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Looks like I&#8217;ve disappointed you, then&#8221; Gu Changge
        replied nonchalantly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Chu Hao, on the other hand, was grim. His expression only worsened when
        he noticed the slowly descending Supreme Dao Diagram.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It was the fruit of his painstaking effort of pacifying it. However it
        ended up in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands just like that. Without the Supreme
        Cave Heaven&#8217;s techniques, the latter could forget about calming
        down the Supreme Dao Diagram.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;I will make you pay for stealing my love and destroying my
        empire, Gu Changge! I&#8217;ve been waiting for this day for a long
        time!&#8221; Chu Hao growled through gnashed teeth as ill-concealed
        animosity enveloped his countenance. He could never forget how Gu
        Changge forced his beloved Tang Wan. If it hadn&#8217;t been for Gu
        Changge, the Vermilion Bird Empire wouldn&#8217;t have been destroyed,
        and Tang Wan wouldn&#8217;t have left him! Gu Changge was the cause of
        everything!
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Since then, at every waking moment, he had wished to have Gu Changge
        chopped to bits.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Lin Wu, Lu Luo, and the others were surprised that the terrifyingly
        powerful man actually had such a deep hatred towards Gu Changge. Even
        Lin Wu found Chu Hao inexplicably pleasant. After all, the two had great
        animosity towards the same person.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The two might be on different sides, but they shared this one thing in
        common.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;I guess that makes the both of us. I&#8217;ve been waiting for
        this day for a long time, too,&#8221; Gu Changge said plainly.
        &#8220;It&#8217;s just, I wonder from where you have gathered the
        courage to say that to me?&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;My courage? You&#8217;ll find out soon enough,&#8221; said Chu
        Hao icily.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        He knew Gu Changge was powerful, but his cultivation had advanced
        tremendously as well, especially when he had practised a few Ancient
        Arts at Supreme Cave Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        There were still many techniques he had yet to perform when he was
        battling the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon, nor had he activated the
        Grand Furnace.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It wasn&#8217;t as if he had zero chances of winning against Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Oh? I can&#8217;t wait to see it then.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled
        plainly as he stood in the middle of the lake, where beneath him, an
        invisible golden Dao platform was seemingly emerging.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        He extended an arm while walking towards the shore, and with a rumble,
        he reached for the Supreme Dao Diagram in the air.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The supreme treasure had been behaving violently earlier with terrifying
        energy interwoven. But now, it was docile, floating mid-air silently.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        But to Gu Changge&#8217;s dismay, slivers of black and white divine
        light appeared as Dao flashed, dispelling his arm when he reached for
        the Supreme Dao Diagram.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Chu Hao, on the other hand, felt reassured upon seeing it, and he
        couldn&#8217;t help sneering, &#8220;Give it up, Gu Changge. The Supreme
        Dao Diagram belongs to Supreme Cave Heaven! It isn&#8217;t some treasure
        outsiders can just take for themselves!&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;No problem. I have all the time to refine it after killing
        you,&#8221; Gu Changge countered plainly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Since the Supreme Dao Diagram was still showing resistance, he would put
        it aside for now. After all, it wouldn&#8217;t be fleeing anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Arrrggghhhh!&#8221; Chu Hao charged towards Gu Changge with his
        energy reaching a peak like never before.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Surging golden light surrounded him as the Grand Furnace floated above
        his head. As its lid uncovered, waves of red and blue flames that could
        burn everything poured out. Even the sky and earth became blurry while
        the space crumbled.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, he roared and executed the terrifying fighting
        technique from earlier. He even deliberately executed a secret technique
        that amplified his attacks. With that, power exuded from the top of his
        head, and nearly all his punches caused the space to explode and crumble
        to dust.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This power was on a different level compared to earlier, and the
        mountains and lands would crumble to dust in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The earth roared as Chaos-Qi rifts extended from behind him and
        stretched towards all directions.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;He&#8217;s more powerful than before!&#8221; The hearts of Lin Wu
        and the others skipped a beat as they keenly felt Chu Hao&#8217;s
        confident and invincible temperament in this battle.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This was a peerless young prodigy from the Upper Realm. He wasn&#8217;t
        any older than most of them, but they couldn&#8217;t help revering the
        indomitable and unbeatable aura, and now, they couldn&#8217;t help but
        slow down as well, wanting to witness the peerless battle.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        For a moment, the place was enveloped in fist divine lights that charged
        towards Gu Changge, who was still walking towards the shore.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Chu Hao had thrown countless punches, and every punch could severely
        damage an average Sacred Emperor Realm Master, cause the void to
        collapse, and Principles to shatter. However, it was as though there was
        a natural moat between his punches and Gu Changge, making it impossible
        to land a punch on the latter.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        All the fist glows would disappear into thin air just as they would land
        on Gu Changge like there was an invisible space that could isolate
        everything. Or, more accurately, like a world was in between him and Gu
        Changge, and he could never go through the distance between them.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It was a devastating scene.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        No matter how Cu Hao roared or activated any kind of terrifying secret
        techniques, he couldn&#8217;t cross it. This was the gulf that could
        never be scale. Not something that could be offset using cultivation.
        Worse, even the divine fire that poured from the Grand Furnace would be
        put out as soon as it reached Gu Changge, causing no damage at all.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;So, this is what all your courage amounts to? How
        disappointing,&#8221; Said Gu Changge while doing nothing except ambling
        towards Chu Hao.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Again! I don&#8217;t buy this!&#8221; Chu Hao was surprised and
        livid, and he hated his incompetence. He couldn&#8217;t believe none of
        his attacks could even touch Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This time, he burned his Blood Essence and performed his strongest
        ability while activating the Grand Furnace, enveloping the
        world-engulfing energy it produced towards Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Reel in despair! Your powers are no match for Master! You might
        as well just surrender and die! He might even be merciful and give you a
        quick death!&#8221; The Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon couldn&#8217;t
        help scoffing jubilantly while his injuries were recovering speedily.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Is this the power of the strongest young prodigy of the Upper
        Realm? This gapâ€¦ How despairingâ€¦&#8221; Many youths from the Eight
        Wastelands and Ten Domains watched the scene with stupefaction. Their
        faces were blanched, and their lips trembled as they found the whole
        thing too surreal.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The Chu Hao they thought were peerless now couldn&#8217;t even get close
        to the man in white! He was so powerful that it was devastating. As if
        that wasn&#8217;t enough, he never made an attack, and he behaved
        nonchalantly as he overlooked everything condescendingly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Lin Wuâ€¦&#8221; Lu Luo glanced worryingly to her side at Lin Wu,
        whose face was evidently pale, worried that he would be traumatised, for
        the man in white was the very person who killed his brother, Lin
        Qingyang.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        How was he to avenge his brother when this was what he needed to face?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;I-I&#8217;m good.&#8221; Lin Wu gritted his teeth and clenched
        his fists as he felt a strong wave of powerlessness. He was still too
        weak.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Time to end this boring game.&#8221; Just then, the nonchalant Gu
        Changge, who never made an attack, suddenly stretched his right hand
        out, extended his fingers, and grabbed the air in front.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        With this one move, World Principles gathered, merging into a golden
        spear before thrusting ahead.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The air froze, and the terrifying force shot towards the sky like a
        massive sun. The spear struck the Grand Furnace with a loud boom, and
        ginormous divine waves shrouded the sky.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Though the fire pot was made of unique material, and it attempted to
        resist by erupting endless Divine Talismans, it still flew to the ground
        with a thump.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Having lost his artifact, Chu Hao turned grim, and coldness surged
        within him as he gathered all his powers to crush the spear. However, it
        was futile, as Gu Changge continued to launch his attacks. Despite being
        such simple strikes, he was able to eliminate all of Chu Hao&#8217;s
        attacks with them.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*Pfft!* Blood splattered as bones exploded into shards in the air.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Noâ€¦ Impossibleâ€¦ How can I die here?&#8221; Disbelief and deep
        despair enveloped Chu Hao&#8217;s face, as indignant as filled him.
        However, the spear just went through him with ease.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Just like that, all his attacks, including the artifacts and divine
        ability he launched, were eliminated for good.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The next moment, the man exploded into bits after Gu Changge&#8217;s
        right arm gently shook.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grey mist surged in the depths of Eternal Overcast, and vast energy flowed when the World Principles collapsed.</span><span id="more-36176"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m intrigued to see what you six are capable of.&#8221; Gu Changge exuded dominance and sharpness. His gaze was cold and indifferent as he walked, disregarding the fact that this was their territory, within the Eternal Overcast. When his large palm slapped down, it was like a towering wave capable of submerging everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeland had been completely still for countless ages, surrounded by endless crimson grey lands. But now, everything was crumbling and shattering. When a wide rift appeared, and the land was completely pierced through, it was as if the heavens and earth were going to be torn apart. Even the mist was thoroughly ripped. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark thunderbolts could also be seen running through the expansive universe, reflecting the deeper darkness there, impervious to any trace of light.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You dare!? How dare you act like this in our territory just because you think you are invincible in the outside world! Today, you shall pay for your arrogance. We will make sure you understand that the world is far bigger than you can imagine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their expression of the Great Ancestor who stepped out of Eternal Overcast homeland turned cold with anger. To him, Gu Changge&#8217;s intrusion into the depths of their homeland was tantamount to slapping them in the face. There was no way they, the Great Ancestors of the Eternal Overcast, could take this lying down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Take him down!&#8221; Another Great Ancestor roared in a voice equally as icy and ruthless. He could barely hide the killing intent deep in his eyes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six of them didn&#8217;t attack together all at once. No matter what, as Great Ancestors of Eternal Overcast, they didn&#8217;t deign to join forces and subdue a young man like Gu Changge. Moreover, in their subconscious minds, Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t reached the level where all six of them needed to act together to deal with him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three of the Great Ancestors made their move without using any profound methods. They simply manifested their true bodies and started to leave their homeland. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This universe seemed like it couldn&#8217;t withstand the aura they emanated. It felt as though it was about to collapse completely. The Great Ancestors&#8217; cheekbones had a radiant brilliance as boundless divine sense surged forth like a bursting Milky Way. Everyone suffocated under it, with their bodies on the verge of exploding, and their souls almost disintegrating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so your Spiritual Energy has already reached power equivalent to the Immortal Realm. Your physical body is decayed, but your divine sense has truly transcended the mortal realm. I see this is what gives you all the confidence.&#8221; As Gu Changge raised an eyebrow, he could sense the majestic divine sense pressing down on him from the Eternal Overcast homeland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the next moment, a hazy radiance pervaded beside him. A symbol of black and white strokes intertwining, resembling the yin and yang. Vast Primal Energy that rotated seemed to be able to break up chaos and return back to the primordial era. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the Supreme Dao Diagram left behind when those from the Supreme Cave Heaven tried to conquer the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had obtained this diagram, which contained unparalleled defensive power, at that time. However, he rarely used it because there were only a few cultivators whose power was a threat to him. However, the Spiritual Energy of the six Great Ancestors was already strong enough to crush everyone in the Upper Realm. Even Remnant Immortals were far inferior compared to them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge chose to proceed with caution as he didn&#8217;t want to make any absurd mistakes. Even though he had numerous methods he could use, he didn&#8217;t want to expose himself unless he had to destroy the entire Eternal Overcast. Furthermore, he had a nagging feeling that someone was observing the Eternal Overcast&#8217;s every move.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the Reincarnation Platform was a marker someone deliberately left behind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It could be the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s scheme.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Bam!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expression on Gu Changge&#8217;s face grew even colder when he snapped back to reality. He stepped forward, venturing deep into the Eternal Overcast homeland. The Supreme Dao Diagram hanging above his head radiated a resplendent aura of multicoloured light. With a single punch, a surging power shot out, carrying infinite Chaos Qi. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast power pierced through the heavens with unrivalled dominance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You will regret this, young one&#8221; The first Great Ancestor warned as he made his move. His voice was icy, and his gaze was chilling as a terrifying beam of light resembling a Heavenly Sword shot out from his eyes. At the same time, the immense Spiritual Energy concentrated at his cheekbones began to evolve, like it was opening up chaos to reveal an ancient world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of a grand boundless and infinite sacrificial ritual soon echoed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three thousand lifelike gods and Buddhas, who seemed to be refined from Principles, appeared. They each displayed joy, sorrow, wrath, and fury as they charged at Gu Changge to take him down. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with a punch from Gu Changge&#8217;s, an immense surge of Chaos Qi filled the air and crushed everything before him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Bang!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three thousand gods and Buddhas began to crumble as horrifying cracks appeared in them. They soon blew up with a resounding crack and turned into ashes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[They might have transformed the illusory into reality, but it is still empty in the end. Far from true reality.] Gu Changge grasped the essence of it all. Although the energy emitted by these three thousand gods and Buddhas indicated their levels as True Daoists, they were merely fleeting traces of such a power. Their physical bodies were as fragile as paper.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, another Great Ancestor also struck. This Great Ancestor was shrouded in a dense grey mist, and only one decayed and razor-sharp claw could be seen emerging. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This claw effortlessly sliced through all World Principles before it, tearing through all matter as it aimed to meet Gu Changge&#8217;s fist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the next moment, a crisp sound of bones cracking and a stifled grunt filled the air. The green claw splattered with darkened blood, while fragments of pale bones spattered. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The claw had been shattered by Gu Changge&#8217;s punch before it dissolved within the dense fog. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witnessing this, the other Great Ancestors&#8217; expressions began to change. They were no longer as composed and at ease as before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have underestimated you.&#8221; Another Great Ancestor appeared. He had sensed that Gu Changge was more powerful than they had expected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge only replied calmly, &#8220;And I have overestimated you all.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their physical bodies couldn&#8217;t begin to compare to Yan Luo, the Fourth Palace Lord, who he had subdued when annihilating Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the most terrifying battle since the birth of the Eternal Overcast broke out, being witnessed by the horrified eyes of all Eternal Overcast Beings. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was accompanied by thunderous roars and beams of light piercing through heaven and earth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several blurry figures shrouded in the dense fog let out earth-shattering howls as if they intended to shatter this universe. The barriers of space were torn apart, and countless runes were erased. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the haze dissipated, everyone could gradually see the horrifying scenes unfolding before their eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How is this possible&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is him against three Great Ancestors!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the experts of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family couldn&#8217;t help but tremble in fear. They were struggling to control themselves as they wanted to fall to their knees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Nan, Jia Jiuer, and the others were even more horrified. They couldn&#8217;t calm down as they saw an endless array of Principles gushing out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the three towering figures clashed with Gu Changge, their every move and action caused boundless divine light and Principles to surge. The immense divine sense proceeded to dry out everything around them as the void melted into nothingness. Even the desolate small worlds around them simultaneously exploded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This battle was simply too horrific.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was truly overpowering. With a sword-like beam filling his surroundings. It didn&#8217;t seem like he was fighting against the three Great Ancestors. On the contrary, it appeared as though he was subduing them all while remaining calm and relaxed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Something bad might happen to us if we don&#8217;t take action soon.&#8221; The other three Great Ancestors who hadn&#8217;t made a move all this time had also turned grimmer than before. They didn&#8217;t think that the joint forces of three Great Ancestors still couldn&#8217;t defeat Gu Changge. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worse, they found themselves at a disadvantage. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black-and-white Supreme Dao Diagram was truly mysterious, as it was able to evolve the Primal Yin and Yang and nullify numerous attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge stood there surrounded by endless billowing silver divine light. Yet, the diagram evaporated everything, including divine sense, that came to attack him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if nothing could get him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the other three Great Ancestors were about to attack Gu Changge, an eerie light suddenly emerged in the midst of the ongoing battle. It was like a Heavenly Sword refined from World Principles, shining brightly as it tore through the eternal sky and disturbed the River of Time to slash towards the head of one of the Great Ancestors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it had appeared abruptly out of thin air, everything happened too quickly and without any warning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Pfff!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood splattered, and a decaying head covered in various marks of rot was instantly sent flying. The remaining body immediately collapsed and shattered into pieces as it exploded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A Great Ancestor has fallen&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How is this possible?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the Eternal Overcast Beings stared wide-eyed at this sudden turn of events. In disbelief, they could feel their scalps tingle. Many of them stood motionless, seemingly dumbfounded. It didn&#8217;t make sense how their undying Great Ancestor could have their head severed and their body exploded into an endless bloodmist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Great Ancestors were also taken by surprise at Gu Changge&#8217;s unexpected technique. However, they didn&#8217;t look concerned. It didn&#8217;t bother them that one of their companions had perished and died.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is something wrong with that gourd. It can obliterate our souls with a single strike. We have to be careful&#8230; We might be undying, but we will look ridiculous if our physical bodies got destroyed by such a petty trick,&#8221; an Great Ancestor reminded, their gaze profound as they stared at the Immortal-Killing Gourd in Gu Changge&#8217;s hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other four Great Ancestors nodded upon hearing that. After seeing Gu Changge&#8217;s skills, they no longer underestimated him as they did at the beginning. After all, they had to undergo painful torment every time they had to rebuild their bodies. It was, after all, a reconstruction of both their physical bodies and souls. Although they had long grown accustomed to such agony, they wouldn&#8217;t want to endure it again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[His Source has shattered, body annihilated, and his soul has been extinguished. Even traces of his existence have been erased&#8230; And yet, he is still alive?] Gu Changge paid attention to the expressions of the remaining five Great Ancestors. He was growing even more curious about the secret hidden deep within the Eternal Overcast homeland. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of waiting for the five of them to attack him together, he took the initiative to make his move.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The onslaught this time was even more terrifying. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Godly Flames that illuminated every world had appeared, directly incinerating all the surrounding fog. The once extremely faint and blurry homeland ended up even more barren. Everyone could see the desolation and emptiness there. The entire ground cracked and collapsed. It wouldn&#8217;t be an exaggeration to say that the ground had shattered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle this time around was even more brutal when all five Great Ancestors joined forces. Although they were not even Remnant Immortals, their divine sense and Spiritual Energy was terrifyingly powerful. The techniques they showcased were not something even Remnant Immortals dared to face head-on. However, Gu Changge was protected by the Supreme Dao Diagram. The interplay of Yin and Yang and the interweaving of life and death gave rise to a chaotic world unfathomably enormous and capable of nullifying all attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This left the five Great Ancestors with extremely gloomy expressions when they realised that not a single of their attacks landed on Gu Changge. They were also unsure whether Gu Changge, at this stage, still harboured many hidden cards. He might not have unleashed his true strength since he still appeared to be extremely relaxed. It even made them suspect if they had been rotting for too long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Supreme Dao Diagram seems far from being as simple as an ordinary Nirvana Grade or Immortal Grade Artifact…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge indeed hadn&#8217;t unleashed his true strength. It wouldn&#8217;t be difficult for him if he wanted to wipe out the six Great Ancestors, but he wouldn&#8217;t be able to discern the secret of their undying ability if he did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, bloodmist filled the air as the sound of explosions erupted once again. Accompanied by a splattering sound, one of the Great Ancestors burst apart. Instead of having their head severed by the Immortal-Killing Gourd, they were forcefully crushed, having their body and soul annihilated by Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scene sent chills down the spines of the other four Great Ancestors. Gu Changge displayed the same calm and composure whether he fought against them one-on-one or against all five. There was hardly any difference from his usual self. Moreover, he still had the capacity to kill others. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the Eternal Overcast Beings were left speechless and shocked upon seeing this, and their scalps tingled while their bodies were chilled to the bone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Hmmm!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as this Great Ancestor was killed, a misty radiance suddenly spewed forth from deep within the Eternal Overcast. It was like a heavy and majestic mist blowing in from an unknown place, putting pressure on the hearts and minds of everyone, almost suffocating them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area instantly became incomparably dark before three obscure ancient wells radiated brilliant lights, as if they were a reflection of countless worlds emerging.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a peculiar black substance undulating at the mouth of the wells.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Ancestor who had been previously slain by Gu Changge with the Immortal-Killing Gourd was now sitting cross-legged at the mouth of the well. His figure was extremely blurry and faint with traces of black substance permeating his body, helping him reshape their physical form. This unimaginable scene shocked all the Eternal Overcast Beings watching.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could those be the ancient wells? Does the secret of the Great Ancestors&#8217; being undying lie within these ancient wells?&#8221; An Eternal Overcast Being muttered under his breath with wide eyes. This was their first time witnessing firsthand the process of their Great Ancestor reshaping their physical form.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So this is the reason why the Great Ancestors are undying. No matter how many times they are destroyed, they can be reshaped within the ancient wells.&#8221; Jia Nan, who was staring intently at everything, discovered the secret that the Great Ancestors had been hiding all along. If it weren&#8217;t for Gu Changge dispersing the thick fog around their homeland, they would likely never have been able to see what really went on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Three wells? Are these ancient artifacts related to the origins of the Eternal Overcast?] Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze also fell upon the wells, where he sensed a familiar energy. He could instantly tell that this was where the Eternal Overcast Sources were from.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the incomplete Reincarnation Platform in the centre of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom suddenly trembled violently at that moment. To everyone&#8217;s astonishment, the Platform then began to disintegrate on its own.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mysterious runes emerged and shot up into the sky, illuminating the void. Within the reflection of those runes, an enigmatic and profound path appeared connected to a distant place.</span></p>

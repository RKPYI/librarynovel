        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When was that? Why don’t I remember?” Gu Changge looked at the sachet that Gu Qingyi picked out and couldn’t help but shake his head, smiling. </span><span id="more-32768"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Qingyi looked at him with bright eyes, as if to see whether or not he was telling the truth. “You will remember eventually.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwhich, she kept the many objects on the green stone. Her right hand habitually swept aside the hair on her shoulder, as if she tried to hide her emotions. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge understood many of her habits. Although she didn’t say anything, he could tell that she liked the objects he brought back. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you looking at me like that?” It seemed as though Gu Qingyi couldn’t stand Gu Changge’s scrutinising gaze. She turned away and her eyes fell on the misty sea of clouds nearby. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge laughed, “If you don’t look at me, how would you know that I am looking at you?” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corners of Gu Qingyi’s mouth curled up slightly as she said, “this is my first time seeing the thief accusing others.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I am the thief, what does that make you? Actually, I have another matter to discuss with you.” Gu Changge smiled as he changed the subject. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it?” Curious, Gu Qingyi asked. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Actually, it’s nothing much. I’ll ask you after I collect those things.” Gu Changge shook his head as he took out a few Earth Dragon Fruits that he had obtained from Kun Mountain and threw them into the faraway sea of clouds. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he wanted to ask was actually related to the Immortal Palace Treasury. Now that he currently has six out of the Seven Tools of World Domination, still only short of the Sword of World Domination, it seems like it won’t be long before he obtains the final key that would unlock the Immortal Palace Treasury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing how Gu Changge didn’t say anything, Gu Qingyi tactfully stopped her questions and quietly watched the Earth Dragon Fruits as they fell into the sea of clouds. These few Earth Dragon Fruits were crystalline. Although they were the size of a fist, they contained astonishing amounts of energy, like that of stars. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Gu Changge threw the Earth Dragon Fruit, the sea of clouds tumbled. A slender snow-white figure emerged and caught the Earth Dragon Fruit. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After such a long time, there wasn’t much change in Xiao Bai’s size. But her physique was slender and beautiful like the moon and her eyes were bright and clear like glass. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gu Changge came, she hid in the sea of clouds without revealing herself. Although Gu Changge was nominally her Master, his attitude towards her was indifferent at best. Instead, it was Gu Qingyi who was extremely caring towards her. Thus, in this little Wang Yue’s heart, Gu Qingyi was her real Master. Thus, her attitude towards Gu Changge was cold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like you’ve eaten quite well during this period of time, you even grew fatter.” With a smile, Gu Changge nodded as he carefully scrutinised Xiao Bai. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xia Bai, who nibbled on the Earth Dragon Fruit in relish, suddenly froze when she heard this. Suddenly, panic ensued in her eyes. [Did I hear him right? Grew fatter???] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, three words echoed in her mind as the Earth Dragon Fruit in her hand was no longer as fragrant as before. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grew fat? What? Don’t scare her like that.” Gu Qingyi didn’t expect Gu Changge to say this so suddenly, and was also stunned. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked at Xiao Bai and shook her head. In her eyes, in comparison to Wang Yue’s clansmen, whom she had seen before, Xiao Bai’s current size was still considered small. [How is she fat?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did she not grow fatter? I feel like there is a world of difference from the previous time I saw her. It seems like you’ve fed her too well, this can’t continue. Although my Gu Family has abundant resources, how can we stand feeding her like this?” Gu Changge looked at Xiao Bai a few more times, before he shook his head and sighed as if he had a headache because he couldn’t keep up. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Qingyi turned and stared at him as she resisted the urge to roll her eyes at him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t even eat that much. If there anyone who gained weight, it’s you.” As she heard his words, a beam of light surged above the sea of clouds. Xiao Bai transformed into her human form. On her cold and arrogant little face was a calm expression. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wasn’t tall and was at most at Gu Changge’s chest. But her features were exquisite. Her eyes were like glass, as if the goddess of the moon had reappeared in the world. Her silver hair was like a bright waterfall that could easily be a guiding light. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only do I raise you, but I also provide you with food and drinks. Is this how you’re going to treat me?” Intrigued, Gu Changge asked with a smile. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Bai was extremely unsatisfied with his words and said in a fury, “Sister Qingyi is the one raising me. It is rare for you to even visit me!” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a change in his expression, Gu Changge shook his head, “Don’t you understand? Qingyi is mine. Who is it thanks to that you can grow so fat?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me say this again, I did not get fat. Hmph! I don’t have a Master like you!” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Bai transformed back into her true form and went back into the sea of clouds. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Qingyi couldn’t believe that Gu Changge was teasing this child. She quietly watched on as she fiddled with her own hair as her thoughts wandered. This scene seemed familiar, as if she had experienced this in the past. As she watched Gu Changge, she couldn’t help but smile. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following days, Gu Changge stayed with Gu Qingyi. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since he had already become a True Daoist, there was no need for him to plan as carefully as before. In other words, he could finally relax. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There wasn’t much need for him in the Gu Family as well. After the battle at the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the Gu Family had divided up most of its resources. Thus, during this period of time, their Family had sent many members to manage the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of Gu Changge, the Sky Deer Goddess has also risen in status and influence in Sky Deer City. Those that follow her had even become a powerful Force in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, although the Bone Clan had moved back to the Upper Realm, they left a portion of their clansmen there to cooperate with the Gu Family to manage the Great Bone Domain. Besides this, there wasn’t much that Gu Changge was concerned with. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Su Qingge, after their parting at Dark Kun City, Gu Changge never once asked about her whereabouts. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that there were rumours of the Successor of Demonic Arts appearing in the Upper Realm from time to time, many Forces were trying their best to capture Jiang Chen. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gave Su Qingge an opportunity. Being the smart person she was, she definitely wouldn’t waste this opportunity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the blink of an eye, six months passed. After the incident in Kun Mountain, the Upper Realm also recovered a rare period of peace. The life and death of the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family still remains a mystery. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who went deep into Kun Mountain and were the last ones to come out alive didn’t know anything. Thus, not many cultivators cared much about this matter any longer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Forces were affected by this attempt. Many Sect Masters and young prodigies died within Kun Mountain. Bringing up the matter was also akin to tearing open their injuries. Naturally, no one dared to bring up the matter now, and no one would be stupid enough to break into the dangerous Kun Mountain again. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, the plan was to resolve the crisis caused by the Eternal Overcast once they saved the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family. However, they could only cancel this plan now. After the incident in Kun Mountain, the Ji Family suffered great losses, with many of their skilled masters falling in Kun Mountain, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this period of time, many old enemies also kept a close eye on the Ji Family, as they planned to devour the once aristocratic Family that produced a Human Ancestor. Previously when they heard that the Ji family wanted to go save their Prime Ancestor, they trembled in fear as uneasiness loomed over them. However, seeing how the Ji Family has suffered great losses, they couldn’t help but gloat as they sighed in relief. After all, the Ji Family’s power was once comparable to the Immortal Forces. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A skinny camel was still bigger than a horse. Even as they neared their end, the Ji Family still had enough power to terrorise others. During this period of time, many enemy Forces tested the waters, but none dared to go further. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near the Ji Family’s domain, many divine rainbows shone past every day and shadowy figures also appeared on the hilltops nearby. This scene made everyone in the Ji Family uneasy. The various Elders who went to Kun Mountain had all died and the few Ancestors left had also met their doom. Even the Dao Artifacts that were brought into Kun Mountain were all lost. Thus, there was not much left in the Ji Family now. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the enemy was to attack them, it wouldn’t be impossible for the entire Ji Family to be erased from the Upper Realm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we hadn’t gone to save the Prime Ancestor, our Ji Family wouldn’t have ended up in this state.” Within the Ji Family’s manor, the atmosphere was heavy and some Sacred Emperor Realm Elders sighed with regret. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is my Ji Family really going to perish this time?” The faces of the rest of the family members were also pale white as they clenched their fists. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue remained silent as they heard the exchange between their fellow family members. Ji Chuyue wore a long pale yellow dress. Her slender silhouette and her delicate fair face were refreshing to the eye. But now, her eyes had lost their glow, as she had lost the brightness she once had. They had only realised how weak and powerless they were when the Ji Family was on the brink of death. They couldn’t even think of a solution. In the Upper Realm, they were young prodigies, peerless and invincible among their peers, but within their family, they were just useless Juniors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before our enemies invade, we should let the Juniors escape. After All, they are our last kindling.” As he listened to the discussion within the palace, Ji Yaoxing who had tightly clenched his fists, seemed to think of something and suddenly said, “We may still have a last resort…” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”Ji Chuyue looked at her brother sceptically as she thought about how they had really come to a dead end. However, as she saw the strong fire of hope that had ignited in her brother’s eyes, she couldn’t bear to extinguish it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can ask Young Master Gu for help. With one word from him, our crisis will be easily solved.” Ji Yaoxing said. This was his last resort. With Gu Changge’s current status, he only needs to say a word and doesn’t even need to do anything to keep the Ji Family safe. The enemies of the Ji Family definitely wouldn’t dare to openly offend Gu Changge or disobey his words. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this was really their last resort. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue was silent, as she had already thought of this.  [But why will Gu Changge help the Ji Family?] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t come up with a single reason. Ji Yaoxing saw the worry in Ji Chuyue’s eye and his face turned solemn, “Actually, I know the probability of this happening is not high, but it is still better than us not doing anything. Why don’t we give it a try? Chuyue, you need to believe in your appearance. Even Ji Qingxuan and her sister stood a chance, I don’t see why you can’t.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These words stirred huge waves in Ji Chuyue’s heart as she came to a realisation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Gu Changge knew about the Ji Siblings’ arrival, he was already planning to visit the Mortal Palace. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he looked over how far the Eternal Overcast crisis had spread, he was reminded of the deal he had with Jia Lan, the Princess of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She owed him a substantial amount of Eternal Overcast Source. Back then, she had left a token of their promise. It was a Space Piece that contained a wisp of her divine sense. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that Space Piece had been sealed and kept by Gu Changge, to isolate the divine sense Jia Lan had left behind. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was through this Space Piece that the Eternal Overcast Kingdom could contact him. Afterall, that was their agreement back then. Jia Lan would help him obtain the Eternal Overcast Source and Gu Changge would help them forge the Reincarnation Platform. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eternal Overcast Source seemed to have the benefit of improving Gu Changge’s Grand Flask. Thus, he still wanted more. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he indirectly asked Jiang Chuchu to help him find more, it was far from enough for the Grand Flask. In his eyes, this Eternal Overcast might be the harbinger of the reappearance of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom in the Upper Realm. At the same time, this was also a sign of the imminent chaos in the Upper Realm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near future, when the Epoch Dao Fruit matures, forcing the Immortal Gate open. Chaos would erupt. Those hidden deeply in their various Forces would definitely reappear to fight for this chance to become an Immortal. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Gu Changge’s mind, he had to make preparations beforehand. To set up a huge bait, which the Eternal Overcast Kingdom seemed to be of great use. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let them in.” As he pondered over this, Gu Changge ordered his guards to bring the Ji Siblings in. He had already guessed their purpose of visit. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ji Family was currently in the midst of a life-and-death crisis. The purpose of this visit was probably to ask him for help. To him, such a problem was just a matter of one sentence, but Gu Changge was not a people-pleaser and he himself didn’t have much interest in Ji Chuyue. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, on second thoughts, he had not only devoured the Source of their Prime Ancestor, he had also manipulated the entire Ji Family and wreaked havoc on them in Kun Mountain. It was only reasonable for him to help them. Not to mention, it would also make it easier for Ji Qingxuan to take over the Ji Family afterwards. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[With all these, helping them would not bring me a loss.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve already heard about what happened to the Ji Family.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the lead of the guards, the Ji Siblings quickly arrived within Gu Changge’s palace. It was obvious that Ji Chuyue had deliberately dressed up for him. With a little makeup, she looked even more graceful than usual. Her hair was like a waterfall and there was a sense of mystery in her eyes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they heard Gu Changge’s words, the Ji Siblings were a little stunned. They couldn’t help but get nervous. Especially Ji Chuyue. She lowered her eyes and gripped onto her sleeves tightly, afraid to look at Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had already planned their entire explanation. However, Gu Changge’s frankness caused them to swallow all the words that they had thought up on their journey there. They didn’t know what to say. Afterall, the current Ji Family had already been reduced to a third-rate Family, why would Gu Changge save them? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Ji Chuyue’s beauty was refreshing to the soul, with Gu Changge’s status, would he lack any prodigal damsel? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwhich, silence reigned. No one dared to say a word, it was like the slow passing of a thousand years. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corners of Ji Yaoxing’s mouth couldn’t help but reveal a sense of bitterness. [Looks like I am overreaching…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let Chuyue stay today.” At that moment, Gu Changge sighed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once he heard this, Ji Yaoxing was first stunned, then overly excited. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue’s cheeks were stained with a rosy hue, she didn’t expect their last resort to work. She had thought that Gu Changge would be too unbothered to care about the life-and-death of their Ji Family.</span></p>

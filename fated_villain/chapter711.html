        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The war was extremely brutal. Even an entire Great Universe was quaking as it was turned into an ancient battlefield. The nearby stars shattered into dust while skulls piled up in the surrounding fragmented Star Territories.</span><span id="more-36174"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kill that monster!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge! We must not let the sacrifices of our Seniors and Ancestors go in vain!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is our last chance!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the fractured sky, formidable cultivators roared, their bodies shrouded in swirling lights that illuminated the universe as they charged towards the figure standing at an unknown, fuzzy plane.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, the figure was too huge, capable of standing at the border of the world. Its body seemed to be made of Immortal Divine Gold. It shone brightly yet its face was blurry, forbidding anyone from discerning its features. Only its cold, emotionless eyes were revealed, as it condescendingly stared down upon all lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it was humanoid, it possessed three heads and six arms. Among his heads, one resembled that of a dragon while another that of a phoenix. Covered in colourful hair, its arms were immeasurably long, holding all sorts of weapons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon a mere glance, the entire universe fell into thorough destruction, as countless formidable cultivators screamed as their bodies exploded, disintegrating into ashes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, more and more cultivators fearlessly stormed forward, unaffected by the fact that they barely inflicted any damage upon the terrifying monster in front of them. It was as if their sole purpose was to annihilate this terrifying monster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was truly an astonishing sight of insanity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge!&#8221; Cultivators valorously swarmed towards the gigantic monster, resembling moths to a fire, only to be annihilated in the void along with their souls that dissipated amid the smoke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, bearing no emotion, the terrifying monster just stood there with its six arms that could tear the universe apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, it swung its blade-like claws downwards and effortlessly tore apart all World Principles. It instantly grabbed the living with its aura  and squished them into nothingness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their bodies blew up as their bones cracked. Blood then splattered in the sky, showering upon the land along with the drizzle of Principles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inevitably, even the experts with the peerless auras were obliterated along with their artifacts. The divine beings that lived within artifacts let out sorrowful shrieks, following their Masters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even Emperor Wu Shuang and Emperor Heng Yu have perished…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Argh! Down with the monster!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, the remaining people roared in fear, their faces filled with hopelessness. Some of them, overwhelmed by the massive impact, screamed before passing out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, such a sight was too shocking and terrorising. At once, cultivators were stunned, standing still on the ground with their shivering bodies. Even kings and emperors, who were deemed unequalled, were taken down by the monster as their exploded body reddened the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, everyone was thoroughly devastated, unable to come up with a solution. It was as if their reality was nothing but a predetermined dream, nothing they sacrificed could ever stop this disaster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Becoming an Immortal is nothing but a lie. There is no Immortal in this world. Only this monster lies beyond the Immortal Gate, and all that stepped on the Immortal Path have been eaten by it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of us are just its meal. Once it tasted enough, it will then consume the entire world.&#8221;&#8216;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As stated in the ancient texts, this is the Beast of Devastation that aims to destroy the world before returning to reincarnation…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old cultivators cried in dejection—their eyes filled with blood—before gruesomely blowing up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For countless years, they had been attempting to crack the mysteries of the Immortal Realm, intending to enter the Immortal Gate. For that, countless Ancestors and Seniors had paid a heavy price in search for the Immortal Path.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, they stopped receiving any messages from their predecessors, who completely vanished as though they were pebbles that sank in the bottomless sea. Even the ancient emperors—apex beings of the world that conquered all lands and wiped out all adversaries without a rival since ancient times—had never returned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some assumed that they had become Immortals and moved on to another world, some claimed that they were trapped on the Immortal Path and were unable to return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, the truth was that, only a fractured universe lay behind the Immortal Gate, harbouring an unimaginably terrifying monster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For countless years, the supreme experts that had tried to thread through the Immortal Path had all become food to this terrifying monster, swallowed by it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corpses had almost flooded the fractured universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the clues and hints left behind by those who walked through the Immortal Gate, the Successors eventually understood this horrifying fact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal Ascension was a lie.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the Immortal Path, that they had spent their entire lives searching for, never existed. For countless years, everyone was led to believe such a lie. Their predecessors persistently searched for the Immortal Path, only to end up as food to the terrifying monster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who fabricated such a horrendous lie!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why lie to us for countless years, only to reveal the truth behind it now!? Is the world simply a prison, confining us as we wait to be fed to that monster!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivators expressed their disaffection toward the worldly inequity with tears and total hopelessness surging in their eyes, their bodies violently trembling. Meanwhile, others charged and yelled furiously, desiring to fight the terrifying monster with their lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, with a swing of its six arms, countless beams and Principles exploded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the darkness of the world, divine light shot through the clouds, fracturing Principles and submerging the unceasing shouts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Universe was falling apart. Numerous stars were uncontrolling quaking, about to plummet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is our years of planning and effort to come here all for the sake of annihilation? Has our effort all been for a lie!? I can’t accept this! I can’t accept this! Heaven! Please! Open your eyes and save us!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An emperor with a frightening aura yelled out of anger. His Artifact emitted infinite lights as Principles emerged, protecting the army behind him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the next moment, as the terrifying monster swung its arm, a blinding light broke out and forcefully slashed through the emperor&#8217;s forehead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right away, the emperor&#8217;s head blew up, and his soul was instantly annihilated. Even his artifact let out a despairing cry before breaking apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their world, the emperor was a peerless figure who remained invincible for generations and conquered the entire world. Yet, to the terrifying monster, he was nothing but a fragile sheet of paper that was easily torn apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of such experts remained dormant for numerous years, solely waiting for this day. Alas, when the day finally came, they unfortunately discovered that their end was predetermined. They clearly stood no chance against such an overpowered monster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rain of blood fell from the sky as the battleground was filled with dejected shouts. In the fractured universe, the armies of the kings and emperors continuously exploded and turned into dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the scarred land was buried by mountains of skulls, making for a horrendous sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Defiers are to be slaughtered.&#8221; The terrifying monster subtly twisted its heads and spoke in an ancient, divine voice. It stood at the border of the world, its eyes cold and emotionless, as though its sole purpose was to guard the universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, it swept its six gargantuan arms across the world to shove the piles of skulls into its mouths, emitting spine-chilling chewing sounds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the fractured universe, a grand, spectacular gate stood. Surrounded by Immortal Energy, it seemed abnormally godly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the gate was slowly shutting, seemingly being pushed by a vast, supreme power. The gate was then completely closed, thoroughly sealing off the two worlds on both sides.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in the distant, unknown plane, a figure sitting in the void erased the scene before his eyes with a wave of a hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Crimson Spirit Ancient World had once nurtured a talent called Heavenly King Chi You, but now, it couldn&#8217;t even take on a Dharma Body equivalent in strength to a Remnant Immortal. As for Immortal Ascension? You puny ants dare to wish to become Immortals? Your greatest destiny is to become my Immortal King Dao Fruit!&#8221; The figure let out a sneer with immense coldness in the depths of his eyes, totally unaffected by the scene he witnessed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these years, he had been travelling through countless worlds and realms. Similar to this, there was no telling how many vast, mysterious worlds he had set up his plans in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the ancient Great Universes were definitely inferior to the Upper Realm, the power they had accumulated since their creation was not to be underestimated. If they were given sufficient time, it wouldn&#8217;t be impossible for them to grow and rival the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since the Forbidden Epoch, the Immortal Domain had thoroughly cut ties with the Upper Realm. Following the destruction of the Immortal Path, Principles became flawed, and even the Great Dao crumbled. Hence, no cultivators could ever become Immortal there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the people of the ancient Great Worlds, which were far away from the Upper Realm, they knew nothing about this. They ignorantly wished to become Immortals through the Immortal Path.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the figure had an idea—using the Immortal Path as bait to lure the supreme experts from the ancient worlds to come build his foundation with their lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the best opportunity to acquire an Immortal King Dao Fruit. When the true Immortal Path comes into existence, my countless bodies will merge, and I shall reach the Immortal Realm, which was once out of my reach.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, the figure then stood up, his eyes filled with unconcealable ambitions. He was an individual from Celestial Ancient Times. Back in his prime, he had far surpassed Immortal Realm. He even mastered the Power of Reincarnation, and even the strongest among those of the Immortal Realm could not contain him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the Dao of Reincarnation was extremely vast and enigmatic as it involved time. Despite his endless years of research, he could barely make any progress, let alone acquiring a Immortal King Dao Fruit using his mastery over the Dao of Reincarnation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, he almost lost hope, thinking that he would never reach the cultivation level he wanted to. To his surprise, as the world fell apart during the Forbidden Epoch, the River of Time was buried, followed by the eternal splitting between Immortals and mortals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unexpectedly, he encountered six strange living beings that were stained by miasma, and their Primordial Spirits and body had gone through numerous reincarnations. These living beings were by no means formidable, yet they possessed the trait of being undying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through them, the figure was told of a place filled with mysterious grey mists—a place that harboured the secret to immortality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slightly stained by a trace of this place’s aura, the six began living with undying bodies and Primordial Spirits, and they would live until the end of time. Although the grey mists symbolised immortality and mortality, during the process, they had encountered unfathomable suffering and torment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, that was nothing compared to an eternal life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, some time after the crumbling of World Principles, the figure lost a huge portion of his abilities and cultivation. Naturally, he had a hard time returning to his prime. Thus, despite knowing that the six living beings carried secrets within their bodies, he refrained from questioning them. Instead, he laid down numerous plans as preparations for the future. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, the six gave him a bowl of well water that was claimed to have been extracted from the odd, enigmatic place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks to that bowl of well water, I am now able to discern true life and death and identify true Dao Techniques, hence giving me a chance to get my hands on an Immortal King Dao Fruit. My intuition tells me that the true Immortal Gate will soon appear. The days of waiting to return to my prime are numbered!&#8221; The figure&#8217;s eyes glistened and deepened, yet retaining his cold emotionlessness as he muttered to himself with his eyes glued to a space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he had laid down plans across numerous ancient universes, right now, he was not capable of drawing strength beyond the Immortal Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to remain silently hidden behind the skies like a shadow and to avoid the depletion of longevity and interference of Principles, he even divided his Source Dao Fruit into millions pieces and hid them in various ancient worlds in the form of Dharma Bodies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After such a long time, those six must still be alive. It seems the coordinates I had left behind are finally usable.&#8221; The figure revealed a chilly grin as he tore open the universe before him with his bare hands, after which he took a step forward and swiftly vanished.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Upper Realm was extremely far from this place, given his cultivation, he could easily get there in no time. So he wasn&#8217;t bothered by it as time was the least of his concerns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, during Celestial Ancient Times, he was known as the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in the Eternal Overcast, in the centre of the royal palace, dense colours of black and white were intertwining. The huge Life Rocks and Death Rocks were cracking and melting under Gu Changge&#8217;s power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, in a unique sequence, they reformed and fused into the shape of a platform. Every inch of its corners were engraved with complex patterns, including the cycle of life and death—the cycle of reincarnation. Even ordinary cultivators could tell that the platform was beyond their understanding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traces of the Power of Reincarnation surged at the four corners of the platform, as if it was a rushing waterfall. A magical, immeasurable force then slowly flowed above the platform, instilling fear and reverence within the bystanders as they felt the urge to kneel down and feel the Power of Reincarnation and time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This aura definitely belongs to the Reincarnation Platform, though it&#8217;s merely just a scarefold…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the depths of the homeland of the Eternal Overcast, the Six Great Ancestors stared intensely at the platform with emotions gushing in their heart. After all, they had been waiting too long for this day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the words left behind by the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, once the Reincarnation Platform was successfully built, they needed only to light the Flame of Guidance on it and the mysterious place would be reflected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they entered the place by mistake back then, they had already considered themselves as living beings of the mysterious place, and they constantly felt the desire to return. Hence, all these years, they resorted to all sorts of methods to attempt to contact the mysterious place in an attempt to return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, the Reincarnation Platform Gu Changge built ignited fervent hope in their hearts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Crack…*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, at that moment, a loud crack could be heard coming from the centre of the hall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The joyful, optimistic faces of the Six Great Ancestors immediately froze as they were visibly shocked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the faces of Jia Nan and the rest also froze as their smiles waned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm… Everything was going fine. Why did it suddenly fall apart?&#8221; Rigging the platform with his divine sense, Gu Changge pretended to only notice this change. He then subconsciously furrowed his brows, speaking with a surprised expression.</span></p>

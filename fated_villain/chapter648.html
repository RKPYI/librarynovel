        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endless blood and fire swept the entire Profound Sword World that day. Despair and wails rang across the lands as darkness enveloped the world, bringing destruction and catastrophe as though the end of the world had arrived.</span><span id="more-34813"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Thirteen States had sunken and formed a terrifying rift that stretched billions of kilometres away. Volcanoes erupted, spewing red-hot lava as though meteorites rained down on the lands, ravaging vast areas of the region.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side of the world, oceans burst their banks and rushed frantically inland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, countless terrifying deep-sea beasts crawled out, wreaking havoc on the land.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Profound Sword World was in shambles at this point. All Forces were enveloped in deep devastation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the end of the world!&#8221; bewailed many Elders as they knelt at the foothills, praying to their Ancestors in hopes of receiving a glimmer of hope.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more cultivators knelt at the foothill, of where Sword God Mountain used to be, praying to the statue at the top.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A catastrophe of this degree had once happened to the Profound Sword World, and it nearly wiped all sentient beings out. Fortunately, a saviour appeared and saved everyone from misery. He was then known as the Sword God.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereafter, cultivators forged Sword God Mountain in this very place and even made a statue of him to commemorate and pray. Alas, in the present time, many discovered to their dismay, that the originally shining, golden Sword God statue was now dimmed and cracked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, the statue came down with a rumble under everyone&#8217;s shocked gazes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a bolt of terrifying lightning struck the Sword God Mountain, causing a rockslide as the mountain itself cracked and fell apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is there really no hope for us!? Even Sword God Mountain has fallen apart…&#8221; They wailed in sadness and despair at the foothill of the Sword God Mountain, having a hard time accepting everything that was happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, similar events were occurring throughout the Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catastrophe haunted the entire world as vast and boundless godly power descended, all while scarlet chains made of Principle pierced through the sky one after another like divine dragons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Earth Sword Immortals, those hidden within the Profound Sword World, were now in utter shock. The scarlet chains that fell from the sky with burning and terrifying destructive energy, caused the world to crumble and headed straight for where they were hiding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brilliant lights burst. Everyone was nothing but mere vermin under such vast power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah!&#8221; All Earth Sword Immortals roared with devastation as they did everything they could to break free from the chains. Alas, it was all in vain in the end, for even their souls were bound, rendering them entirely immobile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the power of the Heavenly Dao, vast and boundless. No cultivator born of the Profound Sword World was spared. That said, such power only targeted beings of the Earth Sword Immortal Realm, leaving many cultivators in the Ninth Realm apprehensive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, many could do nothing but watch as their Ancestors, who had retreated to the depths of their clan&#8217;s residence, got shackled by chains and dragged away to the edge of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such power was devastating, and the gap was far too stark. They could never even begin to fight it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this day, many Earth Sword Immortals, who hadn&#8217;t made themselves known to present times, were taken away by the scarlet chains, vanishing into thin air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one knew where they had been taken to, nor if they would be alive. Be it to them or the rest of the Profound Sword World, this was certainly their darkest day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, many ancient battleships were anchored at the crack outside the Profound Sword World&#8217;s world barrier, surrounded by the vast and profound galaxy of stars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Forces that had come to invade the Profound Sword World and had set up their base camp here. However, none dared to approach the world carelessly at the moment, for even they were apprehensive of the anomaly occurring.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, some Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts attempted to descend upon the Profound Sword World to find out what happened. However, they were quickly expelled by the energy of the world. In fact, they nearly couldn&#8217;t make it back alive. Thus, they gave up probing and just kept away. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since returning from the Ancient Arcane Ruins, many cultivators had been camping here. After all, they had yet to conquer the Profound Sword World. Hence, they naturally wouldn&#8217;t think about returning to the Upper Realm just yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Voom!* Suddenly, an area within the space trembled gently, then rippled before Gu Changge stepped out from it.  He moved speedily, arriving at the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s ancient battleship nearly instantly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu!?&#8221; The many patrolling soldiers, who recognised Gu Changge instantly, greeted him in unison after recovering from their split-second shock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty’s Imperial Ancestor&#8217;s disappearance was kept under wraps for fear of sparking panic. Hence, many were unaware. Thus, they were unaware of the fact that the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was fearful and wary of Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Where is your Eldest Princess?&#8221; Gu Changge asked casually as he moved further in after landing on the ancient battleship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She has been in the main chamber since returning from the Profound Sword World, Young Master Gu,&#8221; revealed a soldier deferentially.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The main chamber, huh?&#8221; Gu Changge nodded subtly before disappearing on the spot and reappearing thousands of kilometres away in a second.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Say, why do you guys think Young Master Gu wants to see the Eldest Princess?&#8221; A few soldiers glanced at each other after Gu Changge left, having a nagging feeling that something was amiss.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situated in the depths of the ancient battleship was the main chamber, where massive clouds drooped, mountains and pavilions were erected, silver waterfalls poured, and iridescent mists wreathed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Yu Feiya, dressed shapely in white and wearing no makeup on her elegant face, stood quietly and composedly in the main chamber.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing footsteps, she turned around and watched as Gu Changge walked from outside the chamber. She didn&#8217;t appear surprised. In fact, it looked as though she had been waiting here for him for a long while.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Gu,&#8221; The young woman bowed and greeted Gu Changge with grace and great composure belonging to royalty, appearing neither overbearing nor servile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded slowly in return. &#8220;Have you been waiting here for me for quite some time?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have,&#8221; answered Yu Feiya frankly with a nod.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had long figured out Gu Changge would return, for the World’s Will would never be able to stop him. She also knew it was apparent Gu Changge would wipe them all out since he dared kill so many True Daoists. Hence, he would certainly make a move, and no one would be spared. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the True Daoists couldn&#8217;t defeat him, they certainly were no match for him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Have you?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled faintly, appearing somewhat interested. &#8220;I suppose you know why I&#8217;ve returned.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, Yu Feiya said with mixed emotions, &#8220;You intend to kill us all here so that you can have the World Source all to yourself, am I right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being astute, she quickly figured out Gu Changge&#8217;s plan when the latter killed her Imperial Ancestor and the other True Daoists. Something like the World Source was enough to send True Daoists into a frenzy, so how could Gu Changge not be moved when he was even more powerful than them?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In that case, why are you still here? Are you presenting your head to me?&#8221; Gu Changge asked with a chuckle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya shook her head in response. &#8220;You can actually do it differently, Young Master Gu. No doubt people will suspect if you kill everyone here before returning to the Upper Realm alone,&#8221; she said gravely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew resisting at this time would only lead to a sooner death. Hence, the only way out was to let Gu Changge realise she could be of use to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know what you&#8217;re trying to tell me. You want me to spare you and your people, no? But how can you be so sure that the other Forces wouldn&#8217;t trouble me?&#8221; asked Gu Changge with a profound gaze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he did intend to kill everyone here and now, he needed to consider the fact that the immolation of sentient beings was required for the World Source to converge. The Upper Realm cultivators present would be a decent choice if they happened to be short of offerings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No doubt you already have something in mind, Young Master Gu, for the dead cause no trouble,&#8221; Yu Feiya stated plainly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chuckle escaped Gu Changge before turning grave. &#8220;No doubt you&#8217;re confident I&#8217;d spare you and your people since you dare wait for me here. It&#8217;s not impossible, but I want you to lure the other Forces into the Profound Sword World.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lure them into the Profound Sword World?&#8221; Shock enveloped Yu Feiya&#8217;s face when she heard Gu Changge&#8217;s demand. It was evident she figured out what the man had in mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it? You can&#8217;t do it?&#8221; asked Gu Changge after taking a gander at her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although her throat felt dry, Yu Feiya still nodded. &#8220;I will try my best. But the World’s Will might force many of them back before they can even approach the Profound Sword World.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, Gu Changge shook his head subtly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry about that. That thing will go easy on them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It will?!&#8221; Yu Feiya was stumped. It took her a moment to realise what Gu Changge meant, and when she did, chills ran down her spine as she shuddered in fear at a certain possibility. [Gu Changge has already subdued the World’s Will, hasn&#8217;t he? That&#8217;s why he intends to lure all the Forces into the world so that he can kill them altogether.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the main chamber, Gu Changge headed towards the dungeon, where the the Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, Lin En, and the other Earth Sword Immortals were held captive, following the news he got from Yu Feiya.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the cultivators agreed to keep them there until Gu Changge&#8217;s return before deciding what to do with them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances of the True Daoists returning were becoming bleak, and they weren&#8217;t idiots either. They wouldn&#8217;t offend Gu Changge when they clearly knew they were no match for him. If anything, they at least had to return to the Upper Realm before doing something about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are the ones who kept slandering you, Young Master Gu. What do you say we do with them?&#8221; asked a Sacred Emperor Realm expert from Godly Spirit Mountain deferentially while pointing at Lin En after showing Gu Changge the way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivators from other Forces were present too, and all of them were no minor characters. If anything, their aura were so terrifying that they were like dreadful furnaces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I got it.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded, then gazed profoundly at Lin En.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had wanted to see how massive of a wave this Fortuitous One could make. Alas, Lin En was a rather disappointing one. Not only had he been bewitched by the World’s Will, but he couldn&#8217;t even make out the present situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I guess there&#8217;s not much to him other than providing me with some experiences and another Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest.] Truth be told, given his current cultivation level, no Fortuitous One could leave a substantial impact on him anymore. Gu Changge could only hope there&#8217;d be surprises after he entered the Immortal Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you doing here!?&#8221; Lin En, who had been held captive and sealed off his powers, stared at Gu Changge as his originally composed countenance changed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He genuinely didn&#8217;t expect Gu Changge to return so composedly after killing the True Daoists of various Forces, let alone be treated so deferentially by them!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge merely casually swept his gaze across the place, having no intention of entertaining Lin En.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and the others had been imprisoned in another cell. Their cultivation had been sealed off, too, and they were now mere mortals. These Earth Sword Immortals were the only ones held captive in this massive dungeon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To think the characters that once stood at the pinnacle of Profound Sword World were now nothing but mere prisoners whose lives were in other peoples&#8217; hands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mixed emotions enveloped their faces greatly as hints of uneasiness showed. Still, it was mostly feelings of defeat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Catastrophe is now surging in the Profound Sword World, and you might have already known about this—the World’s Will wants to annihilate all living beings of this world to achieve Absolute Detachment and Transcendence. The moment he achieves Absolute Detachment is the moment the world crumbles and all beings meet their end. All of you will die; all living beings born of the Profound Sword World will be sacrificed to it,&#8221; Gu Changge drawled, revealing the secret after sweeping his gaze across the dungeon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t want to kill these Earth Sword Immortals just yet. After all, their bodies were long stained with the Profound Sword World&#8217;s energy and Principles, having cultivated this far. In other words, Earth Sword Immortals were the perfect immolation sustenance. However, there were too few of them that had come this far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge also had this intention in mind when he had the World’s Will capture the Earth Sword Immortals hidden within the Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and the others were the top cultivators of the Profound Sword World. It&#8217;d be a waste to kill them just like that, wouldn&#8217;t it?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, cultivators of other Forces were reeled with incredulity upon hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s words. None of them expected such a secret. [To think the World’s Will is so ambitious!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No doubt it will enter the Immortal Realm after it achieves Absolute Detachment. After all, existences like theirs are unlike us, cultivators. They&#8217;re born from the world, are nurtured by it, and receive its protection. They need not suffer any hardships in their growth…&#8221; said a peak-level ranking ancient cultivator with graveness and worry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, there hadn&#8217;t been known cases of an Immortal appearing in the current Upper Realm. What was more, the issue might even be a threat to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Judging by that, the disappearance of our True Daoists might have to do with this,&#8221; sighed Yu Feiya with a subtle frown, who seemed to have something in mind. &#8220;Looks like we have to make another trip to the Profound Sword World.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, the hearts of other cultivators skipped a beat, and they all exchanged glances, believing it might just be the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In actuality, they didn&#8217;t think Gu Changge would kill their Ancestors. Instead, they&#8217;d rather believe the Ancestors were stuck in the Profound Sword World for some reason.</span></p>

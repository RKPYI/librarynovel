        <h4>Chapter 178: Even the Ancestors Take Caution; Let’s Test the Waters First!</h4>
        <p> ——— </p>
        <p> <b>Puff!</b> </p>
        <p> In the void, blood splashed, its strong scent permeating the surroundings. </p>
        <p> No matter how angrily Yu Xuan roared, his appearance and spirit were destroyed on the spot. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge had personally sent him on his way to accompany his childhood sweetheart. </p>
        <p> <b>“Don't worry, your clansmen will come to accompany you in a while.”</b> Despite his light smile, the
            words he uttered gave everyone a shiver. </p>
        <p> By his appearance alone, one could easily judge that he was an extraordinary person. However, his methods
            were tyrannical and ruthless. </p>
        <p> <b>“To cut the grass and remove its roots, not bad.”</b> </p>
        <p> Naturally, Gu Nanshan, the Great Elder, and Gu Xian'er – who came from high in the sky – bore witness to
            this scene. </p>
        <p> Gu Nanshan couldn't help but show a pleased smile on his face, as he said,<b> “This is precisely what I’d
                hoped to see from the Young Master of my Gu Family. Whoever dares to offend the Gu family shall have
                their whole family obliterated.”</b> </p>
        <p> Though he said these words, in truth, his heart was disturbed. </p>
        <p> The Immortal Gu Family has always done their best to steer clear of such bloody affairs. </p>
        <p> However, if someone dared to stroke the tiger’s whiskers, they would find themselves struck by lightning.
        </p>
        <p> In his opinion, there was nothing wrong with Gu Changge’s methods. </p>
        <p> ‘His indifference and decisiveness is one thing. It’s fine for him to be so ruthless, but for him to take
            the reins of power and rule the Gu family is inadvisable.’ </p>
        <p> ‘But in front of Xian'er, do I truly dare say more?’ </p>
        <p> ‘I can only pretend to praise Gu Changge and say these things, despite my true feelings lying elsewhere.’
        </p>
        <p> Gu Nanshan was in quite an awkward situation. </p>
        <p> <b>“Ancestor is right. These people are responsible for themselves. If it weren’t for their extremist
                actions, how else would things have led to the way they are today?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Unfortunately, they fell for Gu Changge’s plot. If not for their stupidity, he wouldn't have been able
                to find an excuse to attack them.”</b> </p>
        <p> As she heard his reply, Gu Xian’er nodded as she offered her own insights. From her eyes, it was clear that
            she believed every word of what she said. </p>
        <p> After all, she was also attacked by the powerhouse of the Tiangou Clan earlier. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was the one who involved her in this matter, causing her misfortune. </p>
        <p> She will be sure to remember this. </p>
        <p> Between the sky and earth was an area of dead silence. Even the vast and magnificent city in front of them
            was in complete silence. No one dared to make a sound. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge stood, his hands still raised in the striking gesture from earlier. At this moment, he was like a
            young immortal emperor, observing the world and overlooking all with indifference. </p>
        <p> His powerful methods not only suppressed the entire Tiangou Clan, even those nearby who merely waited and
            watched felt a chill on their backs. </p>
        <p> In front of the whole Tiangou Clan, he slaughtered their descendants. </p>
        <p> Among the people surnamed Yu, no one dared to show up. </p>
        <p> Such great power made many of the Daoist cultivators tremble, their astonishment growing deeper. </p>
        <p> ‘This is the most powerful person in the younger generation!’ </p>
        <p> ‘The one who can overlook an entire clan!’ </p>
        <p> <b>“Young Master, since they won't come out, should we blast them away?”</b> </p>
        <p> The middle-aged man named Lu Yu, from the Primordial Divine Sect, with the Cultivation Base of the Half-Step
            Sacred Realm respectfully asked. </p>
        <p> Today is the day that the Tiangou Clans shall pay. They must either surrender or have their entire clan be
            wiped. </p>
        <p> And resistance? That will only serve to make them die faster. </p>
        <p> <b>“A tortoise with a shrunken head is undesirable.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge nodded and chuckled lightly, he was in full control of whether this troublesome clan lived or
            died. </p>
        <p> First, he needed to give the monkey an example. If he kills the chicken in too simple a manner, it would
            only serve to make things harder for him. </p>
        <p> ‘At this moment, the Tiangou Clan should be trying to contact the True Dragon Clan, hoping for support.’
        </p>
        <p> ‘However, the True Dragon Clan is a terrible choice. They wouldn’t tear face with the outside world so
            easily. In other words, the True Dragon Clan is testing the waters.’ </p>
        <p> ‘As such, the True Dragon Clan can only delay it, rather than standing up and supporting the Tiangou Clan in
            the name of justice.’ </p>
        <p> ‘As for the Tiangou Clan, they are caught in the middle. They have no choice.’ </p>
        <p> ‘Either surrender or be reduced to rubble by my family and the Primordial Divine Sect.’ </p>
        <p> <b>“You have two options: surrender or die. Choose.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge took a step in the void with his hands behind his back, pressuring those below. </p>
        <p> He spoke slowly, unflinchingly, as everyone’s soul trembled. </p>
        <p> It was at this moment that the rest of the Young Supremes realised it. The gap between Gu Changge and them
            had widened infinitely. </p>
        <p> They were from the same generation, but there could be no comparison in terms of power. </p>
        <p> Ye Langtian, Wang Wushuang, and all the others fell into silence. </p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge, you tyrant! I swear that I won’t let you have your way even if I have to burn my own flesh
                and blood.”</b> </p>
        <p> The Tiangou clansmen burst out with angry voices. Among them, there were several hate-filled figures, all
            staring at Gu Changge. They wished nothing more than to cut him into pieces! </p>
        <p> In the palace gathered several of their elites. Among them was a middle-aged man, in a golden robe. He wore
            a majestic yet gloomy face, as a purple-gold crown adorned his head. </p>
        <p> He was none other than the current patriarch, the reason why the Yu Family was considered to be invincible.
        </p>
        <p> His title alone speaks volumes on his character; his Cultivation Base was in the Great Sacred Realm. </p>
        <p> In his eyes, strands of cold light flashed. </p>
        <p> <b>“This Gu family’s kid thinks too highly of himself. Does he think nothing of our Tiangou Clan? With such
                little manpower, he dares? Such foolishness!”</b> As he said this, Yu Wudi's face grew darker. </p>
        <p> [PR/N: Why does this sound familiar…] </p>
        <p> <b>“If he thinks my clan’s foundation can be uprooted by such a small force, then he underestimates us!”</b>
        </p>
        <p> <b>“Little Xuan!”</b> </p>
        <p> Next to him was a devastated old man, the clan elder of the Yu Xuan’s line. </p>
        <p> They were left to watch, powerless, as Yu Xuan died in Gu Changge’s hands. They didn’t even dare to show up…
        </p>
        <p> To say they were humiliated was an understatement, their anger boiling as it turned to hate. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, the True Dragon Clan had yet to give them an answer. </p>
        <p> Before, they didn't dare to face Gu Changge head-on, even saying they were against the prospect of war. </p>
        <p> It simply showed how unfathomable, how unimaginably terrifying the Ancient Immortal Gu Family and the
            Primordial Divine Sect were. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, this was but the tip of the iceberg, considering how long-lived an ancient behemoth like the
            Ancient Immortal Gu Family was. </p>
        <p> And that wasn’t the end of their problems. The other Daoist Sects and Immortal Families were filled with
            incomparable hate for them. </p>
        <p> <b>“The True Dragon Clan has yet to send a reply. Do they wish to use our clan to test Gu Changge’s
                methods?! This is nothing more than a blatant conspiracy!”</b> A clan elder spoke up, his expression was
            chilling, his face full of anger. </p>
        <p> The Primordial Divine Sect blockaded their territory for more than two days now, and yet the True Dragon
            Clan didn’t even lift a finger. </p>
        <p> It was clear what the True Dragon Clan’s intentions were. </p>
        <p> <b>“Go and ask the ancestor to come out! Without our ancestor, this may very well be our end.” </b>With a
            heavy face, someone gave a suggestion. </p>
        <p> His words were met with unanimous approval. </p>
        <p> Soon, one figure with a grave face rushed to the deepest part of the clan. If it were not such a major
            event, who would dare to invite over their ancestors so casually? </p>
        <p> For each clan, their ancestors were their foundation. The moment they are invited outside of their areas, no
            matter how powerful they are, they are guaranteed to consume their life essence and possibly die of old age.
        </p>
        <p> The Tiangou clansmen bore heavy hearts. They did not expect that there would be such a day when they would
            face a crisis so great that it would dictate their clan’s life and death. </p>
        <p> And all this was brought by a single young man. </p>
        <p> <b>“Until flesh and blood are burned? Hahaha! Such determination, I hope that you’ll hold on to it.”</b>
        </p>
        <p> In the high sky outside, Gu Changge had the same light smile on his face as he heard the natives’ words.
        </p>
        <p> As soon as he replied… Gu Changge pointed with his finger! </p>
        <p> At the same time, his figure traversed the void, walking forward. </p>
        <p> <b>Buzz!</b>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p> Ripples appeared in the void, followed by a strong crisp sound, as the space shook, and a terrible force
            appeared. </p>
        <p> His fingers were like a supreme sword! </p>
        <p> It fell… </p>
        <p> The vast amounts of Sword Qi fell, like a star crashing down from the heavens. </p>
        <p> The Sword Intent swept across the sky, as the ancient mountains and cities in front of them began to
            tremble. </p>
        <p> <b>“Damn it!”</b> </p>
        <p> When they saw this, the Tiangou Clansmen paled. </p>
        <p> No one had ever expected that Gu Changge would suddenly make a move. He was too strong. The terrible power
            of this sword might even be enough for a True God or even a Heavenly God to vanish in an instant. </p>
        <p> Such might shocked them. </p>
        <p> Although Gu Changge was injured for a while, it was now evidently clear that he had made a full recovery.
        </p>
        <p> Moreover, his Cultivation Base was even greater than before. Perhaps his injured origin was a blessing in
            disguise, helping him in his breakthrough. </p>
        <p> [ED/N: Gu Changge’s protagonist aura, except it was all planned.] </p>
        <p> The many Young Supremes were conflicted. </p>
        <p> They had already lost heart to compete with Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> ‘He’s a monster. Only the son of a True Emperor or those dusty Ancient Freaks would be able to stand against
            him.’ </p>
        <p> <b>“Die!!”</b> </p>
        <p> With Gu Changge taking the lead, the immortal-armoured soldiers of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, and the
            many powerful men of the Primordial Divine Sect shouted as one. One after the other, their bloodlust shook
            the sky, directed at the city in front of them. </p>
        <p> In an instant, a shocking battle broke out! </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> Many ancient warships descended, runes flickering on top, as a terrifying aura swept the area. Instantly, a
            few mountains and buildings were reduced to ashes. </p>
        <p> Even people from afar could feel the turbulence. </p>
        <p> <b>“The war is on! Young Master Changge is simply too strong for him to have the confidence to order a
                direct attack. Is he really planning to slaughter the entire Tiangou Clan?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Such arrogance… he doesn't put the Tiangou Clan in his eyes at all!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Where does Gu Changge’s confidence come from? For him to destroy the Tiangou Clan, they would have to
                contend with many of their Supreme-grade Artifacts!”</b> </p>
        <p> People in all directions were shocked, as they trembled. </p>
        <p> Many people believed that Gu Changge has a strong card he had yet to play. </p>
        <p> In other words, there was another considerably strong individual behind him that has yet to appear. </p>
        <p> The Sword Qi in the sky was vast, like the starry sky. Only a wisp of Sword Qi was formed from the Sword
            Intent. However, the Intent it carried was more than enough to split the sun and moon in half. </p>
        <p> Such a sharp edge was made possible thanks to Changge’s ultimate offensive power, the Gengjin Origin . </p>
        <p> Many Tiangou clansmen were suppressed by this vast Sword Qi. </p>
        <p> From the ancient warship he stood in, terrifying rays of Qi intertwined into one, like a river of stars had
            come crashing down all around them. </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> The many ancient formations and runes filled with killing intent erupted all at once, as an audible crack
            could be heard! </p>
        <p> It was as if the universe itself had collapsed. </p>
        <p> Across the sacred mountain, the sky shook, the ground broke, and countless ancient trees collapsed. </p>
        <p> The other nearby mountains quaked violently as they were reduced to ashes! </p>
        <p> <b>Whoosh! Whoosh!</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge led a group of immortal-armoured soldiers with cold eyes as they entered. </p>
        <p> At that moment, he was comparable to a Demon Lord, with a strong temper and many demonic methods to boot. A
            hazy rain of light appeared as he raised his hand, striking out. The large swathes of people in its path
            were simply disintegrated. </p>
        <p> ‘Now might be a good time to drag that guy down here…’ </p>
        <p> Although Gu Changge was focused on killing the Tiangou Clan, he paid close attention to the sky. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er's aura! </p>
        <p> ‘Since she’s hiding here, the Great Elder and the Ancestor are bound to be there as well.’ </p>
        <p> Gu Changge had no doubt this was the case. </p>
        <p> He wasn’t very interested in the Tiangou Clan, anyway. For him, all of this was just so he could send a
            message to the ‘tiger’. </p>
        <p> Currently, he was pondering how he could potentially involve the Gu Family’s ancestor in this battle. </p>
        <p> This was his true goal. For an ancestor to be here, it would imply that the Ancient Immortal Gu Family was
            serious in this matter. </p>
        <p> When that happens, he’ll be able to subdue the rest of the clans with intimidation tactics. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge also knew that this ancestor was here, not to support him, but to ensure that he would be held
            accountable for what he did to Gu Xian’er. </p>
        <p> Everything was going according to the plan. </p>
        <p> The moment that ancestor came to the Ancient Immortal Continent, Gu Changge had already made his plans. </p>
        <p> This ancestor certainly wouldn’t help Gu Changge without a good reason. In fact, he might very well teach
            him a lesson. </p>
        <p> Naturally, Gu Changge was prepared for such an event. </p>
        <p> For those who didn’t know of such things, Gu Changge’s actions would appear even bolder than they truly
            were. </p>
        <p> With a rumble, the void behind him began to bloom with brilliance. </p>
        <p> A vast space opened up. </p>
        <p> Golden light surged, as Divine Weapons appeared. </p>
        <p> Axes, hooks, and forks, all filled with terrifying murderous intent rushed out. </p>
        <p> Divine Armoury! </p>
        <p> When Gu Changge unleashed this power, the Divine Weapons rushed out one by one, surging with light as they
            pierced through everything, slaughtering the many elites of the Tiangou Clan. </p>
        <p> His destination? The Tiangou Hall. It was there that he would face the greatest of their leaders. </p>
        <p> ‘This guy, is he planning to break in alone?’ Gu Nanshan frowned, as he flew high in the sky. </p>
        <p> He noticed that when Gu Changge had a smile at the corners of his mouth when he looked at the sky… </p>
        <p> ‘Why?’ </p>
        <p> ‘Does he know I’m here?’ </p>
        <p> Gu Nashan understood this junior less and less. But one thing was for certain: Gu Changge’s smile carried
            ill intent. </p>
        <p> ‘Perhaps I’m overthinking it again?’ Gu Nanshan was even more puzzled than he was before. </p>
        <p> His Cultivation Base was far too higher than Gu Changge’s for him to be noticed. </p>
        <p> Naturally, Gu Changge didn’t notice. </p>
        <p> It was only thanks to Gu Xian’er’s Dao Bones that Gu Changge could vaguely get a feel for her location. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge had finally arrived at the depths of the Tiangou Clan. </p>
        <p> The void was filled with dozens of dazzling Divine Weapons. They contained such sharpness that even those in
            the Heavenly God Realm would be killed in an instant. </p>
        <p> Everyone's eyes widened. So many divine weapons, all of which were imbued with Dao Marks, all of them
            containing tremendous value. And yet, Gu Changge merely threw them away. </p>
        <p> To say they were shocked at such a blatant display of wealth is an understatement. </p>
        <p> As for the young creatures who stood in his way, they were all crushed. </p>
        <p> <b>Puff! Puff!</b> </p>
        <p> <b>[In the depths of the Tiangou Clan]</b> </p>
        <p> A magnificent city shone, built with large shining pieces of azure stone. </p>
        <p> Currently, it was in the midst of collapse, being torn apart by the surging divine lights of the ancient
            warships. Its walls were unable to hold for even the briefest of moments! </p>
        <p> <b>“By the immortals, that damned Gu Changge…”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Hurry, the ancestor must awaken!</b> </p>
        <p> The two Tiangou clansmen screamed in both horror and despair. </p>
        <p> One by one, they instantly burst into pieces, unable to put up any meaningful resistance in front of Gu
            Changge. </p>
        <p> The magnificent city wall resembled a mountain, and the tall tower resembled a heavenly palace. </p>
        <p> From the skies descended both the Primordial Divine Sect and the Gu Family’s Invincible Army like a torrent!
        </p>
        <p> The city walls continued to shatter, crack, and collapse, as it was reduced to ashes! </p>
        <p> <b>[In the depths of the clan palace]</b> </p>
        <p> The many leaders of the clan were now in a state of panic. </p>

        </div>
        <p> The city was covered with an endless number of ancient runes that do not belong in this area. Unfortunately,
            because of the conflict, they were agitated and began to explode. </p>
        <p> <b>“There’s still some ways left to go before you hit the Yellow Springs and are left unable to enter the
                cycle of reincarnation once more. Would you like me to help you along?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge casually spoke. He had come here, alone, with no one behind him. </p>
        <p> The war broke out elsewhere, in a very violent and alarming manner. </p>
        <p> However, the Tiangou clansmen in front of him paled, staring in horror as they dared not to make a move.
        </p>
        <p> Even the elders at the Half-Step Sacred Realm were the same. </p>
        <p> It was too strange! </p>
        <p> Obviously, Gu Changge was only at the False God Realm, yet he dared to get in all the way inside? </p>
        <p> Was he stupid? No, he had the wit of a demon. He toyed with the Ancient Immortal Races, stringing everyone
            along. </p>
        <p> So why would that same Gu Changge come here alone? </p>
        <p> Sweat covered their backs as they became vigilant. After all, Gu Changge may have some sort of powerful
            means or a trump card. </p>
        <p> <b>“You have two options: surrender or die.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge smiled, as he casually repeated his earlier declaration. </p>
        <p> He knew that many forces were paying close attention to this area. </p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge, if you have the means, then just use them! Today-”</b> </p>
        <p> A powerhouse of the Tiangou Clan glared at Gu Changge, but before he could finish his words, he was pierced
            by a wisp of Sword Qi, and his soul was instantly destroyed. </p>
        <p> <b>“There’s no need to be shy. In my mercy, I’ve decided to give you a chance. And who knows? I might not be
                so kind the next time.”</b> Gu Changge's expression remained unchanged. </p>
        <p> Slowly, he swept across the frightened Tiangou clansmen in front of him. </p>
        <p> From his fingerbones came a terrible Sword Qi, manifesting into a sword that could seemingly destroy the
            universe itself. </p>
        <p> Behind them was the Tiangou Clan hall. </p>
        <p> Many of their clans’ leaders were gathered there, including the elders and Patriarch Yu Wudi, alongside
            others. All of them looked at Gu Changge with gloomy and angry faces, yet no one dared to do anything. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge sighed a bit. <b>“You’ve hunted me down for so long, and now you don’t want to do anything? Such
                hopeless cowards you are.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge, you have done many wicked things, and you are the mastermind behind this mess. With such a
                villainous heart, there is only one end waiting for you!”</b> </p>
        <p> An Elder spoke with incomparable rage, as a terrible glow protected his body, afraid of any sudden moves Gu
            Changge might make. </p>
        <p> <b>“Wicked things? That can’t be right. Your family is the one who wanted me dead so that you could claim
                credit from the True Dragon Clan. It just so happens that I broke this little game. So how can you blame
                me?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge calmly spoke in front of them, beings in the Half-Step Sacred Realm and the Sacred Realm. </p>
        <p> It seemed as if he didn’t care for the terrifying aura they emitted like it was nothing more than a gentle
            breeze from the calm seaside. </p>
        <p> <b>“What use is there in speaking of matters everyone knows of all too well?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“You are shameless!”</b> </p>
        <p> The elders were immediately angered, irritated by Gu Changge’s attitude. They were almost mad with hatred.
            Never before had there been a day like today where they wanted to kill a junior so badly. </p>
        <p> <b>“Stop! There’s something off about him…”</b> Yu Wudi's expression was as deep as water, as he grabbed the
            clan elder next to him. </p>
        <p> When facing a group of powerful elders in the Sacred Realm, the average cultivator would already be limp on
            the ground. To talk and laugh as Gu Changge had was simply unthinkable. </p>
        <p> The many cultivators outside were practically screaming, as they bore witness to this scene. </p>
        <p> It seems that Gu Changge was bolder than they thought! </p>
        <p> <b>“Look at you, to have lived and cultivated for hundreds of thousands of years… only to have the courage
                of a dog. Do you truly not dare to strike at me?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“At this rate, you may as well just commit suicide. You’d be doing me a huge favour…”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge smiled faintly, his eyes falling towards the battlefield in the other direction. </p>
        <p> Regardless of whether it was the Primordial Divine Sect or the immortal-armoured soldiers, they were
            veterans with incredibly high Cultivation Bases. </p>
        <p> This “battle” was incredibly one-sided. </p>
        <p> The Tiangou Clan has no hope of resistance at all. </p>
        <p> <b>“Don't fall for his tricks. Have you forgotten what happened to Yu Jing?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge's words made the clan elders iron-blue from the sheer rage and humiliation that they had to
            endure. Fortunately, their patriarch was a very sensible individual, stepping in to stop them. </p>
        <p> These words were like a basin of cold water pouring on their heads. </p>
        <p> They instantly snapped out of it. Their anger dissipated, replaced with a cold feeling that crept up to
            their spines. </p>
        <p> This strategy was familiar. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was baiting them, giving him more excuses to slaughter them. </p>
        <p> ‘His methods are too vicious!’ </p>
        <p> They felt a cold hand on their backs. </p>
        <p> <b>“Cowardice to this point is something I didn't expect.”</b> Gu Changge wore a peculiar smile on his
            mouth. </p>
        <p> However, no matter how he ridiculed them, the leaders of the Tiangou Clan were stubborn individuals. Though
            they were angry, they dared not strike at him. </p>
        <p> In truth, Gu Changge himself was surprised. He did all of this to drag his Gu Family’s ancestor into the
            waters, forcing him to take action. </p>
        <p> However, Gu Changge never expected the Tiangou Clan to be so fearful that they wouldn’t dare do anything to
            him. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge rubbed his brows, as he felt a headache starting to surface. </p>
        <p> He showed a helpless look as he simply looked at the sky and directly asked. </p>
        <p> In a natural tone of voice, he then said, <b>“Ancestor, this matter has become dull. Handle it yourself; I
                will leave it to you.”</b> </p>
        <p> As he spoke, his eyes carried a meaningful smile before swiftly returning to normal. </p>
        <p> ‘What?!’ </p>
        <p> Gu Changge's words weren’t imposing, but at this moment, they echoed through the area. </p>
        <p> All the outside cultivators and natives were startled, unable to help but stare. </p>
        <p> The shock continued for a while. </p>
        <p> ‘What did Gu Changge mean?’ </p>
        <p> ‘An ancestor?’ </p>
        <p> ‘Could there really be an ancestor of the Gu Family hiding in secret?’ </p>
        <p> ‘Is that why Gu Changge was so confident?’ </p>
        <p> Many cultivators followed Gu Changge's gaze, but there was nothing to be seen. </p>
        <p> However, this was an ancestor of the Gu Family, after all. To see nothing was natural. </p>
        <p> <b>“Daoist Brother… “</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Ancestor… “</b> </p>
        <p> Both the Great Elder and Gu Xian’er, who also hid in the sky, were stunned. </p>
        <p> Neither of them expected Gu Changge to have prior arrangements with Gu Nanshan. </p>
        <p> No wonder Gu Nanshan had such a cordial and optimistic attitude towards Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er was a bit startled, as she seriously began to consider the situation. It would seem that this
            ancestor of her line has a good relationship with Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> Otherwise, Gu Changge would not say such a thing. </p>
        <p> If they were on opposite sides, Gu Changge shouldn’t have said those words. </p>
        <p> It would appear that the two were actually in cahoots, something that the ancestor had neglected to tell
            her. </p>
        <p> This only served to strengthen Gu Xian’er’s suspicions. </p>
        <p> ‘Gu Changge is definitely hiding something!’ </p>
        <p> ‘This abominable junior..’ </p>
        <p> The dry smoke in Gu Nanshan's mouth fell out. He was stunned. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test
            updates</p>
        <p> He didn't expect Gu Changge to know of his exact location, let alone say something so easily misunderstood.
        </p>
        <p> He had never met Gu Changge before, having barely encountered him, let alone spoken to him. </p>
        <p> He was completely taken aback by Gu Changge’s words. </p>
        <p> Who knew that Gu Changge would suddenly say something like that? </p>
        <p> ’I’ve been had!’ </p>
        <p> [PR/N: He got gotten!] </p>
        <p> Gu Nanshan's expression was as black as coal, as thoughts of giving Gu Changge a good beating rose in his
            mind. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, it just so happens that he had no choice but to show up!</p>

          saw this enemy of his who was constantly on his mind. However, he hid
          his emotions well and only clenched his fists tight. He couldn&#8217;t
          forget how Gu Changge drove everyone to death by acting differently
          than he promised back in the Vermilion Bird Empire. If it
          weren&#8217;t for how lucky he was to be rescued by An Xi when he fell
          into and floated along a river after falling off a cliff, he would

          expression on her face, and she became slightly frozen and awkward. Of
          course, she heard what Gu Changge said. She would have lost her temper
          a long minute ago if it was any other people who said that to her.
          However, she didn&#8217;t dare do so in front of Gu Changge.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The biggest reason why she tried to trick Gu Xianer was that she
          thought Gu Changge was not in Dark Kun City. Gu Xianer had always
          acted alone, and she had no other members of the Gu Family or experts
          around her. In other words, she was someone commonly known as a
          pushover.</span

          >However, she recovered quickly by putting on a surprised smile. She
          looked very natural as she lightly cupped her hands towards Gu Changge
          who was walking towards them. &#8220;An Xi greets you, Young Master
          Changge.&#8221;

          attitudes a little apprehensive. After the battle in the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains, Gu Changge&#8217;s fame and power in the
          Upper Realm soared to an unimaginably terrifying level. Even True
          Daoists didn&#8217;t dare to act presumptuously in front of him and
          needed to be cautious, let alone these members of the An Clan.</span

          as they greeted him. &#8220;We greet you, Young Master Changge.&#8221;
          The King with Six Crowns, the Phoenix Lady, Chosen Monk Jin Chan and
          the others looked slightly uncomfortable, but they dared not be rude
          in front of Gu Changge. The emotions running through them were
          complicated. Gu Changge used to be someone who they could compare
          themselves to, but now they couldn&#8217;t even see Gu Changge&#8217;s
          back.</span

          >When the shopkeeper at Stone Gathering Square saw Yin Mei behind Gu
          Changge, his expression changed slightly, and he wanted to come to
          greet her. However, he could only smile wryly in regret for not
          stepping up and speaking out after he noticed the look in her eyes,
          telling him to save his pleasantries.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge&#8217;s expression remained unchanged as if he
          hadn&#8217;t seen An Xi&#8217;s actions. As he walked straight past
          her and towards Gu Xianer, An Xi&#8217;s face turned stiff in
          embarrassment, but she still didn&#8217;t let it show. She could only
          remain in the same pose she greeted him in, despite it looking
          somewhat awkward.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone watched on with different expressions on their faces. Many
          Sect Masters, too, were invested, and they seemed as though they
          weren&#8217;t bothered by how things might turn out. An Xi seemed to
          be in her element when she tried to scheme against Gu Xianer earlier.
          Although she wasn&#8217;t arrogant, it was hard to hide that naturally
          contemptuous attitude of hers. To An Xi, Gu Xianer was just a young
          lady who wouldn&#8217;t be able to compare to her in terms of
          scheming.</span

          >&#8220;You! What are you doing here?&#8221; Taken aback, Gu Xianer
          asked upon seeing Gu Changge&#8217;s sudden arrival. Even though there
          was a happy glint in her eyes when she came back to her senses, she
          managed to hide it well while keeping her tone casual and indifferent.
          She was aware that Gu Changge should be in Dark Kun City, otherwise no
          one would have kept track of her like bodyguards before. Still, she
          didn&#8217;t think Gu Changge would come to Stone Gathering Square in
          person.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          didn&#8217;t come. I didn&#8217;t know that even insects would try to
          trick you! I have seen something new today.&#8221; Gu Changge glance
          at her and shook his head lightly. He could tell that she felt
          aggrieved and wronged despite her face staying as cold as ever. [This
          silly girl can&#8217;t deal with schemes at all. She doesn&#8217;t
          even dare make a move against them. She will be the one who ends up
          with the shorter end of the stick if she quietly lets them take it
          away.]</span

          but she still insisted stubbornly. Having Gu Changge by her side gave
          her a sense of stability that was hard to describe in words.</span

          cheer up.&#8221; Seeing how upset she was from the unfair treatment,
          Gu Changge suddenly smiled and reached out to pat her head, his eyes
          darkening a little.</span

          turned pink under everyone&#8217;s watchful eyes. She glared at Gu
          Changge as she stretched out her fair and slender hand to slap his
          hand off her head disdainfully. &#8220;Also, don&#8217;t you dare take
          advantage of me.&#8221;.</span

          softly when she heard this. She obviously didn&#8217;t take these

          the back of their torsos. The members of the An Clan, especially,
          shuddered a little bit when they felt unnerved because of Gu
          Changge&#8217;s words just now. [&#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t be leaving this

          something that belongs to Lady Xianer. I was only concerned about her
          not recognising the characters on the page, and I thought of
          translating them for her. After all, this was left behind by an
          Ancestor of our family. Apart from the An Clan, there are only a few
          other families who can read the writings on it. Also, this page might

          able to get this piece of paper that would definitely have escaped.
          Technically speaking, she did nothing wrong. This was exactly what was
          clever about An Xi. No matter how strong Gu Changge was, he

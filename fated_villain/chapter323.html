<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge has gone too far! Does he really think that I dare not do anything to him just because he’s the Young Master of the Immortal Gu Family? This whole mess has nothing to do with me. It&#8217;s that Great Elder who is protecting Sky King Zhi Yang. Not me. Even so, that bastard dares not only put my daughter under house arrest, but also dares to sprout nonsense about letting me experience the joys of being a grandfather!? How dare he!?&#8221; Liu Ming, the Sect Master of Purple Mansion roared. He had naturally heard the many rumors that were floating around outside. He was so enraged, he nearly went mad and laughed. Even when his eyes were crescent in shape, there were still flames of hatred within.</span><span id="more-28484"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, he had favorable impressions of Gu Changge. He was such a young, good-looking man who cared about upholding justice for the whole world. Furthermore, his behavior was hinting that he would become a great man in the future. Thus, he would have never expected his daughter, Liu Ziyan, to be placed under house arrest by him. Furthermore, use her to threaten Purple Mansion to hand over the whereabouts of Sky King Zhi Yang.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Even if you threaten me, what use is there? How would I know where Zhi Yang is? What’s more, what can I do when the other person insisting on protecting him is the Great Elder? His authority within Purple Mansion is no less than mine. What’s more, also another old powerful expert that had just reawakened, who greatly favours Zhi Yang!] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liu Ming, knowing that he could do little with the two siding to protect Zhi Yang, tried to turn a blind eye to the matter and let it be handled by the Great Elder. How would he have known that he would have to take the fall for no reason? As the Sect Master of Purple Mansion no less. How was it possible for him to not be livid?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If his daughter really gave him a big surprise when she returns to the sect, he was afraid that he would really lose all rationality and rush to the Immortal Gu Family to make a scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sect Master, please calm down. We were in the wrong with this in the first place, but no matter what, now that the Purple Mansion’s Saintess is with Gu Changge, we can&#8217;t provoke him and make him unhappy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s right. The Saintess is exceptionally beautiful and is a sight that is rare to behold. What if Gu Changge suddenly can&#8217;t help himself and does something reckless&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, the few Elders also began to persuade him with bitter smiles. As experts of the older generation, if they intervened in this matter, they would be suspected of bullying the weak, the younger generation. If that were to happen,the powers backing Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t sit by and do nothing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the situation evolved to that, Purple Mansion would be placed in a disadvantage. Not to mention, there were forces unrelated to this matter secretly eyeing at Purple Mansion covetously. Now, the only thing they had to stand firm on, was that no one currently could come out and prove that Sky King Zhi Yang was really related to the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, their attempts at persuasion did not work. Instead, they made the Sect Master even angrier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He wouldn’t dare! Damn it! That Gu Changge! He is driving me mad! And here I’ve even thought that he would become a great man in the future. Someone who would stand atop the Upper Realm.&#8221; The Sect Leader, Liu Ming, began to pace back and forth, along the hall, with a gloomy face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it weren&#8217;t for the prestige of his Sect and the other forces, he would have personally gone to the Black Tortoise Empire to save Liu Ziyan and also teach that bastard, Gu Changge, a lesson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you so worried about Changge, my dear? Ziyan is smart and intelligent. It would be impossible for her to suffer and be wronged. Besides, this is also an opportunity for her.&#8221; Then, a gentle voice suddenly came from outside the hall. It was from an elegant and beautiful woman. She held a Communication Rune in her hand as she said with a smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Sect Mistress.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Elders all bowed to her, and then looked at each other before tacitly dismissing themselves. This woman was none other than the Sect Master’s wife. A woman who he loves dearly. These two also both doted on their only daughter, Liu Ziyan, very much.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dear…&#8221; The anger on the Sect Master’s face vanished when he saw the approaching figure. Then, a gentle smile appeared on his face. He walked up to her and asked curiously, &#8220;Dear, what do you mean by that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the message that Ziyan had sent me. You can read it yourself. If we have a grandson, I wouldn’t be sure who will suffer losses.&#8221; His wife smiled and handed the Communication Rune to Liu Ming. In her opinion, the reason why Gu Changge had said so was just to embarrass Purple Mansion. He was not seriously going to do it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if he did something to her, with his status, he had to be responsible for her and when the time comes, it would also save her some trouble. After all, Liu Ziyan was a very famous Saintess of Purple Mansion. Famous in the entire Upper Realm. She was as ethereal as could be, irresistible to any man. Even so, as her mother, she was worried that her daughter&#8217;s standards were too high, and she would not find a suitable husband in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter in Talent, background, or strength, there was no better person than Gu Changge. Even if a mistake arises from chance, it would be a blessing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sect Master, Liu Ming, didn&#8217;t know what was on his wife&#8217;s mind. He looked at the Communication Rune in his hand and tried to figure out what was on her mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Ziyan sent back a message? Is it because that bastard had bullied her?&#8221; But soon, he was stunned with his eyes wide open. He didn&#8217;t believe it. Then, he frowned and sighed deeply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading everything in the rune, Liu Ming found it difficult to keep calm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Putting her under house arrest is only a front to the public? I didn&#8217;t expect things to be like this. Seems like, there are times when I, too, judged too quickly. With Ziyan’s personality, it&#8217;s impossible for her to lie to me. Still, he is such a scheming man!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ha…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am also very aware of what Ziyan is worried about… Since Gu Changge now insists that Zhi Yang give him an explanation, then I can only cooperate with him&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liu Ming hesitated for a while and regained his composure. In the Communication Rune, Liu Ziyan had already said everything she needed to say. Including the reason why Gu Changge invited her to tea that day, and what happened after. In addition, during this period, she got along well with Gu Changge, drinking tea and playing chess, and occasionally discussing the Great Dao, which was all in all, quite leisurely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn&#8217;t sound like she was under house arrest at all. Liu Ziyan was even having fun. It was rare for her to find a sense of liking towards someone of the opposite sex.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this matter, Liu Ming could tell that Gu Changge had taken a tough stance. Right now, there were only two choices placed in front of him. One was to protect Sky King Zhi Yang, making many other factions, including Gu Changge, his enemies. The other was to cooperate with Gu Changge to search for the whereabouts of Sky King Zhi Yang, and to announce that Sky King Zhi Yang had nothing to do with Purple Mansion. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dear, you&#8217;d better think about it carefully. After all, this is related to the future of Purple Mansion. Even the slightest misstep might cause you to face a brutal death. You might even die without a burial place.&#8221; His wife also persuaded him. After all, one option involved a matter that had to deal with the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liu Ming frowned and sighed deeply. He felt that the matter was very troublesome and difficult to handle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those behind Sky King Zhi Yang are ancient, and at the same time, have an inseparable relationship with me. If we kick him out of the Sect because of this… I can&#8217;t make a decision on this matter alone…&#8221; Hearing this, his wife replied. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take a step back and claim that it has nothing to do with you? It was the Great Elder alone who did it. Although we will offend him, there’s nothing else we can do about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s true. Then, we would do just as you say.&#8221; Liu Ming pondered for a while and then nodded. He began to give orders and also write the relevant commands. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, a piece of news spread from Purple Mansion, causing a huge sensation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Sect Master of Purple Mansion, if Sky King Zhi Yang had anything to do with the Successor of Demonic Arts, he would be the first to kill him, ensuring that he would not be able to cause any trouble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the news spread, it caused a huge sensation like an earthquake. Everyone was taken aback. They had never expected this to happen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did the Sect Master of the Purple Mansion give in to Gu Changge? Or does he have some other goal in mind?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many speculations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the Sect Master of the Purple Mansion had already declared his stance, but Purple Mansion was still protecting Sky King Zhi Yang. So, what does this mean? It meant that those inside Purple Mansion were clashing!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as this statement appeared, many were shocked. They realized that the Purple Mansion did not come to a unified opinion. Some wanted to protect Sky King Zhi Yang, but there were also some who needed the matter to be dealt with, fairly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the Purple Mansion’s Sect Master had declared his stance, if something uncontrollable happened later on, it would also leave a chance for the Purple Mansion to distance themselves from the situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone in Purple Mansion intended to be the enemy of everyone in the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, no matter what, the situation would only become more dangerous each day, if Sky King Zhi Yang continues to not show himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole Black Tortoise Empire was immersed in an atmosphere where it seems like the rising wind forebodes the coming storm, coming events cast their shadows before them. During this period, outside the Purple Mansion’s mountain gates, an ancient existence from Sky Emperor Mountain came forward to seek justice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no doubt that a horrible battle broke out subsequently. Outside Purple Mansion, many mountains and rivers turned into dust. Some even saw the stars fall from the sky. Many disciples and cultivators of Purple Mansion felt deeply uneasy. When they were walking outside, they encountered a lot of attacks, and were regarded as accomplices of the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these made many disciples of Purple Mansion resent Sky King Zhi Yang. It was he who had provoked this disaster, so why did they have to be the ones who suffer in the end?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">……</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the depths of the Black Tortoise Empire. In the magnificent and ancient palace. Two beings sat opposite each other, with the fragrance of the tea lingered in the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Bam!* </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the last piece fell, the situation on the chessboard instantly changed. The pieces on the chessboard crisscrossed, and it was as though there was a divine light surging from it. It seems as though a true Phoenix was about to leap across the Nine Heavens but was beheaded by a saber, and its blood splashed into the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You’ve lost again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smiled and looked at the woman in a purple dress in front of him.</span></p>

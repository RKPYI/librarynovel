          over, his eyes flashed as he closely stared at Gu Changge. In fact, at
          this moment, both he and the Phoenix Lady had some other thoughts. Of
          course, they were not thinking of challenging him. Instead, they were
          questioning if he was really hurt or not. [Are his injuries really
          that serious? Is he even injured in the first place? Could it be just
          him trying to fool others into believing he is injured? If so, then
          his purpose was to lure them in, into believing they had a chance to
          take him out. Just like earlier.]</span

          injuries, and it appeared to be serious. However, when he made his
          move, his aura was too huge and thick, seemingly inexhaustible. It was
          so suffocating that one couldn&#8217;t help but kneel. In fact, even a
          Sacred King Realm expert could not easily contend against him, and it
          is hard to tell who’s the victor in the end. And, if he really was
          injured, how could he be so powerful and terrifying? Even activating
          his Sacred Emperor Grade artifact.]</span

          bit.&#8221; Hearing this, Gu Changge smiled slightly. His handsome
          face was a little pale. As he spoke, blood trickled down from the
          corner of his mouth again. It seemed as if he was still seriously
          injured.</span

          invincible he was moments ago. [Is this something someone who is
          seriously injured can accomplish? If we look at it another way, he had
          used his own injuries as bait, and pulled the net when his targets got
          inside.]</span

          him. She was someone who knows how to repay others’ kindness. Although
          he claimed to put her under house arrest in this place, only Liu Ziyan
          herself knew that in reality, she was being treated like a guest, and
          felt very comfortable while staying here. She even had tea and played
          chess with Gu Changge from time to time. Thus, her life was quite
          leisurely and carefree.</span

          were in trouble.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and looked at her again,
          &#8220;but as for you, are you not hurt?&#8221;</span

          rosy scene, especially Liu Ziyan’s attitude towards this matter, made
          many confused. They didn&#8217;t understand why she would say such
          words to Gu Changge. [Wait… shouldn&#8217;t she hate him?]

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          The two of them reacted almost in an instant and couldn&#8217;t help
          but sigh, &#8220;I see. Brother Gu, you are so thoughtful and
          farsighted. I really admire your.&#8221;</span

          be honest, during this period, I’m Young Master Changge’s guest. I am
          not under house arrest as the rumours states.&#8221;</span

          of Demonic Arts runs very deep. If Purple Mansion obstinately sticks
          to the wrong course, the only end for them is destruction. I
          don&#8217;t want to see such a scene, so after Young Master Changge
          told me of his plan, to deceive Purple Mansion with him, I agreed.
          Still, I&#8217;m the one who benefits from all this. So, I’m the one
          who has caused all the recent bad rumours about Young Master Changge.
          I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to clarify that this really
          has nothing to do with him. At the end of the day, I was the one who
          dragged him into this mess.&#8221;</span

          Perhaps other than Gu Changge, no one else could come up with such a
          plan. Moreover, for the other cultivators, it was impossible for them
          to work together with Saintess Ziyan even if they wanted to because
          they did not have the qualifications and courage to do so.</span

          the enemy sent a man in black robe, who was at the Peak of the Sacred
          Lord Realm, to assassinate me. Fortunately, Young Master Changge

          Therefore, they retreated. Even if they weren’t able to assassinate
          Brother Changge, they wanted to at least cause him trouble.&#8221; At
          this time, seeing that many were still confused, the Phoenix Lady

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Moreover, the fact that the Successor of Demonic Arts had sent out
          the black robed man to assassinate Saintess Ziyan infuriated many as
          well. During this period, they had been searching everywhere for
          traces of the Successor of Demonic Arts. The fact that the Successor
          of Demonic Arts was able to send the black robed man to Gu Changge’s
          place silently and unknowingly meant that he was definitely somewhere
          not far from the Black Tortoise Empire.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, many young prodigies became vigilant and were anxious because
          of this. If they encountered the Successor of Demonic Arts at this
          time, they would not be a match for him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, they now knew more of Gu Changge’s strength, even if it
          was still the tip of the iceberg. How much strength was still hidden?
          Did anyone know? Regardless, it helped them gauge how strong the
          Successor of Demonic Arts was, and it frightened them.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before this, many thought that although the Successor of Demonic Arts
          was very strong, he was not that invincible. However, it had been
          revealed that this was mostly an after effect of Gu Changge concealing
          his true strength too well.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even ancient monstrosities like Prince Shen got tricked into thinking
          he had a good chance of winning against the Successor of Demonic Arts.
          That was why he couldn&#8217;t wait to chase after the Successor of
          Demonic Arts after hearing news about him. It eventually resulted in
          him getting set up and losing his life.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After this incident, many people were on high alert against the
          Successor of Demonic Arts. They would never assume again that they
          could kill the Successor of Demonic Arts after meeting him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, Gu Changge became more than just world-famous. He became
          someone that would be remembered throughout the ages.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >During this period, the situation that Purple Mansion was facing was
          not optimistic. Even now, many signs showed that there was a
          connection between Sky King Zhi Yang and the Successor of Demonic
          Arts. Sky King Zhi Yang had become so cruel that he even wanted to
          assassinate Saintess Ziyan, just to cause Gu Changge some
          trouble.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Under such circumstances, some in Purple Mansion still wanted to
          protect him. They even announced that there was no evidence. That it
          was just Gu Changge wanting to frame Sky King Zhi Yang. That Saintess
          Ziyan had colluded with an outsider to betray the Sect. They even went
          so far as to curse her, saying that she would definitely be punished
          one day!
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Naturally, such an announcement caused a huge sensation in an
          instant.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many people realised that something must have happened within Purple
          Mansion. After all, she was the daughter of Purple Mansion’s Sect
          Master! It was impossible for the Sect Master to label her as a
          traitor like this.</span

          >&#8220;It seems that Purple Mansion is no longer under the its own
          Sect Master’s control…&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and sat upright in his
          seat at the table, gently blowing into the teacup in front of
          him.</span

          seemed to be in low-spirit. She didn&#8217;t expect that things would
          turn out like this</span

      </p>

      <p>

          >&#8220;All we need to do now is to find Sky King Zhi Yang.&#8221; Gu
          Changge placed the cup down and stood up. He narrowed his eyes and his
          smile seemed to hide a deeper meaning.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Liu Ziyan looked at him in a daze. Suddenly, she felt that Gu Changge
          at this moment was a little strange compared to the person she was
          familiar with a few days ago. There was a kind of profound
          indifference, with him overlooking everything. He felt lofty and
          superior, completely different from the gentle and elegant person she
          knew.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >But soon, a slight smile appeared on his face again. Gu Changge said
          gently, &#8220;In fact, Saintess Ziyan, you don&#8217;t need to worry.
          Once Sky King Zhi Yang dies, even those ancient fossils in Purple
          Mansion, who have been protecting him, would have no choice but to
          accept defeat. If they want to resist&#8230;&#8221; He stopped talking
          and smiled mysteriously.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Afterward, Gu Changge walked out of the hall and began to summon his
          many followers, not caring that Liu Ziyan was still in a daze. In
          fact, Liu Ziyan was no longer useful to him. The bait had already been
          set. If Liu Ziyan was really assassinated by Sky King Zhi Yang at this
          time, he need not care about it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, are you really going to find where Sky
          King Zhi Yang is hiding?&#8221; Liu Ziyan asked after she came to her
          senses.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t answer. Instead, he smiled and said,
          &#8220;Saintess Ziyan, you better go back to Purple Mansion to have a
          look this time. I don&#8217;t think your father&#8217;s condition is
          too good.&#8221; After he finished speaking, his figure flashed and
          appeared in the sky outside. His eyes were cold. With a wave of his
          sleeve, he said to the many followers who were rushing over, &#8220;I
          already know where Sky King Zhi Yang is hiding. Today, we will
          definitely take him down.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Rumble!* The next moment, the void trembled, and a terrifying aura
          pervaded everywhere. In an instant, a portal opened up in front of
          everyone, connected to another space. It was golden, surging, and
          vast. It seemed to be connected to another space.</span

          >&#8220;A Space Tunnel&#8230;&#8221; Liu Ziyan looked at this scene in
          shock. Before this, she had seen such a skill performed in the hands
          of the Immortal Academy’s Elders and Purple Mansion’s ancient
          monstrosities.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Creating a Space Tunnel with one&#8217;s own strength was something
          only those who had a deep understanding of Space Principles could
          accomplish. This was something that required the person to at least be
          in the Sacred Emperor Realm!

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >The next moment, Gu Changge took the lead in moving forward, and his
          many followers hurried after him. The vast, powerful Space Tunnel
          overshadowed the entire Capital of the Black Tortoise Empire.</span

          >&#8220;So, he’s going to finally make his move?&#8221; In a manor,
          the King with Six Crowns suddenly stood up. His eyes flashed with a
          terrifying aura. Afterward, he set out as well, guessing that this
          battle would very likely attract the Successor of Demonic Arts. Of
          course, that was just a possibility.</span

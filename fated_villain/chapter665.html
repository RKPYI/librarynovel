        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge froze, seeing Chan Honyi behaving like this for the first time.</span><span id="more-34830"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Chan Honyi turned around and stared at Su Qingge, her rich hair disorderly danced to the mountain breeze. Her eyes bore coldness as she revealed a grin, which was terrifyingly striking. As if she was a witch that doomed the world, she destroyed her former serenity and naturalness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Chan Honyi in such a state was the Demoness in Red whom the Immortal and Formidable Forces feared so deeply, and her tranquillity and extraordinariness were nothing but a facade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Su Qingge quickly came to her senses and asked, &#8220;Master, who are you talking about? Why would I be familiar with him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chan Honyi&#8217;s expression soon reverted to its previous state as she replied with a grin, &#8220;Because you know him very much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Su Qingge was dazed once again as a dashing figure slowly faded in her mind, rendering her surprised and dismayed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you talking about Young Master Gu?&#8221; she muttered, thinking that it was impossible, but after a moment of thorough contemplation, she couldn&#8217;t think of anyone else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in Dark Kun City, the Demoness in Red appeared and demanded one of the Divine Rocks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that Gu Changge once fought her, his attitude towards her was rather casual, as if he was reminiscing with an old friend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in many cultivators&#8217; eyes, Gu Changge and the Demoness in Red only resembled old acquaintances as they had once fought each other in the Divine City, which was also what Su Qingge had initially assumed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, judging by the situation, the Demoness in Red and Gu Changge&#8217;s relationship seemed deeper, and their relationship was more than meets the eye.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Chan Honyi&#8217;s attitude towards Gu Changge was also unusual, to an extent where Su Qingge thought that their bond was so deep that their feelings for each other were in the bones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Su Qingge was smart enough to refrain from asking about it, but given how Chan Honyi suddenly brought it up, she must have done it with a purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Dark Heaven’s appearance is related to Young Master Gu? What else is he hiding from the world?] The more Su Qingge learnt, the more she perceived Gu Changge as an unpredictable entity of enigma.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, why are you telling me these? Is there something you want me to do?&#8221; Su Qingge questioned after a moment of silence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She understood that after Chan Honyi emerged from Demon-Burying Abyss, there was a period wherein she remained unconscious and was extremely aggressive. During that period, the number of people that had died by her hands was uncountable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, Chan Honyi retained her straight face as a strange sensation flashed across her eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m merely warning you. That you, the so-called Successor of Demonic Arts, are not the biggest disaster to this world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand. But I&#8217;ve never meant to become any kind of disaster to anyone. I just want to live in peace, but that is not up to me apparently. All I wanted was to grab a hold of my destiny and not be someone else&#8217;s puppet.&#8221; Determination zoomed across Su Qingge&#8217;s beguiling face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right away, Chan Honyi chortled aloud, her beauty filled with alluring demonicness. She was indifferent, and her voice was cold and emotionless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s not up to you, as your destiny is predetermined. The person you love and trust the most has actually been looking down on you with his cold gaze somewhere up there. The sentiment you feel is nothing but a result of deliberate pretence. Do you really think he&#8217;d miss the fact that your body bears two souls, the fact that you possess the legacy of Demonic Arts? Forget your flawed Demonic Arts, even all the things I know were taught by him personally. How ludicrous!&#8221; Chan Honyi laughed aloud, yet her divine voice bore immense resentment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? Impossible…&#8221; Hearing that, Su Qingge was stunned as though she was struck by lightning. Her face blanched as she subconsciously stepped backwards in disbelief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had those words been spoken by someone else, she would have suspected them, but now, the speaker was none other than the Demoness in Eed herself, who was feared by the Upper Realm, and there was no reason for her to lie to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Master and Young Master Gu shared a bond this deep, and she was a direct disciple of him? Where did Young Master Gu come from? Has he been tricking me all this time? Him helping me to conceal my identity as the Successor of Demonic Arts… was it also all just deception?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing how Su Qingge reacted as she expected, Chan Honyi retained her faint grin, as though she was eager to see Su Qingge making such a face. Gu Changge wished to maintain his tender, unique image in Su Qingge&#8217;s mind, but Chan Honyi had no intentions of allowing things to go his way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will personally destroy everything you possess…&#8221; Chan Honyi glared at the end of the sky as frightening aggression and demonicness surged in the depths of her eyes, but it only took her a second to revert to her exceptionally calm state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past few days, the Upper Realm had been growing more chaotic, and cultivators figured that a terrorising disaster would very soon arise to haunt them. Various Forces were commanded to recall their disciples out in training to silently wait for the disaster to end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the emergence of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom and the overwhelming spread of the Eternal Overcast, along with the rise of the even more mysterious Dark Heaven, an organisation assumed to have been hiding in the dark like a phantom all this time, it left the people greatly distressed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, the chaos in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty that startled the Forces of the Upper Realm was gradually exposed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the peak of Capital, Emperor Yu fought with his former brother, Yu Tianzheng, and his failure to take the former down led to his death. Even the Chaos Dao Sword, the Guardian Sword of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty proved inferior to Yu Tianzheng.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That night, brutal battles broke out, turning rivers red and causing horrendous uproar throughout the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, countless trembled in dejection and panic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many armies from outside the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty invaded, flames of war swept through the vast territory of the Celestial Dynasty, while numerous other Forces took advantage of the chaos in their favour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to internal and external troubles, the Imperial Ancestors in the depths of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty were forced to appear and intervene in an attempt to put a stop to the mess.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the rules of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, Yu Tianzheng might have been exiled years ago, but the fact that royal blood flowed in his body was undeniable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, since he killed the former Emperor during the battle, he was naturally capable of becoming the next Emperor. Therefore, after discussing it for a while, the Imperial Ancestors decided to adhere to the rules of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and allowed Yu Tianzheng to succeed to the throne.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s virtue and talent were deemed unsuitable, such that even with the help of the ministers he was unable to shoulder the heavy burdens he was obliged to fulfil, he would be forced to relinquish his position to make way for a better candidate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the great chaos slowly waned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of capabilities, Yu Tianzheng was by no means lacking compared to the previous Emperor, and his previous defeat was only the result of being plotted against.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under his ruthless leadership, he eliminated many unruly elements troubling the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. It had also served to establish his dominance as the new Emperor, which kept many individuals under control.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those individuals included dissatisfied people who held power, who then gradually grew silent, unwilling to provoke the rising power of Yu Tianzheng at this point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, some speculated that Yu Tianzheng might be working hand-in-hand with Dark Heaven. Though, such a speculation was not prominent since there was no evidence of him being related to the True Daoists who tried to kill Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the outside world was going through drastic changes, within the depths of the Capital, Yu Tianzheng, the new Emperor, stood in the centre of an ancient, spectacular palace, seemingly softly making a report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if he was a peerless god, he wore a purple gold crown and a wide dragon robe with starry patterns emitting flowing radiance on the sleeves. Nonetheless, his expression seemed extremely humble and reverent, not daring to feign any disrespect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sixty per cent of all territories of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty are now under my grasp. Except for the Military Commander and the former Grand Tutor, the rest have submitted themselves.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of Yu Tianzheng, Gu Changge donned a white robe, gently shaking the thick alcohol inside the White Jade Wine Cup in his hand. His expression was amiable and natural.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems you didn&#8217;t let me down.&#8221; He chuckled and handed the cup to Yin Mei, who was beside him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the new Emperor of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, Yu Tianzheng operated with strict measures, and anyone that displayed the slightest resistance would be submitted to prison right away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, Gu Changge was more fond of Yu Tianzheng compared to the former Emperor as he was more obedient and easy to manipulate. Besides, Yu Tianzheng wouldn&#8217;t provoke him or resort to foolish acts even if there was no benefit offered to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t worried at all by this. After all, Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s life is under his control. And now, he was the true ruler behind the vast territories of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare to.&#8221; Hearing that, Yu Tianzheng replied with a fearful voice, unable to forget how cruelly and brutally Gu Changge murdered the previous Emperor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Upper Realm&#8217;s recent disdain and fear of Dark Heaven, had he not known that Gu Changge was the one who sent forth the True Daoists in black, he probably wouldn&#8217;t have associated him with the matter. Thus, he realised how unimaginable and deep Gu Changge&#8217;s scheming heart was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, his life was now being controlled by Gu Changge. Initially, he partnered up with Gu Changge with an ambitious heart, and now, his wish was granted. He had become the new Emperor of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and fulfilled his revenge that had been his wish for aeons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By the way, Young Master Gu, Yu Feiya seemed to be suspicious of you. She thinks her father&#8217;s death was strange and planned. She&#8217;s been visiting the royal graveyard lately, requesting to meet with the Imperial Ancestor to reveal the matter. Do you think we should look for an opportunity to take action against her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Yu Tianzheng asked with a low voice as he recalled a highly important matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the death of Emperor Yu, Yu Feiya, as the Eldest Princess, remained to be respected and invaluable in the Imperial Palace. Even Yu Tianzheng dared not to touch her as the Royal Family and all those below were all aware of how Yu Feiya&#8217;s birth triggered a huge phenomenon in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As golden lotuses descended from the sky and springs surged on land, divine beams vibrantly shone, illuminating the sky and shedding auspicious signs all across the region. There were even anomalies in the form of soaring dragons and phoenix as well as Celestial Cranes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startled, the Imperial Ancestors of True Daoists&#8217; returned out of their seclusion and they also gifted her some cultivation Techniques.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solely by cultivation Talents alone, Yu Feiya, the Eldest Princess, was superior to all of the younger generation of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. There was no doubt about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the many Elders of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty perceived Yu Feiya as the future Successor, while Yu Lie was unfortunately unappreciated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever Yu Feiya was in trouble, the Elders would grow anxious and that would be troublesome to deal with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, strangeness zoomed across Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes, after which he shook his head and replied, &#8220;No need. Simply tell her that you&#8217;re working for me, and given her some information, she&#8217;ll know what to do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh…&#8221; Yu Tianzheng was stupefied. [Has Yu Feiya been working for Gu Changge all this time as well? What would she think if she were to know that her father was in fact murdered by Gu Changge himself?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, he felt dazed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following days, Gu Changge stayed in the palace, claiming to rest due to his injuries, though he was actually constructing the prototype of the Heavenly Court in his Inner Universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, he had the intentions to do so, but the prototype in his Inner Universe was not complete back then, so the effect of the ‘Ancient Heavenly Court’ and ‘Southern Heavenly Gate’ appearing in the world would be minimal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, Gu changge still remembered how he bumped into a good-for-nothing teenager named Hei Ming of the Black Hawk Clan back when he was searching for the legacy of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being in the Celestial Ancient Content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, Hei Ming wasn&#8217;t totally a good-for-nothing, given that his Talents were much stronger than that of ordinary cultivators, though he was certainly bleak compared to the people of his Clan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the teenager, Gu Changge managed to spread the Entangle Immortal Might and use it to control if not eliminate all the clans of the Celestial Ancient Continent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that time, he presented himself to the teenager through an embryonic prototype of the ‘Ancient Heavenly Court’ he constructed in his Inner Universe. It was so early it was unplanned for at the time that it would be the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, he instructed Hei Ming to collect believers in order to contact the &#8216;Absolute Being,&#8217; but after so long, he never received one word from Hei Ming, so the matter was presumably unsuccessful. After all, Gu Changge was only testing waters without the desire to succeed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, now that Dark Heaven appeared in the Upper Realm, casting its shadow upon the world, it was a fine opportunity to acquire some good catches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, a dazzling burst of light erupted before Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes as a silver portal emerged, emitting brilliant radiance, seemingly linked to another ancient world. Within the portal was a completely different realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three ancient characters, &#8216;Southern Heavenly Gate,&#8217; shone as though they were reflecting off the River of Time, exuding an awe-inspiring power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An imposing and solemn palace stood atop the clouds, and even a single pillar within it seemed capable of supporting the heavens and earth. Surrounded by billowing clouds and dense Chaos Qi, it seemed as though it was the peak of an ancient, boundless universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a sight could tremble all living beings, and a hint of the energy seemed capable of crushing space and destroying all of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge stepped inside, the surrounding energy grew even more intense and radiant, surging like an ocean.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the peak of a palace, a fuzzy figure gradually came into existence, sitting still in its ambiguous, ethereal form as it was surrounded by three thousand ancient worlds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless True Dragons and Celestial Phoenixes perched in the vicinity, while White Tigers and Black Tortoises bowed down, seeming to overlook all of eternity as they rested beyond Reincarnation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The River of Time rushed beneath the creatures&#8217; feet, flowing between the various worlds and realms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, this was still far from sufficient.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is hardly enough to scare the world…&#8221; Gu Changge scowled at the scene. However, since it was merely a prototype for now, it would need some more time to be perfected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, within the Inner Universe, ancient stars gathered at Gu Changge&#8217;s will, transforming into a vast astral universe that then surrounded him. Accordingly, pavilions, palaces and all sorts of buildings began to rise on the ancient stars, seemingly grand and ancient as the aura of the Great Dao wafted around them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, the cultivation resources Gu Changge had collected previously, including the Seven Hued Altar, the Immortal Ancient Sacred Stele, the Supreme Scripture, and Enlightenment, all gushed out at once and transformed into a drizzle of light that then fell into the interior of the buildings, powering them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those who chant the true name shall evoke a true soul into the world. Enter Dark Heaven and be bequeathed with Immortality. For I am the one and only enlightened Absolute Conqueror of Creation within the vast expanse of heaven…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge burned the sacrificial scriptures, solidifying the World Principles of his Inner Universe. He made use of the unceasing Power of Faith from Mortal Palace, which triggered resonance to the cultivators of the outside world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he was basically god of his Inner Universe, who could control all things, certain accidents were inevitable. Now that the Immortal Path was about to emerge, ancient monstersities would begin to surface. Thus, the appearance of Immortal Domain&#8217;s aura might affect his Inner Universe and thereby give him some trouble.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After confirming Jiang Chen and Niu Tian&#8217;s whereabouts, Gu Changge
                temporary put their matter aside since he wasn&#8217;t exactly bothered by those two. After all, they
                were hardly a hindrance right now. Those two were still merely mortal men, even with tremendous luck, it
                would still take them a long time to become somewhat significant to Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes. Thus, Gu
                Changge decided to leave them alone to grow for the time being as they might even surprise him on their
                next encounter.</span><span id="more-28958"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, Gu Changge shifted his concentration onto another matter.
                Intending to fuse Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s Foreseeing Eye and the Purple Chaos Qi Seed, he attempted to
                refine them himself, but he kept noticing something was missing. Even by putting the Chaos Dao Bone into
                the mix, there weren&#8217;t any notable changes. Hence, Gu Changge ordered his men to deliver the
                materials to the Heavenly Arms Domain to have someone else refine them for him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Immortal Gu Family was unquestionably competent, refinement
                wasn&#8217;t precisely their forte.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Heavenly Arms Domain was a special place in the Upper
                Realm, possessing natural terrains untouched by mankind, it harboured more than three thousand innate
                arrays since ancient times, making it a suitable place for cultivators to refine their weapons.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, many popular weapons and Sacred Grade artifacts were
                forged in Heavenly Arms Domain. Even True Daoists, who achieved the Great Dao, who plan to forge Dao
                Artifacts would venture to the Million Fire Domain, which was within Heavenly Arms Domain. There,
                Enlightened Flames, Sacred Flames, and Nirvana Flames were abundant, and there were even sightings of
                traces of Immortal Flames.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given Gu Changge&#8217;s identity, he didn&#8217;t need to spend a lot of
                money and many Elders would still volunteer to take on his commission in order to earn a favour from
                him, so he wasn&#8217;t quite bothered by it. Heavenly Arms Domain was infinitely vast and most of the
                Sects there were those that specialised in refining artifacts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Gu Changge sent his materials, the Foreseeing Eye, Purple Chaos Qi
                Seed, and Chaos Dao Bonem away, even if Purple Mansion were to succeed in rescuing Sky King Zhi Yang,
                they would only come to realise that Sky King Zhi Yang was now no different from a useless person, and
                everything they did was all for nothing.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Once the secret treasure is refined, I may be able to peek into the
                fragments of this timeline&#8217;s future. By then, I no longer have to decipher from what Mingkong is
                doing nor what she says. That being said, she’s a little foolish though. Nonetheless, after
                investigating for so long, she might have actually noticed something.] Gu Changge had plans for the long
                term.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Yue Mingkong was a regressor, many things that happened on her
                previous timeline had now gone off-trail—the death of the Mortal One, the occurrence of the Eternal
                Overcast, the birth of the Successor of the Demon World, the establishment of the Immortal Academy, the
                chaos in the Demon-Burying Abyss—all these incidents went through drastic changes compared to what Yue
                Mingkong had experienced.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, even if Gu Changge were to consult her on the other matters, she
                probably couldn&#8217;t provide a reliable answer, so eventually, he would still have to investigate
                himself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the greater the variables were, the less Yue Mingkong&#8217;s
                advantages as a regressor would become. Besides, in Gu Changge&#8217;s opinion, rather than being a
                regressor, it was more like she gained memories of the future, but those memories were that of the
                normal, intact timeline. As such, she would not be able to figure out why there were so many
                variables.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, Gu Changge summoned his servants and delegated some tasks to
                them. Thereupon, all he had to do now was to wait for the cultivators from Purple Mansion to come rescue
                Sky King Zhi Yang, so he could take all the time he wanted.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, as Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s fate was completely in his hands, he
                wouldn&#8217;t have to fret even if any formidable expert in the Nirvana Realm were to show up. If
                Purple Mansion was smart enough, they would understand that going toe-to-toe against him wouldn&#8217;t
                be of any use. Rather, they would be better off sneaking around and asking around for Sky King Zhi
                Yang&#8217;s whereabouts like Chu Hao was doing. And once they had all bases covered, their chance of
                rescuing Sky King Zhi Yang would indubitably increase.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, judging by Chu Hao&#8217;s recent actions, Gu Changge felt
                as though the former was at the brink of hopelessness, and he was fascinated by the process. The process
                of a Fortuitous One, who constantly opposes him, slowly walking towards dejection and hopelessness.
                Moreover, he already figured out what Chu Hao&#8217;s next move was, and that led to him coming up with
                a way to dwindle Chu Hao&#8217;s Fortuity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Qingge, have you received any news from your sister lately?&#8221; All
                of a sudden, Gu Changge turned to Ji Qingxuan, who was preparing tea beside him, with an uncanny look
                and asked, thinking that he could plant a seed of ambition within Ji Qingxuan to deal with the Hidden Ji
                Family.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? I haven&#8217;t. Young Master, why bring that up so
                suddenly?&#8221; Hearing that, Ji Qingxuan was taken aback as her heart skipped a bit, but after a
                moment, she returned with a question as bafflement and perplexion surged on her face.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given Gu Changge&#8217;s intellect, she believes he already knew that she
                wasn&#8217;t actually her sister, Su Qingge, but he never bothered to expose her, so she could only bear
                and act it through until now. Nonetheless, Gu Changge&#8217;s unexpected question honestly left her
                confused.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is Young Master Gu going to confront me about everything?] Thinking that, Ji
                Qingxuan strangely grew nervous as she subconsciously stopped her tea-making motion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t investigating whether she was working
                with her sister to deceive him, revelation of the matter would mean that she would be sent back to
                Supreme Cave Heaven and continue to be a puppet of her family. And at some point in the future, she
                would be turned into a tool for marriage, and be married off into some unknown family, only to live
                through hell for the rest of her life, as opposed to how she was enjoying her freedom and position
                now.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she was merely Gu Changge&#8217;s maid, that position alone was not
                to be disrespected by anyone else. In fact, many individuals, in order to please Gu Changge, even gave
                her presents in secret, hoping that she could praise and commend them to him. Naturally, she told him
                about the matter, but he simply responded with a smile, obviously unaffected by such
                trivialities.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, Ji Qingxuan genuinely loved and was very satisfied with her
                current life, not daring to imagine what the coercions her family would impose on her if she were to
                leave Gu Changge’s side.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past twenty years, she had lived her life warily on thin ice,
                cultivating every second in hope that she could surpass the young prodigies of her family and earning
                the respect of her family. Alas, she was still unable to escape her fate of becoming a tool for
                marriage. Although Wang Xiao was dead, it was only a matter of time until someone else like him showed
                up, and such was her very destiny.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nothing really. I just happened to remember the stories you told me
                about your past and got curious. It&#8217;s been a long time. Don&#8217;t you want to visit your
                family?&#8221; Gu Changge asked with a subtle smile as he pulled Ji Qingxuan into his embrace.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, Ji Qingxuan certainly felt relieved as liveliness and joy
                instantly surged on her elegant, snowy, flawless face. Frankly, she was rather moved. &#8220;Thank you
                for your concern, Young Master. I never expect you to remember all that.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge then chuckled. &#8220;Oh, is &#8216;Young Master&#8217; a
                forgetful person in your eyes?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hastily, Ji Qingxuan shook her head. &#8220;No, no! In my eyes, you&#8217;re
                the best person in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh really?&#8221; Gu Changge laughed as he lowered his head, rubbing
                his nose against her delicate, impeccable neck and sniffling the flowery aroma on her.
                &#8220;Don&#8217;t you miss your mother?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, nostalgia surged in her charming eyes and she sounded
                somewhat disaffected.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been almost twenty years since my mother was taken away by
                those in the Upper Realm. I&#8217;d be lying if I claimed not to miss her. But I am aware that I&#8217;m
                just some illegitimate daughter born out of discrimination, and I&#8217;ll never be able to see her. To
                the Hidden Ji Family, bloodline and reputation are everything. Back then, my mother&#8217;s escape from
                marriage humiliated the Ji Family in front of many forces, and if it weren&#8217;t for my uncle&#8217;s
                plea, she would have been beaten to death right then. So, how would they ever let me, the disgrace of
                the Ji Family, see my mother?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your sister told you all that?&#8221; Gu Changge leisurely
                asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, she told me about it when I last met her. My sister lived through
                hell all these years. If only she could meet you at an earlier point in her life…&#8221; As Ji Qingxuan
                was speaking, her eyes grew dimmer as if something triggered her emotions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Meet me at an earlier point in her life?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled as
                he noticed the flaw in her story, but he didn&#8217;t care to expose her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm.&#8221; Failing to notice the flaw in her own words, Ji Qingxuan
                gloomily nodded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, have you ever thought of, some day, overthrowing the Hidden Ji
                Family or… taking full control of your family?&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan intuitively widened her eyes, wondering if
                she misheard Gu Changge as she couldn&#8217;t believe what she just heard.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Overthrowing the Hidden Ji Family? Taking full control of my family?] Ji
                Qingxuan understood that given Gu Changge&#8217;s capabilities, him voicing such an idea must mean that
                he had the means to achieve it. And hearing that, she could feel her heart uncontrollably palpitating as
                she forced herself to calm down.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, what do you mean by that…&#8221; Ji Qingxuan
                stuttered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Literally what I said.&#8221; Gu Changge replied with a smile,
                &#8220;Since you look exactly like your sister, by then, all you have to do is follow my instructions
                and no one will notice what&#8217;s truly going on.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Taking control of the Ji Family…&#8221; Ji Qingxuan could feel her
                ambition fiercely growing out of her control. Despite her urges to agree with Gu Changge, she was
                worried that that might be one of his tests for her. Hence, she grew silent.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t feel the need to push her since her
                approval was only eventual. Her Talents were acceptable, yet she was mistreated, and despite her
                tremendous effort, she could never gain the respect of her family. Therefore, all she had for the Hidden
                Ji Family was resentment. Not even the slightest gratitude.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, her current identity was perfect for the job. Once the
                Entanglement Immortal Might was entrusted to her, she would know what to do.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a flash, numerous days had passed. The spectacular Celestial Ancient Army
                was approaching the sky of the Vermilion Bird Empire. Above the billowing grey clouds, ancient
                battleships were flying, as if each of them was a floating continent.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving Gu Changge&#8217;s order, Hei Yanyu sent an enormous army of
                million to strictly surround the vicinity of Vermilion Bird Empire. Their spine-chilling murderous
                intent engulfed every direction of the empire by millions of kilometres.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon such intensity, even wandering cultivators, sensing the bloody scent of
                war that was to come, didn&#8217;t dare to get near as their souls were already shivering.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* As the sky trembled, thousands of blinding beams shot through it.
                Countless rifts opened. At that moment, vast and aggressive, the army of Purple Mansion arose in the
                distant sky, as if they were about to engage anytime.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Vermilion Bird Empire, which was already on the brink of
                destruction, resembled a leaf on the raging waves, as if it could be obliterated and disintegrated
                anytime. The cultivators were witnessing everything in awe and could feel goosebumps all over their
                skin, thinking that a terrorising attack was about to break out above the Vermilion Bird Empire.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the two armies faced each other, their aura gushed into the air. It was as
                just their breathing alone could destroy the sky.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, while the Vermilion Bird Empire was facing its demise, in
                the depths of the extravagant mountains, two individuals were in a hurry to a distant land, as they were
                leaving the territory of the Vermilion Bird Empire. Although they were far away from the daunting aura
                in the distant sky, the shockwave still reached them, causing their hearts to quiver and almost bringing
                them down to their knees.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen&#8217;s face was somewhat blanched. He could still see Gu Changge,
                whom he deeply abhorred, on the ancient battleship that he left previously. Back on the ancient
                battleship, Jiang Chen didn&#8217;t have the chance to experience Gu Changge&#8217;s terrifying aura,
                but now that he could perceive everything clearly, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel horrified.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the army of million rode on clouds and mists while the grand,
                ancient battleships let out thundering sounds as it emitted limitless heavenly lights that covered the
                sun and cast borderless shadows. Such occurrences, which would only happen in tales or legends, was now
                actually happened before his eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, the army of million didn&#8217;t comprise ordinary soldiers.
                All of them were powerful beings, similar to the ones that pursued them, and they could easily destroy
                mountains and rivers with just a puff of air. What was even more shocking was that the horrifying army
                of million was commanded by Gu Changge alone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senior Black, is such a war a rarity in this world?&#8221; Having
                regained his composure, Jiang Chen inquired the elderly man in black robes. For now, he believed that Gu
                Changge wouldn&#8217;t send his men after him. Besides, he feels much safer with the elderly man in
                black robes by his side.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the elder man in black robes&#8217; explanation, Jiang Chen got to know
                his name and that he was a Sectless cultivator who had been looking for a befitting Successor.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the uniqueness of the Everchanging Demonic Arts, the elderly man in
                black robes needed to look for someone who possessed impressive Talents but not a remarkable position,
                and it would be best if the individual wasn&#8217;t treated right by their family or Sects. In other
                words, he was looking for an elite cultivator that didn&#8217;t belong to any forces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Jiang Chen was found to be the most suitable candidate when the
                elderly man in black robes was looking for a worthy Successor at the nearby Sects.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Such a war?&#8221; The elderly man in black robes revealed a
                belittling grin. &#8220;Do you think you get to see an Immortal War everyday? It might not even happen
                once in ten million years. If Purple Mansion hadn&#8217;t angered the world, they wouldn&#8217;t have
                ended up this way.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see…&#8221; Jiang Chen heaved a sigh of relief. &#8220;This is so
                scary. It&#8217;s as if the world is coming to an end.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few days, the elderly man in black robes brought Jiang Chen to
                scour the entire mountain range, but they had only managed to detect traces of his deceased peers. Even
                so, Niu Tian was nowhere to be found. This caused Jiang Chen to feel extremely concerned. It was
                apparent that all his other peers died by the hands of those beings sent by Gu Changge, without any
                survivor. Meanwhile, though there were no trace of him, there was still no telling whether Niu Tian made
                it out alive.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Niu Tian has always been blessed by the Heavens. He&#8217;ll be fine. If
                something happens to him, I&#8217;ll never forgive that bastard!] Jiang Chen&#8217;s eyes grew stone
                cold. With that, he left the area with the elderly man in black robes. As the commencement of the war in
                the sky would soon wipe out the entire region, the nearby Sects had already moved out early on.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately, by conversing with the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of
                Creation, Jiang Chen could sense that the elderly man in black robes was no man of honour. After
                experiencing the annihilation by Gu Changge&#8217;s men, he understood not to judge a person by their
                appearance, and although he trusted the elderly man in black robes, he didn&#8217;t put complete faith
                in him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, Senior Black, given my current strength, how long do you reckon
                it would take me to take my revenge?&#8221; Hearing that, Jiang Chen curiously asked as eagerness surged
                in his eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the words of the elderly man in black robes, he understood the terror of
                the Everchanging Demonic Arts, so he might have a chance of exacting revenge were he allowed some more
                time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given your current strength?&#8221; Immediately, the elderly man in
                black robes let out a snicker and condescendingly remarked, &#8220;Let this old man warn you, it&#8217;s
                best to eliminate that idea from your head. Even in ten thousand years, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to do
                it. Your nemesis is from a totally different world.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are our differences really that huge? Didn&#8217;t you say that the
                Everchanging Demonic Arts is powerful?&#8221; Jiang Chen tensed his brows.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at Jiang Chen&#8217;s sceptical face, the elderly man in black robes
                blatantly mocked, &#8220;Do you understand what the Immortal Gu Family is? It&#8217;s the strongest
                force in the world. Judging by the strength of the Young Master of the Gu Family, he would succeed the
                position as the Head of the Immortal Gu Family in a few years. By then, not a single soul in the Upper
                Realm would dare to defy him. Understand? That is the nemesis you wish to face.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation grew
                wordless in Jiang Chen&#8217;s mind, as the elderly man in black spoke only the truth. Given Jiang
                Chen&#8217;s current aptitude, he was in no position to exact revenge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Not a single soul in the Upper Realm would dare to defy him.&#8217;
                Those words were enough to leave Jiang Chen hopeless and restless. As such, he couldn&#8217;t help but
                wonder how he offended such a powerful figure right after he came to this world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;However, Senior Black, have you heard of the phrase &#8216;never
                underestimate a young one?'&#8221; Swiftly, Jiang Chen composed himself and retained his
                persistence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He understood that the elderly man in black robes&#8217;s unpleasant words
                were only to let him perceive the great disparity between him and Gu Changge for his own good.
                Nevertheless, Jiang Chen deeply believed in one principle: there was more than one way to solve a
                problem as nothing was fixed in this ever-changing world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the Celestial Boat of Creation was in his hands, so how could he
                give up so readily?</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? Well, I can&#8217;t wait to be surprised then,&#8221; the elderly
                man in black robes said with a grin, not hiding any of his sarcasm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Jiang Chen, do not be discouraged by this old man. Once we recreate the
                Celestial Boat of Creation, we&#8217;ll gain its powers and that bastard won&#8217;t even be half of
                what you are!&gt; The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation exclaimed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m not discouraged.] Hearing that, Jiang Chen was unusually calm; his
                eyes were full of confidence. [Yes. I have the Celestial Boat of Creation. It’s my greatest secret amd
                my ultimate trump card!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, he departed from the region with the elderly man in black robes to
                another destination as the silhouette of the Vermilion Bird Empire faded away behind them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Just wait for me, Ruoyin. I promise I&#8217;ll save you!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s the end! There is no hope left! Purple Mansion is approaching and
                they are about to engage Gu Changge&#8217;s army! Hao’er, what should your father do? Are we to watch as
                Vermilion Bird Empire falls?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the palace, the Vermilion Bird Emperor was sitting on the floor, stunned.
                He was speaking with his dread-filled trembling voice. He was just informed today that rifts had opened
                up in the sky a million kilometres away. An army from Purple Mansion was intimidatingly approaching,
                seemingly about to commence a war with Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I got it, Father! I&#8217;ll go to Wan’er and have her beg Gu Changge
                to stand down. I figure this is the only method left&#8230;&#8221; Obviously troubled, Chu Hao gritted
                his teeth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Tang Wan was furious at him and was reluctant to see him, given the
                circumstances, that was the only solution they could opt for. At this point, if they were to do nothing,
                the war between Purple Mansion and Gu Changge would surely lead to the end of the entire Vermilion Bird
                Empire.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately, Chu Hao had been searching for Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s location of
                confinement. However, since Gu Changge had hid Sky King Zhi Yang in a completely unknown location, Chu
                Hao had scoured every underground prison, yet he couldn&#8217;t find any traces of Sky King Zhi Yang.
                Thus, he was even suspecting that Sky King Zhi Yang was actually kept on the ancient battleship floating
                high in the sky. This caused his plan to fall apart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, son…&#8221; In that instant, the face of the Vermilion Bird
                Emperor was paler than snow as he was in absolute despair. He was incredibly opposed to having the
                Vermilion Bird Empire fall under his reign, and his biggest regret was to keep Chu Hao in the empire
                when he should have sent him back to his Sect after dealing with the Eternal Overcast Crisis. That way,
                Chu Hao wouldn&#8217;t have offended Gu Changge for defending his Junior.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it, Father. I&#8217;ll go to Wan’er right away.
                Uncle Master, I shall leave my father&#8217;s safety to you.&#8221; Having said that, Chu Hao promptly
                headed to the manor where Tang Wan usually resided.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Bai Yang nodded, his gaze was complicated. With how things have escalated,
                the only thing he could do now was to bring Chu Hao and the Vermilion Bird Emperor out of the
                empire.</span></p>

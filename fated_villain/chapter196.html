        The system's prompt sound was odd and unexplainable, but he had indeed

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The smile on the corner of Gu Changge's mouth carried a hint of
        intrigue.
      </p>
      <p>
        He quickly swept his gaze across the magnificent divine palace in front
        of him, before giving out an order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of his subordinates stepped forward and began to take away the
        treasures that the True Dragon Clan had collected over the years.
      </p>
      <p>Afterwards, Gu Changge's figure shifted and went outside.</p>
      <p>
        Now that his ‘fellow countrywoman' had noticed him, it meant that she
        must currently be among the Daoist Sects or Immortal Clans present,
        maybe not far from the territory of the True Dragon Clan.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge could understand Wang Zijin’s mentality.</p>
      <p>
        After all, every transmigrator would have a kind of contempt for the
        indigenous people of the new world, to the point where it was almost
        expected. If one were born a little taller, would they not look down on
        those who are shorter? Possessing a strong golden finger meant that
        their arrogance would soar to the high heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was good that the other party didn't seem to know that he was also a
        transmigrator.
      </p>
      <p>‘First, let’s pretend to be a more “special” native.’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was already familiar with playing out this kind of thing. So
        naturally, he could guarantee a seamless act, one where it would be
        difficult to find any flaws. Only if the other party had a system
        similar to his, would she be able to figure out his origins.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, she'd just be playing within the palm of his hands.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's smile was a bit meaningful, as if he already had a plan in
        his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other party thought she was smart and knew the entire script, but
        how could she know whether the people in the script are aware?
      </p>
      <p>“There is always a taller mountain”</p>
      <p>
        ‘Isn’t she interested in me? Then if my guess is correct, this Favoured
        Daughter of Heaven will come to my door and deliver herself to me on her
        own accord.’
      </p>
      <p>
        While Gu Changge was thinking of his plan, ripples appeared in the void,
        revealing a powerhouse of the Primordial Divine Sect.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!! </b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Young Master, the heir of the Immortal Wang Family – Wang Wushuang –
          seeks an audience. He is currently waiting outside the Dragon
          Island.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>The man glanced at Gu Changge and reported.</p>
      <p>‘It turned out to be the Immortal Wang Family?’</p>
      <p>‘Sure enough, she’s very eager.’</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge nodded slightly and couldn't help but smile
        while saying, <b>“Let them in.” </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“As the Young Master wishes.”</b> After receiving the order, the man
        left quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This is the first time I’m meeting a fellow otherworlder after
          coming to this world, I should prepare for it.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled playfully. Since they were competing with routine,
        then they should see whose routines are deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, he took a step, a void appeared in the sky; a void passage. He
        traversed the sky and came to a mountain directly.
      </p>
      <p>To be honest, though he had thought that someone would come to him–</p>
      <p>
        He didn't expect her to be related to the Immortal Wang Family. For all
        those who could be called Immortal Families, their foundation must be
        absolutely unfathomable and unimaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
        A cultivator once said that even the Immortal Families themselves do not
        know how terrifying their own background is.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has been already confirmed by the past scenes within the Immortal
        Gu family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Gu Changge would not underestimate the Immortal Wang Family.
        There must naturally be a reason why these families were able to stand
        for generations and be labelled as ‘Immortal'.
      </p>
      <p>
        But before that, he was thinking about the relationship between the
        Favoured Daughter of Heaven and Wang Wushuang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Wang Wushuang was a little mysterious in front of most people,
        and his true face was covered by mist, Gu Changge could see through him
        and even the origin of his physique at a glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as he wants to, there was no Young Supreme nor any other
        cultivator in this world who could hide from his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had also previously considered plotting for Wang Wushuang's origin.
        His peerless battle physique and the peerless power were expressed by
        the golden lines inside his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This power of Wang Wushuang was equivalent to a terrifying secret
        technique, which can increase all aspects of the cultivator, including
        attack, speed, spirituality, defence and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge gave up in the end because the difficulty was not small
        and it was not easy to succeed in such an endeavour.
      </p>
      <p>[Kshn: Ya think?]</p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge’s opinion, the person who wants to meet him right now was
        not Wang Wushuang himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, if even Wang Wushuang had to listen to the other party’s order,
        their status was obviously higher than him.
      </p>
      <p>‘His Onee-san?’</p>
      <p>‘Or is it one of the Ancient Freaks of the Immortal Wang Family?’</p>
      <p><b>— — —</b></p>
      <p><b>[At the same time.]</b></p>
      <p>
        On the ancient warship of the Immortal Wang family; Wang Zijin, Wang
        Wushuang and others were standing, waiting for the word. It was not as
        simple to see Gu Changge now as in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially since he was currently at the critical moment when the True
        Dragon Clan has just been suppressed, and who knew if there would be
        people who might take advantage to fish in murky waters.
      </p>
      <p>Being cautious was normal and reasonable.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's identity wasn't like the others in the younger generation
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Miss, will we see Young Master Changge soon? I'm so excited!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>With an excited expression, Xiu'er shook her tiny fists in the air.</p>
      <p>
        Her face was exactly like one of those diehard fans from her previous
        world when they finally met their idol. Wang Zijin couldn't help but
        shake her head.
      </p>
      <p>She really wanted to cover this little maid's mouth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“I've already told you to be quiet, why won't you be obedient.” </b>
        Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin spoke helplessly, but she didn't bother to care too much
        about this impertinent little maid, because she was used to indulging
        her like this normally.

      <p><b>“Got it, Miss.” </b></p>
      <p>
        Xiu'er hurriedly nodded, like a chicken pecking at the rice, but
        ultimately still couldn't hide her excitement and anticipation.
      </p>
      <p>But Wang Zijin didn't say anything more.</p>
      <p>
        After all, she was simply following her Little Brother to visit Gu
        Changge, the so-called strongest person in the younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since casually visiting others with her actual identity would cheapen
        her worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, she was just going as a member of the entourage today and was
        dressed as a man to boot.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't plan to expose her identity as the descendent of the Human
        Ancestral Hall so early on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin was truly very tired of those suitors who did not know their
        own worth, yet acted like bigshots. She wished that no one would bother
        her on this trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Everyone, please come with me, the young master is awaiting your
          arrival inside the Dragon Island.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The man who had gone to report soon came back and replied.</p>
      <p><b>“Okay.” </b></p>
      <p>Wang Wushuang nodded calmly.</p>
      <p>
        Everyone followed the man towards the depths of the Dragon Island. Many
        cultivators nearby looked at this scene with very surprised expressions.
      </p>
      <p>‘Wang Wushuang, the heir of the Immortal Wang Family?’</p>
      <p>‘He’s visiting Gu Changge?’</p>
      <p>‘I'm afraid this matter is not easy!’</p>
      <p>
        And soon, under the leadership of the man, everyone in the Immortal Wang
        Family passed through many sacred mountain islands to a cloud-filled
        mountain top.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!! </b></p>
      <p>
        Atop the mountain, several powerful men with terrifying auras were
        waiting for them, like guards.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was also Gu Changge, sitting behind a stone table, his eyes were
        self-assured, looking calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the stone table in front of him, the fragrance of tea was curling up,
        and five coloured steam permeated.
      </p>
      <p>Obviously, the tea was prepared for them.</p>
      <p><b>“Greetings, Brother Gu.” </b></p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang landed here and first said to Gu Changge cupped hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin, Xiu'er, the old coachman and others behind him were half a
        step behind, making Wang Wushuang look like their leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Brother Wang came to visit in person, did something happen?”</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>“Everyone, please have a seat.”</b></p>
      <p><b>“Tea has been served.” </b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled and raised his head, his eyes swept across the people
        in front of the Immortal Wang Family one by one, and motioned them to
        sit down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, while looking at Wang Zijin, who was dressed in men's clothing and
        had a delicate complexion, he paused for a moment, revealing a slightly
        surprised reaction.
      </p>
      <p>But he immediately quickly looked away.</p>
      <p>He seemed to be a little curious, but not very concerned.</p>
      <p>
        As for the rest of the Immortal Wang Family, he never paused to take a
        second look.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she noticed this, Wang Zijin was not surprised. On the contrary, Gu
        Changge's attitude made her feel very curious and she became even more
        interested.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge obviously noticed her difference.</p>
      <p>But he didn't point it out, nor asked about it.</p>
      <p>
        ‘He is a smart man, really different compared with other Young
        Supremes.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘And from a closer look, there is indeed a kind of detached Immortal
        temperament, and it also reveals his elegant and extraordinary
        presence.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It was obvious that he had been doing villain activities up until just
        a few moments before, yet now in the blink of an eye, he had this “I am
        a righteous character” face on, looking dignified and classy. Could one
        even play with this?’
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, Wang Zijin no longer expected that Gu Changge would have a
        miserable day in the future, since he was more than capable, and was
        evidently not the type of cannon fodder villain that will not survive
        many chapters.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, after sitting down.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's question, Wang Wushuang couldn't help showing a
        smile and said,
        <b
          >“Seeing Brother Gu strategizing is a blessing to my eyes. Such a
          simple method to suppress the entire Ancient Immortal Races and make
          them surrender willingly. What an amazing method, Wushuang can't help
          but admire it. I would like to ask Daoist Brother Gu for advice if
          possible.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This felt like a very sincere remark, though it in reality carried maybe
        only half its actual sincerity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang also understood that at this time, saying such a line was
        a way of helping his Big Sister. Wang Zijin was interested and wanted to
        meet Gu Changge. However...
      </p>
      <p>
        As a descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall, if she acted so brazenly
        and cheaply like this, she would inevitably be criticized.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Oh, it turned out to be this.”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled, unabated, and then shook his head.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It's just luck. Brother Wang has overpraised me. The True Dragon
          Clan had committed unrighteousness, this is what they brought up

        Hearing this, the corners of Wang Wushuang's mouth twitched slightly,
        and he then smiled bitterly,

          younger generation could use this method as you.”</b

        What Gu Changge said was reasonable, and there was nothing inherently
        wrong with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, everyone present was not part of the simple generation and was
        not stupid. They could clearly hear Gu Changge's evasive meaning.

        those schemes.

        The problem was neatly tied to the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace without
        a single hitch.

        Speaking of it this way, it almost seemed as if his move was made in

        <b>“Modest? Why should I be modest, it's just the truth.”</b> Gu Changge
        couldn't help but laugh,
        <b>“Brother Wang, you really overestimate me.” </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The old monster of the Wang family couldn't help shaking his head
        silently at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, judging people purely by their superficial surface was just
        asking for death.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had grossly underestimated Gu Changge's ability to spout nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Does he think that people are blind and can’t see his schemes and
        everything he does? Does he not think it would be good to be honest now
        and then? Don't pretend to be a sheep when you're actually a big-tailed
        wolf…’
      </p>
      <p>Even he wanted to say this to Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge also seemed to know what everyone was thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge spoke slowly, his voice containing lingering regret,
        <b
          >“I know that Brother Wang will think of this as me spouting nonsense,
          but it is indeed true that the only reason the Black Sky Eagle,
          Ancient Serpent, and other clans helped me was because of my
          relationship with Ancient Deity of Reincarnation.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Now that the matter is resolved, the agreement between them and me
          will naturally become invalid. We will go our own way, and it will be
          difficult for me to have them take action for me in the future.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        His look of regret seemed so authentic that even the people around could
        not help but begin to believe him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the ancestors of the three tribes were in Quasi-Supreme
        Realm, their strength was enough to make the heavens tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was difficult for them to truly accept that existence of the
        Quasi-Supreme Realm would actually take orders from a young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially after witnessing their might as they worked together to
        attack. A force that managed to shake the sky and rend the earth!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, Gu Changge's words made them feel the slightest tidbit of relief,
        as it was within the acceptable range of what they thought of as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Saying something so hypocritical really doesn't fit your ‘good
          person’ image.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin had a strange expression. Hearing Gu Changge's words at the
        moment, she couldn't help but let out some laughter.
      </p>
      <p>Pleasant to the ears, just like the mystical sound of nature.</p>
      <p>She didn't think Gu Changge's approach was wrong.</p>
      <p>
        In this Fantasy wuxia world where the strong eat the weak, good people
        will never live long.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, those like Gu Changge that held the banner of justice
        in hand while doing despicable acts could most certainly live for a long
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Wang Zijin more and more interested, wanting to know more
        about Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>And at this moment…</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge seemed to finally place his gaze upon Wang Zijin's face after
        hearing her laugh.
      </p>
      <p>He spoke in an odd tone as if harbouring doubts and suspicions,</p>
      <p><b>“Who…?”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This is my Big Sister, Wang Zijin. She has just returned from her
          outside practice. She intended to travel back to our Family, however,
          while passing by the Immeasurable Heaven, she decided to visit me.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang briefly introduced her but did not reveal that Wang Zijin
        had come from the Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Oh, it turned out to be Brother Wang's Big sis. I was a little
          surprised just now. You sure are well hidden.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge seemed a little surprised as if he just learned something
        new.
      </p>
      <p>
        After speaking, Gu Changge raised his teacup made from White Jade,
        gesturing towards Wang Zijin as the fragrance of the tea wafted
        outwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Wang Wushuang didn't mean to introduce her, then he didn’t want to
        ask about it either, so as not to have a counterproductive effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I greet Brother Gu. I have heard many rumours about Brother Gu's
          strength and intellect. A well-deserved reputation in my eyes.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon seeing this, Wang Zijin didn't think there was anything wrong with
        Gu Changge's behaviour and expression.
      </p>
      <p>She returned the toast and drank the tea.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Haha, Miss Zijin is exaggerating. It is nothing more than a false
          narrative.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge also spoke at will, chatting with her happily.</p>
      <p>
        That Divine temperament. That jade-like, pure and graceful face, made
        Xiu'er subconsciously show a look of deep admiration and worship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge talked with Wang Zijin and others, his expression
        calm and without any abnormalities.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he first saw Wang Zijin, he had already confirmed her identity as a
        transmigrator. The huge amount of luck, as high as tens of thousands,
        was just too conspicuous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the temperament of Wang Zijin was very different from the
        rest. She was indifferent and arrogant, and there was a kind of noble
        aura around her as if she didn't care about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge clearly recognized that this was very different from your
        average Favoured Daughter of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        So he planned to follow the original plan and set a few routines in
        place first.

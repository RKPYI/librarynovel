          he looked like he was deep in thought. It would be impossible to
          rescue Sky King Zhi Yang from him if Purple Mansion had only
          dispatched a Quasi-Nirvana Realm Master. [Don’t they know that they
          are only wasting their time if that’s the case? But, Purple Mansion is
          not that stupid. They must have something hidden up their sleeves, and

          courage to burn bridges at first. However, for the sake of Sky King
          Zhi Yang, they had even given up on their whole Sect’s territory and
          dispatched all their forces to this place. Thus. Gu Changge was
          wrong.</span

          might look like they are losing but that seems to be intentional.] Gu
          Changge also had a rough guess of their goal. [It is to paralyse me

          from Purple Mansion have come here. Just that they will stay away and
          immediately move after Sky King Zhi Yang is rescued. So, the territory
          of Purple Mansion is probably just an empty shell right now.
          Interesting. This way, the other forces charging towards your
          territory would be doing so for naught.] Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes
          narrowed slightly at that thought.</span

          she couldn&#8217;t pinpoint. Before this, she always thought Gu

          Bird Empire. After all, in their eyes, the empire was like an ant

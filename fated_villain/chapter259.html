        <h4>Chapter 259-1: The secret conspiracy that would lead him to a dead end no matter what his choice (1)</h4>
        <p> "Ying Shuang's Luck points have decayed to such a degree. It's really another miracle. Sure enough, that
            saying is really true, nothing is invincible, let alone the Son of Luck…" </p>
        <p> Gu Changge's expression was a little inexplicable as he was suddenly interested. </p>
        <p> On his way to the location of Ying Shuang and the others, he kept paying attention to Ying Shuang's Luck
            points as the system kept prompting that Ying Shuang's Luck points were on the verge of decline. </p>
        <p> So he was thinking about whether to secretly help Ying Shuang, so as not to let him die so quickly. He
            didn't want Ying Shuang to die so early, after all, he still needed someone to carry his blame. </p>
        <p> If he died like this, he would have to spend a lot of time looking for the next scapegoat. Ying Shuang was
            too weak, if he had the means of Prince Ying from earlier, he would not be so passive. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge could save a little bit of worry. However, Gu Changge soon discovered that the Luck points of
            Ying Shuang had risen inexplicably. He guessed that it was because of a series of changes caused by Ying
            Shuang being regarded as the inheritor of demonic art by the world. </p>
        <p> It was very likely that there was indeed an organization behind the inheritor of demonic art. Ying Shuang
            might have been noticed by them now. </p>
        <p> If there was any danger to his life at that time, the real inheritor of the demonic arts’ organization might
            come to rescue Ying Shuang. After all, there had been many inheritors of demonic art since time immemorial,
            although there was only one person in each generation who practiced forbidden demonic art. </p>
        <p> But as long as they were not stupid, they were bound to leave some followers. This saved Gu Changge a lot of
            effort. At least Ying Shuang couldn't die now. If someone rescued him, it would be even more impossible for
            him to wash off this blame. </p>
        <p> He must wear the hat that belonged to the inheritor of demonic art until the day he died. As for making
            fakes come true, he could let Ying Shuang have another power. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge wasn't worried, because Ying Shuang wouldn't forbid demonic art at all. Sooner or later, that
            organization would find clues. </p>
        <p> "According to the normal trajectory, if there really exists such a forbidden demonic organization, they
            should be looking for the mysterious person behind Ye Lang, and it should have nothing to do with Ying
            Shuang." </p>
        <p> "I just don't know if there really exists such an organization in the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, but
            not that it matter it doesn’t exist. I'll help you." </p>
        <p> Thinking of this, Gu Changge's smile couldn't help being a little playful. </p>
        <p> This scene in the eyes of the other cultivators reflected Gu Changge's expression of concern for the safety
            of the common people and anxiety in his heart, which made them even more admired. </p>
        <p> <strong>Swish!</strong>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p> A stream of light ran through the sky as the geniuses and cultivators from all ethnic groups were rushing
            away. The news that the inheritor of the demonic art was now in the world had spread throughout the Heavenly
            Extinction Battlefield, causing a huge sensation. </p>
        <p> "Brother Gu is back, that's great, when he was not in the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, it was really
            disturbing." </p>
        <p> "Yeah, with Brother Gu around, the inheritor of demonic art probably wouldn't dare to be so arrogant. I
            think he only dared to do it after he knew that Brother Gu left the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield." </p>
        <p> "Brother Gu still had good intentions at that time and helped them. I'm afraid Brother Gu would never have
            imagined that so many things would happen in the past few days." </p>
        <p> "Alas, if the descendant of Human Ancestor Hall had directly attacked and killed Prince Ying, it is
            estimated that there would be no such thing now." </p>
        <p> "But Prince Ying displayed weakness at this time, trying to hide from everyone…" </p>
        <p> At this time, Ye Langtian, Wang Wushuang, Chi Ling, and the others also rode the divine beasts one after
            another, galloping through the sky, and rushing to the area where he was located. </p>
        <p> They talked a lot and felt very emotional, and they didn't contact Gu Changge about this at all. </p>
        <p> In their opinion, except for Gu Changge and the descendants of Human Ancestor Hall, it was almost impossible
            for the younger generation to be the opponent of the inheritors of demonic art. Now it had almost been
            settled that Prince Ying was the inheritor of demonic art. Even if he wanted to justify and deny it, no one
            would believe it. </p>
        <p> So they couldn't figure out what else they could do to Prince Ying at this time. Was it possible that he
            planned to drag the entire Emperor Mountain and become the enemy of the whole world? </p>
        <p> And even if he wanted to, Emperor Mountain probably wouldn't admit it. The Heavenly Emperor Mountain had
            their inheritance stretched for countless years, it was impossible for Emperor Mountain to make any wrong
            move at such a time. </p>
        <p> It was very likely that Emperor Mountain would chose to abandon Prince Ying. After all, Emperor Mountain had
            existed for many years, and Emperor Ying was just one of the Emperors. </p>
        <p> It was impossible for the entire Emperor Mountain to become his subordinate. On the day that Prince Ying
            accepted the inheritance of demonic art, he should have thought of all this. </p>
        <p> And soon, Wang Wushuang, Ye Langtian, and others also rushed to the area where the people of Heavenly
            Emperor Mountain were. It was just that what they saw in front of them really surprised them, and it was
            difficult for them to come back to their senses for a while. </p>
        <p> The brilliance of the sky was enough to drown all the cultivators below the Sacred Realm. Even they, at this
            time, couldn't help but feel a palpitating feeling, as if they were dream. </p>
        <p> "Does Prince Ying really intend to slaughter everyone? Does he think that he is invincible in the whole
            world?" </p>
        <p> So soon, their faces quickly turned gloomy, and they were extremely angry. Wang Wushuang and others even
            directly activated their respective forbidden artifacts and secret treasures, and went on guard. </p>
        <p> They saw a mighty aura emerging in the front, as if an ancient god was revived. </p>
        <p> That kind of unparalleled aura was really amazing. The divine chain of laws and order intertwined like a
            galaxy and were hanging down there, and there was a golden bell floating up and down in the sky. </p>
        <div id="pf-9473-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> The golden bell was huge like a mountain range that was stretched across the sky, covering everything. The
            terrifying power of time flowing on the golden bell, let out a strong aura almost turning everything to
            chaos. </p>
        <p> The incomparably brilliant and terrifying golden divine light, like a mountain, seemed to have penetrated
            the universe and shattered the sky. Even in the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, it was difficult to stop
            that kind of aura as the sky seemed to have exploded. </p>
        <p> This scene deeply shocked everyone and made Ye Langtian and others who came here shudder. As a descendant of
            the Primordial Ye Clan, Ye Langtian naturally knew the significance of the current situation. </p>
        <p> But he couldn't figure out why Prince Ying was so bold and dared to use this thing. </p>
        <p> "This is the Soul-Suppressing Ancient Bell that had been with Emperor Ying at the beginning. No, it is not
            just the weapon of the Emperor, but it was also refined by him and reserved for his own children." </p>
        <p> "I'm afraid that it’s a supreme weapon. The gods in it are like an unparalleled supreme. Who can stop them?"
        </p>
        <p> "This inheritor of demonic art is too arrogant, and he doesn't even admit it until now. Does he really think
            that with the Emperor Mountain and his father behind him, he can do whatever he wants?" </p>
        <p> "The young king of the Endless Fire Nation is said to have been accepted as an apprentice by a Supreme. Now
            that she is dead here, I am afraid that the Supreme will be arriving soon to demand an explanation." </p>
        <p> "At that time, the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield will not be calm, and it will be even more dangerous for
            us." </p>
        <p> Among the depleted mountain ranges, many young cultivators were discussing, and when they saw this scene,
            they were all angry, and then they looked extremely worried. </p>
        <p> At the end of their line of sight, a monstrous aura could be seen rising from the sky. It was a roar from a
            Great Sacred Realm cultivator; the protector of Qilin Clan’s Young Master. </p>
        <p> When he shot at Ying Shuang, he felt that something was wrong. There was an unparalleled aura in his body,
            which almost shattered his soul. </p>
        <p> "Everyone who inherits the demonic art will get killed!" </p>
        <p> <i>Even if you kill me, someone will still kill you.</i> Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com</p>
        <p> At this moment, he was roaring furiously. The majestic Sacred Realm laws were like cracks in the heaven and
            the earth, symbolizing terror. Under such fluctuations, even ordinary Sacred Realm cultivators would change
            their expression, and it was impossible for them to withstand it. </p>
        <p> When a Sacred Realm cultivator was angry, the mountains and rivers would change their course, the heaven and
            the earth would lose their color, and the universe would be destroyed. If such a battlefield took place
            outside the domain, many realms would explode and become dust. </p>
        <p> But now, it seemed extremely humble and insignificant. Under the pressure of the Supreme Being, he was like
            an ant, and there was nothing he could do except for an unwilling roar. </p>
        <p> In the next moment, the golden divine light came crashing down, as if the world had been burned down. </p>
        <p> The endless power of laws drowned this supreme saint with a puff, and before he could even let out a scream,
            he disappeared in an instant, and his body and spirit were both destroyed. </p>
        <p> "I said that I'm not the inheritor of demonic art, why don't you believe it?" </p>
        <p> As the party involved, Ying Shuang’s face at this time was even bluer than anyone else's. He stood under the
            dome of the sky, and the sky was covered with crystals and dazzling lights. The divine light was brilliant,
            and it was connected to the golden ancient bells in the sky. But it had nothing to do with him.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 259-2: The secret conspiracy that would lead him to a dead end no matter what his choice (2)</h4>
        <p> This golden ancient bell would only actively revive itself when he encountered a life crisis. Usually, it
            was simply difficult for him to activate it. </p>
        <p> Now, Ying Shuang only felt that the blame of the inheritor of demonic art had been fastened tightly on his
            head, and he couldn't take it off like a pluck. </p>
        <p> This made him extremely angry, frightened, and uneasy. Who the hell was framing him, and why did he put this
            blame on his head over and over again. </p>
        <p> "Young Master, stop quickly, the sea of ??hardships is boundless and there is no turning back. As long as
            the forbidden demonic art is abolished, there is still a way." Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
        </p>
        <p> "Otherwise, even the subordinates that the Emperor once left behind won't be able to save you." </p>
        <p> "You are not only hurting yourself, you are also hurting Emperor Mountain!" </p>
        <p> "Young Master, are you still worthy of the title of Emperor? If the Emperor was still here, he would not
            want to see you become like this…" </p>
        <p> Ying Yu, Agu and other people from Emperor Mountain, at this time, all looked regretful, as they all opened
            their mouths, trying to persuade Ying Shuang to turn him back and stop being obsessed. </p>
        <p> Doubt was one thing, now that the suspicion was confirmed, it was totally different matter. This made them
            extremely worried, regretful, and uneasy… </p>
        <p> Why did Ying Shuang go astray? </p>
        <p> As the inheritor of demonic art, no matter what time it was, it was a mortal situation. In the end, even his
            relatives would be implicated, and the whole world would be his enemies, and there would be no good end.
        </p>
        <p> Why couldn't Ying Shuang understand this? </p>
        <p> "I said that I was wronged. I'm not the inheritor of demonic art, why don't you believe me… Ying Yu, are you
            like this too?" </p>
        <p> Ying Shuang's expression was extremely angry, staring at everyone from Heavenly Emperor Mountain, especially
            Ying Yu. </p>
        <p> Even his sister didn't believe him, thinking that he was the inheritor of demonic art. This made him feel
            cold, disappointed, and chilled. </p>
        <p> "It's come to this point, brother, why are you still being obsessed? Are you really planning to drag the
            Emperor Mountain into the water? If you knew that such a day would come, why did you choose it in the first
            place?" </p>
        <p> Ying Yu's expression was full of pain, with struggle, sadness, pity, entanglement… She thought about such a
            day, but kept hoping that this day would not come. But when it really came, she was at a loss and didn't
            know what to do. </p>
        <p> "Haha, you still thought I was your brother, and you doubted me like this…" </p>
        <p> Hearing Ying Yu's words, Ying Shuang's expression suddenly became indifferent. He clenched his fist, and his
            body was trembling. But in fact, he was angry, aggrieved, and frightened to the extreme. </p>
        <p> Ying Yu didn't believe him, which meant that there was no help behind him, and he would face all of the
            enemies alone. At this time, he would rather go back to feed the horses than encounter such a thing. </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <p> Suddenly, the Ancient Golden Bell above Ying Shuang's head suddenly burst into an unusually splendid
            brilliance, with hundreds of millions of golden rays lingering around. </p>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> The terrifying pressure swept the heavens and the earth, causing countless cultivators to become terrified.
            Even the cultivators in the rest of the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield felt a sense of uneasiness and fear
            from the depth of their soul, and couldn't help but kneel down. </p>
        <p> "He's going to kill us all…" </p>
        <p> "Desperately fight with him! The inheritor of demonic art, everyone, attack him!" </p>
        <p> Everyone looked at Ying Shuang with expressions of anger, hatred, and murderous intent. They knew that they
            were not Ying Shuang's opponents, but they were not afraid at all, and they were ready to fight against him.
        </p>
        <p> Ying Shuang was too arrogant. Just now, in front of everyone, he strongly sacrificed such a weapon to kill a
            person in the great sacred realm. </p>
        <p> "Brother, I really don't want to fight with you, don't forget that I also have the Ancient Golden Bell."
        </p>
        <p> Ying Yu's cold voice was mixed with pain resounded between heaven and earth. </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!!</strong> </p>
        <p> In the next moment, in the position between her eyebrows, a large and unusual brilliance appeared, in which
            a strong aura was rising. </p>
        <p> The terrifying phantom suddenly solidified under the sky. It was also the Ancient Golden Bell, exactly the
            same as Ying Shuang's, and it was also refined by the original Emperor Ying. </p>
        <p> It was just that Ying Yu activated it by a secret method, and it was not its active recovery. There was an
            essential difference between the power and the Ancient Golden Bell above Ying Shuang's head. </p>
        <p> "You also want to kill me?Why is it that you still don't believe my words?" </p>
        <p> Seeing Ying Yu's actions, Ying Shuang was stunned, and his eyes widened. His expression turned into a bit of
            disbelief, as if he didn't want to believe that Ying Yu would attack him in the end. </p>
        <p> "You've killed a lot of people, stop now." </p>
        <p> Ying Yu's voice was filled with regret and struggle. As she said that, the position between her eyebrows
            exuded a dazzling glow. </p>
        <p> Seeing this, Ying Shuang also knew that it was useless to talk too much, and he had nothing to say and
            couldn't justify because of this blame. </p>
        <p> At this time, the only thing he could do was to find a way to survive! And soon, the two Ancient Golden
            Bells were fighting in the sky. The fluctuations were as turbulent as the vast ocean, and the scene was
            extremely frightening, as if it would shatter the sky. </p>
        <p> The terrifying laws and order, and the divine light were extremely chaotic, and there was an amazing scene
            like the cracking of the sky. Even some stars outside the realm were swept by this divine light, and then
            fell down and turned into dust in mid-air. </p>
        <p> The chaotic dust fell from outside the domain and drowned it all. Many creatures were too late to escape and
            died directly under this aftermath. Just like the Great Sacred Realm cultivator from earlier, they didn't
            even have time to let out a scream, and their body and spirit were both destroyed. </p>
        <p> For a while, this place turned into a purgatory-like scene on earth. Many young beings were rushing to come
            here, but they were swept away by the burst of divine light in the middle, and they exploded in an instant,
            turning into a cloud of blood. </p>
        <p> "Run away, Prince Ying has gone crazy, he is going to kill everyone, he is planning to be enemies of the
            entire world." </p>
        <p> "Go back and report to the clan, the inheritor of demonic art is here, and he wants to kill everyone!" </p>
        <p> Everyone was terrified and kept running for their lives everywhere, accompanied by incomparable despair,
            panic, and anger. Judging from this move, Prince Ying really intended to kill everyone and destroy everyone
            here. </p>
        <p> After today, probably, there would be no place for him in this world. So thinking of this, Prince Ying
            decided to drag everyone to be buried together at this time. </p>
        <div id="pf-9473-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> "No, let's run away. Prince Ying is planning to self-destruct. Even if he dies, we will be dragged down!"
        </p>
        <p> Wang Wushuang, Ye Langtian and the others suddenly changed their expressions. </p>
        <p> Although they were backed by the Ancient Ye Clan and the Ancient Immortal Wang Family, they didn't have the
            amazing means of prince Ying. </p>
        <p> Was supreme weapon something that ordinary people could have? If they didn't run at this time, they would
            just die here like everyone else. </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!!</strong> </p>
        <p> But in the next moment, a strange fluctuation suddenly emerged from the heavens and the earth, which made
            everyone's expressions change, and they felt a strange power that enveloped all directions. </p>
        <p> "Tsk tsk… I'll see, who dares to escape! Even if Heavenly Emperor shows up, no one can save you! Everyone is
            going to die here today. We have always been hunted and killed by people since time immemorial." </p>
        <p> "I didn't expect that there would be such a day. Karma really turns around. The descendants of this
            generation sure have the courage." </p>
        <p> Accompanied by a sneering sound. Everyone who was fleeing to heaven and earth was startled, and they
            couldn't help but feel cold all over, and even their souls were trembling. </p>
        <p> In the void, three terrifying figures suddenly appeared. They were shrouded in black robes, surrounded by
            gray fog, their eyes were cold, cruel and bloodthirsty. </p>
        <p> Their aura was impressively the Great Sacred Realm, with the laws of Great Sacred Realm intertwined around
            them, so powerful that they could easily crush everyone here. </p>
        <p> "This……" </p>
        <p> "How is this possible!" </p>
        <p> "This must be fake, how could there be a Great Sacred Realm existences hiding in the dark. Not to mention,
            there are still three, this is driving everyone to a dead end!" </p>
        <p> Seeing this scene, everyone was dumbfounded, and then they reacted and couldn't help but feel cold. </p>
        <p> Their face turned pale, their souls trembled, and they were desperate to the extreme. In the dark, there
            were still people hidden, and suddenly appeared at this time? </p>
        <p> Moreover, there were still three terrifying Great Sacred Realm existences! With their single palm, everyone
            here could be wiped out. </p>
        <p> "Descendent, please rest assured, no one can leave here alive today." </p>
        <p> At this time, the three Great Sacred Realm existences who suddenly appeared, in the despair and fear on
            everyone's face, saluted Ying Shuang and said with a very respectful look. </p>
        <p> "This……" </p>
        <p> At this time, Ying Shuang was also a little shocked, and even became dazed. Then, there was a burst of
            ecstasy. It was really a no-brainer. </p>
        <p> He even wondered if the previous Prince Ying was indeed the inheritor of demonic art, but after he took
            over, he didn't know that part of his memory. </p>
        <p> "No, I'm not the inheritor of demonic art, not from the beginning, someone is trying to frame me on purpose!
            And the three people in front of me were sent by him. They seemed to help me, but in fact they had another
            purpose, to make it harder for me to clear my suspicions!" </p>
        <p> "Damn, what a cruel heart! It must be Gu Changge. During this period of time, I have never contacted anyone
            other than him, so I knew he would not be so kind…" </p>
        <p> But soon, Ying Shuang reacted, and his whole body was cold, with some despair and fear. </p>
        <p> But in response, what could he do? </p>
        <p> He could understand all of this, but he couldn't refuse it at all. This was a conspiracy that led him to a
            dead end no matter his choice.</p>

        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen was seriously considering the Daoist Sage’s proposal. As he observed his surroundings, the people around him seemed oblivious to the Sage’s voice. Even the True Daoists were busy surveying the area with a perplexed and troubled look on their faces. </span><span id="more-32760"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Could the Daoist Sage really have sensed my intense murderous intent and decided to communicate with me?] While thinking that, Jiang Chen’s gaze drifted toward Gu Changge. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had his back facing Jiang Chen while scanning his surroundings. Ji Chuyue and An Yan trailed closely behind, seemingly eager to speak to him. Jiang Chen clenched his fists tightly as he realised this could be his final opportunity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll save you but in return, you must kill the man in white,” Jiang Chen transmitted his voice. He sought the advice from the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation and discovered that destroying the mysterious jade would be a difficult task, even for a True Daoist. Fortunately, he had a unique method that he was certain would succeed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rest assured, I’ll keep my promise. Once you release me, none shall escape here unscathed. I swear it on my Dao Heart, you can place your faith in me,” the Daoist Sage in the mysterious jade replied, his voice tinged with a hint of excitement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen nodded, then waited for the perfect opportunity to present itself. With so many True Daoists present, they would immediately notice if he acted suspiciously. Therefore, he had to patiently wait for the dragon breath to emerge from the cavern behind the mysterious jade. Once chaos ensued, he could then make his move.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time slowly passed, the search for an alternative entrance proved fruitless, leaving everyone feeling disheartened. Even the True Daoists struggled to find anything, let alone the others.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is moving this mysterious jade the only way we proceed further? But our Prime Ancestor has warned us against doing it. What should we do now?” one of the Ancestors from the Ji Family asked with a concerned expression.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The True Daoist from Sky Emperor Mountain responded gravely, “The Daoist Sage sealed in the mysterious jade is anything but ordinary. Through my secret technique, I sensed a malevolent energy from him. If handled carelessly, this could bring about unimaginable calamities.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere grew solemn as everyone contemplated the gravity of the situation. The young prodigies were unable to intervene, and could only heed the advice of the True Daoists from their respective groups. They also recognized the potential danger of the mysterious jade in question, and that it must be handled with great caution.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In my humble opinion, I believe it would be wiser for us to backtrack and search for an alternative entrance outside,” Gu Changge suggested with a smile. His words resonated with everyone, as they realised that they were at a dead end and left with extremely risky options.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retracing their steps to discover a new path seemed like the most prudent course of action.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young Master Changge is right, we should find another path.” The other True Daoists concurred with the suggestion, believing it to be a viable option. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expression on Jiang Chen’s face abruptly changed as he came to a realisation. If these people were to retrace their steps now, they would definitely notice what he did. By then, it would be difficult for him to deny his actions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That approach may not work. I have already surveyed the area upon arrival. This is the only way forward. Even if you retrace your steps, you will still end up here in the end. It’s only a waste of our time and energy.” Jiang Chen composed himself and shook his head. He was going to rescue the Daoist Sage in the mysterious jade, so he wasn’t going to let everyone leave now. Besides, the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation had already manipulated the path they took earlier, rendering it unrecognisable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? The only way forward?” Everyone’s expression turned into a mixture of shock and disbelief. Many True Daoists stared at Jiang Chen disapprovingly, as they started to suspect that his motives were not pure and that he had been deceiving them all along.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, then why didn’t you mention this earlier? If there is only one way, then how did Senior Ji Shengchu end up getting trapped here?” Gu Changge inquired curiously while shaking his head.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How would I know? The only way for you to find out is to ask the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family himself,” Jiang Chen replied, shaking his head as he feigned ignorance.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah Da, go retrace our steps and investigate the situation. I’m quite curious as to why he is trying so hard to stop us from retracing our steps,” Gu Changge instructed Ah Da, who was standing behind him. Without hesitation, Ah Da swiftly transformed into a beam of dark light and vanished into thin air.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expression on Jiang Chen’s face changed. He didn’t expect Gu Changge to go out of his way to get his men to conduct an investigation. The thought of his underhanded schemes being exposed left him feeling nervous, and the unexpected turn of events caused his back to break out in cold sweat.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It appears that this guy is really hiding something! Otherwise, he wouldn’t worry about us retracing our steps!”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How dare you scheme against us, what are you intending to do?”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The True Daoists present were quick to pick up on Jiang Chen’s unusual behaviour. Their faces twisted with anger as they realised they may have been deceived by him. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A powerful force immediately bore down on Jiang Chen, causing him to cough up blood. The bones in his body cracked, his skin threatened to split open, and he was nearly crushed by the immense pressure. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other powerful experts surrounded him, their expressions unkind and hostile. Even with his formidable strength, he would have a difficult time escaping given their numbers, even if he had suddenly grown a pair of wings.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue and Ji Yaoxing had no doubts about it. Given the history between Jiang Chen and Gu Changge, it was entirely plausible that Jiang Chen was capable of such a heinous act. However, Ji Chuyue couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sorrow in her heart. She didn’t want to witness Jiang Chen’s downfall, like a helpless bird crashing into a solid wall. After all, how could he possibly stand a chance against the formidable Gu Changge?</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s really courting death.” The Phoenix Lady and her companions also shook their heads with regretful expressions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen’s face darkened at the unexpected turn of events. At this point in time, he refused to concede defeat and instead opted to buy time, patiently waiting for the dragon breath. As long as he could save the Daoist Sage who was trapped in the mysterious jade, no one would be able to escape this place and he could make this escape amidst the chaos.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after that, Ah Da returned to Gu Changge and informed, “Master, the path we took to arrive here seems to have vanished, and I am unable to locate the correct route to return.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing this, Gu Changge let out a deep sigh and shook his head like he had already expected to hear this. “I see, so that’s the reason behind it all. How unexpected.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, is there anything else you would like to say? Thanks to Young Master Changge’s keen senses, we are able to see through your deceitful plan. Otherwise, we would have fallen prey to your scheme.” Ah Da’s report sparked a fiery indignation in the hearts of many True Daoists, who so badly wished they could kill Jiang Chen right now.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gu Changge, don’t you dare to make such accusations against me! You were the one who forced me to come here. I hold no grudges against anyone here, so why would I do such a thing? The terrain here is constantly shifting, how would I know that the path we took would disappear?” Jiang Chen stared at Gu Changge with a strained expression as he continued to deny the accusations, hoping to buy more time to resolve the situation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge shook his head and said calmly, “So you refuse to admit it? Actually, I have already guessed your motives. The Sect Masters whom you mercilessly slaughtered in the Godly Illusion Tomb most likely found themselves in a similar trap as us, with no means of progress or escape. I deliberately spared your life, hoping that as the Successor of a Divine Source Master, you would make amends for your wrongdoing and aid in the rescue of the Ji Family’s Prime Ancestor. It’s regrettable that you have yet to learn the value of gratitude and continue to scheme against us.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? He is the one who slaughtered the Sect Masters in the Godly Illusion Tomb? How can this be?” Gu Changge’s words immediately caused a stir among the crowd. Heads turned and eyes widened in disbelief at the shocking revelation. Realisation immediately dawned upon the young prodigies who witnessed the moment Gu Changge captured Jiang Chen in the Starcatching Pavilion. It turned out that Jiang Chen was the mysterious person that all the Forces had been looking for!</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The events that had transpired in the Godly Illusion Tomb truly caused a huge uproar, as many Sect Masters from various Forces died tragically in it. The Godly Illusion Clan even paid a heavy price to quell the public anger.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, he was the one who murdered my Sect Master? No wonder why his whereabouts remained elusive, it turns out that he’s the Successor of a Divine Source Master!” As the truth dawned on them, the crowd’s fury intensified, their eyes ablaze with anger as they glared at Jiang Chen as if they were going to tear him apart. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one doubted Gu Changge’s words as he was one of the few who had survived the Godly Illusion Tomb incident at that time. It was no surprise for him to have seen the true identity of the murderer.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon reflection, the situation became clear. The Godly Illusion Tomb contained numerous Prohibition Arrays, which a Divine Source Master could effortlessly control. This enabled Jiang Chen to eliminate all the Sect Masters who had entered the tomb in search of the Godly Illusion Clan’s Prime Ancestor’s Divinity Crystal.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, you are a despicable bastard! You and the Godly Illusion Clan were clearly the ones responsible for it, yet you framed me! Karma’s going to get you!!” Jiang Chen was caught off guard when Gu Changge suddenly brought up the matter and accused him. His eyes turned red as he clenched his teeth with fury. Despite Jiang Chen’s protests, no one believed him, especially those whose Sect Masters had perished in the Godly Illusion Tomb. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrifying murderous intent filled the air, pinning Jiang Chen in place and making it impossible for him to escape.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve always been curious, why did you kill those innocent Sect Masters who have never crossed you?” Gu Changge shook his head with a puzzled look. A heavy sigh escaped his lips as he reminisced about the terrible event.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He doesn’t need any reason for his actions. You can already tell that he&#8217;s a bloodthirsty villain with evil intentions just by looking at him.” Gu Changge’s question fueled the crowd’s anger even more. Were it not for Jiang Chen’s status as a Divine Source Master, they would have struck him down to prevent future troubles.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah…!” Some kind of transformation suddenly occurred in Jiang Chen’s body. A black light burst forth from his dantian and spiritual sea, causing him to involuntarily let out a thunderous roar. It rose like a black sun, penetrating his soul, lungs, spiritual sea, spiritual palace, and its brilliance engulfed the long river of time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone saw a terrifying vision behind Jiang Chen. The very essence of life seemed to fade away, leaving a desolate void in its wake. A demonic shadow covered the sky, and a sense of impending doom hung heavy in the air.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrifying demonic nature manifested in him. His black hair danced wildly, and his aura surged, as if a demon god was materialising. The startling transformation changed the expressions on everyone’s face. Even the True Daoists instinctively stepped back, visibly shaken.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could… he be… the Successor of Demonic Arts? Jiang Chen has another identity?” The countenances of the Phoenix Lady, the Sky Demon Sovereign and the King with Six Crowns, contorted with shock. Although they had never met the Successor of Demonic Arts, they possessed ample knowledge about him and had been vigilant. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How is it possible, Jiang Chen is actually…” Ji Chuyue’s mouth was agape in surprise as her beautiful eyes widened in shock. She could hardly believe that Jiang Chen was hiding such an identity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His aura is undeniably sinister, layered with various different Sources. It is no different from the Successor of Demonic Arts! I wonder how many young prodigies have died by his hands until now! It’s astonishing to realise just how deeply he has concealed his true nature, and had he not voluntarily revealed himself today! His identity would have remained shrouded in secrecy!” The eyes of the True Daoist from Sky Emperor Mountain glinted coldly. He felt a surge of anger and murderous intent as he thought of his own Successors falling prey to the poisonous hands of the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did he expose his identity to reveal everything about him? Be careful everyone. If he’s no longer hiding his identity, he must be planning to go all out,” Gu Changge said solemnly, acting like he didn’t expect Jiang Chen to suddenly reveal his identity. His reminder prompted the others to exercise caution and avoid any impulsive actions. After all, they were in the depths of Kun Mountain, and Jiang Chen was still a Divine Source Master.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As tensions rose and everyone was prepared to fight Jiang Chen, the ground beneath them began to shake. The mysterious jade obstructing the entrance quivered, and a formidable purple waterfall rushed up from below with the force of a raging river. It contained a terrifying power beyond comprehension.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panic immediately set in, causing everyone to scatter in different directions as they tried to escape the unknown purple waterfall. Even the True Daoists did not dare to come into contact with the purple liquid, as they could sense it was corrosive.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is… dragon breath…” In the midst of his anger, Jiang Chen’s mind remained sharp as he immediately recognized the powerful gush to be the dragon breath. It was the perfect opportunity for him to take action.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn’t explain why he had revealed the fact that he had been cultivating a Demonic Arts earlier. He only felt an overwhelming urge to eliminate all those present, and a surge of unstoppable energy emanated from his dantian. Given the circumstances, he realised he had no choice but to take action.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Artifact Spirit, help me break open that mysterious jade and release the Daoist Sage so that he can kill everyone here!!” Jiang Chen’s voice thundered in his mind as he seized the opportunity and charged toward the mysterious jade amidst the chaos. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A beam of light came out from his palm. Like a meteor, it collided with the mysterious jade, creating a deafening boom.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not good! He’s trying to release the Daoist Sage in the mysterious jade! Stop him!” The Ancestors of the Ji Family were filled with dread and desperately tried to intervene. However, it was too late. The waterfall collided with him, emitting a menacing hiss as it rapidly eroded his body. The others were equally horrified, their faces turning ashen as they realised they were too late to stop Jiang Chen.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a contemptuous smile on his face, Jiang Chen stood before the jade and lifted his hand to deliver a powerful strike! *Boom!!* The mysterious jade that had sealed the cavern shattered into pieces with a loud crack. A horrifying evil aura immediately engulfed the space, threatening to destroy everything in its path!</span></p>

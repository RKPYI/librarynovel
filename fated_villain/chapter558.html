          covering the sky and obscuring the sun. Within it lurked grotesque and
          ferocious monsters, each with their own strange appearance. Some had
          sleek black wings, others had terrifying horns, and some appeared to
          be drenched in blood.</span

          >An old man rose into the sky and gloomily asked, “Devil Mountain
          dwellers, what brings you to Dark Kun City?”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many recognized him as a knowledgeable man who had reached the Sacred
          Emperor Realm in Dark Kun City. Despite his question, the demonic
          cloud in the sky continued rolling and surging. The great demons
          within it remained aloof, silently standing like a wall of ice.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The atmosphere in Dark Kun City was tense and quiet, with many
          cultivators looking up in horror and fear. Despite the presence of
          numerous Forces, as well as True Daoists from the Upper Realm, no one
          felt safe in this situation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, the terrifying might of the demoness in red had already
          sent shockwaves through the Upper Realm. The great demons under her
          command were equally formidable. Among them were beings that could
          rival the True Daoists, once notorious for their ferocity and causing
          trouble for even the Immortal or Formidable Forces.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What? Did the Devil Mountain presume they could challenge us
          single-handedly?” A True Daoist let out a disdainful snort, expressing
          his displeasure. With a wave of his sleeve, he soared high into the
          sky, looking at the crowd in the demonic cloud. A small blurry green
          caudron hovered above his head, emitting a radiant glow that filled
          the air with an impressive imperial prestige.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Hoho, what’s with that attitude, my friend? Is this how you greet
          someone who has traversed millions of kilometres to reach this place?”
          A cold sneer rang out before an old man with dragon horns emerged from
          the demonic cloud, dressed in a long blue robe. Despite his sunken eye
          sockets and bark-like skin, his eyes burned like a pair of blue flames
          and he exuded a terrifying aura.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As soon as the old man appeared, a stir erupted in Dark Kun City. The
          countenances of the elderly turned grave with intense apprehension.
          “Master Elder Qinglong&#8230;I didn’t expect him to join forces with
          Devil Mountain.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Master Elder Qinglong was a True Daoist who made off with a precious
          treasure from Sky Emperor Mountain three million years ago. During his
          escape, he killed countless cultivators from Sky Emperor Mountain. In
          the end, several ancient experts of Sky Emperor Mountain awakened and
          subdued him together, sending him into the depths of the Endless Sea.
          He was no doubt a ferocious man who had taken countless lives and made
          countless enemies. A highly notorious demon in the Upper Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What do you mean by that, Master Elder Qinglong?” The True Daoist
          who had just appeared confronted him loudly with a somber face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“We are here to cut open some stones, of course. Why? Are we not
          welcomed here?” Master Elder Qinglong sneered. A group of imposing
          figures emerged from the shadows behind him. Their forms were shrouded
          in a demonic fog revealing only their piercing, icy gazes. It was
          evident that these figures were equally formidable as him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This scene sent a wave of tension through the hearts of everyone in
          Dark Kun City, leaving them feeling increasingly uneasy. The people
          from Devil Mountain really came here to cut some stones?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The True Daoist’s countenance softened slightly as he replied, “If
          your intention is to cut open some stones, we naturally welcome you.
          However, I implore you to refrain from any reckless behavior.
          Otherwise, I cannot guarantee that I will show mercy.&#8221; The
          expression on the True Daoist face softened as he replied. He was fine
          with it, as long as these people from the Devil Mountain had no
          malicious intention.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The remaining True Daoists exchanged glances with each other then
          nodded. Despite their suspicions about the Devil Mountain’s true
          intention, they did not stop them. From the looks of it, a significant
          number of formidable demons had descended from Devil Mountain to come
          here. If a conflict were to break out, Devil Mountain might overpower
          them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!!* The demonic cloud looming above quickly drifted further into
          Dark Kun City. A legion of great demons emerged, their piercing gazes
          resembling sharp blades, their presence instilling fear in all around
          them. Amidst the menacing horde, the center remained shrouded in a
          hazy darkness.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A carriage descended into the street, pulled by four Sacred Emperor
          Realm Demonic Water Serpents. Master Elder Qinglong stood next to it
          with utmost respect. Only a select few True Daoists could fully make
          out the scene, the others could not get a clear view.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Chan Hongyi…” Gu Changge detected a familiar aura coming from the
          carriage. A piercing gaze, as cold as ice, bore down on him through
          the thick demonic fog. He had no doubt that the person inside was Chan
          Hongyi. Given her extreme caution, it was likely that it was only her
          incarnation rather than her real form.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I wonder how much she has recovered. If it’s just an incarnation,
          she can hardly take me down.” Gu Changge calmly strode alongside
          several True Daoists as they followed Devil Mountain’s entourage
          toward the Cursed Rock. Although many had speculated that the Cursed
          Rock was the object of the Devil Mountain’s interest, it remained
          merely conjecture. Everyone was curious to see what the Devil Mountain
          entourage would do, especially since the Daoist Artifacts could hardly
          subdue that Cursed Rock.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen trailed behind An Xi and their companions, his gaze fixed
          on the demonic cloud. “Why can’t I shake off the feeling that there’s
          someone far more sinister lurking within that demonic cloud…? Could it
          be the Mistress of the Devil Mountain herself?” he whispered to Niu
          Tian who was beside him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Very likely. She’s a notorious villain who has caused great concerns
          among the entire Upper Realm.” Niu Tian nodded, looking extremely
          cautious.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I heard there was bad blood between her and Gu Changge. In fact,
          when she was in the Divine City, it was Gu Changge who led a group to
          attack her. Do you think she will do something later to take her
          revenge on him?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen dropped his voice to a hushed tone, and could hardly
          contain his anticipation and excitement. He was eager to witness the
          scene unfold before him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Niu Tian pondered deeply before shaking his head. His gaze then fell
          on the man in white, who was leading a group of True Daoists, and a
          soft sigh escaped him. “Unlikely. Making a move here won’t end well
          for her. Besides, Gu Changge might not necessarily be intimidated by
          her, given how strong he is now.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The thought of having provoked such a formidable foe left him
          restless and anxious, unable to find peace even in his sleep.
          Fortunately, Gu Changge remained unaware of Jiang Chen and his true
          identities, otherwise their very existence would be at risk.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I heard that only Young Master Changge and the Mistress of Devil
          Mountain survived the incident in Divine City, while the rest who were
          involved perished in that battle. What exactly happened at that time?
          Were both of them gravely wounded as rumored?” Princess Yu Feiya asked
          with a hint of disbelief and suspicion in her voice as she attempted
          to catch a glimpse of the shadowy figure in the demonic cloud.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The distance separating the Divine City from the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains remained shrouded in mystery. Even in the event of space
          crumbling and collapsing into a wormhole, it would be impossible for
          Gu Changge to emerge anywhere near the Boundary Marker Sea.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon learning of this rumor, Yu Feiya was a little skeptical and was
          hesitant to believe it. She believed there existed some sort of tacit
          understanding between Gu Changge and the demoness in red
          instead.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >While everyone was deep in their own thoughts, the Devil Mountain
          entourage stopped at where the black mist lingered. Master Elder
          Qinglong pointed toward the rock ahead and calmly said, “My Mistress
          wishes to acquire this Cursed Rock.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Cursed Rock was not that big, just a little bigger than a fist.
          Its surface was marred by jagged cracks, and it was as dark as ink.
          Wispy tendrils of black mist continued coming out from it, shrouding
          the entire area in its eerie veil.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Once towering at half a person’s height, the Cursed Rock had
          diminished in size over time. It was said that when the Prime Ancestor
          of Great West Holy Land brought it out from Kun Mountain, it was even
          larger. Nevertheless, it now lay before them, radiating a pulsating
          energy that intimidated many even in its reduced state.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing this, the numerous True Daoists present remained
          unfazed. They stared into the depths of the demonic cloud and inquired
          in a solemn tone, “What do you propose as compensation, my
          friend?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although the Cursed Rock’s ominous nature that even led to the
          destruction of the Great West Holy Land, it still held a great value.
          After all, it had been carefully preserved in Dark Kun City, requiring
          a lot of resources and effort just to keep it suppressed all these
          years.</span

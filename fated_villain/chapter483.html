          dignified. She glanced at those young beings before her eyes fell on
          some women. Someone looked back at her with eyes filled with divine
          light so brilliant it pained her eyes to the point of almost shedding

          fell towards the hunting ground in front. They were about to vent the
          anger and hatred that they had been holding in for a while. They were
          the proud youths blessed by heaven. No matter which era they were in,
          the opponents they looked for in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains
          could be considered their peers. They were held back by their Elders
          from fighting with Ye Han before, resulting in the deaths of two of
          their talents. At this moment, all they wanted was to put glory back
          into the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains&#8217; name, wash the shame
          from the previous fight away and avenge the two who lost their
          lives.</span

          and ancient forces. The King with Six Crowns merely glanced at the
          crowd before he shook his head. He didn&#8217;t care much about this
          battle which further disappointed him after he witnessed the fight
          between Ye Han and his opponent. He wanted more to fight with the Sky
          Demon Sovereign and others.</span

          from the distance then, sending the mountains and rocks rolling as the
          ground trembled. The horned prodigy was extremely tall, and he had the
          blood of the Ox Demon Clan flowing in him. He was now staring at the
          King with Six Crowns, his angry copper bell-like eyes held a murderous
          look.</span

          this. They should be glad that I hadn&#8217;t gone to them instead.]
          The King with Six Crowns shook his head, his face cold. At the same
          time, he felt a sense of being underestimated. It was as if other
          young existences were actively looking for prey, but he was actively
          sought by the prey! This somewhat irked him to the point of wanting to
          kill someone.</span

          with Six Crowns growled while glaring at the horned man. Despite the
          latter&#8217;s good looks, the aura seeping out of his whole body was
          too strong as if he was surrounded by a sea of blood-coloured stars
          bathed in supreme divine brilliance. Every step he took with a black
          spear in his hand resulted in waves of overwhelming momentum.</span

          didn&#8217;t hesitate to attack the King with Six Crowns with as much
          strength as he could muster. As his body boiled with divine power, his
          strength of Qi and blood shot out of his skull and pierced the
          sky.</span

          that their cultivation had reached the Sacred Lord Realm, the
          destructive power they caused was unimaginably terrifying. Glows from
          their spears would occasionally fall to the ground like stars.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just about ten attacks later, a muffled groan could be heard, and the
          place was soon soaked in fresh blood. With a bang, the body and soul
          of the living being called Niu Ming exploded.

          Wastelands and Ten Domains. But in the hands of the King with Six
          Crowns, he couldn&#8217;t even make five moves before he was killed.
          This made the looks on everyone&#8217;s faces turn solemn. Even though
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains seemed to have won in number,
          each and every one of the young prodigies of the Upper Realm was
          extremely frightening.</span

          found their target, and had started to attack. A terrifying battle
          that violently shook the sky and earth broke out here. Strong wind
          began to blow, making sand and rocks fly while the sky shook. Everyone
          had an opponent in front of them, and since there was a large number
          of young prodigies in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the young
          prodigies from the Upper Realm would often have to fight against a few
          people at the same time. It might look somewhat shameless, but since
          the Upper Realm only dispatched a few people, the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains would have to take whatever advantage they could.</span

          blood. His face quickly fell when he saw his favourite disciple
          exploding and turning into bloodmist as soon as his opponent&#8217;s

          Demon Sovereign, who was constantly suppressing him, making his whole
          body tremble as he coughed up blood. Even his powerful and strong

          young man with a robust body suddenly approached her. He must have
          wanted to ambush her as he thought that this shockingly beautiful
          young woman in front of him was weaker than the others. However, Gu
          Xianer seemed fairly unperturbed despite being surrounded. It was as
          if she had already sensed it. Her white and small fist looked as
          though it was carved from jade, but when she threw a punch, a loud
          bang sounded, and she pierced through the void and blasted away the
          person sneaking up on her. The pearl white fragments of bone,
          accompanied by bloodmist, sputtered everywhere.</span

          wings seemed to appear behind her back, and she suddenly darted across
          the space, quickly reaching and ending him. Now that she had finished
          off the two, Gu Xianer glanced into the sky. She happened to catch

          his rage from the furious look on his face. He couldn&#8217;t just sit
          by and watch his allies on their side die. So, he was determined to
          wash away their shame and raise their spirits. Naturally, many young

          would have crushed that despicable man. However, his strength must be
          comparable since he is Lin Wu&#8217;s brother. With Lin Wu&#8217;s

          powerful even amongst the young prodigies of the Upper Realm. He

          emanating from inside the Abyss which did not dissipate with time. He
          knew there would come a day when it would surge out and cause a
          catastrophe. Thus, that monk had made a grand vow—he wouldn&#8217;t

          the Sacred King Realm or even higher. Though it was hard to guess. The
          strongest of the current young prodigies were merely in the Sacred

          Demon-Burying Abyss since it was said that the monk had gone there
          once. His leading the way would save Gu Changge&#8217;s group some
          effort as well as present some other advantages. Jin Chan
          wouldn&#8217;t do this out of the kindness of his heart, so he might

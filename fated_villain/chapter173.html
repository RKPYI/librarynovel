      <h4>
        Chapter 173: Yue Mingkong Reflects on Herself; Pondering the Reason for
        Being Treated So Well!
      </h4>
      <p><b>[Baiheng Mountains]</b></p>
      <p>
        Among the vines and ancient trees, the mountains formed a continuous
        chain of peaks, emitting a spiritual aura dense enough to create a wave.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, in the depths of a hidden ruin, in front of an ancient
        stone gate, a beautiful and noble figure sat.
      </p>
      <p>Immortal rain fell, as the stone gate emitted a faint light.</p>
      <p>
        The figure was dressed in a broad white-jade robe, adorned with an
        ancient sea of stars, giving a lofty and exquisite appearance. The
        figure had a calm, profound aura that appeared to transcend the mundane
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three thousand green threads fluttered[1]. A fairy-like face and
        crystalline eyes as runes of the Immortal Dao flickered and floated
        around.
      </p>
      <p>[1. Metaphor for hair. This author really‚Ä¶]</p>
      <p>It was none other than Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>She had been cultivating here for almost a month.</p>
      <p>
        With her current abilities, it was still difficult for her to unlock the
        Fairy Gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she was afraid that if she went to Gu Changge for help, he
        would not be kind to her and would ultimately deceive her.
      </p>
      <p>So in the end, Yue Mingkong decided to make a breakthrough here.</p>
      <p>
        Coincidentally, she‚Äôd also obtained a mysterious scripture on the
        Immortal Dao from the Fairy Gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúThis Immortal Scripture can help me obtain a flawless Immortal
          Physique</b
        >[2]<b>‚Ä¶</b>‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        [2. Not the same as the flawless Immortal Foundation Base previously
        mentioned. They are probably something like a set‚Ä¶ probably.]
      </p>
      <p>
        As Yue Mingkong murmured to herself, a hazy rain of light containing
        immortal aura emerged from the gateway.
      </p>
      <p>
        The immortal rain carried immortal runes that were being refined into
        her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether the subject in question were her bones or physique, they were
        all transformed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even her aura changed, becoming more unearthly, as the world before her
        began to dim.
      </p>
      <p>But soon, Yue Mingkong sensed something, frowning.</p>
      <p>
        She stood up, returning to her former demeanour of an emperor who sat on
        the throne. Powerful, confident, indifferent, and in complete control of
        everything‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúSomeone triggered the formation that I had laid out‚Ä¶‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        As she said that, she turned into a divine rainbow and rushed into the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of her subordinates and followers who hid in various places
        simultaneously appeared as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over this period of time, she had used her formidable strength to take
        control over the lives and deaths of many, making them submit to her.
      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: Mommy Mingkong can make me submit to her-]</p>
      <p>Her followers now even included many of the Ancient Immortal Races.</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong also possessed secret techniques she could use to control
        others. And to contend with Gu Changge‚Äôs Immortal Devouring Demonic
        Technique, she had combed through various books.
      </p>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs from those books that she had obtained a divine controlling
        technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, those who surrounded her were her subordinates, subordinates
        whose lives and deaths she could control with a single thought without
        fear of betrayal.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòI‚Äôve set up a formation within a 3,000-mile radius of the Baiheng
        Mountain Range‚Ä¶‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no mistaking the fluctuation just now, several powerful auras
        are coming this way.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong appeared atop a mountain with indifferent eyes as
        terrifying waves coalesced atop the palms of her hands. ƒêiscover nùíÜw
        chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com
      </p>
      <p>She looked in the direction from which the disturbances came.</p>
      <p>There was a vague sense of discomfort in her heart.</p>
      <p>In fact, the person she was worried about the most was Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Apart from Gu Changge, there was no one else who knew about the Fairy
        Spirit that was about to appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had no idea how Gu Changge could have figured out where the spirit
        was.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her mind, Gu Changge was practically omnipotent with how many tricks
        he had up his sleeves.
      </p>
      <p>Nothing she ever thought of seemed impossible for Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Even now, Gu Changge‚Äôs schemes had dragged the Ancient Immortal Races
        into the mud. she could have never thought of such means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Poor Ye Ling, who had to carry the blame for Gu Changge even in death‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p>These things needed no further explanation.</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Yue Mingkong was now worried that Gu Changge actually knew
        that there would be a Fairy Spirit that would emerge from the Baiheng
        Mountain Range.
      </p>
      <p>When Gu Changge arrives, how would she explain herself?</p>
      <p>
        She might even make Gu Changge suspect her again because of the Fairy
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship between the two of them, which had been eased and
        brought closer, would probably be reduced to a cold stage again.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, all sorts of thoughts flashed through Yue Mingkong's
        mind.
      </p>
      <p><b>Rumble!</b></p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, in the distant sky, a multitude of divine rainbows appeared,
        heading in her direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man in the lead was dressed in feathered clothes with wide
        sleeves. His face is as handsome as jade, and his appearance was like
        that of a young immortal walking on the earth.
      </p>
      <p>Who was it but Gu Changge, the man she wanted to see the least.</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúHe really is here‚Ä¶‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the look of indifference on Yue Mingkong‚Äôs face grew
        stiff.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, what she had imagined as the worst possible scenario had
        become reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only had Gu Changge come, but he had also brought along a large
        number of followers, including even that fox-spirit, Yin Mei.
      </p>
      <p>Such a scene brought even greater discomfort to Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>
        Her cold eyes grew colder, her expression like an iceberg as she emitted
        a chilling and murderous aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, her cold gaze was not directed at Gu Changge, but rather behind
        him, Yin Mei, who was dressed in a red dress, her nine fox tails waving
        in the air.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúEmpress!‚Äù</b></p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        At that time, Yue Mingkong‚Äôs followers and servants looked at her with
        puzzled expressions.
      </p>
      <p>After all, the person who came‚Ä¶ was none other than Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>Wasn‚Äôt this situation a big problem for Yue Mingkong?</p>
      <p>After all, the two were an unmarried couple.</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúStop him for me.‚Äù</b> Yue Mingkong ordered coldly.</p>

        A silver crescent moon seal, the size of a palm, floated around her
        body, exuding an awe-inspiring pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, she contemplated how she would face Gu Changge, but now‚Ä¶ she
        wouldn‚Äôt stand for it any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei accompanied Gu Changge so that they could put on a big show
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such an act was enough to demonstrate the relationship between Yin Mei
        and Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing such an order, the group of followers all looked at each
        other, feeling somewhat helpless.
      </p>
      <p>However, they couldn't disobey Yue Mingkong's orders.</p>
      <p>
        At once, they rushed towards the approaching Gu Changge, attempting to
        intercept him.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúOh? Mingkong is here too? What a coincidence.‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked quite surprised, as though he‚Äôd just noticed Yue
        Mingkong.
      </p>
      <p>With a gesture of his hand, all the people behind him halted.</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúYoung Master Changge, we were ordered by Empress Yue, we‚Ä¶‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        The followers of Yue Mingkong bit the bullet as they helplessly blurted
        out what they were ordered to do.
      </p>
      <p>How could they take action against Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>Not unless they were trying to court death.</p>
      <p>
        These days, there was hardly anyone who didn‚Äôt know of Gu Changge‚Äôs
        strength and how he was unrivalled among the younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, he was one of their own.</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong was probably making a fuss for some unknown reason.</p>
      <p>
        They were caught in the middle of a private affair between two people,
        placing them in a difficult situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúIt's nothing, I suppose I've made Mingkong upset again.‚Äù</b> Gu
        Changge waved his hand carelessly and spoke with a knowing smile on his
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong threw a cold glance at Gu Changge but said nothing in
        response.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòHe knows he has made me upset?‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked as if he didn't know why she was so angry and asked
        with a faint smile,
        <b>‚ÄúWhat's wrong, Mingkong? Aren't you happy to see your husband?‚Äù</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong glanced at Yin Mei and asked, <b>‚ÄúWhy are you here?‚Äù</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei noticed Yue Mingkong's expression and was slightly startled.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had always heard about this future empress, the daughter of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the power she displayed today was nothing short of astonishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ordinary cultivators would probably bow in front of her subconsciously.
      </p>
      <p>Yet Yin Mei didn't care.</p>
      <p>
        She could sense Yue Mingkong's hostility and killing intent toward her.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòThe future empress wants to kill me, despite having only met me for the
        first time?‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòIt seems she is already aware of the relationship between me and
        Master.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòMoreover, it is likely that she knows of Master's possession of the
        Immortal Devouring Demonic Technique.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship between Yue Mingkong and Gu Changge seems to be quite
        complicated.
      </p>
      <p>Yin Mei felt a bit envious.</p>
      <p>
        She would never have dared to treat Gu Changge in such a manner as Yue
        Mingkong did.
      </p>
      <p>From Gu Changge's words, she could even hear a hint of indulgence.</p>
      <p>
        The usually cold and indifferent Gu Changge had shown such emotion for
        Yue Mingkong, making her wonder if she had misread the situation.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòJust how fortunate is this woman?'</p>
      <p>
        However, she also suspected that Gu Changge was deliberately putting on
        a facade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, Yin Mei was confident that Gu Changge would never let Yue
        Mingkong kill her.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúI'm quite curious also. How come you‚Äôre here too? It seems that not
          too long ago‚Ä¶‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        After hearing Yue Mingkong's question, Gu Changge couldn't help but ask
        with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as he said this, his eyes suddenly narrowed, as if he became
        somewhat interested.
      </p>
      <p>He looked like he was keen to find out more about this matter.</p>
      <p>
        When she saw this, Yue Mingkong‚Äôs heart fluttered. Before, she suspected
        that Gu Changge had already known of the Fairy Spirit that was about to
        appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, the reason why he was surprised and curious about her presence
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given Gu Changge's character, her presence here would definitely arouse
        his suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong also knew that this was not the time to be overly concerned
        about Yin Mei.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúMy intention is the same as yours.‚Äù</b> She said coldly, shifting
        the focus to Gu Changge‚Äôs intentions.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúOh, is that so?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúThat's right.‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled, seemingly unconcerned.</p>
      <p>He didn't question Yue Mingkong's words either.</p>
      <p>
        Then he took a step forward, and in a blur of the void, he arrived in
        front of Yue Mingkong in an instant.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúGu Changge, you-‚Äú</b></p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong was slightly startled.</p>
      <p>
        She didn't believe Gu Changge would take action against her over this
        matter right this instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her eyes shone like jewels and stared at him in silence, serene and
        moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúWhen your husband was injured, a while ago, you didn't come to pay a
          visit, you have made your husband quite sad.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge spoke as he naturally took hold of her supple body.</p>
      <p>
        She was as delicate and flawless as the finest of Immortal jades,
        exuding warmth and serenity.

      <p>However, he carried a slight tone of regret in his voice.</p>
      <p>
        The scene caused the followers to retreat and leave the place to the two
        of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei was envious of the sight, but she inevitably retreated to
        another place as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù</b> Yue Mingkong had not expected Gu Changge to suddenly do
        such a thing in front of everyone.

      <p>Her brain buzzed for a while, leaving her unable to react.</p>
      <p>
        But soon, she remembered that he had done the same thing in front of the
        two families' heads when they were in the Gu family hall.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong quickly composed herself.</p>
      <p>
        This was Gu Changge's usual tactic, so how could she be rattled by it?

      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúYou can fool everyone else, but you cannot fool me.‚Äù</b> Yue
        Mingkong replied.
      </p>
      <p>She wasn't lying, she truly believed in these words.</p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge merely shook his head and sighed,

          >‚ÄúWould you be happy if I told you something that was not in my
          conscience?‚Äù</b
        >
        She asked in return, a sour feeling in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòWhen exactly did Gu Changge become involved with Yin Mei?‚Äô</p>
      <p>She didn‚Äôt know about such a thing in her previous life.</p>

      <p><b>‚ÄúWhy wouldn't I be happy? After all, you are my lucky star.‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled and spoke words laced with a deeper meaning.</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong's cold eyes revealed doubts as she glanced at him.</p>
      <p>There was a feeling of something quite sinister in his smile.</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúYou killed Ye Ling already, didn't you?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>She suddenly asked.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúI helped you kill him. There shouldn't be any problem with that,
          no?‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't deny it, and his gaze fell to the hidden ruins below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúWhat do you mean, you helped me kill him? Clearly, you are the one
          who wanted to kill Ye Ling for his inheritance.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong had long been familiar with Gu Changge's shamelessness, yet
        she couldn‚Äôt help but be furious at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>It sounded like she had to thank him for stealing her prey.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúYou shouldn't say such things. If it wasn't for you, why would I
          have bothered with Ye Ling?‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a culprit too, so I can‚Äôt take all the credit.‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge spoke as he casually patted her head.</p>
      <p>[PR/N: I do love gaslighting.]</p>
      <p>
        Though Yue Mingkong had always been a calm and gentle person, at this
        moment, she was extremely furious.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for the fact that she couldn't beat Gu Changge, she would
        have smashed her jade fist into his face.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúAlright, I won't tease you any more.‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúHow could your husband forget your share of the benefits? This is a
          part of the Inheritance that Ye Ling received. The rest is gone.‚Äù
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        As Gu Changge smiled and spoke, the Enlightenment Platform woven with
        black and white vines appeared in his hand, intertwined with rich Dao
        energies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Astonishing symbols of reincarnation flashed across it, faint and
        indistinct.
      </p>
      <p>Its aura gave off a sense of enlightenment.</p>
      <p>
        For Gu Changge, it was tasteless to eat, but a pity to throw it away,
        after all, he didn't need it in order to achieve enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>It was the perfect gift for Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>‚ÄòShe should be able to use it well.‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        It was a small compensation for having bullied her for so long. After
        all, he had given Gu Xian'er 10 Divine Weapons.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúAn Enlightenment Platform?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong naturally knew what she was looking at and recognised the
        Platform, her crystal eyes growing more puzzled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a good treasure would make even beings in the Sacred Realm
        salivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was even imbued with the Reincarnation aura, making it even more
        precious.
      </p>
      <p>Was Gu Changge actually willing to give it to her?</p>
      <p>
        However, when she thought about it, she had already refined the drop of
        five-coloured True Dragon Blood contained within Long Teng's corpse from
        last time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, Gu Changge had not only given her the drop of True Dragon
        Blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was also concerned that she might be pursued by the Dragon Clan for
        revenge, so he took care of the witnesses and carried the blame for her.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong was well aware of this.</p>
      <p>
        And now he was going to give her a gift as precious as the Enlightenment
        Platform without hesitation?
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòWhat exactly is he thinking?‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly she felt as if‚Ä¶ she had been wrong about Gu Changge all along.
      </p>
      <p>The fact is that he was not as bad to her as she expected?</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúGu Changge, why are you treating me so well now?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong looked into Gu Changge's eyes and asked in a quiet voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her voice trembled slightly, being considerably softer than it was
        before.
      </p>
      <p>Then, in Gu Changge's head, the System Prompt sounded again.</p>
      <p>

      <h4>
        Chapter 213-1: The leek actually came to the door, The real inheritor of
        demonic art (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        The magnificent mountain gate was extremely tall, like the gate of
        heaven during ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were thousands of seasons in the middle, the clouds were steaming
        and the streams were shining, majestic, like a paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
        One after another, the rainbows traveled through the heavens and the
        earth, bringing with them all kinds of rays of light, which seemed to
        have a long history and profound heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu appeared here, with a light veil on her face, and a layer
        of mist hiding her whole face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from her appearance and voice, one couldn't tell whether she was
        male or female at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was alone, standing alone, and had no followers, but she had a
        natural aura all over her body, which was not to be underestimated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing her words, the guards of the Gu family, who were patrolling in
        front of the mountain gate, came towards this place in shock.
      </p>
      <p>"Heir from the Human Ancestor Hall?"</p>
      <p>
        Their expressions were a little puzzled for a while. If they remembered
        correctly, wasn't the descendant of Human Ancestor Hall the mysterious
        woman from the Ancient Immortal Wang Family?
      </p>
      <p>Why did someone suddenly appear again?</p>
      <p>Or was this person impersonating?</p>
      <p>
        They remembered very clearly that some time ago, during the birthday
        banquet of the mistress, the inheritor of the Human Ancestor Hall was
        assassinated by the inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>That incident caused a big stir, and there was a lot of uproar.</p>
      <p>
        "Who is so bold and dares to pretend to be a descendant of the Human
        Ancestor Hall?" At that moment, someone opened his mouth and asked, his
        eyes were like a sword, and he seemed to want to pierce the void and
        look at Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>The majestic pressure fell instantly.</p>
      <p>
        If it was an ordinary person, it would have been unbearable at this
        time, and his legs would have fallen to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Jiang Chuchu was not, she looked unusually calm, as if nothing in
        the world could attract her attention.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong> Visjt nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for new updates</p>
      <p>
        She just raised her hand, and among her five slender fingers, an
        exquisite token appeared.
      </p>
      <p>Human Ancestor Hall!</p>
      <p>The three characters appear in the void, revealing their identity.</p>
      <p>"Human Ancestor Order!"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this rune, the immortal guards in front of the mountain changed
        their expressions and recognized the token.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today's Upper Realm, there was probably no one who did not recognize
        this order.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancestor Order represented the identity of the Human Ancestral Hall,
        and sometimes it could even command many Taoist forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, their expressions became suspicious and shocked, but they
        would not let this person enter just because of this token.
      </p>
      <p>The Ancient Immortal Gu Family had strict rules.</p>
      <p>So what if you were the descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall?</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"In the Human Ancestor Hall, there is not only one descendant."</p>
      <p>
        Seeming to understand why the several people looked puzzled, Jiang
        Chuchu said flatly, "I hope that you will report and tell Young Master
        Changge that the descendant of Human Ancestor Hall have something to ask
        for."
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with her detached status, she also did not dare to be presumptuous
        in front of Ancient Immortal Gu Family‚Äôs mountain gate, and everything
        had to be done according to the rules.
      </p>
      <p>"Okay, please wait."</p>
      <p>
        Several immortal guards looked at each other and turned into divine
        lights to leave, and it took a long time to pass from the mountain gate
        to the central island, and after passing through many teleportation
        formations.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Watching the group of immortal guards leave, Jiang Chuchu's crystal
        clear eyes flashed with bright runes and whispered the name softly.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period, after Jiang Chuchu left the Heavenly Dao Ancient
        City, she went straight to the Ancient Ye Clan, wanting to know about Ye
        Ling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since she had a unique secret technique, she could determine the exact
        location of Ye Ling based on the relatively similar blood of Ye Ling's
        clansmen.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this idea in mind, Jiang Chuchu rushed to the Ancient Ye Clan. In
        her capacity, the Ancient Ye Clan did not dare to neglect, and tried
        their best to cooperate with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Ye Clan also did not want to be associated with the
        inheritors of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the end, after Jiang Chuchu performed the secret technique, the
        entire Ancient Ye Clan was shocked and discovered an unexpected fact and
        result.
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling's aura of life had already dissipated.</p>
      <p>This matter shocked the entire Ancient Ye clan.</p>
      <p>
        In other words, during this period of time, the inheritor of demonic art
        who had been making a lot of noise was actually not Ye Ling but someone
        else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Jiang Chuchu was a little surprised by this conclusion, she
        already expected this‚Ä¶ because she felt that there was something wrong
        with Ye Ling from the beginning, his actions were too passive, and there
        seemed to be someone behind him. And the invisible hand kept pushing
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Jiang Chuchu's view, Ye Ling's death was actually inevitable, it was
        just a matter of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, she always felt that there was a big problem with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>However, this was only her intuition, and there was no evidence.</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, in order to confirm the truth of this guess, Jiang Chuchu
        came all the way to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. On the way, she also
        heard about Wang Ziji's assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
        She heard that there was a huge organization behind the inheritors of
        demonic art, and even Heavenly Emperor Mountain was involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        It just so happened that the Emperor of Heavenly Emperor Mountain had
        appeared during this period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This series of events made Jiang Chuchu a little confused, and always
        felt that there were many doubts in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But since she was not the party involved and did not know the details.
      </p>
      <p>
        "As long as I come to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, I will be able to
        know what happened at that time, so as to determine the real suspect‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was thinking, waiting for the report, standing quietly
        under the mountain gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Gu family members who passed by glanced at her and were a little
        curious, but no one came forward to ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I just don't know what Gu Changge's attitude is. After all, the rumors
        are unbelievable, and I have to witness it with my own eyes."
      </p>
      <p>"I just hope that my guesses are wrong‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu felt that if Gu Changge had a ghost in his heart, he would
        definitely not let her in at this time.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        After all, she was different from Wang Ziji, who had not been deeply
        involved with the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>She came here so rashly, so she had some confidence in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        "The young master has prepared a banquet, waiting for the arrival of the
        descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall."
      </p>
      <p>And just when all kinds of thoughts flashed in Jiang Chuchu's mind.</p>
      <p>Soon, several immortal guards came back with a reply.</p>
      <p>"So calm?"</p>
      <p>
        This made Jiang Chuchu a little surprised. It seemed that Gu Changge
        didn't care at all.
      </p>
      <p>"This thing is getting troublesome."</p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Jiang Chuchu followed a few people with a calm expression
        through the outer and inner islands.
      </p>
      <p>
        After many teleportation formations, she finally arrived at the mountain
        peak where Gu Changge was.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tip of the iceberg revealed by Ancient Immortal Gu Family made her
        mood surge with waves all day long, and ripples appeared at this time,
        making it difficult to continue for her to stay calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she even understood that if Gu Changge really had a
        problem, it would be an extremely terrifying disaster for the entire
        Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>Now Gu Changge had already grown his wings.</p>
      <p>She needed to find a way to stop this.</p>
      <p>
        "The young master is waiting for the guest in the hall, so we will leave
        first."
      </p>
      <p>
        The group of attendants and immortal guards who led the way quickly left
        the place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's brow couldn't help but frown, and a vague uneasiness
        suddenly arose in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cloudy, fairy-like palace on the mountain peak looked like a magic
        cave to her at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If there is really a problem with Gu Changge, he should not dare to
        make a move on me at will, once I have an accident in the Ancient
        Immortal Gu Family, the Human Ancestor Hall will know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ At that time,
        the world will be alarmed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Gu Changge will not be that stupid."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, that uneasy intuition grew thicker and thicker, causing
        Jiang Chuchu's brows to furrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The seven-bodied immortal soul was already the most supreme talent in
        the world, which was rare in a thousand years.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she had a nine-bodied immortal soul, and her talent in perception
        was so powerful that it was mind-boggling, and she even had the ability
        to foretell the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was why all along, Jiang Chuchu had trusted her intuition so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, Jiang Chuchu arrived at the mountain peak, inside the lofty
        and majestic hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as she entered the hall, she noticed the young man at a glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starlight drops, wisps, multicolored dense light pervaded, as if coming
        to the depths of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>In the hall, Gu Changge was seated on top.</p>
      <p>
        He was wearing a wide robe, his hair draped behind the head, and looked
        at ease, while showing dignity and a high temperament.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bottom of the banquet had been set up, spiritual fruits, immortal
        wine, many ferocious beast meat, all kinds of food.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were even many beautiful and powerfully gifted women, dancing in
        the hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their bodies were exquisite, their dancing posture was moving, along
        with the zither and the thurible, and appeared a kind of quiet and
        lofty.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know how to address you? You have come all the way from a
        billion miles, I wonder what the reason behind this is?"
      </p>
      <p>
        When Gu Changge saw Jiang Chuchu coming, he didn't seem to be surprised
        and spoke naturally, and then gestured for Jiang Chuchu to take a seat.
      </p>
      <p>
        His face was warm with a perfect smile, letting people not find a single
        flaw.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 213-2: 7: The leek actually came to the door, The real inheritor
        of demonic art (2)
      </h4>

        <strong>7</strong

          >: The leek actually came to the door, The real inheritor of demonic
          art (Part </strong
        ><strong>2</strong><strong>)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, when the immortal guard arrived to inform him, Gu Changge
        guessed that the visitor was another heir of the Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>In order to wait for her arrival.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge had not moved or left the clan.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, from Wang Ziji's mouth, he had already sidetracked a lot of
        news about Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>
        He knew that she was powerfully gifted and was known in the Human
        Ancestor Hall as the reincarnation of the Ancient Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when he saw her today, that huge amount of her Luck points was
        already about several tens of thousands, so Gu Changge couldn't help but
        be a little heartbroken.
      </p>
      <p>This living leek!</p>
      <p>How dare she take the initiative and send herself to my door!</p>
      <p>
        Although she was not a Daughter of Luck, but the heir of the Human
        Ancestor Hall was also a person with great luck, the number of such
        people in this world possessing such Luck were very few.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that the cultivators who are involved with the Human Ancestor
        should not be simple people."
      </p>
      <p>
        Various thoughts flashed through Gu Changge's mind, and he could not see
        the slightest abnormality on her face.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, he had already guessed Jiang Chuchu's purpose for coming to
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this regard, he did not know what to say other than that she was
        really brave.
      </p>
      <p>Was she too smart and confident, or too stupid?</p>
      <p>"Chuchu greets, Young Master Changge!"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, in front of Gu Changge, Jiang Chuchu also dispersed the
        fog on her face and said in an originally calm and melodious voice, no
        longer concealing it.
      </p>
      <p>She intended to open up to the truth.</p>
      <p>
        The actual fact was that this kind of tactic was not very useful in
        front of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing him with her own eyes, she could know better how wrong the rumors
        really were.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's strength, indeed, could not be judged based on rumors.</p>
      <p>
        This made Jiang Chuchu even more convinced of the idea that there was
        something wrong with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she still remained calm, not believing that Gu Changge would
        dare to lay a hand on her in the grounds of the Ancient Immortal Gu
        Family.
      </p>
      <p>"Chuchu?"</p>
      <p>
        "That's a good name, really Chuchu, I feel sorry for her." Hearing this,
        Gu Changge sighed in admiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, although half of Jiang Chuchu's immortal face was hidden
        by the veil, her pair of eyes were as cold as a cold pool, like a lonely
        cultivator watching the world.
      </p>
      <p>From the external appearance, it naturally went without saying.</p>
      <p>
        If the Human Ancestor Hall was some kind of protagonist, then Jiang
        Chuchu was definitely the female protagonist associated with it.
      </p>
      <p>Such boldness would not be what an ordinary woman should have.</p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge, praises me too much."</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu said indifferently, without being condescending, and then
        entered the seat and sat down, slightly drooping her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>In those eyes, many strange runes started to appear lightly.</p>

        This was her tracing divine ability, which could trace many signs,
        causes and effects between heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wanted to determine whether there was a problem with Gu Changge or
        not, and this was a wonderful opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>Other than her, no one else in the world had this kind of talent.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu did not believe that Gu Changge could detect anything at
        this time.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, her movements looked very stealthy.</p>
      <p>
        It looked like she didn't want to meet Gu Changge's eyes and naturally
        landed her eyes on the spiritual wine and melons and fruits on the
        table.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I wonder what is the reason for Holy Maiden Chuchu‚Äôs visit to the Gu
        family?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, it was as if Gu Changge had not noticed Jiang Chuchu's
        subtle movements.
      </p>
      <p>
        He raised his cup to his mouth, looked natural and asked with a light
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, he actually knew Jiang Chuchu's purpose, but he didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu was tracing Gu Changge's aura with her own talent.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing him ask this, she was also slightly stunned for a moment, and
        then answered calmly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I heard that Young Master Changge fought with the Inheritor of the
        Demonic Art, and Chuchu has always been curious about that battle, so I
        wanted to come visit Young Master Changge and ask for some details."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Asking for details? Could it be that Holy Maiden is also planning to go
        after Ye Ling?"
      </p>
      <p>Upon hearing that, Gu Changge asked as if he was a bit surprised.</p>
      <p>However, he did not wait for Jiang Chuchu to answer.</p>
      <p>
        He continued to speak, with a tone of regret and pity, "However, I‚Äôm
        afraid that Holy Maiden Chuchu has come too late, Ye Ling is already
        dead. Were you really unaware of this matter?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words, Jiang Chuchu fiercely raised her eyes to look at Gu
        Changge, her heart became slightly austere, a chill and alarm steeply
        rose at her back.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was that straightforward?</p>
      <p>
        The first time she came, he said this kind of thing so directly? Could
        it be that Ye Ling was killed by him?
      </p>
      <p>
        "What does Young Master Changge mean by this? How did Ye Ling die?
        Chuchu can not understand."
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Jiang Chuchu still maintained calmness in her expression and
        said indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she was already eight percent sure in her heart that Gu
        Changge was absolutely inseperable to the inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>"It doesn't matter if you don't understand."</p>
      <p>"Holy Maiden Chuchu will understand later."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shook his head, "Rather, Holy Maiden Chuchu has come from
        hundreds of millions of miles, so I'm sorry to miss out on welcoming
        you, so I'll accompany you to a drink."
      </p>
      <p>
        Saying that, he took the initiative to pour the wine and drank it all in
        one go.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu was a little hesitant.</p>
      <p>"What? Are you afraid that this Gu will poison the wine?"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing her appearance, Gu Changge couldn't help sneering, and his words
        touched Jiang Chuchu's mind.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge is worrying too much‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu frowned. Although she really thought so, she naturally
        couldn't admit it at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, this was equivalent to not giving face to Gu Changge, the
        host.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, the faces of the two had not been torn apart yet, or they
        were still in false pretense.
      </p>
      <p>They more or less considered the other side's face.</p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge waved his hand in a sullen mood and interrupted her,
        "Forget it, don't drink it, it's normal for Holy Maiden Chuchu to be so
        vigilant, after all, I did poison this wine."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu was stunned for a moment, and when she
        realized the meaning of Gu Changge's words her pupils shrank suddenly.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, even with her state of mind, her face turned pale.</p>

        She traced Gu Changge's aura with her special talent, and now she had
        finally succeeded.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong></p>
      <p>At this moment, his aura was almost suffocating.</p>
      <p>
        The whole person's mind was instantly filled with a maddening,
        indescribable gray fog, among which there was an indescribable
        terrifying existence, ancient and majestic, as if dragging all beings
        into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of aura was majestic and chaotic, as if it was composed of
        countless origins and laws. Under the majesty of this, she was as small
        as an ant.
      </p>
      <p>"He really‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"Devoured a lot of origins‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's expression under the veil turned a little pale, but she
        was still restraining herself with strong willpower, so as not to
        display any strangeness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now she could be sure that Gu Changge was the most hidden inheritor of
        demonic art!
      </p>
      <p>It was terrifying to the bones!</p>
      <p>Guessing was one thing.</p>
      <p>
        Now that it was confirmed, even her state of mind was trembling
        slightly, and things finally turned to the worst that she didn't want to
        happen.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge looked at her with interest.</p>
      <p>As if he didn't know what Jiang Chuchu did.</p>
      <p>
        "Is something wrong with Holy Maiden Chuchu? Your face suddenly looks a
        little pale. What I said just now was just a joke, you don‚Äôt have to
        take it seriously?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu quickly regained her composure, and nodded when she heard
        the words, "Thank you for your concern, Young Master Changge, but it's
        better not to joke like this."
      </p>
      <p>
        If it was outside, she would still have the confidence to fight Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, she didn't even dare to let Gu
        Changge notice her abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The premise that Gu Changge won't do anything to her was that she didn't
        know her true identity.
      </p>
      <p>Now, once Gu Changge noticed it, would he let him go?</p>
      <p>
        However, Jiang Chuchu was certain that Gu Changge would not easily
        attack her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once she had an accident in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, then the
        Ancient Immortal Gu Family would become the target of public criticism.
      </p>
      <p>Unless Gu Changge was willing to risk his identity being exposed.</p>
      <p>
        All kinds of thoughts flashed in her mind, and Jiang Chuchu had already
        given birth to the intention of retreat at this time.
      </p>
      <p>Her initial instinct was right.</p>
      <p>
        It was just that after determining Gu Changge's true identity, how to
        expose him was a problem, because she had no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>Tell the people of the Human Ancestral Hall?</p>
      <p>
        But with her words alone, how could it be possible to shake Gu Changge
        and Ancient Immortal Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, it might be thought that she deliberately framed Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because she couldn't come up with any evidence that Gu Changge was the
        inheritor of demonic art. If his identity was simple, then things would
        be a lot easier. UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge's identity and background was destined to be the
        highest figure in the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>Who dared to say such words without evidence?</p>
      <p>This matter needed to be considered in the long run.</p>
      <p>"Oh, don't care how?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge's smile suddenly became a little intriguing,
        "After all, the Holy Maiden Chuchu came all the way, this Gu will keep
        this kindness in my heart and take care of you, is there any problem?"
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu just wanted to leave this place at this time.</p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge is overly concerned."</p>
      <p>
        "I'm in a hurry today, since Young Master Changge said that Ye Ling is
        dead, then I should go look for other clues."
      </p>
      <p>
        She replied very tactfully, stating that she wanted to say goodbye to
        it.
      </p>
      <p>But at this time, how could Gu Changge let her leave so easily?</p>

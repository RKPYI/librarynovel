          went, the more intense the terrifying fluctuation felt. Moreover,
          other than the countless skeletons hanging on the walls surrounding
          them, there were also living beings of all races. They could also feel
          the fear that made them shiver and penetrated their souls. The cold

          handful of people had come to this pitch-black place. However, with Gu
          Changge&#8217;s powerful eyes, he could easily see the surroundings
          clearly. The walls were steep and covered with various plants. There
          were also many fairly young Soul-Exterminating Lotuses taking root in
          the void.</span

          monks around Chosen Monk Jin Chan were struggling to move forward, and
          many had suffered serious injuries inflicted by the demonic entities
          here. However, Buddhist Mountain&#8217;s dharma was exquisite enough
          to easily expel Demonic Energy from them without causing much
          damage.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although what Gu Changge said before eased his suspicion, he was
          still wary of Gu Changge and secretly had his guard up. A man like him
          would never give his complete trust to another person, more so when
          the other party was Gu Changge. The best thing to do now was to avoid
          Gu Changge and enter the place alone so that he could prevent Gu
          Changge from coveting the Zen Robe.</span

          give much of a reaction other than replying with a smile. &#8220;All
          the more reason for me to stay if it&#8217;s dangerous. What if
          something bad happens to you here? I wouldn&#8217;t want the Buddhist
          Mountain to blame me for it.&#8221;

          on his face. &#8220;In that case, I&#8217;ll have to trouble you in a
          bit, Young Master Changge.&#8221; In fact, he wasn&#8217;t surprised
          by Gu Changge&#8217;s reply. It only made sense for Gu Changge to not
          leave at this point. It wasn&#8217;t as though Chosen Monk Jin Chan
          had high hopes when he suggested it earlier.</span

          Demonic Energy was even more widespread, and finally came to the

          >Different from the turbulent Demonic Energy in other areas, this
          place appeared to be extremely peaceful. Not a single demonic entity
          could be seen. As if they had entered an invisible portal to the
          deepest part of hell, this place was so quiet not a hint of energy of
          life could be detected.</span

          >&#8220;Something feels off here. It&#8217;s unsettling,&#8221;
          commented a monk from the Floating Buddhist Temple. He had a frown on
          his face as his eyes swept across the quiet abyss. This was very
          different from the depths of the Demon-Burying Abyss they imagined.
          However, they could still see the many traces of fighting and killing.
          Someone had been here before, but this was also where they met their
          end. Thick Demonic Fog could also be seen filling the air of this
          place, and it could even shroud one&#8217;s divine sense behind a dark
          and gloomy curtain.</span

          >[The Zen Robe is here.] Chosen Monk Jin Chan felt the Buddhist Bone
          in his arms start to glow as it sent out a sense of familiarity. This
          piece of Buddhist Bone was the relic transformed by the last owner of
          the Zen Robe after his demise. It looked exactly like a bone that
          shone brilliantly as wisps of Buddhist cadence intertwined on its
          surface. However, Chosen Monk Jin Chan&#8217;s face looked as normal
          as could be when he suggested, &#8220;This is a special place. I
          suggest we split up and look for leads. What do you think, Young
          Master Changge?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge, too, felt a sense of familiarity with nature coming from
          the depths of the Demon-Burying Abyss. He smiled nonchalantly upon
          hearing those words. &#8220;Since Chosen Monk Jin Chan has said so, we
          should investigate separately. But if there is any danger, I am afraid
          it will be difficult to go to immediately lend each other our
          support.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;There is no other way. Everyone should watch their own backs.
          I have my suspicions that this place has something to do with the
          loosening and breaking of the Demon-Burying Abyss seal. Let&#8217;s
          gather up here if you can&#8217;t find any clues,&#8221; Chosen Monk
          Jin Chan sighed.</span

          >&#8220;If so, I&#8217;ll start from this side.&#8221; Gu Changge
          smilingly nodded and went directly to another area where the Demonic
          Energy was more turbulent. Chosen Monk Jin Chan took a deep look at
          him, and it was only after seeing Gu Changge&#8217;s figure disappear
          that he turned around and went in the direction the Buddhist bone was
          beckoning him to. However, out of worry that Gu Changge would turn
          back, the monk hid himself and carefully waited there.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[It seems that he really went in another direction.] Chosen Monk Jin
          Chan quietly breathed a sigh of relief. After not seeing Gu Changge
          following him despite him waiting for a long time, he headed towards
          the place the Buddhist bone picked up. He was extremely vigilant
          towards Gu Changge, and he hadn&#8217;t lowered his guard for even one
          second. He was cautious about everything.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After separating from Chosen Monk Jin Chan Fozi and the others, Gu
          Changge appeared on a low mountain at the bottom of the abyss with a
          faint mockery on his face. [Are you still foolishly waiting for me to
          turn back?]
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >How could he not know what the Chosen Monk was thinking? Just as
          Chosen Monk Jin Chan didn&#8217;t want him to follow, Gu Changge also
          didn&#8217;t want to be followed. After all, there was still a drop of
          his True Blood here. He could go take his True Blood while Chosen Monk
          Jin Chan went for the Zen Robe. In fact, Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t the
          least bit worried. Even if Chosen Monk Jin Chan found what he was here
          for, Gu Changge had his ways to make the monk surrender the item to
          him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the energy contained in this drop of True Blood in the
          Demon-Burying Abyss was beyond imagination. With his current strength,
          even if his Grand Flask swallowed it and forcely refined it, it would
          be a tall task. But as long as Gu Changge had the Zen Robe, the
          process would be much easier.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge&#8217;s figure swiftly passed through this place and
          headed towards the darker area ahead, where the terrifying
          fluctuations could be seen and felt. This was where his Sacred Emperor
          Realm aura surged. It practically made him invincible. Even from a
          distance, his aura felt as though it could cause a person’s body and
          soul to collapse.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >During this process, there were many Sacred King Realm great demons
          who appeared. However, all of them ended up cowering as they kept
          their distance and prostrated on the spot they stood on.

          >Gu Changge&#8217;s cultivation now was only half a foot away from
          Quasi-Nirvana Realm. Those in the Sacred King Realm were no different
          from ants in his eyes. At this moment, the great demons all felt as if
          they were worshipping a true dragon. Their opponent could shatter them
          to pieces by putting a little pressure.</span

          >The land in front of him was already a dark purple colour. As if
          formed by countless blood stains. The quiet, exhausted piece of land
          was filled with Demonic Energy. This was a strange place which had
          been smashed to pieces. Terrifying craters formed from fallen stars
          could also be seen here.</span

          >Gu Changge went deep into the place, but he didn&#8217;t feel Chan
          Honyi&#8217;s aura. Thinking that she must be where Chosen Monk Jin
          Chan was heading, while he himself was where the drop of True Blood
          fell, he immediately headed deeper to the seemingly-deserted
          land.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There were even some ancient Engraved stones here that fell from
          somewhere. Some of them were complete; some were broken. Gu Changge
          only took a glance at them before he got bored of the sight. The
          depths of the Demon-Burying Abyss was a world of its own where the
          territory was endless.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The remaining prestige of the drop of True Blood had even changed and
          reversed the World Principles here, causing the environment here to
          have different Great Daos. He could even see many disordered stars and
          galaxies emerging above his head. This scene was frightening; this
          place was already an independent world of its own.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge eventually reached the deepest parts of the place. This
          sea of fire, or sea of blood, was boundless and thick with surging
          Demonic Energy. As it bubbled and billowed, wisps of brilliant,
          blood-coloured oozed out of it. Supreme Principles could be seen
          merging into the sea. If one was looking at it from a high altitude,
          one would be able to see bubbles emerging one by one and tumbling into
          the sky as if there was an ancient world in it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even Gu Changge felt like his body was about to burst when he arrived
          here. One could only imagine how scary and mighty the energy of this
          sea of blood was. Even a True Daoist would feel intimidated, and would
          hesitate to approach this place. However, as Gu Changge exuded more of
          his energy, this feeling of being torn apart disappeared. After all,
          the two were two peas in a pod.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Right then, several vague figures exuding terrifying auras emerged
          not far away. However, their faces were not of the human race. Their
          strange appearance was as though all kinds of things were spliced
          together. There were ones with human heads and animal bodies, and
          there are also those with animal heads and human bodies.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were staring at Gu Changge with surprise, awe, and submission at
          this moment. Their feelings came from the bottom of their hearts. This
          was because they were the terrifying Ox Spirits bred by this sea of
          blood, and they were also giants who dominated the Demon-Burying
          Abyss. Any other demonic entities were but food to them.</span

          He only lightly closed his eyes and sighed in admiration when he came
          to the bank of the sea of blood. [This familiar and long-lost energy…]
          At this moment, the sea of blood in front of him was boiling, and
          there was a monstrous red wave of light rushing out. It was as if it
          was cheering and welcoming their original master.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Whoosh* Gu Changge suddenly opened his mouth at the boundless sea of
          blood. A terrifying momentum seemed to sweep the world as it shook the
          heavens, and even space was about to collapse. All the creatures near
          the sea of blood couldn&#8217;t help trembling and falling to their
          knees, not daring to move an inch.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!* The area between his eyebrows let out a bright, clean glow
          then. It was a terrifying power that penetrated the clouds, entwined
          with five-colour rays of light and Chaos Qi. This was the first time
          Gu Changge had shown his power, which literally could split the sky
          apart. Even the stars in front of him were so fragile they could turn
          to ashes in one breath.</span

          >A terrible thing happened the next moment. Following Gu
          Changge&#8217;s roar, the sea of blood in front of him began to boil
          like crazy as it crashed in Gu Changge&#8217;s direction. He devoured

          there were many shiny scriptures on it, and a string of intertwined
          and glowing ancient runes branded everywhere near it. Faintly, he

          However, they could feel a palpitating energy which made them tremble
          coming from it. They could hardly withstand such pressure. Having to
          put up with the feeling made them feel like ants in front of a dragon.
          The unstoppable pressure was comparable to the feeling of walking on
          the edge of an abyss with eyes closed; one mistake was all it took for

          >The Floating Buddhist Temple was grand and sombre-looking, glowing
          faintly with light. The righteous aura it exuded was indescribable and
          probably could bind any demonic being. The soft sound of a gong and
          Buddhist chanting could be faintly heard which contained the truth of
          the universe. The place could cleanse the minds of cultivators and
          make them calm and pacified.</span

          >Monks were sitting everywhere pondering on the Dharma. All of them
          were surrounded by a golden Buddha aura which made them appear
          extraordinary. They did not mind the visitors walking inside the
          temple, only sparing them a glance before returning to cultivate, as
          if Dharma was their only focus.</span

          >Gu Changge and Jiang Chuchu walked side by side, their robes
          fluttering in the air and making them resemble an Immortal couple.
          Many powerful experts followed behind, including Gu Changge&#8217;s
          subordinates and cultivators from Mortal Palace. Meanwhile, Chosen
          Monk Jin Chan walked ahead of them to lead the way.</span

          >While Jin Chan looked calm on the outside, he couldn&#8217;t help
          feeling surprised. He had never expected Gu Changge to come to the
          Demon-Burying Abyss since the man wasn&#8217;t one to sacrifice
          himself for anyone. He wouldn&#8217;t even care if the chaos spread
          everywhere in the world. He was much more selfish and cruel than Jin
          Chan himself and would only make a move when it benefited him
          immensely. That was why Jin Chan felt doubtful and kept a mental eye
          on Gu Changge.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, he did trust Jiang Chuchu. Even if they hadn&#8217;t met
          that often, he admired her righteous attitude back at the Immortal
          Academy. However, he didn&#8217;t trust the explanation that Gu
          Changge was only here to accompany her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, Jin Chan led the group through the area into the depths of the
          Floating Buddhist Temple. A mighty energy billowed in the air as
          Buddha aura surrounded the mountain, giving the place an air of
          sacredness and peace. Towers with spherical roofs stood before them,
          with many beasts meandering around below, all seemed to be at peace
          and not ferocious at all. Instead, they were much more gentle than
          humans and contained some sort of Buddhist aura. Any bloodthirsty
          beast surrounded by the Buddha Qi of the place would lose their savage
          nature, becoming gentle and tame.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s said that the Buddhist Mountain has a Deliverance
          Sutra which could tame everything including savage animals and
          artifacts. The black mountain in front of the Buddhist Mountain once
          bound a Monkey Demon known as the Heavenly Chaos Saint. The Buddha had
          to chant day and night for ten thousand years for it to eventually
          lose its wild nature and follow the Buddha. He was then given the name
          Heavenly Chaos Buddha and now guards the Buddhist Mountain gates.
          I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s true, though.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge glanced around at the beasts resting around the pagodas,
          sounding interested. He already knew where the Deliverance Sutra came
          from since it had been an incomplete chapter that came from his
          Demonic Manipulation Urn. After being completed by a high-level monk
          via deduction, it became a new technique which was claimed to be able
          to tame everything and couldn&#8217;t be countered.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many cultivators ended up following the Buddha because of this,
          resulting in a crusade against the Buddhist Mountain in the Upper
          Realm. However, the Buddhist Mountain abilities were very strange yet
          superior to the usual secret techniques of the other Sects. Its
          numerous believers could be found in the Upper Realm and the Lower
          Realms as well. Their number was comparable to that of Mortal Palace
          believers. Several Sect Masters had even studied in the Buddhist
          Mountain and followed the Buddha when they were younger, thus giving
          the place plenty of connections with many different Upper Realm
          Sects.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There were also many great treasures inside the Buddha Mountain, some
          of which contained powerful energy. A Buddha had once appeared with a
          Demon-Killing Staff and killed a member of the Eternal Overcast Royal
          Family. His power was comparable to the Mortal One back then. Thus, it
          could be said that the Buddhist Mountain was much more mysterious than
          Mortal Palace and Sky Emperor Mountain.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh, that happened a very long time ago. Now the Buddhist
          Mountain gate is no longer guarded by him but by his descendants for
          many generations. As for the Deliverance Sutra, that&#8217;s just
          rumours created by the outside world. Very few could gain access to
          the highest sutras in the Buddhist Mountain.&#8221; Jin Chan
          smiled.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t surprised by that. The Buddhist
          Mountain&#8217;s way of acting (as though they always held the high
          ground) was similar to his own and so he couldn&#8217;t say much. He
          just wanted to know how close the connection was between the
          Deliverance Sutra and his Demonic Manipulation Urn, as well as whether
          he could alter the Sutra so those tamed by the Buddhist Mountain would
          be under his control. However, that was just a passing thought; he
          would have to find the original copy of the Sutra first. He
          didn&#8217;t have time for them otherwise. Thus, this matter would be
          put on hold.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I heard that the Heavenly Chaos Saint was tamed because he
          didn&#8217;t respect the Dharma and looked down on the Buddhist
          Mountain. A cultivator with great abilities transformed his hand into
          a black mountain to bind him in front of the Buddhist Mountain and
          make him listen to Dharma day and night.&#8221; Jiang Chuchu, thinking
          that Gu Changge was interested in the matter, immediately informed
          them of what she knew from the ancient records.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You are actually mistaken. It wasn&#8217;t because he
          didn&#8217;t disrespect the Dharma, but because he was far too
          stubborn and disregarded the rules. The Buddhist Mountain thus chose
          to teach him a lesson and rehabilitate him. He was so grateful that he
          decided to guard our gate to repay in kindness.&#8221; Jin Chan turned
          to correct her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chuchu eyed him and fell silent, knowing that it was no use
          elaborating when she was here in the Buddhist Mountain. She knew that
          it was merely their opinion and that many forces had records of the
          true proceedings. Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t surprised by the
          shamelessness of the Buddhist Mountain, since he would have done it as
          well. Any force would take a terrifying guard seriously after
          all.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, they arrived at a temple compound. Jin Chan told the other
          monks to leave as soon as they arrived so Gu Changge and his group
          could rest here for the day, which they promptly did.

          tomorrow to deal with the great demon catastrophe inside. The Buddhist
          Mountain would also send many accomplished Buddhas to join them
          too.</span

          very acutely. She had used it to uncover Gu Changge&#8217;s true
          identity, and now she could sense something suspicious about the
          Chosen Monk Jin Chan. The monk might have ulterior motives for going
          to the Demon-Burying Abyss.

          during the journey or he might cause issues. It will be terrible if
          things go wrong and he releases the bound great demon
          inside.&#8221;</span

          I&#8217;ve heard that Jin Chan has gone there once, so is there a

          any monks here who were well-versed in this Talent, he wouldn&#8217;t
          be found. However, he did conceal his energy just as a precaution. He
          had sensed someone looking at him when he entered the temple, who had
          looked away at once when he looked back in their direction. This was a

          to the Demon-Burying Abyss. If the monk had the same intention as him
          then he wasn&#8217;t interested; Jin Chan might be looking for
          something inside. The monk had gone there once and was said to have
          nearly died there. Now that the seal was weakening and chaos was
          erupting inside the Abyss, he could take advantage of the situation
          and get what he wanted. If so, Gu Changge now had a scapegoat who he
          could blame for the broken seal in the Abyss.</span

          lit. Buddha aura illuminated the walls, and the strings of Buddhist
          beads glowed even brighter in the light. An elderly monk with white
          eyebrows long enough to reach the floor was knocking on his wooden
          fish, the sound of his chanting filled with an indescribable aura and
          seemingly resonating.

          manifesting in the Border Marker Sea had shocked many in the younger
          generation including him, but he knew that Mortal Palace had a secret
          technique which could use the Power of Faith to manifest a Dharma Body
          from an infinite distance away. That technique had nothing to do with
          the wielder&#8217;s level of cultivation but now it seems Gu Changge

          which ensured that monks accomplished in the Dharma could retain their

          was the Zen Robe he had brought into the Demon-Burying Abyss. The Zen
          Robe was the most sacred item of the Buddhist Mountain which contained
          extraordinary Dharma. Thanks to innumerable powerful monks chanting
          continuously, it had developed great Buddhata which could bind
          everything demonic. As for why it had ended up in the Abyss, it was an

          staring at them from that direction, but nothing was there when he
          turned to look. This confused him. How could he be mistaken with his
          level of cultivation? Also, who could openly scrutinise him in this

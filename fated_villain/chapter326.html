          murderous atmosphere. Everyone&#8217;s eyes were cold and with intent
          to kill, but there was still lingering fear in their hearts. From
          their point of view, Qin Wuya was actually on the same side as the
          black robed man, who suddenly broke in and wanted to assassinate
          Saintess Ziyan.

          Master Gu reacted quickly, sensing something was wrong, and had
          quickly returned, perhaps something awful would have happened to
          Saintess Ziyan! Once such a thing happens, everyone on patrol would
          naturally not be able to escape from being blamed.] At the thought of

          felt that things were going downhill. Even if he was confident at the
          beginning, at this time, a chill came over him. He didn&#8217;t expect
          that Gu Changge would suddenly appear.</span

          turn back? If I don’t come up with some kind of explanation, I will be
          regarded as someone who is on the same side as the assassin.] Since
          Qin Wuya had been cultivating for many years and had an extraordinary
          state of mind, he easily calmed down and asked in a deep voice. “Gu
          Changge, if you are smart enough, let go of Saintess
          Ziyan.&#8221;</span

          took the initiative to make clear his relationship with the man in
          black robe. That he had nothing to do with that man. Moreover, his
          face was covered with a black veil, and runes flickered. There were
          special rules flowing through it, and he was not afraid of being seen
          through.</span

          if she had been murdered in Gu Changge’s place, it would bring him a
          lot of trouble. Even so, she was still moved.</span

          I have done something to her? Well done, blaming the victim. If I
          hadn&#8217;t noticed that there was something wrong with that black
          robed man, and guessed that he had accomplices, I&#8217;m afraid you
          would have succeeded. So, let me ask again. Just who are you?&#8221;
          Gu Changge smiled faintly. Between his hands behind his back, runes
          began to appear. They shone with peerless light, spreading a
          terrifying aura.</span

      <p>

          >&#8220;Gu Changge, everyone in the world knows that you have placed
          Saintess Ziyan under house arrest. What else do you want to argue
          about at this time? I just can’t stand how you are treating her and
          came to rescue her.&#8221; Qin Wuya said while frowning as he looked
          at Liu Ziyan. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Saintess Ziyan. I don&#8217;t
          mean you any harm. The reason why I come here tonight is to save you
          from the claws of the devil. &#8220;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He knew that when he first appeared, Liu Ziyan was extremely
          vigilant. She clearly assumed that he was on the same side as the
          black robed man and attacked him. But at this time, all he needed to
          do was to explain everything clearly. He believed that Liu Ziyan would
          understand he truly had come to save her.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Save me? From the claws of the devil?&#8221; However, when she
          heard this, Liu Ziyan just sneered and said nothing. Her gaze was very
          cold. If it weren&#8217;t for her quick decisiveness earlier, she
          would have died here miserably, soul completely destroyed. Even then,
          the man in front of her was still planning to lie and deceive
          her.</span

          [Does he really think that I can&#8217;t see the situation clearly?
          Can’t he have come up with a more decent excuse?] In her opinion, the
          man in front of her was the same as the black robed man, who had
          attacked her before. However, Sky King Zhi Yang was meticulous. He
          still felt worried after sending out one person. Therefore, he
          dispatched another.</span

          mean you any harm.&#8221; Qin Wuya said in a low voice. For some
          reason, Liu Ziyan was extremely vigilant against him.</span

          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, are you all right?&#8221; However, at
          this time, Liu Ziyan no longer cared about him. She asked Gu Changge
          with concern, recalling that his Source was already seriously injured.
          Now, even if his injuries had made a turn for the better, forcing
          himself to fight would probably make the injury worse.</span

          Gu Changge replied with a smile, looking extraordinary with his
          elegant demeanor.</span

          extremely domineering. The rumbling sound spread over all directions,
          shaking the sky. Many behind him also took action immediately. All
          kinds of divine abilities and artifacts shot forth, covering the night
          sky. They all shone brightly and emitted an incomparably terrifying
          aura. After all, these people were ranked top among their peers, and
          many were famous young prodigies.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          turning the place into complete chaos. It was as if many stars
          exploded, and the terrifying waves shocked everyone in the Capital of
          the Black Tortoise Empire. Furthermore, all these mighty attack were
          all aimed toward Qin Wuya.</span

          Liu Ziyan didn&#8217;t believe his words at all and was instead
          worried about Gu Changge, Qin Wuya frowned and rudely mocked. He
          didn&#8217;t intend to cause any unnecessary trouble. If Gu Changge
          was smart and let go of Liu Ziyan, he would take her away and
          wouldn&#8217;t do anything to Gu Changge.</span

          So, what could he possibly do now? As for Gu Changge’s followers, they
          were nothing in his eyes. He didn&#8217;t need to care about them at
          all. He could defeat them easily.</span

          far has been too gentle, giving everyone the courage to dare and bully
          me.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head slightly at the scene in front of
          him. He looked calm and indifferent.</span

          strength.&#8221; Gu Changge’s Dharma Body was tall and powerful. Its
          might was boundless, and it could easily fend off the attacks Qin Wuya
          threw at it.</span

          >Seeing this, a strange look flashed across his eyes. After all, Qin
          Wuya was an expert that had returned from the Nine Realms. He had gone
          through all kinds of hardships, methods, and combat experiences there,
          which were incomparable to ordinary cultivators. After all, the Nine
          Realms was a place that many cultivators yearned for.</span

          moreover, he had yet to show his true strength.</span

          >&#8220;It seems that Junior Brother Zhi Yang’s worry is a reasonable
          one. At such a young age, Gu Changge&#8217;s strength is actually so
          terrifying… And he had never revealed it before.&#8221; After the
          blow, Qin Wuya frowned and his figure appeared on the other side. He
          looked relaxed, but in fact, he couldn&#8217;t calm down as dark
          clouds were stirring up in his heart.</span

          >In fact, many had guessed exactly how powerful Gu Changge was before
          this, because he hadn&#8217;t shown his true strength in front of
          everyone. Thus, they had to guess. After all, even in the face of
          young prodigies of the same generation, he could easily defeat them.
          So, as time went by, his strength became a mystery. Eventually,
          everyone just knew that he was unfathomable.</span

          something to be trifled with. Many guessed that his cultivation level
          had actually surpassed many ancient monstrosities. However, today,
          even while he was seriously injured, the scene that Gu Changge
          displayed had surpassed that of a Sacred Lord Realm expert, which had
          shocked everyone.</span

          >As Gu Changge followed the tracks Jiang Chen left into the mountains,
          Jiang Chen finally encountered the cultivation opportunity that he so
          anticipated. The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation was
          extremely confident in its abilities; after it had helped deal with
          the many arrays before him, the stone wall cracked open automatically
          to reveal a broad and unobstructed path. Further behind, an ancient
          bridge could be seen which was linked to an indescribably enormous
          palace. It shone majestically with golden light while exuding a
          powerful yet ancient energy.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;It really is the Palace of World Domination.&gt; The Artifact
          Spirit sounded excited. Jiang Chen then noticed the words embellished
          in gold above the palace. They looked really old and seemed to possess
          some sort of great power which could bind the heavens. It wasn&#8217;t
          known who had left them but its grandness could be observed.</span

          >&#8220;What&#8217;s the relationship between the Palace of World
          Domination and the Tower of World Domination?&#8221; Jiang Chen
          muttered to himself, walking up the steps towards the great palace
          before him.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After arriving at the entrance, he looked to the left and right
          before opening the doors. It opened easily without any pressure or
          obstacle, and A great surge of purple fog suddenly swept out. It
          almost resembled a liquid as it reached his knees. As Jiang Chen
          entered the palace, a blinding light shone down and made him close his
          eyes instinctively.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[This…] Jiang Chen froze and his eyes widened. Clear and shiny Origin
          Stones as large as basins were littered all over the place, surrounded
          by different colours of the rainbow. The place looked like the sacred
          territory of a celestial sect. Jiang Chen could even see some strange
          beings, artifacts, jade scrolls, jade jars and so on preserved within
          some of the Stones.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sight was shocking, as there were too many of these rocks and the
          purple fog had been due to the Origin Stones liquefying. The abundance
          of treasures here was far too astounding; it&#8217;s no wonder that
          the Artifact Spirit had said this was an opportunity specially
          prepared for him. He could detect the strong scent of pills in the
          air, which seemed to open up every pore and could make one turn into
          an Immortal. Further behind, there was an entire herb farm brimming
          with spiritual energy, which was enclosed in swirling fog and
          colourful light.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[There are too many cultivation opportunities here. There&#8217;s so
          much! Spirit grass, Origin Stones, jade scrolls, cultivation
          techniques, artifacts, and even preserved pills.]
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen stared around at everything, breathing hard while his
          heart raced. It was the first time he had seen so many resources for
          cultivation. Even if he did not enter a Sect after leaving, these
          resources were already enough to last him a long time. He
          instinctively prepared to store everything.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;Don&#8217;t get so excited. These are just your mediocre; the
          best is further back. All of them are yours and no one can take them
          from you,&gt; the Artifact Spirit interrupted his actions, sounding
          excited and smug yet feigning calm with Jiang Chen.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen nodded at that, also forcing himself to calm down. He knew
          that the Artifact Spirit would never lie to him; even if they were
          just the usual, that meant there were much more powerful objects
          further back. With that thought, he continued deeper into the
          palace.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[The beings here did not attack Jiang Chen, which is probably because
          of his special physique. He&#8217;s the vessel of the Celestial Boat
          of Creation but I&#8217;m not sure what surprise he will give
          eventually. It&#8217;s a pity he&#8217;s still young.] Gu Changge
          moved with his hands behind him with a relaxed demeanour. It was like
          he was taking a walk, with no one following him or any beings
          approaching him. Any beings who tried it had immediately turned into
          ashes, both their body and soul completely destroyed.</span

          carelessly.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No. Jiang Chen trusts me completely and hasn&#8217;t noticed
          anything strange when I was carrying out your orders. He&#8217;s
          become more and more trustful of me during this time,&#8221; replied
          the elderly man in black.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled. &#8220;Jiang Chen
          must be satisfied with the guardian I have arranged for
          him.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s not urgent. His worth is far more than what
          little he has now. He should at least help me catalyse the ripening of
          the Dao Fruit.&#8221; Gu Changge gazed at the cave and walked towards
          it. He could now feel the all-encompassing power pressing down on him
          more acutely.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He tried sensing Jiang Chen&#8217;s location, realising he was not
          that far away. However, he would allow the Demonic Puppet to go there
          first since the elderly man in black robes was Jiang Chen&#8217;s
          guardian. Besides, he could know in advance if anything unexpected
          happened. Of course, he had other plans for Jiang Chen.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The palace was grand and ancient, looking unharmed except for part of
          the pillars which had collapsed. It was majestic and exuded a heavy
          pressure as if it had formed its own world. With the fog surrounding
          it, it resembled paradise.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen could see giant pillars standing in the palace as he
          walked, which seemingly supported the sky. Suddenly, he heard a faint
          sound in the distance, which sounded like a tall tower shivering or a
          giant bell ringing. It shook him to the core, deafeningly loud.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[What&#8217;s that?] His expression shifted slightly, feeling like
          his head had been pierced by a needle. The pain made him turn pale and
          he felt like his brain had been hit with a large bell. It rang loudly
          and his mind became static. For some reason, he could faintly sense a
          small golden tower standing within the palace which hovered in the air
          and exuded Chaos Qi.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[A golden tower.] His eyes widened in surprise. His pain went away as
          quickly as it had come, and now he could hear that sound
          clearly.</span

          sensed your presence,&gt; the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of
          Creation said excitedly. &lt;Follow the sound and you will be able to
          find it.&gt;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He understood immediately and seemed delighted. [Didn’t that mean I
          would soon possess the Tower of World Domination that Gu Changge had
          been looking so hard for?]
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[He had worked so long but did not get any results; would he not get
          livid?] Jiang Chen became more anticipatory, heading towards the sound
          without pause.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!* The ancient sound of Dao seemed to ring out from the nine
          heavens. The deeper he went, the more he felt that the sound was
          deafening yet glorious. He couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if the sound
          would penetrate the walls and resonate within all the purple
          mountains. He could now faintly see a large tower glowing with golden
          light, making loud rumbling sounds. There were many heavenly
          Principles swirling around it, making it indescribably divine.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          will never let Gu Changge take possession of it.]</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen&#8217;s gaze became determined, fists clenched as he
          marched towards the source of the sound. The palace was enormous but
          his path was free of any obstacles, so it wasn&#8217;t long before he
          arrived deep within the palace and finally saw that huge tower. It had
          a total of 9 storeys and was entirely golden in colour as if made from
          indestructible gold. It hovered in the air and resembled a hill.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There was also a platform below it, which seemed to be built from
          jade. It looked ancient yet natural, enclosed in interweaving red and
          golden light as well as the colourful mist which swirled around it. It
          emitted a loud rumbling sound, runes flickering around it as it hung
          above the platform. It seemed nearly able to bind everything.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It looked like there was something inside the platform which drew
          Jiang Chen in, but his attention was fully on the Tower of World
          Domination now. After some close observation of his surroundings, he
          realised that the sound which had been echoing inside his head had
          come from it.</span

      </p>

          >&lt;This is the Tower of World Domination,&gt; shouted the Artifact
          Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation excitedly. &lt;We need to
          think of a way to store it.&gt;</span

          >[But I haven&#8217;t started cultivating yet. How am I going to store
          it?] He paced under it while frowning. All cultivators could take out
          artifacts and store them in their spiritual seas in preparation for
          battle, yet his spiritual sea hadn&#8217;t been opened up yet. Even if
          he acquired it, he could not store it. He hadn&#8217;t anticipated
          that the Tower of World Domination would be that big, more like an
          enormous pagoda instead of something which could fit in his
          palm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;The Tower of World Domination is the one in charge of suppressing
          the potential power out of the Seven Tools of World Domination. It can
          suppress the world easily. Even the dead and living will not be
          excluded from its restrictive power. You can definitely store it. It
          called for you, which meant it approves of you,&gt; the Artifact
          Spirit said assuredly.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen became serious after hearing the words, starting to
          experiment using whatever method he could think of. However, no matter
          what method he used or how he spoke, the Tower of World Domination did
          not budge. It remained standing as if it could never be moved in any
          way. This made him wonder if he had misunderstood the sound from
          before, and that the Tower hadn&#8217;t been calling to him.
          Otherwise, why wasn&#8217;t it reacting at all?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Is there other tests for it? I can only get its recognition if I
          passed its test?] Jiang Chen looked confused.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;Impossible. You are the vessel of the Celestial Boat of Creation,
          so it&#8217;s technically impossible for it to not recognise you.&gt;
          The Artifact Spirit sounded puzzled as well. It had also noticed that
          the familiar aura from before had become weaker here, which made it
          frustrated since its memory wasn&#8217;t complete and it could not
          remember many things well. Otherwise, it could have deduced which
          familiar figure that aura had belonged to.</span

          He hadn&#8217;t gone near it when the Tower of World Domination
          suddenly shook slightly, light falling from it and causing water-like
          ripples in the void. With a loud boom, heavy pressure came from above
          and there was suddenly a great weight on his body. He was now unable
          to move.</span

          preventing me from moving forward?] His eyes widened, unable to accept
          this. He gritted his teeth, face pale and forehead sweaty. However, no
          matter how much force he exerted, he could not continue forward like
          there was an invisible wall blocking his way. The platform was just a
          few steps away but seemed like it was far on the horizon.</span

          force he could. He was unsatisfied since it was so close to him yet he
          could not approach it.</span

          >&lt;That&#8217;s impossible. These things should belong to you, so
          why is this happening?&gt; The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat
          of Creation was stunned, failing to understand this. The Tower
          hadn&#8217;t reacted at all and now it was preventing him from getting
          closer to the platform. Why was this happening? In the next instant, a
          light flickered and the Bronze Celestial Boat appeared from between
          Jiang Chen&#8217;s eyebrows.

          >&lt;Tower of World Domination, why are you stopping us?&gt; The
          Artifact Spirit had materialised and an angry yet childlike voice
          began to demand an explanation.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen inhaled deeply and stopped his fruitless efforts, knowing
          that the Tower was stopping him. Without its recognition, he would
          never be able to approach the platform. Despite his frustration and
          rage, he chose to calm down and see how the Tower was going to answer.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >According to the statements made by the Artifact Spirit, the Tower of
          World Domination was an artifact from the Immortal Palace, which had
          the potential to suppress the whole world. Like the Celestial Boat of
          Creation, it also belonged to the Immortal Palace. That meant that
          they could sense each other&#8217;s presence. Those beings around the
          purple mountains had ignored him and allowed him to enter its depths
          because he had the aura of the Immortal Palace. His Journey
          wouldn&#8217;t have been so smooth-sailing otherwise. Yet now, the
          Tower of World Domination was stopping him. [Why is this
          happening?]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the Artifact Spirit made the demand, the giant golden tower above
          them seemed to react. It shook slightly and began to vibrate loudly
          within the void. After that, a blurry figure appeared within it
          surrounded by golden light which made it impossible to discern
          anything. It looked to be an ancient god.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation sounded
          pleased. It was obvious that the gold-coloured figure was the Artifact
          Spirit of the Tower of World Domination since it was different to the
          other Tools of World Domination. The being who had made the Tower of
          World Domination had planned to use it to suppress all things, so they
          had purposefully chosen a different material and forging method to
          cultivate an Artifact Spirit within it. This figure before them was
          the aforementioned Artifact Spirit.</span

          Boat of Creation demanded, unable to puzzle it out. They were
          technically on the same side and while it was understandable that the
          Tower of World Domination wouldn&#8217;t help Jiang Chen, it was
          stopping the Artifact Spirit as well!</span

          >&lt;Wang Yue is dead and the Immortal Palace has already collapsed
          anyway. No matter how long she lived, she will eventually die of old
          age.&gt; The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation froze
          before answering in a low voice. It seemed to have remembered
          something.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing Jiang Chen&#8217;s confusion, it began to explain. Wang Yue
          had been the celestial beast responsible for carrying the Tower of
          World Domination. She was enormous and had a lifespan as long as that
          of the stars. There were even rumours that claimed she was transformed
          from the fallen moon god from the Nine Heavens. So, even if Wang Yue
          didn&#8217;t take a human form, she was still beautiful. Besides, her
          long lifespan had given her the nickname of a living fossil. In fact,
          she kept such a low-profile that hardly anyone knew about her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[So that&#8217;s what the Artifact Spirit of the Tower of World
          Domination is talking about. What&#8217;s the link between that issue
          and stopping me from going near the platform?] Jiang Chen guessed that
          the late Wang Yue had been accompanying the Tower of World Domination
          for so long that they had a close relationship. The Tower might be
          unable to accept its death for that reason. However, he still
          couldn&#8217;t understand why the Tower had stopped him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;I know that the way I am reassuring you isn&#8217;t right, but
          the indestructible Immortal Palace will collapse one day. This means
          that Wang Yue will die of old age eventually too. You must accept that
          fact and besides, it&#8217;s not a reason for stopping us.
          What&#8217;s inside the platform anyway? The responsibility of
          restoring the Immortal Palace&#8217;s glory now lies on Jiang
          Chen&#8217;s shoulders; I hope that you won&#8217;t trouble him since
          you were also from the Immortal Palace&gt; advised the Artifact Spirit
          of the Celestial Boat of Creation.

          >In its opinion, there were definitely much better things within the
          platform since there were plenty of cultivation resources such as
          Origin Stones and spiritual herbs in the Palace of World Domination.
          After all, the Palace had been used to store a lot of things which was
          suppressed by the Tower of World Domination. It was impossible to have
          so few things present here.</span

          interrupt, but the words of the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat
          of Creation made him feel that the abundant cultivation resources here
          were left here for him.</span

          offspring of Wang Yue. I&#8217;ve promised her that I will raise her
          offspring.&#8221; The Artifact Spirit of the Tower of World Domination
          was quiet for a while before giving a reply which surprised both Jiang
          Chen and the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation.</span

          Platform?&gt; the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen wasn&#8217;t sure how powerful Wang Yue was, but he could
          deduce it from the Artifact Spirit&#8217;s shaking voice. The value of
          the thing preserved within the platform was hard to estimate since
          anything linked to the Immortal World was not that simple. This made
          him excited and expectant. If Wang Yue’s offspring grew up, it would
          become a real celestial beast. If he had one, did that mean he could
          do anything he wanted in the Upper Realm without any hindrance? It
          would be easy for him to take revenge against Gu Changge too.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;If so, you definitely should hand over the child to us. Jiang
          Chen is the vessel of the Celestial Boat of Creation, and you should
          know what that means. Giving the offspring to him is the most
          appropriate move. Besides, if you follow us out of this place, you can
          still watch the child grow up. Isn&#8217;t that killing two birds with
          one stone?&gt;</span

          convincing the Tower of World Domination once more, its tone urgent.
          It hoped to convince the Tower of World Domination into giving the
          child to them and leaving with them. Jiang Chen was filled with
          anxiety as well but remained silent, his expression calm.</span

          not change. It wasn&#8217;t that it was underestimating him but was
          just speaking the truth. It didn&#8217;t matter what reincarnation
          Jiang Chen was nor what vessel he was, as long as he had the criteria
          to properly raise the child, the Artifact Spirit of the Tower of World
          Domination would have no qualms. If he couldn&#8217;t do that at all,
          why should it give the offspring to him?</span

          doesn&#8217;t mean he won&#8217;t have them in the future. He has
          great potential and the Palace of World Domination has plenty of
          resources too.&gt; The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of
          Creation argued, refusing to let this rare opportunity pass. It would
          be a significant advantage for it as well as Jiang Chen if they had
          the offspring.

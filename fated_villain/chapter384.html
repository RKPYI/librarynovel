        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Changge told me about you before.&#8221; Yue Mingkong continued.
            </span><span id="more-29563"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the King with Six Crowns and the rest were somewhat dazed.
                According to the refugees outside the Forbidden Area of the Celestial Ancient Continent, the continent
                was only opened to the outside world in recent years. However, the forbidden area within it had stood
                since ancient times, barely touched.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many rumours pertaining to that region. While some claimed that
                Remnant Immortals were slumbering in the forbidden area, some stated that the secrets of the fall of the
                Celestial Ancient Era were concealed within.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coincidentally, the woman in white also came from the same place, which led
                to them thinking that she was a guest from the Forbidden Area.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, upon Yue Mingkong&#8217;s words, many came to a realisation that
                as Gu Changge&#8217;s fianc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">é</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;">e, though she might be making the introduction casually, in all honesty, she
                was declaring her intimacy with Gu Changge in between the lines. She was hinting how Gu Changge
                didn&#8217;t hide the matter from her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Yue Mingkong typically wouldn&#8217;t bother intervening with such
                matters, let alone taking the time to explain them to the public. Nevertheless, she could feel that
                something was wrong with the atmosphere.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be it Wang Zijin or Jiang Chuchu, those women seemed to share a deep bond
                with Gu Changge, and even the Jiang Luoshen, the Princess of Godly Illusion Clan also bore a significant
                relationship with Gu Changge in her previous life.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, another puppet of his, Xiao Ruoyin, had come out of nowhere. Yue
                Mingkong naturally felt frustrated, seeing how he was surrounded by so many other women. Therefore, her
                action was truthfully a declaration of her identity and position. That she was his legitimate,
                soon-to-be wife.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon Yue Mingkong&#8217;s introduction, the crowd came to understand Xiao
                Ruoyin&#8217;s identity. Although they were somewhat sceptical, they simply kept their bafflement to
                themselves.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, Gu Changge randomly asked Xiao Ruoyin about her cultivation progress
                as of late to show his concern, to which Xiao Ruoyin frankly answered, expressing that she had been
                working hard and assured him that she would not let him down.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very well. I hope to see your cultivation effort come to fruition
                soon.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Xiao Ruoyin was conversing with Gu Changge, she was also assiduously
                attempting to infiltrate the circle, as she was aware that the youths here possessed no ordinary
                identities and were of terrifying backgrounds. They were from forces that could dominate the world in
                fathomless ways, people who she could never get in touch with on the usual day.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Gu Changge was obviously a core member of the circle, which was
                why she tried to socialise with the other youths here when she greeted Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, Xiao Ruoyin was no fool, and she had her personal ambition and
                calculations. In her previous world, she never had to consider such details as she was the one who was
                gratified and placed on a pedestal. But now, she was nothing but a weak, influenceless woman, and all
                she could depend on was her unstable relationship with Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, knowing Gu Changge and being close with him were two completely
                different matters. Now, she wished to grow closer to the man, but after thinking about it, she realised
                that her sole asset was her pure body and youthful charm. However, such things didn&#8217;t matter to Gu
                Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far away, watching as Xiao Ruoyin attempted to enter the circles of the young
                prodigies, Jiang Chen clenched his fists tensely, agonised by a helpless and uncomfortable
                sensation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stone cold goddess he adored so deeply was now nothing but a lowly,
                careful nobody who was doing everything she could to please his nemesis, whom he abhorred with all of
                his heart. Yet, she remained so oblivious to Gu Changge&#8217;s true colours and malicious
                intentions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kind Sir Jiang, why are you staring in that direction for?&#8221;
                Standing beside Jiang Chen, the Monk Pu Du saw his expression and asked out of curiosity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jiang Chen was taken aback and hastily withdrew his gaze, after
                which he leisurely explained, &#8220;Among the younger generation, how many could be surrounded by so
                many beguiling women like Gu Changge? How enviable.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t dare to let the Monk Pu Du know about his grudge against Gu
                Changge as he could still vividly remember the massive loss the siblings of the Ji Family had caused
                him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the Monk Pu Du chuckled. &#8220;Reality is void as void is
                reality. A pretty woman is nothing but flesh on bones. What is enviable about that? Open-mindedness is
                the key, Kind Sir Jiang.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the golden clouds, Jiang Luoshen, donning an icy expression, overheard the
                conversation of the two below her and furrowed her brows before subconsciously turning to where Gu
                Changge was.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, I&#8217;ll never forget what you did to me…&#8221; She
                gritted her teeth as she couldn&#8217;t forget Gu Changge&#8217;s threat earlier, and the spine-chilling
                murderous intent and coldness she felt had yet to fade away.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since she was born, it was her first time being threatened this way. Or
                rather, her first time experiencing such fear. Such a sensation was etched in her mind, causing her soul
                to trembled. And to her, this was humiliation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jiang Chen, I&#8217;ll have you dead if you fail to find the relic of
                my Prime Ancestor.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, Jiang Luoshen coldly glanced at Jiang Chen and imposed a
                judgement of life and death onto him. If it weren&#8217;t for him, the conflict between her and Gu
                Changge wouldn&#8217;t have happened, and Jiang Ming as well as the Grand Elder, who was in the Peak
                Sacred Lord Realm, wouldn&#8217;t have been killed. If it weren&#8217;t for Jiang Chen&#8217;s value to
                her, she would have murdered him right away.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, Jiang Chen cursed in his mind, [Why weren&#8217;t you this
                bold in front of Gu Changge earlier, huh?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless despite such thoughts, he didn&#8217;t dare to feign any
                disrespect, quickly answering, &#8220;Rest assured, Princess Luoshen. I am very confident this
                time.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* At that moment, the crack, which many formidable cultivators charged
                into, let out a blaring sound as the incomparably vibrant palace began to tremble, emitting thick
                colours of blood.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the onlookers who noticed this scene were stupefied.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, screams of anguish cried out. An Elder in purple robe was
                sent flying to the sky. with blood all over his body. His injuries were extremely grave. He was still up
                in the sky after a while, obviously, struck by some frightening force, which then caused his body to
                explode and disintegrate.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, the crowd was dumbfounded as some of them were stunned. They could
                only stand still, not daring to move a muscle. They realise that none of the countless formidable
                cultivators that entered the crack had survived.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This region is full of life-threatening dangers. The young ones shall
                be barred from entering recklessly.&#8221; Formidable Masters from the Immortal Academy, Skyward
                Schloss, and the Immortal Gu Family were peering in that direction in dread.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess Luoshen, the entrance is right below the palace. They surely
                searched the wrong place and triggered a trap.&#8221; After a moment of daze, Jiang Chen communicated
                with the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation in his mind before informing Jiang
                Luoshen.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a glower, Jiang Luoshen glanced at Jiang Chen and Monk Pu Du before
                commanding, &#8220;You two, head in first.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Monk Pu Du grew furious, and as he was about to reject, he saw
                Jiang Chen sternly agreeing to Jiang Luoshen.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fine then, I shall trust you this once.&#8221; Monk Pu Du helplessly
                heaved a sigh, and casted a heavenly light to encapsulate Jiang Chen, before advancing towards the
                crack.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s face subtly changed, and without any
                hesitation, she ordered her men to follow the two.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are they looking to die?&#8221; A confused young disciple of the
                Immortal Academy tensed his brows.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Yue Mingkong turned to Gu Changge and gently asked,
                &#8220;Shall we enter as well?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding her hand and indulging in her fair, delicate skin that
                resembled a flawless, luxurious jade, he casually replied, &#8220;There&#8217;s no rush. Let&#8217;s
                wait a little longer.&#8221;</span></p>

          >With a smile on his face, Gu Changge gracefully left his host seat
          and approached the Young War Immortal. After a few thoughtful glances,
          he said, “Oh, I see. It appears that your injuries are more severe
          than I initially thought. Someone, go prepare some Million Year Old
          Blood Reishi for the Young War Immortal. Those things can swiftly heal
          even the wounds of a Sacred Emperor Realm expert. It will be a problem
          if your wounds remain unhealed for our journey to Kun Mountain
          tomorrow, so we cannot afford to delay your treatment. Don’t you
          agree, Young War Immortal?”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Each Million Year Old Blood Reishi was a rare and invaluable
          treasure, coveted by many but inaccessible to most cultivators. If it
          were to appear in an auction house, it would surely cause a frenzy of
          bidding and bloodshed. Even if a Sacred Emperor Realm expert could
          acquire it, it would be their prized possession and only used to save
          lives in dire circumstances.</span

          >As Gu Changge generously offered a few of them as gifts, everyone’s
          expressions contorted with shock. At the same time, they couldn’t help
          sigh inwardly either. Gu Changge’s insistence made it difficult for
          them to decline.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were not foolish either. Based on the words and actions of the
          Young War Immortal, they could tell that his injuries were just an
          excuse for him to not enter Kun Mountain. After all, why would the
          Successor of the esteemed War Immortal Mansion lack potent healing
          medicine?</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unfortunately, Gu Changge was aware of the Young War Immortal’s
          intentions. Not only did Gu Changge not pardon him from the
          expedition, but he even insisted on publicly giving him medicine,
          emphasizing that it was necessary to ensure their journey to Kun
          Mountain tomorrow would not be hindered. This left the Young War
          Immortal with no room to decline.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing the Young War Immortal had failed to escape from the
          expedition, everyone felt slightly disheartened. An Xi and the others
          were filled with frustration and indignation, but they knew better
          than to voice their grievances right now, so they could only bear it
          in silence.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Thank you, Young Master Changge. I’m truly grateful for your
          kindness. Indeed, we cannot afford to waste any time during such a
          critical moment.” The Young War Immortal’s face changed slightly. He
          clenched his fists tightly under his sleeves as he seethed with fury.
          Despite the turmoil within him, he quickly regained his composure and
          pretended to be grateful.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Young War Immortal, there’s no need for formality between us. We are
          peers, and I can’t help but feel concerned for your well-being after
          your recent misfortune. Kun Mountain is a treacherous place, the
          chances of rescuing Senior Ji Shengchu will greatly improve if your
          injuries are healed. Your efforts will undoubtedly make you a hero in
          the eyes of all those in the Upper Realm.”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With a friendly smile, Gu Changge gracefully gestured for his guests
          to take their seats. Young and beautiful waitresses served platters of
          succulent fruit, savory beast meat, and fine wine, all glowing with
          hazy divine light. The young prodigies felt a mix of emotions as they
          sat down, knowing it would be difficult to decline the invitation to
          venture into Kun Mountain tomorrow.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Chosen Monk Jin Chan chanted Buddha’s name, then fixed his gaze on Gu
          Changge who sat on the host seat. Memories of Gu Changge’s past
          treachery against him and the Buddhist Mountain during his time in the
          Demon-Burying Abyss flooded his mind. He knew that if he were to enter
          Kun Mountain without caution, he would surely fall prey to Gu
          Changge’s wicked schemes. Thus, he resolved to take preemptive
          measures to avoid any tragedy that might befall him.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The King with Six Crowns, the Sky Demon Sovereign and others were
          also racking their brains for a viable strategy to ensure their
          survival. Since they couldn’t refuse the invitation, they could only
          proceed with caution. Fortunately, there were quite a few supreme
          experts in their entourage. They figured that they could bring
          additional reinforcements to Kun Mountain, in hopes of avoiding any
          unforeseen mishaps.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Numerous young prodigies had the same idea. If entering Kun Mountain
          was inevitable, they could only find a way to safeguard their lives
          within its treacherous terrain.</span

          >From his seat, Gu Changge observed Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, and the
          others with great interest. All of them were sipping on their wine in
          silence. He gracefully raised his cup with a smile and said, “Senior
          Ji Shengchu once valiantly protected our Upper Realm and tended to the
          various Forces. Now that he is in trouble, we cannot stand idly
          by&#8230; If Senior Ji Shengchu were to escape his predicament, he
          could undoubtedly resolve the crisis caused by the Eternal Overcast,
          which is also a rare blessing for the entire Upper Realm. On behalf of
          Senior Ji Shengchu, I extend my gratitude to all our friends for their
          assistance.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone quickly raised their wine cups in response too.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Likewise, the Upper Realm is truly blessed to have a dedicated man
          like Young Master Changge, who tirelessly works towards the noble
          cause of rescuing Senior Ji Shengchu. Moreover, it is our duty to lend
          a helping hand. Our Ancestors were once cared for by Senior Ji
          Shengchu, and now that he is trapped in Kun Mountain, it would be an
          honor to offer our assistance.”

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many young prodigies fervently expressed themselves, their words
          brimming with sincerity and emotion.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even the Sky Demon Sovereign and the rest, who were dissatisfied and
          upset, refrained from speaking further at this moment. The situation
          had escalated too far for them to express any dissent.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Thank you all for your dedication in rescuing our Prime Ancestor. We
          are forever grateful.” The siblings from the Ji Family, Ji Yaoxing and
          Ji Chuyue, rose from their seats and raised their wine cups in a toast
          to the young prodigies. Despite feeling a bit uneasy, Ji Chuyue
          managed to put on a smile and convey her heartfelt gratitude to the
          young prodigies who had come to their aid.</span

          >It was at this moment, many began to take notice of the princess from
          the Ji Family, whose beauty was comparable to that of a flawless jade.
          Her figure was delicate, her features were stunning and her complexion
          was fair. She was slender and exuded a peerless allure. The princess
          seldom made public appearances so she was truly a rare sight to
          behold.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen was momentarily stunned as he gazed upon Ji Chuyue, who
          was clearly dressed up for the occasion today. It took him a while to
          snap out of his daze and regain his composure. He was well acquainted
          with Ji Chuyue, having trained alongside her near Kun Mountain. In
          fact, he was the reason why the Ji Family was able to discover that
          their Prime Ancestor was trapped in Kun Mountain. However, the Ji
          Family never mentioned a word of it to anyone. It was as if they never
          acknowledged it.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Chuyue…” Jiang Chen took a sip of his wine, but his heart felt heavy
          as he observed Ji Chuyue. Despite her bright and charming exterior,
          her eyes lacked the usual spark and energy. They were dull and
          lifeless. She looked no different to a forest fairy who had lost her
          wings, unable to soar freely as before. Clearly, Ji Chuyue had not
          been happy lately, and her life was far from ideal.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen felt a pang in his heart. He couldn&#8217;t deny the
          affection he felt for Ji Chuyue. From the moment they met on Purple
          Mountains, he sensed that this intelligent and vivacious woman was not
          a bad person. Although her brother had tried to frame him back then,
          he knew that was due to lack of options. Not long ago, Ji Chuyue had
          even come to warn him to stay on his toes as her brother had already
          figured out his true identity.</span

          >Niu Tian noticed the unusual expression on his friend’s face and
          couldn’t help but feel a little concerned. “What’s wrong,
          Ah’chen?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen let out a soft sigh, his gaze fixated on Ji Chuyue.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“That lady at the front is a friend of mine, and I would like to
          rescue her,” he replied in a hushed tone. Niu Tian was taken aback by
          Jiang Chen’s words. Though he had never met Ji Chuyue, he could sense
          the importance of her status.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Jiang Chen is actually acquainted with her?] He found it difficult
          to inquire about how the two of them had crossed paths.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“She seems to be doing fine, why do you want to rescue her?” he asked
          with a hint of confusion, unsure of why Jiang Chen had mentioned his
          desire to rescue Ji Chuyue.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You know nothing. She isn’t happy. She is akin to a canary trapped
          in a cage, devoid of any freedom.” Jiang Chen sighed softly. The
          dullness in Ji Chuyue’s eyes was a stark contrast to the vibrant
          energy he had once known her for. She looked no different from a
          prisoner.</span
        >

          later. I can only imagine how devastated Chuyue must feel, being used
          by her own brother as a mere tool to gain favor with other young
          prodigies,” he replied in a hushed tone.</span

          his sister stood before Gu Changge and expressed their gratitude. “My
          sister, Chuyue, and I are deeply grateful for the tremendous effort
          Young Master Changge has put into gathering so many young prodigies
          here today at this banquet to rescue our Prime Ancestor. We would like
          to raise a toast to you.”</span

          >Ji Chuyue was dressed in a gorgeous flowing pale yellow dress that
          accentuated her tall and slender figure. Her face was lightly
          powdered, her eyebrows were beautifully drawn and her lips were
          painted cherry red. Many young prodigies couldn’t help but secretly
          admire her beauty. What made her even more captivating was her unique
          heterochromia. She gracefully followed behind Ji Yaoxing, silently
          holding a wine cup which she was ready to offer to Gu Changge.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“There’s no need for such formality, Brother Yaoxing. As I have made
          a promise to you, I am more than happy to fulfill it.” Gu Changge’s
          lips curved into a gentle smile as he graciously accepted the wine cup
          from Ji Chuyue’s delicate hand.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >It was at this moment, Ji Chuyue’s fingers accidentally brushed
          against Gu Changge&#8217;s. A shiver rippled through her, causing her
          to falter and lose her grip on the wine cup. With a deafening crash,
          the cup fell on the ground and the wine in it spilled all over Gu
          Changge’s hand.</span

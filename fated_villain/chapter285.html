          extremely humiliated after Gu Changg embarrassed him in front of the
          Immortal Academy’s Elders and disciples, even threatening to make him
          beg for death. He could not do anything about it though, not even
          making a rebuttal. After all, that would lead to Gu Changge attacking

          this event and make Gu Changge pay in full. Qin Wuya might have
          cultivated to the Enlightened Noble Realm, but his true strength was
          no lower than an expert in the Sacred King Realm. Not to mention, he
          had plenty of powerful techniques he could use, but he had not shown
          it yet. Soon, he disappeared in a flash as well, without a word.

          >&#8220;It seems that Zhi Yang and that ancient man from the Wondrous
          Stone have a good relationship. The events of today may have allowed
          them to hold a grudge against Gu Changge.&#8221; The Elders and
          disciples glanced at each other. They had gained some understanding of
          the situation and their emotions were complicated.

          everyone&#8217;s minds. He could fulfil his threat and dominate the
          entire Immortal Academy if he so wanted. If the best among the Ranked
          Disciples had to end up like this when he went against Gu Changge, how
          would the rest of the young prodigies fare? They wouldn&#8217;t even
          be able to stand a chance.</span

          however, had a strange expression on his face as he remembered the
          events of the night when a young prodigy like Gu Changge had ended up
          being manipulated by a woman. This not only made him sigh about how
          impermanent everything was, but also deeply understand how terrifying
          Su Qingge was. [She is truly frightening. To think her mind is
          calculative enough to be able to trick Gu Changge! She truly lives up
          to her name as the Successor of Demonic Arts.]</span

          glanced around, a bright smile appearing once more on his face as if
          he was not the least bit cruel and dominating earlier. The quick shift
          in demeanour made many young prodigies turn pale, waving their hands
          in denial of his words.

          towards Gu Xianer. He then left with his followers without saying
          anything else.

          >Gu Changge was in a good mood as well, having used Gu Xianer as an
          excuse to hurt the Sky King. He had also gained Fortuity from Qin Wuya
          as well, who had recently returned from Nine Realms. It was truly
          convenient that the Fortuituous One and Sky King Zhi Yang, who also
          holds a great amount of Fortuity, were greatly connected in terms of
          their Fortuity. After all, he had been the latter&#8217;s Senior
          Brother in his past life.</span

          everyone. It didn&#8217;t matter if it had a destructive effect on the
          Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s Dao Heart, as it would not affect his later
          plans at all. The planting of the Demonic Seed in his Heart could only
          happen if the Heart had been greatly shaken.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Yang, and wasn’t sure if he would succeed or not, which might risk
          exposing his true identity, so he chose to frame someone else. He had
          already told Wang Zijin about this and thus only needed to draw a
          connection. The Sky King would have no chance even if he argued
          against it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After returning to the palace and sending everyone away, he used the
          Dao Fruit of Reception. Golden light glimmered in his hand as if a
          mysterious shrub was shaking there, with many colourful and shiny
          fruits on its branches. One of them had Purple Qi dripping from
          it.</span

          >[This Chaos Purple Qi may be cloned in a rush, but it is enough to
          fool everyone into thinking it&#8217;s real.] Gu Changge&#8217;s smile
          was intriguing. He had used a technique to steal some Chaos Purple Qi
          during the fight and cultivated it using the Dao Fruit of Reception,
          and now it had borne fruit. Of course, the Chaos Purple Qi acquired
          this way was inferior to that acquired from the Chaos Dao Bone,
          especially since the time taken to clone it was too short. Had it been
          a little longer, he could have replicated it perfectly.</span

          had been something left behind after killing the Mortal One.
          Obviously, the Chaos Purple Qi Sky King Zhi Yang possessed and the one
          Gu Changge understood wasn&#8217;t exactly the same, but it was still
          a terrifying Talent to have. The other Talents such as Chaos Force,
          Chaos Evolution, Primal Chaos, World Devouring Chaos, were all
          extremely powerful as well.</span

          having recovered from the great hit he sustained a few days ago. He

          seems to me that everything that happened was just done using her as
          an excuse.&#8221; Qin Wuya was silent with an ugly expression. He
          could now slightly understand how Zhi Yang felt. To them, she was
          still their Junior Sister even if she hadn&#8217;t regained her
          memories from her past life. Why wouldn&#8217;t they worry when they
          knew of what would happen to her in the future? That Gu Changge, who

          evilness is hidden under a layer of fake kindness…&#8221; Qin Wuya
          couldn&#8217;t help but sigh. He had come to know many young prodigies

          Yang&#8217;s fists were clenched, heart aching at the memory of Gu
          Xianer&#8217;s cold dislike towards him. In their past lives, she
          would never fully express her dislike for him no matter how coldly she
          treated him; but now, she was too dependent on and trusting of the man
          who was supposed to be her arch-enemy. He could not bear this anymore.
          It hurt him way too much.</span

          Changge&#8217;s side were no weaklings at all too. Thus, if he
          encountered the Gu Changge, he would still be humiliated. This made
          him deeply frustrated but he had no choice. He had been undefeated his
          whole life, crushing everyone else in the young generation of the

          and down, while great ancient palaces stood within, emanating an air

          >&#8220;This trial is very important to all our predecessors, as it
          involves the Eternal Overcast. It has happened once again, where
          Eternal Overcast creatures have appeared. But this time, they seem to
          have a mind of their own, something that has never happened in our
          history books before…&#8221;</span

          Overcast birthing an Yin Emperor or another being that is much more
          powerful than a Yin Emperor. They might even build Eternal Overcast
          Kingdoms.&#8221;</span

          >The Elders were discussing the contents of the trial in the palace
          with grave expressions on their faces. The trial was not as easy as a
          normal test. It was much more difficult.</span

          shall be separated into five smaller teams, then they will choose
          disciples who will follow them…&#8221; They sighed afterwards. They
          had been in charge of so many trials. Yet, they had the feeling that
          the current one would not be so easy. The number of fatalities and
          injuries might be astonishing since the conditions for every area were
          varied and the dangers within were still unknown.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, a divine rainbow descended from the stage as Gu Changge arrived
          with his followers behind him. The young prodigies near him turned
          stricken immediately upon seeing him, shifting away in fear and
          respect as to prevent any hindrance to him.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;G-greetings, Young Master Changge.&#8221; Before him, an
          attractive girl in a white dress was standing with another youth. They
          stood out among the nearby prodigies. The girl immediately became shy
          and anxious at his approach, greeting him with a blush. Her voice
          stuttered as she spoke.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge stopped in front of her, smiling slightly. &#8220;You are
          Qing Xiaoyi, right? It&#8217;s been a while since we met; are you
          accustomed to this place yet?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh, you still remember my name, Young Master Changge? I-I am
          kind of used to everything now.&#8221; Qing Xiaoyi was surprised and
          shy at the fact that he had addressed her by her name and her heart
          beat rapidly. She couldn&#8217;t believe he could remember the name of
          an unknown figure like her. It was hard to imagine.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge!&#8221; Her brother Qing Feng
          immediately greeted him with respect and gratitude.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge inclined his head slightly. &#8220;It looks like you both
          have gained something during this time. Even your cultivation levels
          have greatly improved.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s thanks to my sister, or I won&#8217;t be so
          lucky,&#8221; Qing Feng rubbed the back of his head and smiled
          slightly sheepishly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Not really. All of us have our own fate.&#8221; Gu Changge
          smiled, taking the time to chat a little longer with them. If he
          remembered correctly, Qing Feng&#8217;s amplitude was terrible, to the
          point that he did not have a Spiritual Root. It might be possible that
          an Elder had transplanted one into him, though it wouldn&#8217;t make
          him improve this quickly in such a short amount of time.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[A Fortuitous Encounter] Immediately, these three words flashed into
          Gu Changge&#8217;s mind. What else could explain this? He had kept a
          mental note of Qing Feng at their last meeting, and now his Fortuity
          showed signs of growing.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[He must have gained some sort of treasure.] Thoughts whizzed through
          Gu Changge&#8217;s mind though his expression remained calm. He did
          not speak much after that, quickly walking past them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Qing Xiaoyi looked admiring and excited. &#8220;Brother, I told you
          Young Master Changge will remember me…&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Ugh, fine, fine. Pipe it down; you are now the Elders’
          favourite disciple. Watch your behaviour.&#8221; Qing Feng said
          resignedly. All this time, she had repeatedly talked about Gu Changge
          to him, not losing any detail of any rumours and news about him. His
          ears were already getting calloused.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before this, he would feel inferior to Gu Changge and be too scared
          to speak. Now, though, his behaviour was changing as he began gaining
          confidence. He knew that it was all due to that mysterious
          flask.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[This cannot continue. Xiaoyi holds gratitude and admiration towards
          him, but she&#8217;s just a minor figure who doesn&#8217;t really
          matter…] Qing Feng sighed internally, feeling that he couldn&#8217;t
          let her go on like this. Otherwise, she would suffer in the future and
          become regretful and depress.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All the young prodigies soon gathered on the square. Even Sky King
          Zhi Yang was present, although his expression was dark. Meanwhile, the
          mysterious King with Six Crowns had made his first public appearance.
          His face was indistinct and he was of medium build, standing on a hill
          in grey clothes. He looked like he was in a different world from the
          others, with indescribably strong power.</span

          married couple by now. Cooperation between them would be convenient as

          of a unique material. No divine sense could penetrate it, so there was
          no chance of cheating here. If they could, the Immortal Academy would

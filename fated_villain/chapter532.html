          mother, she couldn&#8217;t make out who was who when the two were

          it was impossible. She believe would inevitably die of old age in that
          quiet, secluded chamber. However, on this day, the family came
          together and decided to revoke her punishment and even restore her

          that even the members of the Ji Family dared not cross him. Though
          gladdened, she also felt bitter. If her daughter hadn&#8217;t met Gu

          start after both mother and daughter are done with their
          reunion,&#8221; stated Ji Hao deferentially, like a good brother to Ji
          Xue and a good uncle to Su Qingge.</span

          been fooled by Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s acting.</span

          shifted. They never expected such a surprising question from Gu
          Changge. How did he know about it when they hadn&#8217;t even decided
          to spread the word!? Then again, it wasn&#8217;t wise for them to ask
          questions at this time.</span

          >&#8220;Whom have you heard such information from, Young Master
          Changge?&#8221; Ji Hao asked after coming to himself. &#8220;Actually,
          we still hadn&#8217;t decided if we wanted to spread the word or keep
          it a secret.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;Oh, so the rumour is true then.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded
          somewhat dazedly, then smiled. &#8220;I honestly admire Senior Ji
          Shengchu&#8217;s past feats. So I&#8217;m rather worried after
          learning that he might be trapped somewhere out there. If you plan on
          rescuing him, I&#8217;ll be happy to lead the members of my family to
          help in the rescue.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even Ji Hao had to take a deep breath to calm himself down. Still,
          the joy on his face could hardly be contained, and the shakiness of
          his voice proved how excited he was. &#8220;The members of the Ji
          Family will forever be in your debt if you&#8217;re willing to help
          us.&#8221;</span

          Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family being trapped in Kun Mountain now that
          he had Gu Changge&#8217;s promise. Before this, they were worried that
          this issue would lead the enemies of the Ji Family to band together
          and attack them with a last-ditch effort.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Ji Family had gradually declined in power and influence over the
          years. If their enemies launched an attack altogether, they might go
          down before they could even rescue their Prime Ancestor. That was why
          he had been hesitant. After all, there were pros and cons to the
          matter. However, now that he had Gu Changge&#8217;s word, things would
          be different, and it boosted Ji Hao&#8217;s confidence greatly. Gu
          Changge&#8217;s aid meant that the Ji Family were no longer a force
          their enemies could mess with easily.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s not necessary.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head
          with a plain smile. &#8220;Senior Ji Shengchu had contributed greatly
          to the Upper Realm in the past and had sheltered countless people. Now
          that he&#8217;s in danger, how can we not help?&#8221;</span

          >After hearing his words, all the members of the Ji Family, who Gu
          Changge had just won over, now found him even more admirable. Such an
          incredible venture had been downplayed by the man like it was only an
          insignificant matter.</span

          also taken aback upon hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s words, especially Ji
          Chuyue. She gazed at the man with stupefaction, having trouble
          believing they were from the same person she had first gotten to know.
          To her, Gu Changge was not only powerful but incredibly scheming,
          heartless, and resolute.</span

          saving their Prime Ancestor, but now she was hearing for herself that
          he volunteered to help out!</span

          can assume…&#8221; Ji Yaoxing, too, was surprised. He suspected that
          Gu Changge would ignore the matter, but it turned out the man was
          willing to help out!</span

          it was a Life Forbidden Area. Even a Sacred Emperor only dared to

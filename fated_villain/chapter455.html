          World was entirely in his control. Initially, he figured that he
          should be able to suppress the aggression for at least three months.
          Yet, it was speedily cut to one month. In other words, Chan
          Hongyi&#8217;s recovery rate was excessively faster than he had
          expected.</span

          Life Forces for her to absorb in order to help her recover and contain
          that other side of hers. He also stored her in his Inner World so that
          he could effectively deal with her. However, if he were to fight her
          now, the disturbances would surely leak and draw the attention of

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Surrounded by spectacular Divine Mountains and dazzling Celestial
          Islands, the vast ancient foret expanded into infinity. There were old
          and rich Celestial Trees with endless vines that seemed to have
          existed for innumerable epochs.</span

          >As thick Celestial Energy drifted about, there seemed to be an
          ancient Heaven in the depths of this place. Magnificent palaces shone
          in the sky, extravagant and splendid as tall sturdy pillars stood
          across four directions of the universe. Glowing and sturdy, the
          pillars seemed to be holding up the sky, preventing it from
          crumbling.</span

          universes could be seen rotating, emitting grand and vast sounds. Any
          living beings that stepped into them would instantaneously
          disintegrate into dust and ashes. That was the real, absolute Force of
          the World, surpassing any kind of power in the world.</span

          >After entering his Inner World, Gu Changge did not stop moving. Upon
          his will, he reappeared at the top of a mountain. The mountaintop was
          flat, where chilly breezes would blow over.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Not far away, simple houses were being built with bamboo, unique and
          tranquil, as boulders floating in the air formed into steps. Nearby
          the houses, there was a chilly pond. The water plunged from the silver
          waterfalls high above, leaving silver ripples on its surface.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Rare divine fishes could be seen wagging their tails in the chilly
          pond. Delicate and crystalline, their bodies were the size of a palm,
          containing a shocking amount of vigour.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Somewhere further, there were herb farms and bird habitats filled
          with harmony, as though it was paradise.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Somewhere on top of the mountain, there was a simple boulder and a
          peach tree of moderate height.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As soon as Gu Changge reached here, what he saw evoked a complicated
          sensation in his eyes.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;M—Master…&#8221;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In one of the houses, a woman in red seemed to have detected his
          arrival. Pleasantly surprised, she pushed the door open. Her body was
          glamorous and her hair was silky. Snowy and fine, her face resembled
          an exuberant jade. Her petite face was beautified by her impeccably
          flawless features. Her captivating eyes resembled glistening
          onyxes.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, she was rolling up her sleeves, revealing her
          lotus-like pale, perfect wrists, as she was cleaning a wild
          chicken.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Did you decorate, all of this?&#8221; Gu Changge nodded and
          calmly asked as he gazed across the houses, the boulder, and the peach
          tree. Then, his deep gaze eventually fell upon Chan Hongyi, as though
          he could see through her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing the look on his face, Chan Hongyi thought she somehow upset
          him. As she timidly stepped backwards, she hastily explained,
          &#8220;I… I remembered the past… how the two of us used to live
          together… just like this…&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge nodded and praised, &#8220;Very thoughtful of
          you.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He didn&#8217;t seem to be blaming her, and Chan Hongyi was relieved
          by that. Accordingly, she cutely carried over the wild chicken she was
          cleaning with a gleeful smile on her little face. &#8220;M—Master, I…
          want to make roasted chicken for you…&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;When did you learn how to do that?&#8221; Gu Changge walked
          upon her and reached out his hand to brush off the ash stain on her
          nose.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The hunter at the foot of the mountain taught me…&#8221;
          Suddenly, Chan Hongyi felt somewhat uneasy, fearing that Gu Changge
          might rebuke her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why have you never told me about this?&#8221; With a grin, Gu
          Changge pinched her nose and asked.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;M—Master, you never allow me to learn these… So I was worried
          that you might… scold me…&#8221; Chan Hongyi lowered her face and
          explained. There were subtle gleams on her snowy face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So, that is how you perceive me, huh?&#8221; Gu Changge
          sounded somewhat playful.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;N—No, Master! You&#8217;re the absolute best in my
          heart…&#8221; Chan Hongyi quickly shook her head like a pellet
          drum.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Really? I shall indulge in your delicacy, then.&#8221; Gu
          Changge chuckled with a warm expression.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Mm… Yes, please…&#8221; Happiness surged on Chan
          Hongyi&#8217;s face. She then turned around to build a fireplace.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The swaying hem of her garment accentuated the slenderness of her
          figure. As she turned her head, her silky hair rested downwards on her
          shoulder, underlining the flawlessness of her elegant, snowy face. Her
          beauty was simply indescribable by words in this world.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes deepened as he looked at her tending to her
          work.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Followingly, he gently shook his head and swung his arm. As his eyes
          glistened, a set of stone furniture appeared before his eyes, followed
          by a wine glass and a waft of wine&#8217;s aroma.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, embers sparked into a flame. Chan Hongyi then rotated the
          chicken on a bamboo stick over the fire. Golden tallow of the chicken
          dripped down and sizzled under the heat, emitting a thick, salivating
          fragrance.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was focused as she was constantly staring at the chicken. The
          light of the fire was reflected on her tiny face, along with its
          subtle, warm halo.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the meantime, Gu Changge wordlessly looked at her, as he was also
          waiting for her to finish cooking the chicken.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;M–Master, the chicken is done.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Finally, Chan Hongyi revealed a delightful smile as the chicken had
          been cooked, after which she quickly carried it over. Evidently, she
          roasted the chicken with utmost delicacy. The grease on the chicken
          was still sizzling, with gleams on its skin and a salivating
          aroma.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Looks pretty good,&#8221; Gu Changge remarked with a smile as
          he accepted the food from Chan Hongyi&#8217;s hands, but he did not
          start tasting it just yet. Instead, he turned to her and asked,
          &#8220;Do you have nothing to say to me?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Bafflement arose in her eyes, as if she was puzzled by his
          question.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;M—Master, what do you mean?&#8221; She confusedly asked as she
          shook her head.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, Gu Changge refrained from explaining himself and simply
          smiled instead before starting to taste the roasted chicken she made
          for him. Taking his time, he ate it meticulously, as though he
          didn&#8217;t want to waste her strenuous effort.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ve never expected you to be such a good cook,
          Hongyi.&#8221; As he was eating, he raised the glass of White Jade
          Wine to his mouth with a look of astonishment.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, watching as he finished the roasted chicken
          thoroughly without leaving one bit of meat, Chan Hongyi grew
          silent.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Master, was it good?&#8221; she asked.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s good as long as you&#8217;re the one who cooked
          it.&#8221; Gu Changge let out a chuckle before slowly pouring himself
          another glass of wine.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, before the glass reached his mouth, black blood started
          flowing from the corner of his lips. Yet, he didn&#8217;t seem
          affected by it, as he retained his serene look. It was as though he
          had seen this coming. Calmly, he pulled out a handkerchief from his
          chest and wiped off the blood on his mouth. Nevertheless, the blood
          wouldn&#8217;t stop flowing, as though it was gushing from a massive
          dam.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that, he spat mouthfuls of blood, rinsing the clean, white
          handkerchief in absolute blackness. Even his clothes were stained by
          his blood. There was a rotting aura within the blackness of the
          blood.</span

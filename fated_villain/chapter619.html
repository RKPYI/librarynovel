        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Proofreader: </strong><span style="color: #00ffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color><strong>Silavin </strong></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the palace shifted their attention over, including Princess Xuan Dea and Ah Qing, who peered at Gu Changge in stupefaction, taken aback by his sudden remark.</span><span id="more-33864"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Princess Xuan Dea was secretly pondering, contemplating over Gu Changge&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Not all Forces enjoy invasion and conquest. Some of them value longevity, and peace. Is he referring to the Forces behind him, which is why he bears no hostility toward our world? And what is he really talking about— we of the Profound Sword World are thinking of the absolute worst? Then, those invading Otherworldly Sky Demons, are they merely ordinary cultivators?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, the Elders of Sword Cliff sank into thoughts, feeling that Gu Changge&#8217;s claims was hinting them of a solution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please enlighten us, Young Master Gu!&#8221; Right away, the Southern Light Emperor&#8217;s face grew deep with multiple meanings. He took a reverent bow toward Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the Sword Cliff Elders too revealed expressions of solemnity, paying full attention. Concerned that they missed a word.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprised by the crowd&#8217;s reaction, Gu Changge let out a flat chuckle. &#8220;Have you not noticed something all this time after fending off these so-called Otherworldly Sky Demons?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, what might you mean by that?&#8221; The Southern Light Emperor was dazed as the Sword Cliff Elders grew nervous, sensing the bafflement in one another&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To them, the strength of those Otherworldly Sky Demons were absolutely frightening and their abilities were unimaginable. Not only do the Otherworldly Sky Demons possess secret treasures and powerful artifacts, but they also ride menacing fierce mounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, their number was undeniably overwhelming, given that one fallen wave of the Otherworldly Sky Demons would be followed by another wave of even more daunting, terrorising ones. Hence, they fell into hopelessness and were unable to come up with a solution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Ah Qing began pondering. Back in the Upper Realm, Gu Changge talked to her about Karma and Reincarnation, and that Karma was never wrong. As such, she couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if the Otherworldly Sky Demons&#8217; invasion would lead to an outcome which would cause the Profound Sword World&#8217;s comeback.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Heaven has always been merciful. It always provides a way to survive. The number of the so-called Otherworldly Sky Demons may be great, but there has never been a formidable expert among the invaders, and that&#8217;s simply because they are afraid of this World&#8217;s Will. I wonder if the formidable experts of this world have noticed this.&#8221; Gu Changge faintly smiled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The World&#8217;s Will?&#8221; The Southern Light Emperor and the rest were dumbfounded, revealing shock on their faces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At their current level, they had inevitably encountered a being on par with the Earth Sword Immortals. Thus, they had heard mentions about the World&#8217;s Will before. However, they could never completely understand what it was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, they were confused as to why terrifying auras, capable of shaking this entire world, would surge in the Outer Territory, but those auras had never reached the Profound Sword World.  Gu Changge&#8217;s information gave them an epiphany.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, are you saying that the World&#8217;s Will is the key to fend off the Otherworldly Sky Demons?&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea&#8217;s eyes glistened as she eagerly asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Light Emperor and the rest were also donning contemplating looks. [Is that what Young Master Gu has been trying to convey? But why did he tell us all these?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Honestly, you can put it that way. But of course, you could also ask the formidable cultivators of your world about this. They should know something,&#8221; Gu Changge claimed with a strange expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;World’s Will?&#8221; Ah Qing furrowed her brows as she suddenly remembered the matter her father once mentioned to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, a fathomless, mysterious force did exist in the Profound Sword World, and it had been protecting the living beings of this world. Although her father never clarified what kind of power it was, judging by the current situation, it must be what Gu Changge referred to as the World’s Will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for your reminder, Young Master Gu. We shall report everything to Cliff Master,&#8221; the Sword Cliff Elders stated with solemn expressions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Cliff Master should be more knowledgeable than you regarding this matter, but from what I know, the World may possess a Will, but it won&#8217;t act unless things have grown out of control, or somehow, you manage to locate an Artifact to summon its Will.&#8221; Gu Changge retained his subtle grin, casually bringing up the secret.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, ancient worlds that possessed a World Source would lead to the emergence of a semblance of a Will, but one as eminent as the World&#8217;s Will of this Profound Sword World was extremely rare. It could only exist due to two possibilities—either the World Source was extraordinarily massive, or the emergence of the World&#8217;s Will took place during an infinitely long time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge believe that he could take advantage of the clueless people of this world to locate the whereabouts of the World Source and save some time looking for it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, if the cultivators of Profound Sword World managed to fully awaken the World&#8217;s Will, the Forces that came to this world would definitely stir up a great war, which Gu Changge could utilise to gain some benefits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the faces of the Sword Cliff Elders were immensely grave. Not daring to tarry any longer, they turned into divine rainbows and departed, intending to return to Sword Cliff to report the matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Light Emperor, too, dared not to loiter. Immediately, he gave the order to dispatch more men to fight off the Otherworldly Sky Demons. Gu Changge&#8217;s reminder reignited the hope in his heart. [So, we weren&#8217;t exactly without hope in this  battle. To think we have been unknowingly holding our trump card up this whole time. Our World’s Will.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We must relay the news to the other states. Only by uniting could we bear through until the emergence of the World&#8217;s Will,&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea noted as a glimmer of hope surged in her eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, this is the way to survive. This is what Young Master Gu referred to back then.&#8221; Ah Qing came to a realisation in that instant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the experience, Southern Light Empire restored their faith as the Emperor gave his command to gather the troops across all regions to provide back up to the Forces facing the Otherworldly Sky Demons at the frontlines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, armies of great number charged out of various towns on their flying boats and divine swords to eliminate the Otherworldly Sky Demons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Forces that came from the Upper Realm were stunned to discover that the devastated people of Profound Sword World grew more aggressive in their clash. It was as though they were injected with some sort of narcotics. Though, such was the ruthlessness and valour of absolute desperation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[According to that Sacred Emperor Realm expert from the Silver Wing Clan, when he broke through the Southbarren City’s barrier and was about to take down a Princess, he encountered Gu Changge and was scared off by him. Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t come to this world without a good reason. He must have some kind of purpose. But, what? Also, why did he bring that young woman along?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Yu Feiya, the Eldest Prince of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, was now taking a rest with the numerous young prodigies she was leading in an ancient city in Southbarren State. She tensed her brows as her heart was filled with unceasing confusion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, she never really gave the matter a thorough thought, but when she had heard that a Sacred Emperor Realm expert from the Silver Wing Clan was scared off by Gu Changge, she came to a realisation—Gu Changge must be holding some kind of purpose that was known by no one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, to him, taking over the Profound Sword World shouldn&#8217;t be difficult, though it could be time consuming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the ancient city before her had been seized, it was packed with troops from the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the relentless retaliation of the cultivators of Profound Sword World, they were speedily wiped out in the end as their defences quickly failed. Given the grave disparity between the two worlds and the constantly approaching troops from the Upper Realm, the peril of Southbarren State was only a matter of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Where&#8217;s that useless Tuo Ba Xiao Yao? Ever since he came to this world, he swiftly disappeared. Nobody even knows where he went…&#8221; Yu Min, Yu Feiya&#8217;s younger brother, vented his frustration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was already disdainful towards Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, and now, amid the battle against Profound Sword World, the latter decided to vanish without a trace, and that aggravated his anger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He must be tending to urgent matters,&#8221; Yu Feiya guessed as she gently shook her head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, after altering his appearance, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao left Southbarren State for the region where Shu Sect was located. He was hurrying to the Sword Pavilion of Shu Sect, to look for a way to dispel his bond before the agreed upon time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his previous life, he was a Core Disciple of Shu Sect, and now that his appearance had changed, it should be easy for him to sneak in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, he couldn&#8217;t be more familiar with Profound Sword World, as he knew the terrains and environments well, so he could effortlessly deal with any danger he encountered. Therefore, his journey was quite smooth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, he also heard that it had been five hundred years since his death back when he was witnessing his Prime Ancestor attempting to breakthrough. In other words, perhaps he wouldn&#8217;t be able to meet many of his acquaintances in the Shu Sect since it had been so long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, he felt remorseful. Although he had experienced reincarnation and was now in a different vessel, his original soul still belonged to a disciple of the Shu Sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I may be able to do something for Profound Sword World against the calamity it is now facing.] Tuo Ba Xiao Yao gazed at the vast city far away. Thinking how it would be consumed by disasters when the flames of war spreads, he felt deeply dejected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, he felt the responsibility on his shoulders grow even weightier, as it pertained not only to the fate of his loved ones in this life, but the survival of his former home as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cliff Master, this is what Young Master Gu has told us.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the top of a towering mountain surrounded by chilly winds, two figures stood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly extremely old, one of the figures wore a Daoist Robe and sported a bun, yet his eyes glistened with exuberance, as though they were a divine sword that had been refined countless times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blessed with crystalline skin of whiteness and delicacy, the figure beside him carried the utmost elegance, donning a simple robe and a white mask that revealed only her cold eyes. Her hair danced along the wind, as if it was thousand traces of Sword Qi intertwining in the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was none other than the Cliff Master of Sword Cliff, the Most Graceful Damsel of Southbarren State, that people of the world referred to as the Snow Sword Immortal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the old man was the Old Sword Immortal from the Shu Sect, who possessed monstrous, immeasurable strength.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;World&#8217;s Will?&#8221; After listening to the Elder&#8217;s report, the Snow Sword Immortal furrowed her brows as she ruminated on the term.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems that that world knows a lot about us. They even knew that our world has grown its own Will. This isn&#8217;t at all auspicious.&#8221; The Old Sword Immortal softly shook his head as he stroked his goatee. &#8220;This Young Master Gu must not bear any good intentions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Though, what he said isn&#8217;t unreasonable. Judging from the signs on the ancient altar, the World&#8217;s Will is indeed our last hope.&#8221; The eyes of the Snow Sword Immortal underneath her mask revealed  pondering eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you, too, believe a man like him?&#8221; The Old Sword Immortal questioned with a scowl.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the Snow Sword Immortal shook her head. &#8220;I simply sensed reasons in his words. Besides, I&#8217;ve captured an Otherworldly Sky Demon and searched his soul. Apparently, in that world, this Young Master Gu comes from an unthinkable powerful background. To put it directly, if he wishes to, he could obliterate our world without breaking a sweat.&#8221;</span></p>

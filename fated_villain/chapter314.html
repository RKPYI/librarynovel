        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proofreader: </strong><span style="color: #00ffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color><strong>Silavin </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!!* Ripples spread out, one after another, blurring up the void as countless divine lights filled the air.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge stepped out from the void dressed in white, looking otherworldly. With every step he took, an immensely horrific aura exuded from him, making seem invincible. Currently, rather than seem like an injured man, which the rest of the world saw him as, his condition could not be any better.</span><span id="more-28405"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, he had devoured Prince Shen&#8217;s Source and bloodline from Sky Emperor Shen. It contained various divine abilities, and gave him more or less some benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Phoenix Lady, the King with Six Crowns, and the others were present right now, they would surely be shaken to the core. All of them believed that Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t be able to use his powers for at least another half a month, and could only hide in his chambers to recuperate.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!!* Right then, following a strike of his fist, a burst of colourful energy transformed into a horrific black disk and fell onto the world like a meteor shower. Many of the Eternal Overcast creatures exploded in an instant, and they became a huge fog of bloody mist following their obliteration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When have I ever said I want to get myself killed?!&#8221; Jiang Chuchu retorted icily as soon as she came to herself. &#8220;It&#8217;s all just in your head. Also, if you&#8217;re a casualty, then there isn&#8217;t a person in this world who isn&#8217;t injured. As for whether you&#8217;ll miss me, that&#8217;s none of my business.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, she was still happy, seeing that Gu Changge cared about her. After all, this was who Gu Changge was. One could never count on hearing anything pleasant from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seems you haven&#8217;t met any danger when you&#8217;re still so lively,&#8221; Gu Changge commented plainly as he appeared next to her in a flash. &#8220;Guess I shouldn&#8217;t have come. I&#8217;ve gotten a little full of myself, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu snorted disdainfully under her breath. &#8220;I can very well handle it myself, even if I&#8217;m in danger. I only mentioned it to you because I can&#8217;t resolve the Source, which is in the depths of the Land of Eternal Overcast.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And what does your incompetence have to do with me? Then again, it will be a different story if you beg me,&#8221; Gu Changge said monotonously as he gazed at her before sizing up the crack high up in the sky with narrowed eyes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, he was just trying his luck, never really expecting Jiang Chuchu to find an Eternal Overcast Source for him. [Who&#8217;d have thought she was a natural treasure detector?!]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, it was only a treasure to Gu Changge as it could help boost his own ability, with the Grand Flask&#8217;s power to devour it. Meanwhile, to the others, the Eternal Overcast Source was purely a horrific source of tragedy. No one wanted to have anything to do with, avoiding it at all cost. Their faces would even turn dark just hearing it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no way Gu Changge would say something like this to Jiang Chuchu. He was still counting on her to continue being his &#8216;tool&#8217; in finding things like the Eternal Overcast Sources. [Well, not like she hates it. She seems to have fun doing it. Also, at worst, I’d just need to take the time to go to her after receiving an update.]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As if I will ever beg you. And get this straight; you wanted to come yourself. I was just giving you an update…&#8221; Jiang Chuchu retorted icily. There was no way she could bring herself to beg this repulsive scum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Gu Changge smiled and put his hand up, interrupting her. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave if you&#8217;re not going to beg. As for this crisis, you deal with it yourself then. I can&#8217;t be bothered anyway. Plus, this has nothing to do with me. That said, don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s embarrassing when you, the Successor of the Mortal Palace, have become so idiotic?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How dare you call me an idiot again, Gu Changge… You… You&#8217;ve crossed the line!&#8221; Fumed Jiang Chuchu after being taken aback. Who&#8217;d have thought that Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t deal with the Source of this Eternal Overcast crisis first, but instead used it to threaten and bully her and even call her an idiot?! [This guy is really as loathsome as ever!]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Successor of the Mortal Palace, all else aside, she was already a force to be reckoned with. She held an extremely high status and reputation amongst her peers, and did she even need to bring up her Talents and abilities?! Jiang Chuchu had at least that bit of pride and confidence about herself.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your loss for not begging me. Either way, you&#8217;ll spare me the trouble,&#8221; said Gu Changge plainly, having zero consciousness that he was bullying her and having absolute control over her weakness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, even if Jiang Chuchu didn&#8217;t beg him, he would still ultimately head toward it. After all, no one in their right mind would say no to an Eternal Overcast Source, well, if everyone was in his situation. It was just that he would never tell Jiang Chuchu this.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu, on the other hand, was pretty upset, seeing that Gu Changge could possibly leave at any time. However, what else could she do at this time? She was the one who notified him, after all, and she had done so, hoping that he could deal with the source of this Eternal Overcast crisis. At the very least, he did still come to help her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I get it. You just want to exploit the situation and have me yield. Gu Changge, you bastard, can&#8217;t you just let me have it for once?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu chided icily, only for Gu Changge to chuckle. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re not so dumb after all if you can think things though like this. Looks like you didn&#8217;t break your brain while breaking through to the next realm.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You!&#8221; Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s gaze was so sharp that it resembled a dagger layered with frost, intending to make a bloody hole in Gu Chugge. If looks could kill, the man had probably died countless times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So? Are you going to beg or not?&#8221; Gu Changge continued to smile nonchalantly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No.&#8221; Jiang Chuchu insisted with rare defiance with inexplicable courage, boring into him icily with her crystal-clear eyes just like that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had a feeling it was because she always acted vulnerable in front of him that he would find pleasure in bullying her. Thus, she couldn&#8217;t yield at this time, even if it meant that he would force her later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what surprised and stumped her was the fact that Gu Changge didn&#8217;t get upset but chuckled instead after hearing her words. &#8220;Alright, I won&#8217;t bully you today, seeing that you&#8217;re so pitiful… Now, sit tight and wait for me here.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, he took a step and leapt into the air in a flash, without waiting for her response.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next second, he appeared above the atmosphere. With a wave of his hand, a burst of terrifying energy came crashing down, as though the whole galaxy had been split apart. Below, the Eternal Overcast creatures were crushed into bloody mists before they could even get close to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure… You be careful.&#8221; Jiang Chuchu couldn&#8217;t help mumbling when she came to herself despite still being somewhat stupefied. But, she very quickly realised that she was actually worried for him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, to be fair to herself, the surprise she got was rather unexpected. [Why would he suddenly be so nice to me? He hasn&#8217;t gotten upset at all, given my attitude. Could it be because I asked if he could treat me a little nicer in the past? He did, in fact, do it in a way, but that bastard just had to be mean and say no at that time!]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As quiet and aloof as Jiang Chuchu usually was, she felt beyond exasperated with Gu Changge right then after figuring it out. But then, it quickly hit her that his change in attitude, in a way, meant that he would actually consider her feelings.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that notion in mind, she suddenly felt much brighter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge appeared within the crack, in the depths of the Eternal Overcast Fog. However, he had just taken a step forward when he felt an intense divine sense sweep against him from behind. At the same time, a horrifying wave of energy came at him like a volcano eruption. It was beyond powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm, Sacred Lord Realm, huh?] He didn&#8217;t stop to think before immediately hurling a punch behind him. The punch created an unfathomable divine force which traversed through space, immediately turning everything around it into dust.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though that Sacred Lord Realm Eternal Overcast creature was born with intelligence, it was easily obliterated with just one punch. Though, to be fair, give his current powers, Gu Changge could fight an expert in the Sacred King Realm with ease, even if he didn&#8217;t use Demonic Arts. If he used whatever means possible, he, too, was confident that he could fight against someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm and above, which was the Nirvana Realm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Silavin: Quasi-Nirvana seems to still be within the Nirvana Realm, like how Quasi-Sacred is still considered within the Sacred Realm)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the limit was those in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm at most. As for those that have achieved the Great Dao, he would need to breakthrough to the Sacred King Realm first before thinking about it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eitherways, there were Nine Minor Realms in the Sacred Emperor Realm, and every </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minor Realm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was harder to reach than the last. So, the gap between each Minor Sacred Emperor Realm was still significant. Thus, being able to beat one at the Peak was still an amazing feat.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[According to Jiang Chuchu, the Source of the Eternal Overcast is in the depths. Judging from the fluctuation, this one is much more intense than the last Eternal Overcast Source I encountered.] As Gu Changge went deeper into the crack, his eyes lit up as he sensed that this Eternal Overcast Source&#8217;s aura was much more intense than the one he had encountered previously. In other words, after devouring this Eternal Overcast Source, his cultivation level would be able to advance by leaps and bounds.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, he suddenly remembered he had obtained an Amethyst Fortuity Crown long ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there were only so many times he could use this item, he actually wasn&#8217;t sure how useful it was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, this is a good chance to test it out.] While musing, a golden-purple light flashed in his palm, and a purple crown appeared the next second. It seemed to be made out of celestial gold, as it looked exceptionally grand while exuding an unfathomable aura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After using it, Gu Changge found a blurry figure flash across his eyes and somehow, he could sense that the aura around him became much more mysterious and unfathomable.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it wasn&#8217;t long after he moved forward that he saw a figure suddenly charge toward him from the grey mist. The force the figure carried was so intense that the entire space rumbled and cracked non-stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a headless body tainted with grey mist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A headless Sacred King Realm body, and his Source is even whole… Jiang Chuchu sure is lucky. I guess I can call her my Lady Luck,&#8221; Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t help joking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The space in the crack looked more like a small universe. Though it looked to be boundless, it had everything, from mountain ranges to lakes and even buildings.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who knew how long this headless body had been immersed in Yin Energy, as it was wearing shabby armour while holding a pike. When this headless body came charging over, the mountains and rivers crumbled, and all the mountain peaks collapsed into dust. After all, the power of a Sacred King Realm expert could easily cause the sky to collapse. It was beyond horrifying.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He not only has Yin Energy in him but even has Celestial Energy…] Gu Changge shifted and disappeared from where he stood, charging toward the headless body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next second, he reached his hand out, and vast waves suddenly came from all directions, wanting to trap the headless body and devour its remaining Source.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The void collapsed and transformed into a terrifying palm. Even someone as mighty as a Sacred King Realm expert couldn&#8217;t escape such shackles. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The headless body was seemingly enraged as he swept his divine sense toward Gu Changge. However, the next second, the space suddenly exploded and was enveloped in a palm. Following a rumble, many mountains collapsed, and the ground crumbled, forming countless cracks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The palm crushed down on the headless body right away, and his strong Sacred King Realm flesh nearly exploded as well. In no time, a Sacred King&#8217;s whole Source had been devoured, leaving nothing but the body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once done, Gu Changge left the place with a flash. He had a hunch that the Amethyst Fortuity Crown had to do with him meeting a completely intact Sacred King Realm Source. However, he suddenly sensed an odd feeling right then. &#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stopped abruptly and disappeared in a flash, only to show up in a different direction, where he found a black boat travelling toward him from within the thick grey mist. It was rusty and stained with blood. It had visible signs of being through various battles. There was also on it, shabby war clothes, ancient armour… as well as another headless body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge didn&#8217;t know what material the boat was made out of, but it was pitch-black and didn&#8217;t have even the slightest glimmer, but it gave off an inexplicably horrifying feeling. [Who could&#8217;ve imagined there would be such a creepy boat in such a place? This is within the depths of the Eternal Overcast, its land already. The Source is also close by as well.]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any cultivator would&#8217;ve felt a chill running down their spine at this time. What was more, the Eternal Overcast Fog surged from it ceaselessly, like the terrifying deep sea.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appearance of the black boat surprised Gu Changge, even he didn&#8217;t expect to find someone suddenly appearing like this.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wave of divine sense swept over in his direction from the boat suddenly, and the grey mist burst. It was so terrifying that even the headless body that attacked Gu Changge earlier quieted down and knelt on the spot like he was kneeling to its king.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge could see that there were many figures on the boat, all rather powerful Eternal Overcast creatures with intelligence.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No doubt they are members of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom if they can travel within the Land of Eternal Overcast. Those geezers in the Immortal Academy are right. Someone from the Eternal Overcast Kingdom has something to do with this Eternal Overcast crisis this time.] Gu Changge narrowed his eyes at that, ruminating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He recalled the news he got from Yue Mingkong, the Eternal Overcast Kingdom intended to establish Reincarnation for the Eternal Overcast beings, and was trying to find the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yue Mingkong witnessed in her past life how a member of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family searched high and low for the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being after he was born.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ye Ling, on the other hand, had been super cautious back then, so his whereabouts had never been exposed. As for whether Ye Ling had ever engaged with the Eternal Overcast Kingdom later, Yue Mingkong had no idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had tried to obtain information from her, but he didn&#8217;t expect that a member of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family would be born so early on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Could it be, the timeline had been brought forward well in advance? It&#8217;s likely that this has something to do with the Amethyst Fortuity Crown. I could give it a try.] As he mused, mist subtly crept up to his face, leaving only his cold, crystal-clear eyes visible the moment the other party’s divine sense swept over in his direction.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* The next second, an even more terrifying aura surfaced. It was like an ancient heavenly palace had emerged into this world. The Six Paths of Reincarnation seemed to be invoked, vast and boundless in power. Everything revolves around it, and it had the might to overturn Heaven and Earth.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dull thump came as the boat rumbled. At the same time, the figures on it flew out and fell right down. His expression seemed to be one of extreme discomfort..</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it…&#8221; An obscure voice came out, and a man with a bloodless face, dressed in purple and gold armour stepped out. He was in the Early Sacred King Realm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He must be a member of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family.] Gu Changge made out who the man was at first glance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Eternal Overcast creatures came in all different shapes and sizes, but only the royal family resemble humans. Furthemore, those sharing the Eternal Overcast Royal Family bloodline could suppress all other Eternal Overcast creatures, allowing them to go wherever they wanted in the Land of Eternal Overcast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This man in front of him might not look old, but he was, in fact, ancient. Even his clothes were absolutely aged beyond comparison.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, he was looking somewhat shocked at Gu Changge. The other figures that appeared behind him stood immobile as well, absolutely gobsmacked. They were baffled how an outsider, a young man at that, could appear in the place where the Yin Qi was so intense.

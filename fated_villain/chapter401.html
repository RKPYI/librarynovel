          Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t help lightly shaking his head. His tone

          peerless Celestial Sword that seemed to be condensed by countless
          Principles and slashed towards Ye Yao. Like a sea of stars, a Five-Hue
          Divine Light soared into the sky, and the vast sword energy flooded
          the sky. This overwhelming force was so terrifying that it made
          everyone pale and tremble. It no longer was something that the living
          could compete against.

          the sky when a machete with a peerless aura, which seemed to be made
          of Immortal Divine Gold, appeared in his hands. He swung it downwards.
          The movement was not very fast, but a Heavenly Dao Sound suddenly fell
          from heaven and immediately extended across the endless space.</span

          condensed on the black blade were concentrated on Gu Changge&#8217;s

          even time and space were cut off, and a sturdy Vacuum appeared in the

          Changge was said to be from the Immortal Palace. It was a majestic,
          powerful artifact that had the effect of suppressing Fortuity itself.
          Some even said that the Tower of World Domination was actually an
          Immortal Grade Artifact. Even if Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t use it to

          angered even the heavens! If the Great Demon World stays under her
          reign, it will be destroyed sooner or later.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t
          actually plan on fighting Gu Changge, and that was why he was now
          starting a conversation to delay Gu Changge, and give others the
          chance to murder the Empress.

          Gu Changge then casually added, &#8220;I know that you&#8217;re trying
          to drag this fight, but you don&#8217;t have to go through all this
          just for that.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;How cocky of you to put away the Tower of World Domination.
          You underestimate me too much, boy!&#8221; the Night Demon sneered. He
          didn&#8217;t think Gu Changge would be so arrogant as to put away the
          Tower of World Domination right after they reached this desolate
          place. [Just how confident in his powers is he?]</span

          everyone, otherwise, you’ll end up thinking I need artifacts to beat
          you,&#8221; Gu Changge drawled with a smile seemingly mockingly. The
          next moment, a monstrous Demonic Energy suddenly appeared in his hand.
          It was like a halberd made of flawless black crystal that exuded a
          terrifying aura capable of destroying eternity and slaughtering the
          Gods.</span

          >[What is this feeling of impending doom!?] The Night Demon suddenly
          spotted a wary look when he noticed something was wrong. This was a
          strong sense of danger that seemed to freeze his soul as the monstrous
          halberd threatened to fall at any time. At this moment, the Solar
          Heavenly Blade in his hand, started to showcase more power when it
          seemed to have sensed the danger. The aura it showcased was shocking
          and even brought on a menacing divine light. Soon, a black light shone
          as it delivered a powerful blow.</span

          to die.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s expression remained calm as he took
          a step. The void blurred and disappeared from the spot in an instant,
          the Eight Barren Demon Halberd swept down, and the nearby galaxies
          exploded all of a sudden. The terrifying fluctuation caused the Solar
          Heavenly Blade to make a bone-chilling &#8216;crack&#8217; in that
          instant. It seemed that it would be difficult to continue the fight.

          >&#8220;Ugh…&#8221; The Night Demon was severely injured, and with a
          muffled groan, he coughed up blood. His internal organs were in severe
          pain, and the hand holding the Solar Heavenly Blade almost burst open.
          This was a destructive force that would turn anything and everything
          of all levels into powder in a second.</span

          >His face then was twisted in horror. He couldn&#8217;t make sense of
          why Gu Changge had more frightening means to fight against him, even
          though he now holds the Solar Heavenly Blade.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >The exhausted land held not a hint of the living as it fell into
          eternal silence. A pitch-black Grand Flask dripping with black light
          floated above Gu Changge&#8217;s head like a frightening black hole
          devouring up the sky.</span

          >The Night Demon was hit by realisation the instant he saw all this
          and found out Gu Changge&#8217;s identity. Face pale, he exclaimed,
          &#8220;How is this possible!? The Successor of Demonic Arts… is
          you!?&#8221;
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          poured into the Solar Heavenly Blade tried to gush out of the

          Principle coursed.</span

          Demon Halberd swept down and the void exploded. Even the universe
          seemed to have ruptured and split into two. Afterwards, the place was
          filled with grey fog that covered all the galaxies, and there were
          horrifying screams that slowly turned silent.</span

          assassins invaded the Sacred Mountain in an instant. With their power,
          many young prodigies couldn&#8217;t even put up a fight before they
          were defeated. All of a sudden, the place was filled with battle cries
          as everyone unleashed the might of their artifacts to fight each
          other.</span

          will come soon.&#8221; Despite the chaos, Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s face
          was calm. It was true that she couldn&#8217;t use her Qi now, but her
          physical body was frightening enough that ordinary people
          couldn&#8217;t get close or even hope to harm her. Not to mention,
          there were many experts left behind by Gu Changge for her. Thus, this
          assassination attempt was about to come to an end.</span

          of her officials, who she trained since she was a child, would one day
          betray her by poisoning her food. She still remembered how she saved
          her from the mouth of a large monster and even taught her the ways to
          cultivate till now.</span

          has seen through this a long time ago,&#8221; Empress Yao Xi mocked
          herself. This was no longer a matter as simple as her being blinded by
          the truth because she was too closely involved. It was pure naivety

          disappeared, leaving behind only artifacts and a simple letter about
          how the Demon World would soon go into chaos. The artifacts were left
          for Yao Xi to fend for herself. She also wouldn&#8217;t have reached
          this point if it wasn&#8217;t for the contents of the letter. That was
          why the Solar Heavenly Blade must have been left behind by the Solar
          Demon Overlord for his son.</span

          his death because the body in his tomb has disappeared, and yet
          instead of being dead, he&#8217;s now hiding somewhere. But what if
          this is part of his plan? What if he deliberately led me in this
          direction to make me think that he was actually dead at that time, but
          before the Lunar Demon Overlord disappeared, he reshaped his soul and
          reincarnated with his original memory? Could that be the reason I have
          never found him?] Empress Yao Xi couldn&#8217;t help narrowing her
          eyes when her doubts were suddenly cleared.

          the drain?] Just when Empress Yao Xi figured out the key points, Jun
          Fan&#8217;s face turned dark. Even though he was also fighting among
          the crowd, he had been paying attention to the battles outside the

          action, Empress Yao Xi would have absolutely no chance of surviving.

          come back. It was clear that he was facing difficulties.</span

          the Sacred Mountain, none of them even dealing the least bit of damage
          to her before their lives were taken. Once the army from the imperial
          palace arrives, the situation would definitely turn around in an

          a small, wry smile on his face. He habitually touched his nose and

          fight against Wudi, he will lower his cultivation to be at the same

          Mountain Elder waved his hand and snorted coldly while he made the

          his words.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang was a disciple of the Nine Great Mountains who was highly
          regarded by the Second Mountain Elder. Even though he had only been a
          follower of the Nine Great Mountains for a little more than 20 years,
          his cultivation shouldn&#8217;t be underestimated. He had learnt all
          of the Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s skills. Not only that, Gu Wudi
          was recognized as the Chosen One by the Nine Great Mountains, and he
          was also the disciple the Third Mountain Elder was most proud of.
          Except for a few disciples who had been cultivating for the longest
          time, the rest were not his opponents at all.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that Gu Wudi had already reached the Sacred Emperor Realm, and
          Xiao Yang&#8217;s only in the Sacred Realm, the difference between the
          two was the gap between heaven and earth. In fact, Gu Wudi could crush
          Xiao Yang to death with one finger if he wanted to.</span

          >&#8220;A Three-Strike Pact?&#8221; Hearing this, the Second Mountain
          Elder relaxed his frown. He then gave it a thought before he nodded.
          Still, he asked Xiao Yang beside him, &#8220;What do you think of
          Third Mountain Elder&#8217;s request? Is it acceptable?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang smiled when he heard those words. &#8220;Since Third
          Mountain Elder has said so, how can I refuse? I may not be as talented
          as Senior Wudi, but I have confidence.&#8221; As he spoke, he raised
          his eyebrows, showing the vigour and confidence only a youth would
          have. He had a plan. Otherwise, it would be impossible to win against
          Gu Wudi.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing this, all the Mountain Lords quietly nodded. They thought that
          all Xiao Yang needed was more time, and what he would be able to
          achieve in the future would surely not be inferior to that of Gu
          Wudi.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Alright. In that case, see you at the square of the Second
          Mountain in three days,&#8221; Third Mountain Elder snorted coldly.
          Not wanting to stay, his figure then turned blurry as he disappeared
          from the hall. Seeing this, the rest of the Mountain Lords bid
          farewell to Second Mountain Elder as they intended to leave. The
          decision about the closure of the mountain hadn&#8217;t been made just
          yet.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >What was important now was the owner of the Celestial Seal of the
          Nine Mountains. Each of the Nine Great Mountains was separated by a
          distance of a million kilometres, and there were vast seas of stars
          between them. However, with their cultivation, they could return to
          and fro with little effort. Soon, the hall became quiet when only the
          Second Mountain Elder and Xiao Yang were left there.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Second Mountain Elder flashed a warm smile and spoke to Xiao
          Yang, who was beside him. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t need to say anything
          just now. As long as I keep asserting pressure, Third Mountain Elder
          can&#8217;t do anything to me. Now that the Celestial Seal of the Nine
          Mountains is in my hands, he is not my opponent.&#8221;</span

          I have the confidence to win the Three-Strike Pact,&#8221; Xiao Yang
          smiled and replied, looking quite confident.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear you say that.&#8221; The Second
          Mountain Elder let out a relieved smile. He suddenly sighed,
          &#8220;You&#8217;ve grown up in the blink of an eye. I still remember
          the first time I saw you. You were just a baby back then.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang grew curious when he heard this. &#8220;For you to mention
          this suddenly… Are you going to tell me about my identity,
          Master?&#8221; He knew the Second Mountain Elder was not someone who
          normally would say such words.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Second Mountain Elder nodded. &#8220;I should have sent you out
          to deal with the Upper Realm&#8217;s invasion. I didn&#8217;t because
          the outside world is unpredictable, and it&#8217;s difficult for you
          to do anything with your current cultivation level.&#8221; He had a
          complicated look in his eyes as he stared at Xiao Yang.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I understand that your decisions are for my own good,&#8221;
          Xiao Yang reassured him with a smile. Although he wanted to see the
          outside world, he could also understand his Master’s painstaking
          efforts.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Second Mountain Elder asked again, &#8220;Do you know the reason
          I say you would make a better owner for the Celestial Seal than Gu
          Wudi?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it because you favour me, Master?&#8221; Xiao Yang
          was a little surprised to see the Second Mountain Elder shaking his
          head slightly. He then thought for a while before he deduced solemnly,
          &#8220;Gu Wudi&#8217;s virtues are not beneficial for someone in
          power. He is too headstrong, and it will be difficult for him to move
          on from small matters and look at the bigger picture. The most
          important thing to consider is that the Nine Great Mountains might
          fall in danger if he is in charge of the Celestial Seal. What&#8217;s
          more, Third Mountain Elder is far too ambitious to keep the Nine Great
          Mountains hidden from the world. As his disciple, Gu Wudi will
          definitely obey the words of Third Mountain Elder.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, the Second Mountain Elder nodded and praised,
          &#8220;Clever boy.&#8221; However, he quickly turned serious again.
          &#8220;After you take over the Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains, I
          will seal off the mountain and send you out. You belong to the outside
          world&#8230;&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;What?&#8221; The smile on Xiao Yang&#8217;s face froze in
          puzzlement. &#8220;Forgive me for not understanding this, but what do
          you mean, Master?&#8221; He didn&#8217;t understand what the Second
          Mountain Elder meant by sealing off the mountain and sending him off
          to the outside world. [Didn&#8217;t Master just say that the outside
          world is unpredictable?]

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that instant, Xiao Yang was confused, and he couldn&#8217;t figure
          out what was happening.</span

          emerged. This jade pendant was only as long as the forefinger, and it
          was engraved with ancient and complicated patterns. It didn&#8217;t
          belong to this era. Xiao Yang&#8217;s name in an ancient language was

          mentioned to him before about how this jade pendant might hold the
          secrets of his identity. However, he had never actually looked into it

          disciple because I owe the owner of this jade pendant a favour back
          then,&#8221; the Second Mountain Elder suddenly told Xiao Yang a

          Cloud Flying Boat, which was like a mountain, was on the edge of the
          continent thousands of kilometres away drifting across the sky. The
          extremely tall and ancient vehicle was hidden in the vast clouds.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Understood. You are here to visit my Eldest Senior Sister with
          me, Young Master Gu,&#8221; The Sky Deer Goddess repeated with a
          charming, bright smile that reached her eyes. She had an idea what Gu
          Changge was up to.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, Gu Wudi and his group led the way. With Golden Runes beneath
          their feet, they crossed great mountains and rivers and rushed to the
          real location of the Nine Great Mountains. Gu Changge noticed that
          there was a huge difference between Deep Cloud Graveyard and the
          outside world. There were many ancient beasts and birds here, but they
          were not vicious. Some were even somewhat docile.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Primeval Forest was densely covered, and the mountains were
          magnificent. During the journey to the location, many disciples from
          the Nine Great Mountains saw Gu Wudi and the others, and they greeted
          the group respectfully. They seemed wary of Gu Wudi. However, they
          were curious about Gu Changge and the Sky Deer Goddess, who were
          following behind. For countless years, no outsider had been to the
          Nine Great Mountains. Despite their curiosity, they all regarded the
          two as Gu Wudi&#8217;s guests, and they didn&#8217;t ask any
          questions.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Which mountain should we go to first, Young Master?&#8221; Gu
          Wudi suddenly asked in a respectful tone mid-journey.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Whichever mountain you are from,&#8221; Gu Changge replied
          casually and looked away after he took a careful look at this
          place.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes, Young Master.&#8221; Gu Wudi nodded, and the Golden Rune
          under his feet extended from the sky to a certain majestic Mystic
          Mountain in the depths.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The surrounding sea of stars was a vast place where small stars
          gathered together. It was a magnificent, beautiful place that felt
          like the Celestial Realm. This was The Third Mountain.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Divine rainbows shot over from the mountain peak when Gu Wudi
          appeared at the mountain. This group of people was made up of both
          aged males and females. Some of them looked at Gu Changge and the Sky
          Deer Goddess suspiciously. Even so, they spoke to Gu Wudi while
          ignoring them, &#8220;Greetings, Chosen One. Third Mountain Elder is
          looking for you.&#8221;
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Alright. I shall bring my honoured guests along to meet
          Master.&#8221; Gu Wudi nodded and returned to looking regal. He looked
          like a god with golden light shining in his hair. Everyone was
          cautious towards him, and they were even more curious about the
          distinguished guests he was talking about. Still, none of them dared
          to ask more questions.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;This way, please, Young Master.&#8221; Gu Wudi led the way to
          the main hall of the Third Mountain Elder. Gu Changge nodded slightly
          in response. He wasn&#8217;t worried that Gu Wudi would attempt
          anything. He also wanted to see for himself who the so-called Third
          Mountain Elder was, and what he was capable of.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The clouds and mist on the top of The Third Mountain were vast, and
          there stood a magnificent and ancient palace. The Celestial Waterfall
          of Chaos flowed from among the peaks of the mountain. Not only that,
          Celestial Mist lingered where Celestial Light intertwined, and there
          were clouds of thousands of colours.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This was a shocking scenery comparable to heaven on earth. The
          spiritual beasts here had some kind of Celestial Energy, and their
          energies were extraordinarily strong. They were completely different
          from the beasts outside. They weren&#8217;t afraid when they saw Gu
          Changge and the others coming. Instead, they let their colourful
          feathers shine brilliantly under the glow of the sunlight.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[There must be some kind of secret treasure that maintains the
          environment here…] Gu Changge quickly concluded when he saw this
          scene. The Nine Great Mountains were somewhat extraordinary. Compared
          to his Inner World, the Nine Great Mountains had a sense of mystery
          and eternity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, under Gu Wudi&#8217;s lead, Gu Changge and the others saw the
          so-called Third Mountain Elder in the hall. He was an energetic old
          man in a black robe with supreme energy lingering between his eyes.
          However, he was also looking at Gu Changge puzzledly before his gaze
          finally fell on the Sky Deer Goddess. &#8220;Wudi? These
          are…&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Master, they are the distinguished guests that I met outside
          the gate,&#8221; Gu Wudi replied respectfully, not daring to reveal
          what he had encountered before.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Are you the current Sky Deer Goddess?&#8221; Surprised, the
          Third Mountain Elder quickly asked. He recognised the Sky Deer
          Goddess.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She smiled in return. &#8220;Hello, friend.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He then turned to Gu Changge. &#8220;And this is…&#8221;
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He couldn&#8217;t quite gauge Gu Changge&#8217;s cultivation. Gu
          Changge obviously wasn&#8217;t old, but for some reason, he gave off a
          dangerous feeling, even more so than the Sky Deer Goddess.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, before Gu Changge could answer, she quickly answered,
          &#8220;His name is Changge. He is my husband.&#8221;
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She then smilingly arched her dark eyebrows as she laced her arm
          around his. Standing here, she looked like a Divine Lotus with a holy
          aura, as though she was a young girl completely in love.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Husband?&#8221; The Third Mountain Elder&#8217;s eyebrows
          raised in surprise. [Since when did the Sky Deer Goddess get a
          husband?]
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since ancient times, Sky Deer Goddess had always been a symbol of
          purity and cleanliness. No man had ever appeared by her side.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes!&#8221; As Sky Deer Goddess replied, her voice grew
          slightly grumpy. &#8220;But I am only my husband&#8217;s

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tell me who you are. Are you just a pawn used by the real Successor of Demonic Arts to deceive everyone? Even if you survived this encounter, it is impossible for you to win against me. Do you think you will be that lucky again after escaping back then?&#8221;</span><span id="more-34840"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the quiet compound, Lan Yifei spoke carelessly with his hands behind his back as light seemed to flow within him. He looked extremely confident and did not turn around, smiling confidently as if certain that his visitor would never defeat him. He had the True Dao Source Physique, which was an extremely rare physique that had only appeared several times in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He truly was confident since his physique naturally complemented with the Great Dao. His body had already produced a Dao Source since birth, which allowed him to absorb the forces of heaven and earth. As long as his Soul had not been destroyed, the power he possessed would never run out which gave him an inherent advantage. He had the ability to protect himself and escape even if enemies were far more powerful than him, so he wasn&#8217;t worried about dying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information about him possessing the True Dao Source Physique had somehow accidentally leaked and he was attacked by the Successor of Demonic Arts when on a trip. Due to the great number of rumours, he had been extremely wary of the Successor of Demonic Arts since he knew he had a very rare and precious Source, which would be coveted by the Successor of Demonic Arts once it was publicly known. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he had greatly overestimated the abilities of the Successor of Demonic Arts, who had attacked him. His opponent was inferior to him in terms of cultivation. Nevertheless, Lan Yifei did not dare to let down his guard against such an enemy, since his enemy already had such a reputation. Everyone in the younger generation was fearful of the Successor of Demonic Arts, but Lan Yifei soon realised during the fight that the so-called Successor of Demonic Arts wasn&#8217;t as terrifying as the rumours claimed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His opponent might have strange and cunning techniques, which were hard to defend against, but they weren&#8217;t so impressive that they could easily defeat everyone in the younger generation. After all, Lan Yifei knew that the Successor of Demonic Arts had been the only person to survive Gu Changge&#8217;s multiple attempts at killing him and thus had to be very remarkable. No one in the Upper Realm was certain of escaping Gu Changge&#8217;s attacks alive and unscathed, yet the Successor of Demonic Arts had achieved that. It was a thought that was sobering and chilling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he realised that he was mistaken even with that in mind. The Successor of Demonic Arts, who had been brave enough to make an attempt on his life, seemed to have noticed that things weren&#8217;t right and quickly retreated to flee somewhere far away. Lan Yifei knew that it was because he had been far too low-profile and hadn&#8217;t displayed his formidable abilities in the outside world, thus allowing the Successor of Demonic Arts to carelessly underestimate him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had pursued the Successor of Demonic Arts without hesitation and the ensuing chain of events wasn&#8217;t surprising. After battling for some time, the Successor of Demonic Arts, who had stirred up a storm in the Upper Realm, had come off worse and ran away, nearly getting killed by him in the process. However, the Successor of Demonic Arts had fled to the area outside the territory where Devil Mountain was situated, so he had to withdraw due to his wariness against the fearsome Demoness in Red.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning to the Sect, Lan Yifei became increasingly doubtful as he felt the Successor of Demonic Arts who had attacked him was probably a fake or a scapegoat and not the real deal. Had it been the real Successor of Demonic Arts, he would have been killed earlier because the true one considered everyone to be prey regardless of their physiques, and no prey could ever escape their hunters. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lan Yifei might be confident in his own abilities, but that didn&#8217;t mean he was senselessly arrogant. He had cultivated under the radar all those years without creating a famous reputation for himself in the outside world for a reason. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, he had the increasing feeling that he had accidentally discovered a shocking secret that he never announced to anyone, including even his Elders or his Master. Now, the fake Successor of Demonic Arts had shown up once more to take revenge. It was amusing to him, but he was more curious about whether the true Successor was responsible for this and who exactly the real Successor was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you that confident I won’t be able to kill you this time and take your Source?&#8221; The cold calm voice spoke once again. It was difficult to tell whether the speaker was male or female, though it contained chilling intent. The compound was quiet and serene, with a stream flowing under a bridge and rock formations everywhere which made the place look elegant. It would have seemed charming if not for the murderous aura suffusing the place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lan Yifei came back to himself and turned leisurely to look towards the source of the voice. &#8220;You can try. I want to see how you have improved in the last few months, though I&#8217;m far more curious as to who you are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He sounded extremely carefree and looked unbothered. He had put up traps everywhere in the area by connecting divine arrays with heaven and earth and weaving in Principles to seal up the space so even a fly couldn&#8217;t escape, so he considered the arrogance of the Successor of Demonic Arts in barging in recklessly entertaining and foolish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who I am isn&#8217;t important. What&#8217;s important is that you are going to die today.&#8221; The hidden voice was still cold and held no inflexion or hint of emotion. A terrifying black-coloured wind swirling with Dao runes swept towards Lan Yifei; it was a terrifying murderous intent which contained the Sound of Great Dao that could shake apart a cultivator&#8217;s soul and destroy everything with a physical form.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lan Yifei seemed to have already sensed it and raised his eyebrows. Blinding light surged from beneath his feet to form a thick heavy mountain made of runes which blocked the attack. As someone with the True Dao Source Physique, he was naturally at one with the Great Dao and as such had free reign over the world he was in. Thus, he had limitless power at his disposal and could suppress everything. He could sense that his opponent&#8217;s powers had drastically improved compared to several months ago, probably due to instruction from an expert while recuperating. However, it wasn&#8217;t enough to defeat him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You won&#8217;t win against me. If you tell me who the real Successor of Demonic Arts is, I may consider letting you go,&#8221; suggested Lan Yifei mildly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge, who had always hidden in the shadows without revealing herself, frowned as she felt things becoming more complex. She had thought she would master her abilities better after being taught by Chan Honyi, and could acquire Lan Yifei&#8217;s Source to take revenge. However, Lan Yifei was still extremely strong, which meant she wasn&#8217;t the only one who had improved. Apparently, nearly everyone in the younger generation of the Upper Realm was resorting to various ways to catch up to a certain someone right now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The real Successor of Demonic Arts? You also think I am a fake?&#8221; Su Qingge replied coldly. Anger and hatred began to show in her eyes when she recalled how she had been unknowingly tricked and manipulated by Gu Changge all this time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew her hatred of him was partly due to Chan Honyi&#8217;s influence. If Chan Honyi hadn&#8217;t informed her, Su Qingge would have still been kept in the dark and thought herself to be the real Successor of Demonic Arts, while he shone brightly like the sun in his role as the leader of the light and the commander of the Upper Realm. The depth of her love for him before was how deep her hatred of him was now that she knew the truth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had thought of finding Gu Changge after leaving Devil Mountain to ask him about everything, but she was more afraid of seeing the cruel gaze that would be revealed after he took off the warm gentle mask he usually wore. He had brought her to the Upper Realm and allowed her to understand it more. Frankly speaking, she wouldn&#8217;t have turned out this way without him, and it could be said that he had moulded her into what she was now. The man who had given her infinite hope and warmth was cold and cruel beneath that disguise he wore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh? So you have also understood that you are the fake Successor of Demonic Arts now? That means that you have always been the scapegoat for the real one.&#8221; Lan Yifei seemed amused by this and his gaze was unabashedly mocking and scornful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge&#8217;s eyes became cold. &#8220;That changes nothing. I will take your Source today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that Su Qingge was about to continue her attempt, Lan Yifei&#8217;s expression darkened as well. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know when to yield. Do you think that laughable strength of yours is comparable to that of the real Successor of Demonic Arts? Can someone like you kill me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His words hit her sore spot, making Su Qingge&#8217;s expression become colder. She clenched her fists tightly as a bloodthirsty aura swirled around her. She knew that her personality wasn&#8217;t as calm as before after combining herself with her other Soul, and many things could elicit an unimaginable level of murderous and savage intent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are a pitiful pawn after all and don&#8217;t know who the real Successor of Demonic Arts is.&#8221; Lan Yifei shook his head before laughing coldly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge fell silent, unable to argue against that. While she knew it was already too late, what Lan Yifei had said was an undeniable fact and she might be such a pawn to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know who he is.&#8221; Su Qingge regained her calm frigid demeanour from within the shadows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You do?&#8221; Lan Yifei&#8217;s expression was stunned before he asked sceptically, &#8220;How can I believe you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undeniable excitement rose within him, probably since he had a clear judgement of his own abilities after experiencing Su Qingge&#8217;s tactics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;His true identity had been unknown for 20 years and quickly gained public fame upon his appearance. If I was the one to expose the real Successor of Demonic Arts, it would not be a bad idea to abandon the low profile I have been keeping.&#8221; Lan Yifei&#8217;s eyes lit up. He became very excited as he thought of many possibilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course I do. I consider him my enemy,&#8221; Su Qingge answered neutrally before giving her conditions. &#8220;I know that you also desire to know who he is, so let&#8217;s make a deal. I&#8217;ll tell you what you want to know, and you will help me gather physical Sources as the Chosen One of the Immortal Dao Alliance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lan Yifei sneered scornfully. &#8220;You are still extremely arrogant. I can kill you and search your Soul if I really want to know that. I don&#8217;t have to make a deal with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn&#8217;t foolish; if his actions in gathering Sources got exposed, the Immortal Dao Alliance wouldn&#8217;t be able to protect him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am brave enough to show up here, which means I am not worried about you being able to kill me. If you don&#8217;t agree to that, then I&#8217;ll add another condition. I can tell you what I know about the Devouring Demonic Arts, Nommening.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge didn&#8217;t seem shocked by his reaction and smirked. If Gu Changge could use her as a pawn, why couldn&#8217;t she emulate him by using someone else as her pawn?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At those words, Lan Yifei suddenly became quiet despite his personality. He frowned since he felt conflicted. Although the Upper Realm Forces greatly despised the Successor of Demonic Arts to the point of wanting to destroy him, who could do exactly that without succumbing to their desires when inheriting the Demonic Arts was within reach?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge looked at him silently without feeling surprised. The entire compound fell silent for almost five minutes before Lan Yifei regained control of himself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course. I agree to your conditions,&#8221; he replied, a fire blazing within his eyes before it died away. He looked confident and assured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge laughed and secretly called him a fool, but her expression didn&#8217;t change. What was the use of him knowing that Gu Changge was the real Successor of Demonic Arts? Would he be brave enough to interrogate Gu Changge or investigate further? This would end with Lan Yifei studying the Demonic Arts and garnering Gu Changge&#8217;s attention, thus making him the new scapegoat.</span></p>

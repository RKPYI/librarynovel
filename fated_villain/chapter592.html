        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s words put Yu Feiya into a deep contemplation. In her opinion, it was hard to make a decision with such baseless information. Her father was probably not going to believe it unless Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had evidence. </span><span id="more-32775"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, why would Gu Changge send someone to assassinate the Second Prince? And How did Tuo Ba Xiao Yao know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya&#8217;s mind was filled with plenty of doubts. But she still chose to believe Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, as she nodded and said ,&#8221;I will try my best to convince my father and ask him to be cautious. I will help you keep your secret as well.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao smiled and said, &#8220;I got it. Thank you Feiya.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao didn&#8217;t wish to expose too much of what he knew right now. If Emperor Yu questioned her about it, Yu Feiya could give some excuse to cover it up. Once this incident was over, he would then find an appropriate opportunity to explain everything to Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the conversation, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao bid goodbye and turned into a green smoke before vanishing into the void.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya stayed silently still for a moment before heading back to her palace. However, she was still thinking about Tuo Bao Xiao Yao&#8217;s words as she whispered to herself, &#8220;Three days later?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same moment, after being escorted to the temporary lodgings allocated by Emperor Yu, Gu Changge sealed up the surrounding space to prevent anyone from spying with divine sense. He then ordered a subordinate to investigate Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alliance of Thousand Merchants stretched across the Upper Realm and other worlds. They had a branch in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty as well. Thus, he simply had to give an order and someone would bring him the information he wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you asking someone to investigate the Eternal Overcast Scourge?&#8221;  Jiang Chuchu was drying her hair while walking over. Her body was covered in a chiffon fabric that looked like an ethereal fog. There were still traces of water on her arm and it was obvious that she had just taken a bath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The veil on her face had already been taken off, exposing a flawless face. Her lips were red even without dye and her skin was crystal clear, it was so fair that it looked like a superior white jade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge turned around and smiled in response, &#8220;Not yet, I am asking someone to investigate a person that interests me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A person that interests you? Could it be that Eldest Princess Yu Feiya from the palace?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu blinked her eyes before she asked with an unconcerned tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the question, Gu Changge laughed and reached out as he wanted to embrace her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Jiang Chuchu avoided deftly and avoided his hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have yet to answer my question.&#8221; Her glistening eyes were so beautiful and felt like there were celestial light swirling in them. &#8220;Don&#8217;t try to fool me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge spoke with a helpless tone, &#8220;Is someone jealous? She merely gave me a toast in the palace hall. Look at how petty you are now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu was a little offended as she said, &#8220;When you are in the palace, you have been staring at her. Don&#8217;t think I didn&#8217;t notice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am just wondering what Physique she has. What are you thinking?&#8221; Gu Changge sighed and was seemingly helpless. &#8220;She is inferior to you in looks, inferior to you in obedience. Why would you think I am interested in her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu snorted and stared at Gu Changge, &#8220;Is that true? You are not allowed to deceive me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It can’t be more true, more so than real gold and silver.&#8221; Gu Changge had a serious expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t explain about Tuo Ba Xiao Yao as there was a reason. Jiang Chuchu merely wanted an expression of feelings, not facts. Even if Gu Changge was really interested in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s Eldest Princess, Yu Feiya, Jiang Chuchu wouldn&#8217;t really argue over it. After all, what she wanted in her heart was not much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this period of time, Gu Changge realized that Jiang Chuchu was overly clingy to him. It might not be to the point where she couldn&#8217;t be an inch away from him, but it seemed like she would need to see if he was by her side before she could be at ease. It had given Gu Changge a headache as Yue Mingkong wasn&#8217;t as clingy as Jiang Chuchu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially after Gu Changge sent Ah Da to resolve the areas which had the Eternal Overcast Scourge. It allowed Jiang Chuchu to be at total ease for once, with her delegating all the other Mortal Palace matters to the Elders as well. As a result, she didn&#8217;t cultivate at all and was always by his side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, we better rest early tonight.&#8221; Hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s guarantee, Jiang Chuchu couldn&#8217;t help but smile brightly and put her head into his embrace as she softly said. Her moist hair was emitting a faint fragrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Resting so early? Don&#8217;t forget that you have serious matters to attend to here, at the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.&#8221; Gu Changge revealed a gentle expression as he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu lifted her glistening eyes and looked at him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t I have you? I don&#8217;t wish to think about the matters of Mortal Palace. I just want you to be with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She seems to think I’ll just naturally handle everything.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel like I am overly pampering you.&#8221; Gu Changge laughed and reached out to hug her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu let out a small smile and reached out with her fair and jade-like arms to wrap around Gu Changge&#8217;s neck, &#8220;It will be great if things can always be like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge involuntarily shook his head while he smiled. He believed that no one apart from him had ever seen Jiang Chuchu in this state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the next few days, the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was extremely lively as they were preparing for the Hunting Event. Almost everyday, there were flying boats and divine rainbows rushing towards the Great Yu Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the Forces within the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, there would be plenty of spectators from the Immortal or Formidable Forces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was definitely a huge commotion for Gu Changge to be personally visiting the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Many here were discussing this topic. Everyone was even more excited and emotional when they found out that Gu Changge would be spectating the Hunting Event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the youth generation were rubbing their fists and palms, they hoped they would be able to perform well during the Hunting Event and grab his attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families and Sects in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty were all making comprehensive preparations for this Hunting Event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s investigation about Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had received some updates too. But judging from the matters known about in recent years, it was hard to find any clues. Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was publicly recognized in the Imperial Capital as a mediocre individual of the General Manor. He was dumb-witted, honest, and had ordinary talent. He was only interested in practicing the sword. It was said that his cultivation was comparable to a six-year-old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the information he collected, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was extremely suitable for a profile of a wastrel. In Gu Changge&#8217;s opinion, it seemed like something was lacking. It was strange because clues were so hard to find.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was the third child of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s great general and had prestigious status. He was rather amicable with his siblings and there was no news of conflicts among them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Gu Changge&#8217;s opinion, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was either keeping a low-profile or he was a late bloomer and had yet to become a true Fortuitous One.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It would be rather simple to find out which kind he is. He can be tested with the people around him. He does have an elder sister and younger sister…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was planning to test Tuo Ba Xiao Yao before the Hunting Event. By then, he would be certain if Tuo Bao Xiao Yao was the owner of the Sword of World Domination or someone related.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the next day, there was an unexpected visitor and it roused up Gu Changge&#8217;s interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yu Tianzheng pays his greetings to Young Master Changge.&#8221; The visitor was a middle-aged man with a majestic aura. He had black waterfall-like hair, deep eyes, and was emitting prestige.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, his face actually had 70% resemblance to the current Emperor Yu. But he looked to have gone through more hardship and was obviously older.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had visited quickly and didn&#8217;t alert anyone. Gu Changge was able to detect that Yu Tianzheng didn&#8217;t have any malicious intent, otherwise, he would have already made a move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be able to sneak into the imperial palace, one either had overwhelming strength, or had plenty of subordinates planted around. For this self-proclaimed Yu Tianzheng, Gu Changge felt that he was probably the latter. This made Gu Changge hold some guesses in his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you looking for me?&#8221; Gu Changge asked with eyes of interest as he sized up the strength of this individual in front of him. [A Half-Step True Daoist, huh? And he seemed to be even stronger than Emperor Yu.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng was wearing gray robes and had a solemn expression. He was emitting magnanimity and grace, as he was obviously a person of high status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am here to pledge loyalty to Young Master Changge. I am willing to offer the entire Great Yu Celestial Dynasty as tribute.&#8221; As Yu Tianzheng was speaking, his expression was extremely stern and wasn&#8217;t joking at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before he came to visit Gu Changge, he had already thought of what to say. He clearly knew what kind of person Gu Changge was and he wouldn&#8217;t listen to nonsense. Therefore, Yu Tianzheng went straight to the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Interesting. Tributing the entire Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and pledging your loyalty to me? But are you capable of that?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s expression changed a little but after a smile, his expression reverted back to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This person was either a fool or was confident enough to speak words of treason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge merely had to say one statement and would be able to summon plenty of experts within the imperial palace to seize Yu Tianzheng. He wouldn&#8217;t even need to do it personally. [For this person to have such guts, he is obviously making a bet.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am naturally capable. Young Master Changge, please listen to the entire story. Once everything is successful, I shall offer the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty as a tribute.” Seeing that Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t planning to make a move, Yu Tianzheng revealed a face of delight as he let out a breath of relief in his heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like he took the right bet. How could a person like Gu Changge not have any ideas of seizing the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;300 years ago, I was contesting for the imperial throne against the current Emperor Yu, Yu Tianhe and we were evenly matched. We are born of the same mother and are extremely close. Back then, I promised that I would clear off all hindrance and offer him the imperial throne. But I didn&#8217;t expect him to send someone to assassinate my wife… Even our mother had been poisoned to death by him and he ultimately put the blame on me.&#8221; Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s expression was filled with deep-seated hatred as he explained the incidents that happened during the contest for the imperial throne that happened 300 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He included how he was defeated and had been exiled out of the Great Yu&#8217;s domain. He also explained how he was recklessly trying to take back what originally belonged to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge listened with interest and didn&#8217;t interrupt him. Of course, Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t believe Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s explanation as this was a grudge between him and Emperor Yu. It was something that only the two of them knew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was currently considering what benefits could Yu Tianzheng bring to him, nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Yu Tianzheng wasn&#8217;t able to satisfy him, Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t mind delivering him personally to Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I am to take back the throne of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, I will definitely announce Young Master Changge as my Master. I can swear on my Dao Heart. If I break this oath, my dao heart will collapse and I will turn into ashes without a chance to reincarnate!&#8221; Seeing that Gu Changge was remaining silent, Yu Tianzheng couldn&#8217;t help but give the guarantee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then what help do you need from me?&#8221; Gu Changge paused for a moment before asking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge didn&#8217;t wish to place a bet on Yu Tianzheng, but this bait was simply too huge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hidden Ji Family or Hidden An Clan could not hope to be compared to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. They were a renowned Immortal Force of the Upper Realm that had existed for a long time. They were ranked amongst the strongest in the Upper Realm, and had immeasurable foundations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Gu Changge had other plans. He didn&#8217;t need Yu Tianzheng to make an oath upon his Dao Heart, he only had to plant a demonic seed in Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s Dao Heart. If Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s plan was to fail, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t have to worry that he would be exposed as the mastermind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I need Young Master Changge to send troops and quell the unrest!&#8221; Seeing that Gu Changge was asking questions, Yu Tianzheng appeared to be excited. He had actually been waiting for this day for a long time, but no one was able to help him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent years, he had been putting down plenty of measures in the imperial palace, otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t have been able to sneak inside so easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That isn&#8217;t a problem. But I need to see if you are worthy enough for me to aid you.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng took a deep breath and said with eyes of radiance, &#8220;Young Master Changge doesn&#8217;t have to worry, I already have a plan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During this Hunting Event, I arranged for someone to assassinate Emperor Yu&#8217;s second son. This son is extremely precious to him and has been nurtured as a Successor. Nothing must go wrong for him. Once I send someone to kill his son, Emperor Yu would definitely be enraged and would start to search for the killer. By then, the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty would be in chaos and I will use the opportunity to sneak into the palace and kill Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty would be leaderless and would sink into a state of panic. I would then appear and with my status, I can take over the place as Emperor with a justifiable reason. The only thing of consideration would be the resistance from Yu Tianhe&#8217;s loyal servants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Emperor Yu was killed, the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty would be in even greater chaos. There would be Forces that would desire the throne. What Yu Tianzheng needed Gu Changge to do was to send troops and help him quell chaos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With deterrence from Gu Changge, it would calm the restless factions and they wouldn&#8217;t dare to make any reckless moves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your plan is indeed flawless, but have you considered about the hidden experts in the imperial palace and if those Ancestors of the Great Yu would accept your succession.&#8221; Gu Changge said indifferently as he didn&#8217;t feel that the success rate was high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The massive Great Yu Celestial Dynasty had accumulated their foundation for a long time. It was too whimsical to think that the death of Emperor Yu would put the dynasty in chaos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge doesn&#8217;t have to worry about this point. Be it me or Yu Tianhe, we have the bloodline of the Great Yu. For those Ancestors, different Successors wouldn&#8217;t make a difference. As for the chaos within the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, I have other plans.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Tianzheng was still very confident even with Gu Changge&#8217;s doubts. He had already thought of such problems and had measures in place.</span></p>

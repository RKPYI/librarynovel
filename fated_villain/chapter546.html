          Changge&#8217;s words, she obediently kept the red egg. She
          didn&#8217;t believe that a Sky Phantom would hatch from it. After
          all, Sky Phantoms were one of the Extraordinary Beings of the World.
          There was no way a creature of that level would hatch from such an
          ordinary egg. Not only the eggs, but other things related to the Sky
          Phantom were also supposed to have a shocking appearance, such as
          having a divine glow that could light up the sky. Since ancient times,
          there had been rumours that Sky Phantoms fed on Immortals. Just that
          was enough to show how powerful and terrifying these creatures
          were.</span

          slowly dispersed. Everyone looked at the cracked rock, noting how
          there was still a lot of red blood-like liquid in it. It looked like
          blood, but at the same time, it also looked like water that was
          stained red. Instead of a peculiar odour, it exuded a faint
          fragrance.</span

          saying that she was wasteful in a roundabout manner. She crinkled her
          nose and raised her beautiful eyes to glare at him before she snorted.

          Changge. With the corners of her mouth curled up slightly, she turned
          around, lifted the big red bird beside her feet, and started to wander
          around in search of new stones. However, none of the stones left at
          Stone Gathering Square piqued her interest. Even the big red bird
          seemed bored. Obviously, there was none that it liked.</span

          this, they were all disappointed. Many young prodigies immediately
          left without a sound. They wanted to wait for the Divine Rock
          Conference 3 days later. It would be held in the largest marketplace
          in Dark Kun City, and many Immortal and Formidable Forces would
          participate by bringing all their families&#8217; rare Wondrous

          behind her, also looked ashen and frightened. When Gu Changge took the
          page from his hand just now, he had a feeling that he could have been
          killed by the palm. Even the blood in his body seemed to freeze when

          >What happened at Stone Gathering Square today spread quickly and
          caused quite a stir in Dark Kun City. Of course, that mysterious page
          was the hottest topic. Even though Gu Xianer had to spend 1.5 million
          Spiritual Stones to extract it, the many Sect Masters and Ancient
          Beings present had a feeling that the Sword Technique written on that
          mysterious page was beyond the ordinary Emperor Grade. It had
          definitely surpassed that level. As a result, the page&#8217;s actual
          value was indescribable with words, and it could never be measured
          using Spiritual Stones. Considering that, 1.5 million Spiritual Stones
          suddenly didn&#8217;t seem like a lot.

          Spiritual Stones, people thought it was a disappointment and a waste
          of Spiritual Stones for Gu Xianer. After all, the only thing that came
          out was an egg no more usual than any other egg.</span

          to death by Gu Changge also caused quite a commotion. Of course, the
          many people who witnessed what had actually transpired thought that An
          Xi had it coming. Almost everyone could see now that Gu Xianer was not
          someone they could afford to provoke, especially not when Gu Changge
          was still in Dark Kun City. After this incident, people began to doubt
          whether or not Gu Xianer actually gained the Legacy of a Divine Source
          Master. Because if she didn&#8217;t, her luck was the only plausible
          explanation for what had happened.

          Celestial Bloodline had other uses. That was the reason he arranged
          for the Divine Rock Conference that would happen 3 days later. There
          was no doubt that the Immortal Gu Family would also participate in the

          against the fairness of her skin was even clearer than a newborn

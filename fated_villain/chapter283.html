<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voice that came from outside the cave was not at all unfamiliar to the women.</span><span id="more-28046"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazed for a second, Jiang Chuchu was visibly delighted when she realised it belonged to Gu Changge. However, her eyes quickly dimmed when she knew it was Wang Zijin that he was looking for. She quickly regained her calm, not allowing anyone to see her strange expression</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge? How does he know I&#8217;m here?&#8221; Confused, Wang Zijin tensed her brows. Nonetheless, it was no secret that she would pay Jiang Chuchu a visit whenever she was free since their caves were close to each other. Therefore, Gu Changge must have looked for her before coming to Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s cave.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge came for you. Why don&#8217;t you go check it out?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu serenely suggested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh, you&#8217;re right, but why am I getting the feeling that you&#8217;re upset? How peculiar?&#8221; Wang Zijin shot her a smile before hastily blinking out of the cave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wang Zijinâ€¦&#8221; Having composed herself, Jiang Chuchu revealed a frown. Although she didn&#8217;t want to eavesdrop on the conversation going on outside, she couldn&#8217;t control her emotions when she remembered that it was Gu Changge, who was right outside her cave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She started to walk towards the entrance of the cave, but before she walked out of it, she was stunned. It was due to the sight of Gu Changge sitting under the tranquil bamboos outside the cave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, he was donning his white robe made of the silk from a Sacred Realm Silkmoth King, and simple accessories that highlighted the slenderness of his body. His appearance was collectively noble and heavenly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the prodigal damsels from regions far away couldn&#8217;t help glacing at him with their eyes full of curiosity, wondering why he would be at Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s cave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saintess Zijin.&#8221; As Wang Zijin came out, Gu Changge leisurely greeted her with a flawless smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To what do I owe the pleasure, Brother Gu? Let me guess. You must want something, don&#8217;t you? Huh, perhaps you should fix that opportunist habit of yours.&#8221; Blinking out of the cave, Wang Zijin responded with a gleeful smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s not very amiable, Saintess Zijin. Do I strike you as that kind of man?&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head, seemingly helpless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you not? Douchebag.&#8221; Wang Zijin muttered, though her words weren&#8217;t audible.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Gu Changge heard it, but he pretended as if he missed it, after which he stated, &#8220;But of course, I indeed need a favour from you, Saintess Zijin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subtly rolling her eyes, Wang Zijin was impressed by his shamelessness. It was only seconds ago when he denied being an opportunist, and now he was asking for a favour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, as she was already used to his attitude, she wasn&#8217;t at all surprised. She then smilingly replied, &#8220;Oh? I wonder what it is that brought you to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Gu Changge heaved a sigh. &#8220;If it weren&#8217;t out of my capabilities, I wouldn&#8217;t have trouble you, Saintess Zijin. Now, do you still remember the man in black that attempted to assassinate you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two conversed as they walked away side by side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Jiang Chuchu subconsciously clenched her fists as her face paled. [Wasn&#8217;t Wang Zijin warning me that Gu Changge is no good man? Why is she getting close to him so readily?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That man in black in the Sacred Realm?&#8221; Hearing that, Wang Zijin was clearly taken aback. She unquestionably remembered what happened back then at the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s residence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Does this pertain to the Successor of Demonic Arts?&#8221; She asked as her interest was swiftly piqued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded. &#8220;I tracked down some subtle traces of him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please, Brother Gu.&#8221; Wang Zijin grew serious at Gu Changge&#8217;s sternness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saintess Zijin, have you ever heard of Demonic Heart Manipulation? By certain means, it allows one to control the mind of another,&#8221; Gu Changge stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having heard of such magic in both her lives, Wang Zijin nodded. [Since he&#8217;s saying that, does he suspect someone in Immortal Academy is under the control of the Successor of Demonic Arts?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about it, and I decided that it&#8217;s best that I let this be known to you, since you&#8217;re quite a capable woman,&#8221; Gu Changge claimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Zijin doubtlessly replied, &#8220;Huh, quite an impression of me, Brother Gu.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Changge chuckled. &#8220;Well, I know none of the other Ranked Disciples. Besides, I don&#8217;t trust any of them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At such a rare compliment, Wang Zijin grew rather happy, after which she asked, &#8220;So, Brother Gu, do you have a suspect?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head. &#8220;But it&#8217;s best that we be wary of the other Ranked Disciples.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a contemplating look, Wang Zijin nodded, thinking that Gu Changge must have found something, or he wouldn&#8217;t have said such things. However, his first reaction was to warn her to take caution, and that made her somewhat moved as the apathetic man actually feigned sympathy for the first time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Wang Zijin&#8217;s expression, Gu Changge was pleased as he accomplished his goal. Truth be told, his lengthy speech was solely to smoothen his plans for Sky King Zhi Yang.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, Wang Zijin was one of the Successors of the Mortal Palace, whose words, similar to that of his, carried immense weight among the younger generation. Thus, he spoke to her as a preventive measure, given that she, a fellow transmigrator, possessed more shocking intellect than the rest. In fact, if it weren&#8217;t for her unique mind back in the Immortal Gu Family Residence, Gu Changge would have a much harder time trying to frame Ying Shuang.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some time of conversing, Gu Changge eventually sent Wang Zijin back to Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s cave, but he had no intention of leaving right away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brother Gu, why don&#8217;t you come join us for a bit?&#8221; Staring at Gu Changge, Wang Zijin invited out of curiosity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is Saintess Chuchu not in?&#8221; Gu Changge asked, seemingly surprised.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At such a time, of course she is.&#8221; Wang Zijin laughed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nevermind, then. I&#8217;ll visit you again some other time.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head, and without tarrying any longer, he turned into a divine rainbow and left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the cave, Jiang Chuchu was cultivating as she was sitting on a shiny jade bed of three metres, but she could still clearly hear the voices outside, especially the conversation between Gu Changge and Wang Zijin, not one word of which she missed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He knows I am here. Is that why he decided not to come in?] Upon Gu Changge&#8217;s rejection, gloom and disaffection flashed across her eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, she was always resentful and indifferent towards Gu Changge, and the thought of seeing his face angered her. Nonetheless, now that Gu Changge no longer wished to see her, evading her every time he could, she was deeply dejected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â€¦</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the blink of an eye, numerous days had passed. Things had grown rather harmonious as there was no news regarding the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As there were only seven days remaining until the first trial of the Immortal Academy, every disciple, from Ranked Disciples to Outer Disciples, were giving everything they had into their training, and they would attend the lectures of their Elders, study the legacies of experts in the Sacred Emperor Realm, and experience the scriptures from those in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm, hence undergoing massive boost in their cultivation level.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Zoom!* All of a sudden, dense energy and vibrant lights were shot into the sky from a region of palaces within the depths, followed by the occurrence of a terrifying Golden Dharma Body, as if it was a god that existed before time. Covering the skies, the aura was vast and thick, resembling a golden sun that illuminated the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the disciples and Elders of the Immortal Academy were startled as they peered towards the region in stupefaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a Mystic Mountain covered in crimson mists, the Phoenix Lady appeared. She too turned to the region of palaces and furrowed her brows. &#8220;Prince Shen is being so conspicuous?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, many young prodigies hurried to the sky and gazed at the region as they were unable to calm down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is Prince Shen&#8217;s aura. I heard that he was cultivating an ancient technique. Has he perhaps succeeded?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This power must exceed that of the Sacred Realm. How frightening! He is indeed the Ancient Monstrosity with the Blood of God!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is said that Prince Shen is highly valued by an ancient expert, who intends to protect him. It is said that the ancient being has gone beyond the Sacred Emperor Realm, and is even considered to be someone in the Nirvana Realm!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sheesh! Even if that expert has not gained enough enlightenment, he is still someone at least in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm. How terrifying! To think that Immortal Academy harbours such an ancient monstrocityâ€¦&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, many disciples were dumbfounded as they were reminded of the recent news, peering in that direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surge of power persisted for a long while before slowly fading.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Prince Shen, you are no rival of mine.&#8221; In a bronze palace, a man in silver with a concealed face saw the occurrence and gently shook his head. &#8220;In this world, only Gu Changge is worthy of rivalling me. I do hope that all of you will surprise me during the trial.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* As he was speaking, the figure of an ambiguous, massive world containing giant mystic mountains and heavenly woods. Amid, there was a gigantic tree as high as the sky, whose roots spread towards all cardinal points, while stars and Chaos Energy were ringing around it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in a huge, ancient pavilion, an unremarkable man with ordinary features was staring at the numerous archives before him in dismay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The epoch I belong to was buried in the River of Time and is regarded as the Forbidden Epoch. Its name is nowhere to be found, and no one dared to even mention itâ€¦ What happened back then is unknownâ€¦ Obliteration of worlds, annihilation of civilisations, ruination of the Great Dao, destruction of orderâ€¦ Why? Why has it come to this?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man speaking was none other than Qin Wuya, who came out of the Wondrous Stone. Lately, after being taken by the Elders, he was thoroughly interrogated for innumerable matters. Having thought of a way to deal with that, he pretended to be clueless without revealing his true identity, hence drawing no suspicion onto himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, he requested to study relevant archives to get to know about the current era, to which the Elders granted. Alas, despite the countless ancient archives he went through, he failed to find any records pertaining to the epoch he belonged to as any slight record about the epoch was erased by an enigmatic, terrorizing force that was absolutely spine-chilling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, he thought he only spent centuries in the Wondrous Stone while his Sect, mentors, partner, and Juniors were still alive, awaiting his return. Nevertheless, his accidental venture into Nine Realms took more than centuries. Then, with the assistance of the woman in white named Xing Zu, he roughly got the gist of it. As such, as if he was struck by lightning, he was immediately stunned, drowning in disbelief for half a day.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it that happened back then that turned everything this way? How long has it been since I left? No one seems to have an answerâ€¦&#8221; Frantic with bitterness, Qin Wuya felt as though the gods were fooling around with him, allowing him to enter Nine Realms and thereby fulfilling a dream countless cultivators craved for, only to pop it like a bubble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will discover the truth about the past, and find my Sect and my Eldersâ€¦ If they no longer live, then I shall avenge them!&#8221; Swiftly, Qin Wuya recovered from the impact and regained his composure, clenching his fists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He possessed the means to achieve what he said, given that he trained for three hundred years in Nine Realms, making his mind extremely sturdier than a normal person. Thereupon, it didn&#8217;t take much time for him to calm himself down and realise what he must do next. The truth, the revenge must be actualised by himself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Qin Wuya got up and left the ancient pavilion, intending to learn about the new, glaring era of prosperity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before he could venture far, he encountered a dazed and exhilarated man in purple between hills with glowing mists. The man in purple seemed to have been waiting for him, but for some reason, he detected a familiar sensation from him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Qin Wuya questioned with a glower. As he had learned the tongue of the era, communication was no longer an obstacle. Subconsciously, he treated the man in purple as a young prodigy who came to challenge him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sâ€”Senior Wuyaâ€¦&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, Qin Wuya&#8217;s body shook as he widened his eyes in dismay with how the man in purple addressed him by &#8216;Senior Wuya.&#8217;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Senior Wuya? For how long have I missed that titleâ€¦ No one else except my Juniors in Borderless Sect would call me that. I&#8217;ve never disclosed my identity to anyone, so none should know my name. Is he perhapsâ€¦]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, Qin Wuya&#8217;s voice was shaking in excitement, yet he was somewhat incredulous as he feared that it was merely an illusion. &#8220;Yâ€”You areâ€¦&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senior Wuya, it&#8217;s me, Yang!&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s voice was also trembling as he had never felt such uncontrollable thrill and surprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not actually expect the man to be his missing senior. Qin Wuya&#8217;s face, as ever, was unchanged despite the years that had passed. Still, it was quite unusual for Sky King Zhi Ying to reunite with his long lost senior of Borderless Sect in such a way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yangâ€¦ It&#8217;s really you, Yang? Bless the gods! I never expected to be able to meet you again!&#8221; Unable to control his emotions, as his eyes reddened, Qin Wuya hastily dashed forward and held Sky King Zhi Yang, checking how he was doing. And he was still the same old Zhi Yang, the naughty but kind Junior who was in love with another Junior.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yang, what has happened all these years? Where&#8217;s our Sect? Where are our Elders?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the excited duo reminisced, they gradually calmed down. After confirming each others&#8217; identity, they were thrilled and happy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Qin Wuya asked about something that concerned him the most.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, upon the question, Sky King Zhi Yang was obviously distraught as his face paled, and he hastily answered, &#8220;Be cautious, Senior Wuya. Some things are not to be spoken mindlessly, not even written down as a note or letterâ€¦&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Qin Wuya grew silent as he remembered the ancient archives he looked into suggested the same. There were innumerable terrors in the world, and some things that were labelled forbidden were not to be mentioned at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But rest assured, Senior Wuya, I will tell you everything else except that,&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang continued after heaving a sigh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From what I know, besides me, Dao Xian, too, has successfully reincarnated. If I am right, the Elders and seniors we know should also have reincarnatedâ€¦ So, Senior Wuya, don&#8217;t worry about it. I am sure we will reunite once again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relieved by the news, Qin Wuya revealed a comforted smile. He then asked, &#8220;You said Dao Xian has also reincarnated? Well, where is she? Why don&#8217;t I see her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;About thatâ€¦&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang grew speechless, and after a moment of contemplation, he stated, &#8220;Dao Xian&#8217;s current state is rather weird. It seems she has yet to remember the past.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She has yet to remember?&#8221; Qin Wuya was taken aback, after which he smilingly replied, &#8220;Nevermind, we will wait until she remembers everything. We can even assist her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senior Wuya, am I relieved to hear that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? What&#8217;s that sound?&#8221; All of a sudden, Qin Wuya scowled as he sensed a major disturbance nearby, followed by a number of agonised screams. The mountains quaked as the nearby hills tremored.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;D*mn! Someone is attacking my men!&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s face drastically changed. Obviously disrupted, he could identify that the screams belonged to his followers. Prior to his encounter with his senior, he instructed his followers to guard the area and keep anyone out to prevent any obtrusion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who dares attack us?&#8221; Qin Wuya furrowed his brows even more tensely. As his body flickered, he appeared high in the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not far away, a young man with a bland face was standing high above with his arms resting behind his back, looking downwards as if he was a young god. Behind him, there was a large number of followers, whose daunting aura also gushed in the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sky King Zhi Yang, get the hell out and face me!&#8221; Saying that, the young man drew his hand. Dense, colourful godly beams resembling a divine artefact and enormous talismans vaguely surged. In the sky, a golden palm resembling that of a god occurred and struck downwards. The palm was gargantuan, filled with irresistible dread and intimidation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Mountains on the land instantaneously collapsed, turned into dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s followers were regarded as prodigies in the Upper Realm, and their formidable strength was sufficient to engulf a nation. Yet, in that instant, they were overwhelmed by fear and hopelessness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thumpâ€¦* As each of them were fighting with their lives, their protective tools, failing to contain the strike, exploded. Compared to the invaders, they were nothing but ants.

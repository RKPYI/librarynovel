      <h4>
        Chapter 127.1: Another Treasure Hunting Rat; Countless Opportunities in
        the Ancient Immortal Continent!!!
      </h4>
      <p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
      <p>
        Mighty cultivators gathered in the depths of the Heavenly Immortal Dao
        Palace where immortal mist covered the sky and splendid treasures came
        to life here and there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Young Supremes rode their unique mounts — some resembled black cows
        covered in scales, and others resembled gigantic Pengs that flew around
        like lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young cultivators from the various heritages rode atop warships and
        flying boats, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless cultivators who were qualified to take part in the expedition
        arrived on the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Once the younger generation enters the Continent, it won’t be our
          responsibility if they live or die. The older generations of the
          aborigines inside the Continent won’t take action, so everyone will
          have to depend on their ability to get their hands on any
          opportunity.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        An Elder appeared in the sky and spread his words to the ears of every
        cultivator by amplifying his voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, all the participants stared at the massive crack in front of
        them with excitement burning in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        They could already see the stretches and mountains of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were majestic mountains with colorful lights and fog covering
        them, and expansive plains that gave rise to fear in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even further away, they could see immortal lights that went up and down,
        runes that appeared and disappeared with a flash, and rays of the Great
        Dao that zoomed in every direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        No wonder it was an Immortal Continent rarely seen even in a million
        years!
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the Elders of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace also appeared
        in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside them was a person who had mountains, rivers, the sun, and the
        moon embroidered on his sleeves, while another wore a purple-gold gown
        that made him resemble an old emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was also an old daoist holding a horsetail whisk in his hand and a
        beautiful woman dressed in cloud-patterned robes.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were mighty existences from the other Dao Heritages. They arrived
        here to guard the entrance of the Ancient Immortal Continent, so as to
        make sure that no aborigines would make it out of the Continent once it
        opened.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The results of the Sikong Family’s divination were correct; the
          Immortal Spirit will appear here this time!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged man with the mountains, rivers, the sun, and the moon on
        his robes couldn’t help but sigh when he looked at the thick fog that
        rumbled through the massive crack.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beautiful woman in cloud-patterned robes couldn’t help but smile
        with pride when she heard his words, and said,
        <b
          >“That’s natural! My Sikong Family’s divination ability is said to be
          able to do anything — it can see through life and death, break yin and
          yang, and even calculate the fate of immortals!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This time, the mighty and the weak are mixed together, so let all
          the juniors pay attention to their surroundings and everyone around
          them, since the successor of the Taboo Inheritance has already
          appeared in the world…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Make sure they aren’t tricked into getting murdered in there.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When they finished speaking, the leaders of the younger generation of
        the various Dao Heritages also appeared on the scene in the form of
        brilliant rays of different colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peng Fei, the Young Master of the Golden-Winged Great Peng Family was
        covered in a golden light that seemed to pour gold in every direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, was
        surrounded by spirits like an ancient emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang of the incomparably mysterious Ancient Immortal Wang
        Family, the Heir of the Immortal Lake…
      </p>
      <p>All of them were mighty Young Supremes with majestic auras!</p>
      <p>
        Divine lights loomed around their figures and brilliant runes flashed in
        their vicinity every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tian Rong was also one of the Young Supremes. As soon as he appeared, he
        swept his knife-like gaze in every direction that made the void tremble
        and almost caused a fire in his surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>Countless cultivators trembled when they felt his gaze.</p>
      <p>
        Although they claimed that the Ancient Immortal Continent was open to
        all from the younger generation, getting the better opportunities was
        nothing more than a pipe dream for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once they enter, they would have to make sure not to cross one of these
        Young Supremes.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Whoosh!]</b></p>
      <p><b>[Whoosh!]</b></p>
      <p><b>[Whoosh!]</b></p>
      <p>
        One after another, divine rays of light flew across the sky as they
        arrived from the rest of the mountains and islands of the Heavenly
        Immortal Dao Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large group of young men and women dressed in gorgeous clothes adorned
        with colorful feathers arrived on top of beasts that resembled
        vermillion birds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one who led the group had a petite figure and delicate but prideful
        features, and she was none other than the Holy Maiden of the Vermillion
        Bird Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not far behind her followed a large group of her followers, and Ye Ling,
        who had disguised himself, was among that group of followers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling felt a burst of emotion in his heart when his gaze fell on the
        majestic islands and immortal mountains. They were inside the Heavenly
        Immortal Dao Palace, indeed. The other heritages he saw in the past
        couldn’t compare to the Palace in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since he had disguised himself and mixed with the others, he wasn’t
        worried about someone figuring out his identity, and that brought great
        peace to his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace is worthy of its status as the hegemon
        of Immeasurable Heaven. What we see right now is probably only the tip
        of the iceberg since there’s no way they are letting us see their true
        roots.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling looked at the crack in space not too far away from him with
        excitement. After all, according to the old turtle in the pendant, the
        Ancient Heavenly Emperor of Reincarnation left an opportunity inside the
        Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once he obtained that opportunity, it wouldn’t be hard for him to raise
        his Cultivation Base and clear himself from the name of the Taboo
        Inheritance’s successor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then, several terrifying rays of light suddenly rushed over from
        the east.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large group of powerful young geniuses rushed over from there. The one
        leading the group was a handsome man with a slender figure; he wore a
        feathered star crown, and the sleeves of his spotless, white robes
        fluttered in the wind to give him an extraordinary appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The large group of followers behind him — including True Disciples of
        the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace — gave off an imposing aura that shook
        their surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>‘Gu Changge…’</p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling’s pupils shrank and flames of hatred burned in his eyes for a
        moment before he reigned everything in.
      </p>
      <p>
        True, he had never seen Gu Changge before, but he could immediately
        recognize the man in front of him as the successor of the Taboo
        Inheritance who pinned all the blame on his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, Ye Ling wasn’t someone who couldn’t control his emotions, so he
        showed no abnormality on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        He understood that he couldn’t let Gu Changge sense anything abnormal
        from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more he looked at Gu Changge, the more he felt that he resembled
        that figure he met that night, and this realization made Ye Ling clench
        his fists.
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, Ye Ling was taken aback by disbelief when he saw Chi Ling walk
        towards Gu Changge with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Brother Changge, I hope you will take care of us during this trip to
          the Ancient Immortal Continent.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling smiled when she saw Gu Changge, and took the initiative to
        greet Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stood on a mountain peak and responded to her with a smile,
        <b>“You are too polite, Lady Chi Ling.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him stood a group of his followers, as well as the True Disciples
        of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, including Yin Mei, Jin Zhou, and
        the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of them were mighty Young Supremes who had already reached the
        Conferred King Realm, and all of them were commanded to follow Gu
        Changge’s lead on this expedition.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, Gu Changge swept a glance at the followers behind Chi Ling.
        Before long, his gaze momentarily stopped on a man with a handsome face,
        and he showed a meaningful smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could naturally tell that Ye Ling would mix in with her followers and
        sneak in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling’s method of disguise was amazing, indeed, since it could even
        cover up his origin using the Power of Reincarnation, but it couldn’t
        help him hide from Gu Changge’s perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, how could Ye Ling hide the dazzling Fortune bursting from his
        body which Gu Changge could view through the System?
      </p>
      <p>He had around five thousand points of Fortune Value.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge couldn’t help but envy him.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, he made sure not to show any strangeness on his face as he
        calmly swept his gaze around without letting anyone know that he was
        specifically looking for someone.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Ye Ling wasn’t braindead, then he must have already figured out that
        the one who framed him was none other than him.
      </p>
      <p>But what could he do even if he knew that?</p>
      <p>Was he going to expose himself just to expose him?</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge merely sneered in his heart at that thought and ignored it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it weren’t for Ye Ling’s role as his scapegoat, he would have already
        killed Ye Ling.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more? He was looking forward to using Ye Ling as one of his
        treasure-hunting rats, since he was a Favored Son of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Favored Son of Heaven he met in the Lower Realm helped him enter the
        core region of the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm without facing any
        obstruction, so Ye Ling must also help him clear his path.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 127.2: Another Treasure Hunting Rat; Countless Opportunities in
        the Ancient Immortal Continent!
      </h4>
      <p>‘Could it be that Gu Changge noticed me already?’</p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling’s heart tightened when he noticed Gu Changge’s gaze, and he
        worried that Gu Changge might have noticed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the fact that Gu Changge only swept his glance around and then
        looked away calmed him down.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Fortunately, I told Chi Ling to not reveal my existence before coming
        here, or I might have found myself in great danger! It’s as if I am
        walking on a thin layer of ice…’
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling cursed Gu Changge in his heart.</p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, he glanced at Chi Ling, who was chatting with Gu Changge,
        and felt uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It seems that I must remind Chi Ling to not be deceived by Gu Changge;
        that guy is very likely to be the evil successor of the Taboo
        Inheritance.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling glanced around and soon found Yin Mei, who wore a red dress and
        stood among the other True Disciples with a haggard appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It seems that Yin Mei couldn’t handle the news regarding Bai Lie’s
        death. She mustn’t know that all of this was done by Gu Changge, so I
        must find an opportunity to give her a reminder.’
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling still held some feelings for the charming Yin Mei.</p>
      <p>
        What’s more? He heard that Bai Lie was killed after he went to see Yin
        Mei that night, so he hoped that Yin Mei would be able to prove as a
        witness that he wasn’t the successor of the Taboo Inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a time when Ye Ling entertained the thought of taking care of
        his lovely sister-in-law once Bai Lie died in some ditch…what he never
        expected was that his thoughts would turn into reality one day.
      </p>
      <p>
        [TL/N: this dumbf!ck learned nothing from his bruh’s demise and is
        trying to follow his steps.]
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Right then, innumerable rays of radiant light erupted from the crack and
        spread in every direction; it was as if someone tore open a barrier in
        space, and the terrifying winds that resulted from it desired to tear
        people apart!
      </p>
      <p><b>“The Ancient Immortal Continent is open!”</b></p>
      <p>
        An Elder shouted, and his extremely loud voice spread in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different thoughts crossed the minds of the various Young Supremes
        present on the scene as they watched the crack in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong, too, watched the massive fluctuations in space from
        another direction as she stood on top of a mountain with an indifferent
        and prideful expression. Her gorgeous hair fluttered with the wind, and
        her robes accentuated her beauty; behind her stood a group of people
        from the Supreme Immortal Dynasty.
      </p>
      <p>
        She momentarily glanced at Gu Changge from a distance and then withdrew
        her gaze. To enter the Ancient Immortal Continent, one had to join a
        group formed by the disciples of their Dao Heritage, so she didn’t
        follow Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason she separated from Gu Changge was that she worried that
        if she went with Gu Changge, then she won’t be able to get her hands on
        any good opportunities as he would steal them all — just thinking about
        that enraged her.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge also saw Yue Mingkong and smiled at her.</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong met his gaze with a snort and looked away.</p>
      <p>
        The vigilance in the hearts of the Young Supremes rose when they noticed
        the minor exchange between the two of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, everyone in the outside world was on friendly terms so it was
        all good and well, but once they stepped foot on the Ancient Immortal
        Continent, no one would give face to anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge alone gave them a headache, so if he joined forces with Yue
        Mingkong, then they will suffer an even greater loss, unless they joined
        forces against them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It’s fine if Yue Mingkong doesn’t want to go with me; I will let her
        get some opportunities this time.’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge thought with a faint smile.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, he understood that Yue Mingkong avoided him because she
        feared that he would steal all of her opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s just that he only cared about the Immortal Spirit and Ye Ling’s
        inheritance, and the rest didn’t hold any allure to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the inheritance of the Ancient Heavenly Emperor of
        Reincarnation dealt with the Dao of Reincarnation, which was based on
        the supreme Dao of Time, and that filled Gu Changge’s heart with desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge sent a voice transmission to Yin Mei and gave
        her some commands to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now, he saw Ye Ling secretly look at Yin Mei, so he reckoned that
        he would need Yin Mei’s help if he wanted to keep track of Ye Ling’s
        whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>After all, Ye Ling didn’t know that Yin Mei worked for him.</p>
      <p>
        After that, Gu Changge looked towards the east and saw a cold and
        arrogant girl standing there. The youthful girl had delicate and
        flawless features, but her expression appeared as frosty as the core of
        a glacier, and a big, red bird sat on her shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although alone, she gave off a sense of cold that prevented anyone from
        approaching her.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Gu Xian’er’s Fortune Value has risen a lot recently! It seems that
        there are also some opportunities hidden for her inside the Ancient
        Immortal Continent. Tsk, tsk, tsk…forget it, I will let her go this
        time; for now, let me cut that leek, Ye Ling, first and then I will
        think about the others…’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge quickly retracted his gaze after taking one look.</p>
      <p>
        After that, he started to think about his plan to follow after entering
        the Ancient Immortal Continent. At that time, he must get himself away
        from the other disciples of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace; sure, he
        was the Palace’s Heir, but that didn’t mean he was their nanny.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of them would have their own opportunities, so Gu Changge no longer
        bothered about them after taking one look at their Fortune Value.
      </p>
      <p>His greatest target was still Ye Ling.</p>
      <p>
        As for the other opportunities? Well, he might plot against someone if
        he encountered a genius with some special physique or talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Gu Changge cared about more than geniuses were actually the
        mausoleums of the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as he could find the corpse of an immortal that still retained
        its essence, he would make a profit that the trash young geniuses could
        never compare to.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Gu Changge was lost in thought, Gu Xian’er glanced at him with
        furrowed brows and a puzzled expression. Just now, she felt as if Gu
        Changge was looking at her, but when she looked at him, she realized
        that it was nothing more than her illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The Ancient Immortal Continent will be my opportunity to surpass Gu
        Changge.’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian’er secretly thought in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        She had spent the last period of time immersed in cultivation, and even
        achieved some breakthroughs, but none of that brought any joy to her
        like before.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge seemed to have forgotten about her, too.</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, she could only spend her time in cultivation, so as to calm
        herself down and prevent Gu Changge from haunting her thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>According to her Master, Gu Changge was now a demon of her heart.</p>
      <p>
        This wasn’t a good sign for Gu Xian’er, but every time the demon of her
        heart inflicted her, she would run to the top of the mountain to have a
        look…and every time, she would return in disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong would visit her every now and then, but Gu Changge never
        bothered to see her even from afar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, many geniuses reached the entrance of the Ancient Immortal
        Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er didn’t stick with that group of people as one, she liked to
        act alone, and two, she could avoid bumping into Gu Changge if there
        were less people around her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because he ignored her, it didn’t mean that she was willing to
        ignore him, too, yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er held complete confidence in the fact that she could protect
        herself inside the Ancient Immortal Continent, and didn’t need the
        protection of the Palace.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, when Gu Xian’er saw Gu Changge enter the crack with everyone
        from the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace, she also turned into a brilliant
        ray of light and rushed into the crack.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dizzy spell assaulted Gu Xian’er as she felt herself walk through a
        barrier between different worlds. On her way to the other side, she
        witnessed and experienced various scenes.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, she landed and the sight in front of her shocked her.</p>
      <p>
        There were small puddles and thick mist formed by the liquefaction of
        incomparably rich Spiritual Qi. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>
        She never imagined that there would exist a place in the world where
        Spiritual Qi would liquefy into a spring!
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for a few poisonous insects and beasts here and there, the place
        resembled a pure land.
      </p>
      <p>
        The place where she ended up turned out to be a magnificent mountain
        range that had no end in sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal energies here were so dense that their essence could be
        seen ascending towards the sky in the form of steam, and she could hear
        the roars of dragons and see extraordinary visions as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more? The Laws of Heaven and Earth made this place even better
        than some of the best cultivation abodes of the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er couldn’t help but finally show her true colors as she said in
        excitement,
        <b
          >“It seems that the Ancient Immortal Continent isn’t different from
          what was recorded in the ancient books! It’s a great place,
          indeed.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, she thought about all the great treasures she could obtain,
        and that compounded her excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The red bird on her shoulder couldn’t help but roll its eyes when it saw
        Gu Xian’er’s wealth-obsessed attitude surface again…it made her seem
        like a poor girl born in some cave.

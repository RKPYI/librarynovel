          >Kun Mountain was shrouded in a thick blanket of fog. Mist swirled
          around in every direction, infused with the lingering energies of the
          recent battles fought by the supreme experts, which could not
          dissipate even after countless years. It was impossible for even the
          most powerful divine sense to breach such dense chaotic
          energies.</span

          >The Ji Family members trailed after Gu Changge as they ventured
          deeper into Kun Mountain. Over the past few days, they didn’t have to
          do much of the fighting as it was Gu Changge who deftly handled the
          obstacles that arose along their path. Though Jiang Chen occasionally
          lent a hand in steering them clear of danger, it was ultimately thanks
          to Gu Changge’s guidance that they could make their way to their
          destination unscathed.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even Ji Chuyue, who harboured a deep fear of Gu Changge, found solace
          in his presence now. With Gu Changge on their side, they felt safe and
          the daunting task of rescuing their Prime Ancestor seemed much more
          manageable. The once tense and cautious group now moved with more ease
          and confidence.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Perhaps we’ll really be able to save our Prime Ancestor…” Hope
          filled Ji Chuyue’s heart as she gazed at Gu Changge.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As they made their way to the destination, Ji Chuyue deliberately
          avoided making eye contact with Jiang Chen. She believed that after
          their encounter in the dungeon, Jiang Chen must have given up on her
          and come to the realisation that seeking revenge against Gu Changge
          was futile. With this in mind, she saw no point in them to speak with
          each other again. Her only wish was for Jiang Chen to survive this and
          let go of his hatred toward Gu Changge, so that he could live a
          peaceful life of his own.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!!* All of a sudden, a thick grey fog appeared
          out of nowhere. The chilling and eerie gusts of wind that accompanied
          it penetrated the souls of those present. In just the blink of an eye,
          the world around them was enveloped in darkness, with the thick fog
          obscuring all traces of light.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What’s this?” The expressions of those from the Ji Family turned
          pale with shock. Even the leading Ancestors, who were usually composed
          and collected, felt a sense of unease creeping over them. The ominous
          grey fog was unlike any they had ever encountered before, and seemed
          to possess an powerful and deadly aura that could engulf them
          entirely.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In an instant, everyone became extremely alert and vigilant. Some
          couldn’t even speak without a quivering voice. After all, they had
          never encountered such a situation in their many years of cultivation.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even the True Daoists were visibly disturbed, their faces turning
          pale and their bodies trembling uncontrollably. They couldn&#8217;t
          shake off the overwhelming feeling that this dense fog had engulfed
          countless lives over countless eras, and the gravity of this
          realisation weighed heavily on them. Though they had once considered
          the rumours of Kun Mountain’s danger to be exaggerated, this eerie
          scene changed their minds, sending shivers down their spines.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Everyone, stay close together and don’t act alone. This must be one
          of the great dangers of Kun Mountain,” the Head of the Ji Family
          instructed while solemnly holding up an enigmatic ancient bronze
          mirror.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The smooth surface of the mirror was shining with a bright light that
          sought to dispel the ominous grey fog. Unfortunately, a sharp hiss cut
          through the air as the mirror began to corrode and fracture at an
          alarming pace. Within moments, it exploded and shattered into
          shimmering powder that scattered across the sky.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The atmosphere in the Ji Family shifted as they laid their eyes on
          the treasure. It was an extremely mysterious artifact that the Head of
          the family had discovered in an ancient ruin many years ago. In some
          respects, it was actually even more powerful than a Dao
          Artifact.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The fact that the grey fog easily tarnished the mirror and caused it
          to shatter with tremendous force showed just how terrifying the fog
          was. The members of the Ji Family gathered together, not daring to
          underestimate the potential danger that the grey fog posed. Despite
          this, there were still many unfortunate souls who were swiftly
          consumed by the fog, unable to utter even a single cry before
          vanishing.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What the hell is that?” The faces of Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue
          contorted in fear too. Initially, they had considered themselves
          fortunate and thought that their journey to Kun Mountain was not as
          frightening as the tales had made it out to be. The appearance of the
          ominous gray fog truly shattered their illusions and gave them a rude
          awakening.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Where is Young Master Changge?” Several members of the Ji Family
          were quick to notice the issue at hand. As soon as the dense fog
          descended, the front was shrouded in it, causing many to lose sight of
          Gu Changge. His absence only added to their growing unease, as Gu
          Changge’s presence had been a source of comfort for them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that even Gu Changge appeared to have been consumed by the thick
          fog, the remaining members of the Ji Family started panicking. The fog
          was simply too overwhelming and peculiar, leaving them with a bad
          feeling that they would be consumed and killed within it too.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Young Master Changge should be fine. This grey fog shouldn’t last
          long and will dissipate soon.” Ji Hao, the Head of the Ji Family,
          furrowed his brow with concern, yet tried his best to calm everyone
          down.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Young Master Gu’s remarkable strength surpasses our imagination. If
          even he is unable to do anything about the fog, then there is little
          we can do but patiently wait for it to dissipate. Perhaps we’ll be
          able to see him soon,” an Ancestor of the Ji Family spoke in a deep
          voice.</span

          >A small bronze cauldron hovered above his head, bobbing up and down,
          while Divine Chains made from Principles dangled down from it,
          attempting to repel the grey fog. Unfortunately, the same hissing
          sounds were heard before it also quickly disintegrated, unable to
          withstand the fog. The sight only intensified the fear in everyone’s
          heart, causing them to spiral into even greater panic.</span

          >&lt;This phenomenon does not seem to be natural in Kun Mountain, but
          rather it seems to have manifested out of nowhere. I believe that it
          was intentionally created by someone. It’s even possible that it’s
          caused by Gu Changge, who have disappeared…&gt;

          behind Ji Chuyue and the others, but he didn’t expect to hear this
          explanation from the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of
          Creation.</span

          Changge thinking?” Jiang Chen’s back was drenched in cold sweat. He
          felt a shiver down his spine and felt his scalp crawl as he wondered
          about Gu Changge&#8217;s intention in creating this fog. [Is he trying
          to conceal something or kill someone amidst the ensuing chaos?]</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen’s face paled as his mind raced with a sudden realisation.
          He started scanning his surroundings fearfully, but the thick grey fog
          made it impossible to see anything clearly, even True Daoists didn’t
          dare to act recklessly.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          others, An Xi, the Young War Immortal, Niu Tian and other cultivators
          from the An Clan and War Immortal Mansion marched on, occasionally
          looking up to gauge the remaining distance.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I stumbled upon quite a number of precious rocks and even managed to
          gather a few rare magical herbs rumoured to be stained by the blood of
          the Immortal King. This has truly been a fruitful expedition.” An
          Wangshan, An Xi’s Grand Uncle, smiled while stroking his beard as he
          conversed with another True Daoist from the War Immortal
          Mansion.</span

          >Their relationship was flourishing as they joined forces and ventured
          into Kun Mountain together, offering each other invaluable support and
          gaining numerous opportunities along the way. The positive experience

          Daoist from the War Immortal Mansion nodded with a smile, unable to

          the air. Despite the distance, the footsteps felt unnervingly close,

          Immortal, and Niu Tian were taken aback. He stood there in silence,
          clad in pristine white that blended seamlessly with the world around

          in Dark Kun City, he was relatively safe due to the presence of many

          dispose of their corpses without a trace.

          supreme treasures like heavenly blades, divine swords, ancient lamps,
          and green cauldrons appeared, radiating a resplendent glow that

          Sword Qi. They were reduced into a blood mist, both their physical
          bodies and souls destroyed. It was a horrifying display of power,

          fight.

          world, a divine furnace materialised and rushed out from the top of
          his head. Like an ancient mythical beast, it charged towards Gu

          transformed into a dazzling golden light and flew toward Gu Changge
          from another direction. His speed was beyond words, and with a supreme
          fist technique, he charged at Gu Changge like a god of war descending
          upon the mortal realm.

          remained calm as he stepped forward. As his opponent’s fists descended
          upon him, he lifted his hand and reached forward. What seemed like an
          entire universe was materialising before him, its supreme aura
          radiating from his very being, accompanied by a thunderous and
          awe-inspiring force. The stars themselves seemed to orbit around him,
          crushing and eradicating the six ancient pillars.</span

          Sword Qi in another direction, imbued with the ultimate principle of
          world destruction. A jet-black beam of light ripped through the air,
          materialising into a fearsome dragon of destruction that soared into
          the sky in a flash.</span

          his arsenal of magic weapons and defensive techniques, none could
          withstand the devastating attack that pierced through them all. Even
          in death, his eyes remained open. The sword-like beam that was less
          than an inch long left a gruesome hole between his brows. In the next
          moment, thousands of sword glows erupted from within his body.</span

          wounds, causing him to disintegrate. There was no trace of him being
          left behind, as both his body and soul were completely obliterated.
          Even in his final moments, he couldn’t even take out his Dao Artifact
          and his soul was forever buried.</span

          is not bad.” Gu Changge nodded slightly in approval, not paying any
          attention to the terrified gazes from those around him. He had just
          tested the power of the Deathbringer Sword Technique and he was not
          disappointed since he was able to easily slay a True Daoist under one
          second.</span

          with intense fear. None of them expected their Ancestor to be killed

          left them feeling utterly hopeless and defeated.</span

          and cough up blood.

          releasing black and yellow aura. Its imperial might was so immense

          none other than An Wangshan&#8217;s Dao Artifact.

          pressed down upon the area. The blue cauldron vibrated violently
          before being sent flying by a terrifying force. The impact of the
          crash left fractures all over its surface. The shockwave of the strike
          devastated the surroundings, reducing mountains to ashes and leaving a
          trail of destruction in its wake.</span

          naturally causing him to sustain severe damage.</span

          Wangshan’s desperation overtook his sense of pride and he fell to his
          knees, pleading for mercy. It was during their confrontation that he
          fully grasped the futility of his situation, realising that he had no
          chance of resisting Gu Changge’s power.

          graceful wave of his sleeves, he unleashed a terrifying aura, causing
          a thick mist to envelop the area. An Wangshan and An Xi immediately
          vanished before they could even scream, leaving nothing but dust in

          his group, fear consumed him entirely. His hair was in disarray, and
          his appearance was pitiable. He looked nothing like the young prodigy
          he once was as he screamed, desperate to survive. “Gu Changge, even if
          you kill us, your secret will come to light sooner or later unless you
          could eliminate every soul in the Upper Realm! I have already informed
          my Master that in the event of my demise, he must release the

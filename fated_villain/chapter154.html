      <h4>
        Chapter 154: Although His Heart Is A Million Shades Dark, It Is Not As
        Indifferent As I Once Thought.
      </h4>
      <p>Yin Mei could not believe it.</p>
      <p>She thought she was going to die just now.</p>
      <p>
        After all, she was going up against existences in both the Heavenly God
        Realm and the God King Realm all the while gravely injured, not to
        mention that she had already exhausted most of her life-saving
        treasures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei could choose to be humiliated, but her death was set in stone.
        So what was there to do? T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com
      </p>
      <p>She was merely Gu Changge‚Äôs sacrificial pawn in the first place.</p>
      <p>
        Since her value was exhausted, there was naturally no need for such a
        pawn to exist anymore.
      </p>
      <p>No one would take the time to care about her life and death.</p>
      <p>However...</p>
      <p>
        The moment she witnessed that familiar falling sword light, her mind
        blanked as an overwhelming buzzing threw her thoughts into disarray. She
        half-believed she was having a dream. A hallucination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei really didn‚Äôt expect the always indifferent Gu Changge to show
        up and save her.
      </p>
      <p>The scene felt unbelievable to the point of impossibility.</p>
      <p>
        Her first reaction upon seeing the sight in front of her was thinking
        that she had went insane.
      </p>
      <p>But a hallucination from an addled mind could never be so vivid.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge‚Äôs breath was all too familiar to her.</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei was so happy that she became unable to restrain herself,
        throwing herself into Gu Changge‚Äôs arms without even first considering
        the consequences.
      </p>
      <p>Shiny tears dripped down her pale face.</p>
      <p>
        She was truly touched. From despair to hope, and from life to death, one
        can only understand this kind of situation after experiencing it
        personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, Gu Changge‚Äôs strength is terrifying. Even if the opponent
        is a God King cultivator, she believed nothing bad would come to pass.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as Gu Changge showed up, it meant that all danger would simply
        cease to exist.
      </p>
      <p>This made Yin Mei feel extremely at ease.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúWhat are you thinking about all day? How could I not want you?‚Äù</p>
      <p>Gu Changge patted her fluffy head.</p>
      <p>
        With a faint smile on his face, he let her throw herself into his arms.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, he raised a single hand and slashed out mountainous
        sword energy, mixed with the horrifying dark-gold Gengjin laws as a
        peerless edge rushed out!
      </p>
      <p>Clack!</p>
      <p>
        The dazzling sword intent made a sound as if it had broken free from its
        scabbard.
      </p>
      <p>
        The void was suddenly ripped apart as the inconceivable slash flitted
        through the very fabric of the universe, falling right above the dazed
        God King Realm creature in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄúHow is this possible‚Ä¶?‚Äù His face suddenly paled.</p>
      <p>
        Eyes widened in fright, he tried to avoid it but found the nearby space
        had been locked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sword intent only lightly moved forward, and yet‚Ä¶ it seemed to split
        the whole universe in two!
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
      <p>A ghastly expression of despair appeared on the God King‚Äôs face.</p>
      <p>‚ÄòJust who the hell is this monster!?‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        He was a dignified God King Realm cultivator, renowned among many nearby
        ethnic groups as one of the strongest, an insanely difficult opponent to
        face.
      </p>
      <p>And yet!</p>
      <p>The creature screamed wildly in his heart.</p>
      <p>‚ÄòWho is this young man that appeared from who knows where?‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòHow can he be so strong? Using the power of rules so casually and
        without caring? Moreover, it seems that he even controls the void!‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>The God King was cold all over.</p>
      <p>‚ÄòToo late!‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        He only felt a chilly breeze blow on his neck, before the world around
        him suddenly turned dark.
      </p>
      <p>Puff!</p>
      <p>
        Blood splattered in all directions, as the screech of a blade rang
        across the heavens, smiting the body and soul of the being in God King
        Realm, extinguishing his primordial spirit, and erasing him from the
        world entirely!
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge did not even raise his eyes to take a second look.</p>
      <p>The two pests died with open eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced back at Yin Mei, who was still sobbing softly and
        shook his head. He took a step forward as the void shifted yet again,
        taking them away from this bloody place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, many powerhouses are chasing Ye Ling‚Äôs tracks, so the movement
        here will inevitably attract others to pay a visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding them amidst the scene of a crime would not be conducive to his
        plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, he did not understand why Yin Mei thought that he would simply
        abandon her. She seemed to have a misconception that he treated her as
        merely a sacrificial pawn.
      </p>
      <p>How could he let her die in this dingy spot?</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei, as the Holy Maiden of the Nine-tailed Celestial Fox Family, was
        in charge of the resources he needed for his cultivation. No matter
        whatever aspect you view it from, her being alive was a great benefit
        for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though Gu Changge has been using her and coercing her with her
        life, he was not a person who was extremely indifferent to the point of
        insanity like the previous ‚ÄòGu Changge‚Äô.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not possible to act so indifferently to the life and death of Yin
        Mei, who has been honestly working for him with all her heart to the
        point she almost died for it.
      </p>
      <p>Yin Mei truly thought too badly of him.</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòThough this Gu admits to having a blackened heart, it‚Äôs not so black
        that I would do such a thing as discard my own pawns willy-nilly.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge oddly felt that he should be slightly nicer to Yin Mei in the
        future, lest a situation like this occurs again, causing her to look as
        if all hope was lost and her death was imminent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge took Yin Mei and left the mountain. On the way, he
        casually took down a few masters of the Ancient Serpent Clan who noticed
        the bloodstained battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        At last, he and Yin Mei stopped at the mouth of a relatively remote and
        quiet underground cave, bristling with strong spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>The sound of dripping water tickled the senses.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúMaster...‚Äù</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Yin Mei had also calmed down as she left Gu Changge‚Äôs
        embrace, still blushing.
      </p>
      <p>She was a little embarrassed to look up at Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>Her actions today were a little overboard, in all honesty.</p>
      <p>
        She jumped directly on him without even obtaining his permission first.
      </p>
      <p>Yet Gu Changge didn‚Äôt even blame her for this.</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúThis period of time has caused you much suffering.‚Äù Gu Changge smiled,
        before leading the way further into the cave, fully intending to find a
        place to stay and rest.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄúFor the Master‚Äôs mission, this is nothing.‚Äù</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei shook her head at the words. Her nose was a bit sour as she
        became emotional.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this sentence, the grievances and injuries she suffered during this
        time suddenly became far less important.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, she abided by Gu Changge because he held her life in
        the palm of his hand. But since then, she gradually accepted her fate
        and realized that there was nothing wrong with following him, slowly
        changing her mentality towards him.
      </p>
      <p>
        And once it had arisen, this feeling quickly snowballed, becoming more
        and more difficult to reverse.
      </p>
      <p>She found herself sinking deeper and deeper instead.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge‚Äôs mind is vicious, his methods cruel, and his character
        indifferent and unfeeling, having all sorts of bad qualities
        characteristic of a great villain.
      </p>
      <p>
        But a Gu Changge like this also made her feel complicated inside, to a
        level where she was willing to do anything for him‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that ‚Äòthat‚Äô same villainous Gu Changge was asking about her
        wellbeing with concern, Yin Mei trembled with joy at the unprecedented
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>Even if this was probably just a random question from Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>Even if it was a throwaway question not from the heart.</p>
      <p>
        It still made Yin Mei very happy, feeling as if the injuries and
        suffering she had gone through for so many days were worth it in the
        end.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be cared about, to be praised... it lets her know that she is still
        useful to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei‚Äôs emotions spiralled fast as her heart filled with affection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge chuckled inwardly. Obviously, as meticulous and observant as
        he is, Gu Changge knew and understood Yin Mei‚Äôs current mental state.
        Appeasing her and levelling up her affection towards him was a piece of
        cake when taking everything into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>Roar!</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, deep in the cave, ferocious scarlet eyes like burning
        lanterns appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        A beast shaped like a dragon-tortoise roared and rushed forward, ready
        to feast on the two uninvited guests who had broken into its territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at it, before flicking a finger, distorting the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        It eerily rippled in front of him like a murky mirror, as if it
        contained a maze with endless layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fear of the beast stunned it. Its movement immediately halted, right
        until the moment it was smashed into ashes by the power of the void,
        dissipating into nothingness with a loud bang.
      </p>
      <p>Yin Mei was stunned into silence but didn‚Äôt think much about it.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the breath of Gu Changge, his strength was indeed far from
        what she could comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was afraid that, with the sole exception of Gu Changge himself, no
        one else can truly understand the depths of his unfathomable might.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs rest here.‚Äù Gu Changge stated, easily cleaning out the cave.</p>
      <p>Yin Mei‚Äôs injuries were grave.</p>
      <p>She needed to take care of herself and rest for a while.</p>
      <p>
        Then‚Ä¶ she needs to suffer again. Unfortunately for her, for the purposes
        of Ye Ling‚Äôs downfall, Yin Mei is irreplaceable.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge soon took out a variety of magical medicinal pills.</p>
      <p>
        The Supreme Amethyst Order of the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect was in his
        hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, he was by no means short of medicinal pills and the like and
        can get as many as he wants.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, he casually took out a few of each.</p>
      <p>
        The dense pill fragrance wafted through the air, ever so enchanting,
        lingering here and there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pills of all functions were present. From nourishing the primordial
        spirit, restoring the body and limbs, and even those that specialize in
        stabilizing the Sea of Consciousness‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about anything. Let‚Äôs take care of the injury first.‚Äù Gu
        Changge said with a slight smile.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄúThank you, Master.‚Äù</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei said no more than was necessary and simply took a few of the
        medicinal pills that worked best on her injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, the various panaceas and medicines on her body had
        already run dry. Her injuries would not have dragged on for so long if
        not for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei, who had swallowed the elixir, soon began to meditate in a lotus
        position. The Holy Maiden had lost most of the sexual allure she usually
        exuded, her charming and moving features instead smoothing into a pure
        and peaceful stillness.
      </p>
      <p>Cold sweat beaded her clean and pale face.</p>
      <p>Hum!</p>
      <p>
        A hazy rune appeared on her body, while nine fluffy, snow-white foxtails
        shimmered with lustre.
      </p>
      <p>Her injuries were gradually improving.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge took a peek and nodded in acknowledgement before his figure
        left the cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple words are meaningless. At times like these, actions speak louder
        than words.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meditating Yin Mei almost instantly noticed the disappearance of Gu
        Changge‚Äôs familiar aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        She opened her previously closed eyes, looking at the empty karst cave
        with hints of disappointment and reluctance, her drooping ears clearly
        displaying her saddened mood like an abandoned puppy.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she quickly shook herself out of it, discarding the strange
        emotion.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòWhat am I thinking?‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just a pawn, just a replaceable toy. It was enough that Master even
        came to my assistance.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòWhat did I... still hope for?‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        Of course, although Yin Mei comforted herself like this ‚Äì deep down ‚Äì
        she felt a bit lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was inevitable that she would feel a bit of self-pity thanks to her
        current state.
      </p>
      <p>In a blink of an eye, the sky outside turned dark.</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei withdrew from the state of recuperation, mostly healed.
        Naturally, the medicinal pills given by Gu Changge were more than
        enough, and their healing effect was of excellent quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lone fox girl glanced at the night outside that gradually grew
        darker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her expression showed a hint of regret as if she was expecting
        something. Unfortunately, it was only a wishful thought, an anticipation
        that would dissipate without ever achieving fruition.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge saved her, and then he left.</p>
      <p>Simple as that.</p>
      <p>As she thought of this, Yin Mei created a bonfire.</p>
      <p>But the heat could not reach her, it was still cold.</p>
      <p>
        Ruby-like eyes shone melancholically as they quietly stared at the
        bonfire, almost as if they could see a certain person‚Äôs imposing figure
        within the bright and dancing flames.
      </p>
      <p>If only‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        At that moment, Yin Mei‚Äôs ears moved slightly, hearing footsteps from
        outside the cave.
      </p>
      <p>She turned to look.</p>
      <p>
        Some clean fruits and melons in one hand, and a green lotus leaf to hold
        water in the other. The shadow of a figure walked in leisurely from the
        entrance of the cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        The slight firelight fell upon a familiar face, as Yin Mei‚Äôs heart
        pounded in her chest.
      </p>
      <p>It turned out that Gu Changge did not leave.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúMaster...‚Äù</p>
      <p>Gu Changge had a slight smile on his face, ‚ÄúHow is your injury?‚Äù</p>
      <p>A bonfire danced freely between them.</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei propped her head up, tilting her pale and tiny face to stare at
        the bonfire. Her chin rested on her knees, as the embers of a raging
        fire were reflected within her beautiful, watery eyes.
      </p>
      <p>She looked at him in amazement, surprise overflowing in her eyes.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge walked over and handed her the fruits and water.</p>
      <p>‚ÄúAre you hungry?‚Äù</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúI solved some troubles while I was gone.‚Äù Gu Changge casually spoke
        once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed as if he was explaining to Yin Mei why he left so suddenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it did not matter what trouble he solved or what people he
        had killed, the important thing was that he did not plan to leave her
        here.
      </p>
      <p>That alone was enough for Yin Mei.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge handled the situation very well, knowing how to comfort the
        injured Yin Mei, and he also knew the best way to soothe her resentment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing his gentle words, Yin Mei took the melons and fruits that
        Gu Changge specially washed for her as she felt even more touched.
      </p>
      <p>Her previous speculations and assumptions vanished with the wind.</p>
      <p>
        When she was injured, Gu Changge did not choose to leave but instead
        stayed to take care of her. Yin Mei felt as if she had imagined him as
        too uncaring before this. Gu Changge was not as cold or indifferent as
        she once thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing that the desired effect had been achieved, Gu Changge couldn‚Äôt
        help but smile in his heart, though the expression on his face did not
        change at all.
      </p>
      <p>Yin Mei did actually help him a lot.</p>
      <p>And he was in control of Yin Mei‚Äôs life.</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei did things for him, so he lets Yin Mei live, making for an
        equivalent transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if Gu Changge doesn‚Äôt do anything, Yin Mei didn‚Äôt have ill
        intentions toward him.
      </p>
      <p>But this was much more interesting.</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúMaster, the gap between Chi Ling and Ye Ling has been created. If my
        guess is correct, Chi Ling should leave this place soon.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        While eating the spirit fruit, Yin Mei slowed her breathing and softly
        reported the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded with an unrestrained smile, and even told her a bit
        about his plan, ‚ÄúThat is good news, but Ye Ling can‚Äôt die yet.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>With the relationship between Ye Ling and Chi Ling broken‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>[Ding!]</p>
      <p>He took note of a familiar prompt.</p>
      <p>
        In any case, Chi Ling had the Vermillion Bird Clan, and she could be
        regarded as Ye Ling‚Äôs backbone and primary source of support in the
        Immortal Ancient Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        To rupture this relationship, Gu Changge needed to put in only the most
        insignificant of effort, and yet the rewards were quite sizable.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúIndeed, I believe that Master still needs Ye Ling to continue helping
        you by carrying the black pot.‚Äù Yin Mei also nodded in agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was true. No matter what, Ye Ling was still the successor of an
        Ancient Deity, so the force he hides and conceals behind his back will
        not be small.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Ancient Deity was an existence that was infinitely close to True
        Immortals‚Äîperhaps even surpassing True Immortals‚Äîsince ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
        One that did not leave any lineages or clans, but instead left all his
        inheritance to the future successor.
      </p>
      <p>
        How profound was this opportunity? It can be said that even those
        supreme Daoists and great immortal sects will be moved to action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei‚Äôs careful observation of Ye Ling during this time was not
        wasted, and she recognized the abnormality of his actions and situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The successor of the Ancient Deity didn‚Äôt dare to reveal the Inheritance
        he had, so he had to swallow his anger and bite the bullet for Gu
        Changge, even if he was unwilling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, Gu Changge‚Äôs plan could be described as vicious and seamless. It
        will be difficult for any individual to find flaws in it for at least a
        good while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Ye Ling himself would cooperate and hide his origins, even if
        cultivators all over the world insulted and chased him like a mouse
        crossing the street.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòIn the end, this pot-bearing leek escapes unharmed anyway.‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        In fact, in terms of taking the blame for Gu Changge, there was none
        quite like Ye Ling.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúYe Ling‚Äôs worth in being alive is greater than his worth in being dead.
        I‚Äôm still waiting for him to help me find the Immortal Cave of the
        Ancient Deity of Reincarnation.‚Äù Gu Changge smiled lightly.
      </p>
      <p>The words did not take Ye Ling‚Äôs life and death to heart.</p>
      <p>
        With his current strength, killing Ye Ling was actually an incredibly
        simple matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what‚Äôs the use of a so-called Favored Son of Heaven if you didn‚Äôt
        squeeze out every single drop of value step-by-step?
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, master. As long as you still need it, Yin Mei will
        definitely try her best to help you.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei spoke with a serious face, looking at Gu Changge with eyes like
        glazed, blood-coloured gems.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a relief.‚Äù</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled, reached out, and took her into his arms as he patted
        her fluffy head, ‚ÄúUnfortunately, I would have you suffer yet again. Can
        you accept that?‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        He was still thinking about how to let Yin Mei continue hiding beside Ye
        Ling for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that she herself spoke first, it spared Gu Changge the effort to
        come up with a line for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúIf Master commands it, there is nothing that I can‚Äôt accept.‚Äù Yin Mei
        said so with a serious tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a statement that came straight from her heart, without the
        slightest hint of falsehood.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúWhat a pitiful girl...‚Äù Gu Changge looked at her and sighed softly.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she heard this, Yin Mei looked at him with anticipation and a
        little shyness, her watery eyes shining with unspoken emotions.
      </p>
      <p>A great villain like Gu Changge naturally knew what to do.</p>
      <p>
        The nine, snow-white tails of the Heavenly Fox Clan curled around them,
        forming a sealed cocoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, a deluge of heart-tugging noises rang out from the fluffy
        cell, filling the tiny cave with a sense of aromatic desire.
      </p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>A sleepless night for both.</p>

          of bitter winter, its bone-chilling coldness left everyone trembling
          with fear. Without any instruction from the Young War Immortal, the
          people in the courtyard instinctively reached for their weapons, their

          direction in the once serene courtyard, brandishing their weapons and
          cautiously scanning the surroundings. They were all skilled fighters
          of varying strengths from the War Immortal Manor and the An Clan. Most
          were only in the Sacred and Enlightened King Realms, but the strongest
          had attained the Sacred Lord Realm.</span

          fog, transforming the once vibrant space into a bleak and eerie one.
          Several figures dressed in gray appeared outside the courtyard, their
          cold faces devoid of any human emotion.</span

          material, but they looked sharp and exuded a menacing aura that filled
          the air with a crimson glow. Swathed in a black fabrics that obscured
          their faces, save for their piercing eyes, they exuded a terrifying
          aura that betrayed their true strength—a group of Sacred Lord Realm
          Masters, with even a Sacred King Realm Master among their ranks!</span

          from the various Forces were present. Such a huge commotion would
          undoubtedly draw the attention of these forces. These assassins were
          truly brazen, as their actions were akin to committing a heinous crime
          in public, without any regard for the potential consequences of being
          caught.</span

          possibly offended someone enough to warrant such an extreme response.
          It was rare for any organization, even assassin guilds like Pagoda and
          Nether, to have the capacity to coordinate such a large-scale
          attack!</span

          assassins were here to kill them, the person who hired them had really

          have offended someone who could send a group of skilled assassins to
          hunt him down.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Kill them!!” A group of assassins immediately charged toward the
          Young War Immortal and their companions. They surrounded them and
          unleashed a barrage of attacks, utilizing various arts and techniques
          to overwhelm them.</span

          cauldrons, and furnaces, radiating incredible power in every
          direction. In an instant, the experts from both the An Clan and the
          War Immortal Manor either coughed up blood or exploded on the spot.
          The assassins were too powerful for anyone present to challenge them
          without meeting a swift demise.</span

          fiercely, trying to make his voice heard by all in an attempt to alert
          the others. One of the assassins fixed his gaze on him then vanished
          into thin air. When he reappeared, his longsword sliced through the
          air like a streak of black lightning and pierced the man’s forehead,
          killing him instantly!</span

          were filled with terror and quickly took measures to ensure their own
          safety. Chaos erupted within the courtyard as a fierce battle ensued.
          Many were fatally wounded or beheaded. The air was thick with the
          scent of blood, making it difficult to stomach.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The courtyard was shrouded in a black fog, effectively cutting it off
          from the outside world. Breaking this barrier would be challenging
          without the help of a Quasi-Nirvana Realm Master. Those from the An
          Clan and the War Immortal Manor grew increasingly desperate as their
          Ancestors or Elders were not present to assist them.</span

          An Xi’s Grand Uncle, An Wangshan, had also returned home instead of
          staying in Dark Kun City. He was worried about the Ji Family’s
          upcoming invasion of Kun Mountain and wanted to steer clear of any
          potential danger that might befall Dark Kun City.</span

          with a deep sense of bitterness. With a mighty roar, immense divine
          power erupted from the golden crosses in his pupils. His body radiated
          a brilliant blue light as he unleashed a series of secret techniques
          that shook the world. He charged forward like a furnace that would
          burn eternally. His fists crushed everything in his path with
          unmatched force like the divine mountains.

          >&#8220;The might of the Young War Immortal is truly remarkable. It’s
          a pity that you still have to die today,” the Sacred King Realm
          assassin turned his attention to the Young War Immortal and spoke
          coldly as he advanced toward him. With a swift swing of his sword, the
          space was torn asunder. Several experts from the An Clan and War
          Immortal Manor exploded and were reduced to dust. Such was the might
          of a Sacred King Realm expert. Only those of equal cultivation level
          could hope to withstand it.</span

          >“Who have I offended?” The Young War Immortal’s eyes were a little
          bloodshot as he searched his memory. He then recalled the contemptuous
          look on Gu Changge’s face back at the Divine Rock Conference. With
          just that, he could almost conclude that the person who had sent
          assassins after him was someone related to Gu Changge.</span

          >“You can think about it when you’re on your way to hell,” the
          assassin in gray said nonchalantly before unleashing his power again,
          causing his remaining enemies to explode and turn into fine dust. The
          Young War Immortal, at the pinnacle of his power in the Sacred Lord
          Realm, was virtually unbeatable among his peers. Even so, he was no
          match for an assassin in the Sacred King Realm.</span

          deep and bloody wounds. The Young War Immortal let out a fierce roar
          that echoed through the air. Blood suddenly seeped out of the golden
          crosses in his pupils, accompanied by the sound of shackles
          breaking.</span

          feel any pain. He transformed into a peerless War Immortal, capable of
          vanquishing any adversary in his path. With a peerless physique, a
          golden whip materialized in his grip, reminiscent of the legendary
          weapon from ancient lore. He fought the Sacred King Realm assassin
          fearlessly before him, showing no regard for his own mortality.</span

          I have underestimated the Young War Immortal’s capability. Although I
          had sent someone to hinder the True Daoist in their party, the Young
          War Immortal unleashed a peculiar technique and killed our Sacred King
          Realm assassin, ultimately causing our assassination attempt to fail.
          If I had sent more people, perhaps we could have succeeded.
          Furthermore, someone destroyed the array and that alarmed the other
          True Daoists in Dark Kun City.” Yin Mei stood before him, her lovely
          face filled with anxiety. She made her report apologetically and
          kneeled on the ground.</span

          this unexpected turn of events. I did not expect the Young War
          Immortal to have such ability and also believed that this mission was

          >He had no intention of placing blame on Yin Mei for the unsuccessful
          assassination. The Young War Immortal had been spending a lot of time
          with Jiang Chen and Niu Tian, so it was no surprise that the aura of
          the Fortuitous One had rubbed off on him. Thus, it was understandable
          that he would suddenly perform a miracle during such a critical
          moment. Now that the assassination had failed, Gu Changge needed to
          find a way to deal with the aftermath, as it had caused quite a
          commotion in the city.</span

          Changge was not worried that they would be able to produce evidence
          against him. However, he was aware that his next attempt to
          assassinate the Young War Immortal would be significantly more

          >Gu Changge shook his head. “There is no need at this moment. The
          Young War Immortal will undoubtedly be on high alert following this
          incident.”</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Yes, Young Master,” Yin Mei humbly replied.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Do I have to do this myself?] Gu Changge contemplated for a moment.
          He didn’t consider to involve Ah Da, who was a Quasi-Nirvana Realm
          expert. After all, the Young War Immortal was first attacked by the
          Successor of Demonic Arts then by assassins. All Forces were extremely
          vigilant about the safety of their own Successors nowadays. Besides,
          Gu Changge couldn’t guarantee that Ah Da would be able to carry out
          the task without leaving any evidence behind.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If he were to tackle the problem on his own, he might succeed but
          this would come with a significant amount of risk since he was being
          closely watched by many in Dark Kun City. For now, Gu Changge didn’t
          want to cause various the Forces of the Upper Realm to join forces
          against him, so he must wait patiently for the right opportunity to
          present itself.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Being in the limelight truly makes it difficult to do certain things
          openly.” Gu Changge shook his head and set his teacup aside.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If it became apparent that Gu Changge intended to eliminate the Young
          War Immortal, it could lead to significant unrest throughout the Upper
          Realm. Many Forces would not tolerate such an action. If Gu Changge
          were to act without cause, it could set a dangerous precedent for him
          to attack other Successors of various Forces. This could potentially
          serve as a justification for the other Forces to launch an attack
          against him or even the Gu Family. Despite his impressive abilities,
          Gu Changge still lacked the power to fully dominate the entire Upper
          Realm.</span

          >“Fortune had smiled upon him this time. I wonder if he will venture
          into Kun Mountain. Should he do so, I shall make sure to personally
          take care of him.” Gu Changge smiled, unperturbed by the matter.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >What could a mere Young War Immortal possibly do? Even if he were to
          reveal Su Qingge’s true identity to the War Immortal Manor, it would
          likely have little impact without any concrete evidence. Unless the
          Young War Immortal was able to capture Su Qingge, his words held
          little weight.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What inconvenience could the Young War Immortal possibly bring upon
          you? As soon as you leave Dark Kun City, eliminating the Young War
          Immortal will be as easy as crushing an ant.” Yin Mei nodded before
          gracefully picking up the teapot and filling Gu Changge’s cup to the
          brim.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >An enigmatic smile spread across Gu Changge’s face as he reached out
          and pulled Yin Mei into his arms. “You&#8217;ve reminded me of
          something important. This incident has presented me with an ideal
          opportunity. Yin Mei, go issue an order announcing my intention to
          host a banquet in the Starcatcher Pavillion in two day’s time and
          invite many young prodigies in Dark Kun City to discuss the invasion
          into Kun Mountain and the rescue of Ji Shengchu&#8230; no, the rescue
          of a Human Ancestor. I would love to see who has the audacity to
          refuse my invitation.”</span

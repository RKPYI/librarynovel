        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Splat!* Blood sprayed in the air, like a blooming flower with a morbid sense
                of beauty.</span><span id="more-28822"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone felt that the sword light was beautiful, like unimpeded moonlight.
                It lit up the sky but the bloody aura it carried caused their souls to shake in extreme fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like a fairy from the moon had descended to the mortal realm.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite such a beautiful sight, the Purple Mansion’s Sacred Emperor Realm
                Master was frozen in place. His eyes were wide open, with panic and despair in them yet to fade.
                However, the lights had already left them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the destruction of both body and soul! The bloody hole between his
                brows made for a grisly sight, causing everyone to be taken aback</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a matter of seconds, an expert in the Sacred Emperor Realm, who seemed
                incomparably powerful, was destroyed in both body and soul.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the light smile on Gu Changge’s face, everyone shivered. Some people
                were so stunned that they couldn’t speak. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The middle-aged man, whom the old man saved, was as white as paper, without a
                hint of blood on his face. He couldn’t stop his body from shaking, he felt fear to such an extreme, he
                almost reeled back.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Sacred Emperor Realm Master is dead…” </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some finally reacted. They swallowed their saliva, and their voices trembled.
                They could already foresee the unimaginable shifts that were going to happen in the Upper Realm.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As expected. Gu Changge had already anticipated this, and made preparations
                beforehand. I guess I worried for nothing…” Gu Xianer was also wide-eyed with shock. She didn’t know who
                that lady was just now, but from Gu Changge’s attitude, it should be someone from the Immortal Gu
                Family, who was unfathomably powerful. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was way too domineering. Not a single word, directly going in to kill
                someone in the Scared Emperor Realm…”</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm we’re talking about…”</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The King with Six Crowns, the Phoenix Lady, and Ying Yu were also wide-eyed
                with shock. Chills went down their spines, and they found it hard to accept what they just saw. However,
                they clearly know that the matters today would definitely cause a great uproar among all factions.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Third-Order Scared Emperor Realm Master should be considered an invincible
                existence in the Upper Realm. An expert without a rival. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the forces behind those present would be extremely respectful towards
                someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm, without daring to slight them. After all, those who could reach the
                Scared Emperor were all geniuses of their era.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those referred to be young prodigies may be gifted, but whether they could
                reach that cultivation level was still hard to say. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purple Mansion had sent someone like that, intending to solve the matter
                today and protect Sky King Zhi Yang. In everyone’s opinion, it was a forgone conclusion that couldn’t be
                changed once that old man had appeared. After all, although Gu Changge possessed a Sacred Emperor Grade
                artifact, he should still not be able to contend against someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm. </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When that old man made his move, everyone was still guessing why Gu Changge
                was so calm, without any signs of fear. But now, they finally understand. The strength of this peerless
                expert behind him was simply too frightening. She was able to kill someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm
                in one strike. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a feat could never be accomplished even if it was another person in the
                Scared Emperor Realm. Much less in one move. This could only mean that the mysterious person from a
                moment ago, reached a height greater than the Sacred Emperor Realm. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Could it be? An expert in the Nirvana Realm?] Thinking of this, everyone’s
                expression changed. shock, fear and alarm flashing by their faces. Thos in the Nirvana Realm were
                existences that suppressed Fortuity, and were hidden powers of their respective force. It should be
                impossible for them to directly make a move like this. Normally, they only rouse from their seclusions
                when the whole force they were backing faced life or death. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one expected this matter to alarm an Immortal Gu Family’s Nirvana Realm
                Master, and to think this expert was hidden behind Gu Changge this whole time, just waiting for Purple
                Mansion to lose patience and attack. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just from this alone showed how important the Immortal Gu Family regarded Gu
                Changge! They obviously knew that Purple Mansion would definitely try something, so they prepared this
                beforehand. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or perhaps, the real purpose was to find an excuse to move against Purple
                Mansion?</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the reason, the Immortal Gu Family was bound to be seen as on
                the side of justice. After all, under the eyes of so many people, Purple Mansion had shown they were the
                strong bullying the weak, when they planned to teach Gu Changge a lesson. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was unsurprising even someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm met with such a
                fate and Purple Mansion could only swallow their grievances. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even a Sacred Emperor Master has met his end. Sky King Zhi Yang, even if he
                is still the Successor of Purple Mansion, he already had his Chaos Dao Bone dug out, and is no better
                than dead… I’m afraid Purple Mansion will go mad after today.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is most likely the case? Not to mention, Purple Mansion’s behavior is
                no different than declaring war on the Immoral Gu Family. They had their Sacred Emperor Realm Master
                attack Young Master Gu. How is that any different from a provocation for war?”</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their Sacred Emperor Realm Master is dead. I can only say they were asking
                for it. They were so arrogant just a moment ago, they should&#8217;ve known there would be
                consequences.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cultivator couldn’t help whispering this, thinking about the aftermath this
                would cause. In the many years, this was the first time they heard of someone in the Sacred Emperor
                Realm dying. Moreover, he was killed by an unfathomable expert in front of everyone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just now, everyone saw that blurry figure that made a move. However, no one
                could see the person’s face clearly. They could only roughly guess that it was a woman of peerless grace
                and Talent. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does anyone else want to have a go?” Gu Changge glanced at the expert from
                Purple Mansion, who were quaking down to their souls and he faintly smiled. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Or does anyone want to try retrieving Sky King Zhi Yang’s Chaos Dao Bone?”
                Saying this, he motioned at the Chaos Dao Bone, which was glowing with purple mist and covered with
                divinity. The thick mist tangling together was mysterious and beautiful, and felt like it could
                transform all of the Heavens and the myriad worlds. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Zhi Yang’s bone was dug out by Gu Changge, he had yet to faint. Rather,
                he was trying to hold out until his Martial Uncle could come to his rescue and take him away. However,
                at the next moment, his Martial Uncle, his ray of hope, had been killed by a powerful master. He finally
                couldn’t hold back anymore and spat out blood before losing consciousness. To be fair, how could he
                continue to persevere after suffering such a huge blow?</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, hearing Gu Changge’s words, those from Purple Mansion were
                pale with fear. They trembled in place, and looked at Gu Changge with horror, scared that he would
                suddenly massacre everyone. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even their expert in the Scared Emperor Realm had died. So, what could they
                possibly do? Fight? Their death would only come sooner.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems that you bunch still have some senses. The death sentence could be
                spared… but it would be hard to escape the suffering.” Gu Changge looked at their frightened faces while
                maintaining his smile. However, when he spoke the latter half of his sentence, his tone took a cold,
                sharp turn. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Purple mansion colluded with the Successor of Demonic Arts to harm their
                peers. They deserved to be punished by the masses. Someone, come and lock up this group from Purple
                Mansion. We’ll decide what to do with them later.” After he finished speaking, behind his back, rays of
                divine rainbows came rumbling over, like an army on horseback. It was dazzling to the point of
                threatening everyone. Each of them were donned in armors and wielded large weaponry, exuding domineering
                and bloody aura. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are… Where did Young Master Gu dispatch the Unrivalled Guards from?”
                Everyone was surprised by the scene after they finally noticed the group of elites Gu Changge had
                dispatched. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire group, composed of only those above the Enlightened Noble Realm.
                They all carried an intense bloody aura, as if they had slaughtered their way out of a mountain of
                corpses. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““If Gu Changge had planned everything from the start, he not only wanted to
                take care of Sky King Zhi Yang, but he also did not intend to let Purple Mansion off from the start.
                What a tyrannical guy.” The King with Six Crown’s pupils couldn’t help shrinking as he couldn’t suppress
                the shock in his heart. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gu Changge must have discovered where Zhi Yang was hiding a long time ago.
                He merely didn’t act because he was waiting for the arrival of experts from Purple Mansion so that he
                could find a suitable excuse to act. Siii… does he really plan to destroy Purple Mansion?” At this time,
                the Phoenix Lady finally reacted. She had seen plenty of brilliant schemes before. Yet, today, she
                couldn’t help feeling a bit fearful and sucked in a cold breath of air. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under everyone’s shocked eyes, the Unrivalled Guards let loose their
                murderous aura and charged down. They immediately encircled those from Purple Mansion, intending to take
                them down. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, although the experts from Purple Mansion were livid, they
                didn’t dare to resist. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They arrived quickly, but were suppressed even faster. Among them, the Sacred
                King Realm expert’s had his Knowledge Sea sealed before being restrained. Furthermore, he did not dare
                to resist at all.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changege didn’t choose to kill Sky King Zhi Yang at this moment. He just
                sealed the latter’s Knowledge Sea and threw him to the Unrivalled Guards. After all, he still had other
                uses for Sky King Zhi Yang. However, before he tossed the latter away, he took away Sky King Zhi Yang’s
                bottle of water from the Lake of Reincarnation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had seen Qin Wuya hand this bottle to Gu Xianer, but Gu Xianer didn’t take
                it so Zhi Yang had taken it back. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you still in a daze? Soon, I will find out where they hid Qin
                Xiaoyi. After all, Sky King Zhi Yang is now in my hands, sooner or later he will confess to everything.”
                Gu Changge landed from the sky. With a smile, he arrived by Gu Xianer’s side as she was still in a daze.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“En.” Gu Xianer nodded, she didn’t retort to him like she would have done in
                the past. Rather, she was weirdly quiet and tranquil as if she was going to ascend to become an Immortal
                at any moment. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge could guess what she was think, he smiled, “What’s wrong, you’re
                still thinking about what happened before?”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing him take the initiative to mention his topic, Gu Xianer was
                surprised. She glanced at Gu Changge and didn’t say anything, but her attitude spoke for itself. She
                wasn’t stupid and could even be considered smarter than average cultivator. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before, she thought Qin Wuya and Zhi Yang harbored ill intentions to wreck
                her relationship with Gu Changge. That was why she got mad and without thinking too deeply about it. She
                just simple-mindedly determined that it was Qin Wuya and Zhi Yang slandering Gu Changge. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[However, from the looks of everything, Gu Changge had long planned to deal
                with Sky King Zhi Yang. After all, he even brought an expert in the Nirvana Realm from the Immortal Gu
                Family with him. Such arrangements could not be made in one day. Meaning, he had been planning this for
                a while. From this perspective, Sky King Zhi Yang was more like an unlucky ghost, and had no chance to
                begin with…]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more she thought about it, the scarier he seemed. Gu Xianer knew Gu
                Changge wasn’t a completely evil person, but he also wasn’t anything decent either. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the scene Sky King Zhi Yang had shown her, Gu Xianer never took it
                seriously to begin with. Although Gu Changge was a deeply shrewd person, and had terrifying methods, he
                never truly harmed her. [If he was really interested in my Source, with my meagre skills, how am I able
                to live up to now? But, what if Qin Wuya and Zhi Yang were speaking the truth? How should I face Gu
                Changge in the future? If he is really the Successor of Demonic Arts, what would that make me? The
                Successor of Demonic Arts’ accomplice?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, Gu Xianer did not think too badly of the Successor of Demonic Arts.
                This was because her Masters from Peach Village were a mix of righteous and evil, and each had their own
                conducts. However, she still hoped for their words to be false and that it was just Sky King Zhi Yang’s
                ploy to damage their relationship. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I still feel like I must confess some things to you. Otherwise you’ll always
                have an expression like I owe you money.” Gu Changge looked at Gu Xianer who was lost in thought and
                said this. At the same time, he motioned for the Unrivalled Guards to take away those from Purple
                Mansion. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the distance, the young prodigies wanted to come up and offer their
                praises, however, they sensibly stayed in their place and did not come over. What they saw today shocked
                them to their core and there were many things they wanted to ask Gu Changge. But, they did not. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the King with Six Crowns, the Phoenix Lady and the rest chose to not
                move forward. They were silent for a while before moving to leave, one after another. Divine rainbows
                flashed in the sky as many departed, believing that they had to share what had happened to their
                respective Sect or Family. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm?” Gu Xianer’s thoughts were interrupted as she looked at Gu Changge with
                suspicion. Although she was rather displeased with his expression, she was still curious about what Gu
                Changge wanted to say to her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Actually, before you came here, I already found this place. Everything Sky
                King Zhi Yang said to you, I heard them all too… Including how he said I was the Successor of Demonic
                Arts, and how you were their Junior Sister in your past life and only needed to drink the water from the
                Lake of Reincarnation to restore your memory… Naturally, I also saw that scene, and also heard you
                saying that you were willing, even if that is your future.” Gu Changge confessed all this in a calm
                manner. But when he said the last bit of his sentence, the corner of his mouth couldn’t help tugging
                into a playful smile. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, Gu Xianer’s beautiful eyes widened in surprise. Hearing the
                last part of his words, she couldn’t bear it anymore and felt her face getting hot. [Argh! Why did I say
                that earlier! He even heard it!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Gu Changge’s expression, she wanted to dig a hole and hide in it.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gu Changge, don’t you dare read too deeply into it. It’s merely something I
                said in the spur of the moment. Don’t tell me you took it for real?” Gu Xianer had cultivated her mind,
                so very quickly, her face returned to normal and she shot him a glance as she retorted. Her expression
                now reads ‘you wish what I said was real’.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, she didn’t expect Gu Changge to say all this. Still, him
                telling her these things significantly improved her mood. She realised that it wasn’t really Gu
                Changge’s identity that was bothering her, but rather his attitude. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aren’t you overreacting a bit? I’m telling you all these things because I
                want you to understand something.” Gu Changge said with a light smile. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know, actually, you didn’t have to tell me this.” Gu Xianer said,
                “Although nothing good comes out of your mouth, I still trust you.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, everything Qin Wuya and Sky King Zhi Yang said is true.” Gu Changge
                waved his hand and interrupted her. His words made Gu Xianer stunned. She half thought Gu Changge was
                joking with her. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He continued, “that’s why, in the future, you should stay a bit further away
                from me. Who knows, one day if you make me unhappy, I just might throw you into a dungeon, drink your
                blood, dig out your bone, and swallow your Source as I please to teach you a lesson on trusting
                me.“</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yet, you showed up here alone, because you couldn’t bear seeing Sky King Zhi
                Yang hurt me?” Gu Xianer snapped out of her daze, and unable to bear the itching feeling, she threw back
                a retort with some indignation. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s right. After all, I’ve said it before. No one is allowed to
                bully you besides me. Sky King Zhi Yang was just asking for death, he can only blame himself.” Gu
                Changge nodded his head in a serious manner. He then said somewhat regretfully, “It’s just that you’re
                really too weak. Originally I thought with your level of strength, you wouldn’t be injured by
                him.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Xianer was stunned, she suddenly remembered the feud between Gu Changge
                and Sky King Zhi Yang seemed to have started because of her. Whether Gu Changge was dealing with Sky
                King Zhi Yang or dealing with Purple Mansion, it was all for her in one way or another. [To think I was
                only concerned about his identity and his frightening means…] </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t dislike me for being weak…” Thinking up to here, Gu Xianer stared
                at Gu Changge and snorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The darkness of this place blurred the surroundings. Such a scene was akin  to the Hell from the legends. As stars hung in the sky, each of them was covered in thick mist, majestic and heavy, as though they had the power to suppress everything. Hiding amongst the mountain ranges were assassins from Neraka, whose astonishing auras and killing intents spread.</span><span id="more-36156"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge has made a move on Neraka for no reason. Naturally, I&#8217;ll have to show him who the boss is. Heed my order, disciples of Neraka. This battle will not end before Gu Changge is dead.&#8221; The Third Palace Lord of Neraka, who wore a battle suit made of Hell&#8217;s Iron and held a Heavenly Sword, appeared from the depths of the pavilions as he rode on the back of a Black Water Dragon, who was in the Nirvana Realm. Meanwhile, Old Lady Meng was by his side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were ten Palaces in Neraka, but this place was only a small world where three of them were located. They were not in the Upper Realm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Third Palace Lord received the news, he led the disciples of Neraka to intercept and annihilate Gu Changge and his army. Though the various Palaces of Neraka were not in contact with each other, they would act together during moments of major crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s such a pity that the current First Palace Lord’s cultivation level is not high enough, or he could have used the Immortal Annihilating Formation to end Gu Changge&#8217;s life,&#8221; Old Lady Meng commented with a sigh. She was also a True Daoist but her cultivation was nowhere near the Ten Palace Lords. Nevertheless, she had brutally killed many peerless experts and the Sect Master of Formidable Sects over the years. Their skulls were even on display in her room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge! Make Neraka proud!&#8221; Under the orders of the Third Palace Lord, killing intent immediately surged from between the mountains and islands. It was everywhere, even emerging from the clouds. Enormous ancient battleships stained with blood also appeared and drifted across the sky. The angry roars of beasts could be heard pouring out like a flood as they stepped out of the battleship with bloodshot eyes filled with killing intent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless assassins from Neraka appeared from space portals, some having appeared after exiting seclusion. Their numbers easily exceeded tens of millions and were close to billions, if not endless. There were even those that hid their powers, whose aura would leave everyone&#8217;s heart racing if unleashed on the battleship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They came with such an unimaginable force that it was enough to overpower any Force with terror. Yet, this was merely one of the Ten Palaces of Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar scenes were happening in the other Lower Realm Worlds run by Neraka. A shocking number of armies gathering to launch an attack on their enemies. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, this was not all that was planned by the higher ups of Neraka, who were secretly making other contingencies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had quietly sent off many treasures and inheritances of Neraka as they feared that an accident would occur as a result of this battle. Now that the entire Upper Realm was alerted, many Forces tried to take part, in the hopes that they could have a slice of the action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless people had a feeling that it would be difficult for Neraka to escape unscathed this time. Even if there were no destruction, they would still most likely sustain heavy losses that would make it hard for them to reach their previous peak again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those of high positions in Neraka hated Gu Changge with a burning passion. They had no idea why he would do such a thing. After all, they had never gotten involved with each other&#8217;s matters. Despite that, Gu Changge suddenly ordered his men to wipe out their contact points and practice grounds in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. Everyone was caught off guard by such a move because it was so ruthless and quick that they couldn&#8217;t react. By the time the Palace Lords came to understand what had happened, all the informers and points of contact on the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds had already been completely removed. It was obvious from this that Gu Changge had been planning this for a long time. This was not impromptu by any means.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multitude of armies gathered by the Upper Realm had arrived at the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds through teleportation arrays. On top of these ancient battleships were numerous armies armed with all kinds of weapons as they rode on the ferocious beasts. They were all waiting for their order to charge into the Lower Realm ancient worlds and start a massacre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was absorbed in his thoughts as he listened to his subordinate&#8217;s report on an ancient battleship. [In addition to Giant Wave World, there are traces of Neraka in other worlds too…] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t intend to execute the plan himself. Instead, he wanted the other Forces to battle it out with Neraka first. When the time was right, he would naturally reap the benefits. That was the reason why he did not hesitate to inform the various Forces of everything about Neraka. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, with the power and influence that Gu Changge now had, he alone was more than enough to cause serious harm to Neraka. Still, he did not want to have too many losses on his side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wouldn&#8217;t I be silly not to use the tool in front of me?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu… There is news from Pagoda while we have Neraka trapped. It seems like they are frightened.&#8221; A wave of fluctuation could be felt in the void as the mysterious Master of the Nephrite Breeze Pavilion, Bai Lian&#8217;er, appeared on the ancient battleship and reported to Gu Changge. There was a rare smile on her face since a matter of concern had apparently been resolved. Once Neraka and Pagoda were destroyed, the entire dark side of the Upper Realm would be under Nephrite Breeze Pavilion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, did Pagoda show up?&#8221; Gu Changge was a little taken aback when he first heard it, but he didn&#8217;t think it was surprising after he gave it a thought. After all, Neraka was in danger, now that all the Forces of the Upper Realm were preparing to besiege it. It was only normal for Pagoda, which was no more powerful than Neraka, to feel uneasy. The foundation of Pagoda was worse than Neraka, so it was normal to feel uneasy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have already assigned someone to look for any trace of Pagoda. We should be able to locate them in a few days,&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er responded with confidence. As she had gotten her Junior Brother, Bai Hua, to help, she had a rough idea of Pagoda&#8217;s hiding place based on the clues that showed up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge only nodded and said nothing else. Apart from Dark Heaven and the Epoch Dao Fruit in the Upper Realm, only the troubles surrounding Neraka and Pagoda remained unsolved. He believed that it would not take long before things would come to an end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Epoch Dao Fruit was showing more signs of ripening as hints of World Principles began to seep out of his Inner Universe. The World Principles of the entire Upper Realm were also undergoing obvious and massive changes. Those with higher cultivation and who stood at the peak of the Upper Realm should have felt the changes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Gu Changge had resolved the troubles surrounding Neraka and Pagoda, he would begin to lay out his plans for the Epoch Dao Fruit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprisingly, a horrific war broke out at various places on the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds half a month later. Some of the armies descended to Neraka through the teleportation array and fought with the forces there. The battle caused an earth-shattering fluctuation that ravaged the entire area. It was as if the sky had been pierced through and the stars were broken into ashes. Chaos Qi soon began to disperse and spread all over the universe. Endless blood and bones were piled up at the scene, plunging the worlds into an abyss of misery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Gu Changge had expected, the soldiers of Neraka were divided into two groups. One appeared outside the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds to stop the various Forces while the other did not participate in the battle as they seemed to be escorting something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Looks like Neraka is well aware that there is only one ending to this fight. They are already thinking of retreating to preserve their next generation.] Gu Changge had yet to show up or even fight as he merely watched everything unfold from an ancient star filled with people. He raised his palm to slam the distant Neraka ancient battleship into smithereens, but he couldn&#8217;t locate traces of any True Daoist among the ship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strongest that Neraka sent were only of the Quasi-Nirvana Realm. The True Daoists were smart enough to choose to hide. This was even truer for the Ten Palace Lords of Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There are rumours that the Ten Palace Lords have a joint offensive formation called the Immortal Annihlating Formation… It will be good if I can use that for my puppets.] Gu Changge smiled and waited for the various Forces to fight with Neraka before he would finally make a move.</span></p>

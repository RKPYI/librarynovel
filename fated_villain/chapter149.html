        <h4>Chapter 149: Suddenly Feeling That He Is Different Now, A Bone-Deep Rooted Love.</h4>
        <p> Yue Mingkong sat silently inside the white-jade carriage. </p>
        <p> Green[1] hair kept in a spiral bun. A picturesque, fairy-like face, so beautiful it overwhelmed the
            beholder. </p>
        <p> <i>[1. The traditional Chinese character for “green” has the same character as simplified Chinese for
                “blue.” Since we’ve used green before, we will continue to use it.]</i> </p>
        <p> Her onyx-coloured phoenix eyes shone with a calm and profound light. </p>
        <p> However, at this moment, she couldn’t help but show a slight blush on her face. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong seemed to be quite happy, mixed with a hint of surprise. </p>
        <p> Needless to say, Gu Changge’s words disturbed her icy demeanour. </p>
        <p> After all… these words came straight from Gu Changge’s own mouth, making it a completely different matter
            than when it came from anyone else. Even if the others were to spit these words out with every inch of their
            heart and soul, she would have just ignored them, not taking the matter to heart at all. </p>
        <p> But when Gu Changge said it, those empty words suddenly gained meaning. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong suddenly felt that Gu Changge was acting very strangely. </p>
        <p> <i>‘So he does know that I am beautiful?’</i> </p>
        <p> When it came to her own charm, Yue Mingkong has never once doubted herself. Just think about it, how many
            women in the world could possibly compare to her in this regard? </p>
        <p> And yet… Gu Changge never looked her way. </p>
        <p> Whether it be in the past or present life, his nonchalance had made Yue Mingkong plenty frustrated. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Long Teng possessed thoughts that he shouldn’t. Dying like this is too cheap for him.”</strong>
        </p>
        <p> A faint smile graced her vision as Gu Changge continued to talk casually as if he didn’t realize how Yue
            Mingkong’s mood was changing by the second. </p>
        <p> At any rate, it’s not like it costs anything to say something nice and shower her with praises every once in
            a while. </p>
        <p> And he was right. </p>
        <p> Hearing his flowery words, Yue Mingkong stared at him without blinking, as if to see right through him. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Long Teng was </strong><strong><i>COURTING DEATH</i></strong><strong>, he can blame only
                himself.”</strong> </p>
        <p> She spoke calmly. Although she felt joy from the bottom of her heart, her pride dared not let it show. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong instead put on a mask of apathy. </p>
        <p> Nevertheless, Gu Changge—who knew she liked to hear such praise—didn’t care at all. </p>
        <p> He kept a light smile, <strong>“Indeed. Even if I didn’t kill him, Mingkong probably will, right?”</strong>
        </p>
        <p> Since there is no one around... </p>
        <p> Gu Changge simply opened up to Yue Mingkong. </p>
        <p> As a regressor, Yue Mingkong should know what Long Teng’s character was like, yet she still decided to come
            forward and hatch such a plan, using such a method to plot against himself. </p>
        <p> Such an act showed just how much she hated Long Teng, wanting to kill with a borrowed knife. </p>
        <p> That said, Gu Changge has always indulged and spoiled Yue Mingkong, and he didn’t bother to care about these
            little thoughts of hers. </p>
        <p> <strong>“What do you mean?”</strong> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong acted like she couldn’t understand Gu Changge’s words, staring at him with a cold expression
            before asking. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was too lazy to expose her, and just laughed, <strong>“Long Teng’s body is in my hands, what are
                your plans for him? Tell your hubby, and maybe I’ll give you his body.”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“You...”</strong> Yue Mingkong froze. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge really hit the nail on the coffin. </p>
        <p> She had been recently thinking of ways to reap and harvest Long Teng. </p>
        <p> The most important part was, obviously, the drop of True Dragon Blood. Rumours say that Long Teng had
            obtained it during a fortuitous encounter and that the blood droplet’s origins were very mysterious and
            ancient. </p>
        <p> If she refined that drop of rainbow-coloured True Dragon Blood, her strength would surely increase by leaps
            and bounds, giving her the powerful talent and surging vitality that characterized the True Dragon Clan.
        </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong never expected Gu Changge to unveil her thoughts so quickly. </p>
        <p> Deep down, she felt slightly annoyed, frustrated even. </p>
        <p> <i>‘How come I never get an upper hand on Gu Changge?’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“You will grant me Long Teng’s body if I just ask?”</strong> Yue Mingkong calmed herself down and
            asked. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Why? Do you not trust your husband?”</strong> Gu Changge lamented. </p>
        <p> His expression made it difficult for Yue Mingkong to guess what he was thinking. </p>
        <p> So upon hearing this, Yue Mingkong fell silent for a few seconds before she replied, <strong>“I heard that
                there is a drop of True Dragon Blood in Long Teng’s body. It would be very useful to me.”</strong> </p>
        <p> At this moment, she began to wonder whether Gu Changge would go back on his word and ignore her request.
        </p>
        <p> After all... he cultivated using the Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art, so his demand for various physical
            sources is even more frightening compared to normal supreme arts. </p>
        <p> Long Teng’s precious droplet of blood came from the ancient and mysterious True Dragons. </p>
        <p> With Changge’s selfishness, it was highly unlikely he would let such a thing go. </p>
        <p> Even if she concealed the refinement method, Gu Changge would probably be able to just devour it whole with
            his abilities anyways. </p>
        <p> <strong>“True Dragon Blood?”</strong> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was momentarily stunned, pondering whether that drop of the rainbow-coloured droplet of blood he
            condensed was the very same True Dragon Blood[2] that Yue Mingkong was referring to. </p>
        <p> <i>[2. It is the same thing, yes.]</i> </p>
        <p> However, since it was rewarded to him by the Heavenly Dao Treasure Chest, it can be said that this reward
            originated from the system, not from the actual physical resource, which is Long Teng’s body. </p>
        <p> In other words... there should still be a drop of True Dragon Blood hidden on Long Teng’s body. </p>
        <p> In all honesty, Gu Changge’s first thought was precisely what Yue Mingkong had believed, and he was tempted
            to go back on his promise. </p>
        <p> This heaven-gifted resource contained immense life force and tyrannical defensive attributes, so naturally,
            Gu Changge wanted to keep it for himself. </p>
        <p> The more the merrier. </p>
        <p> He mused it over again. On second thought, he had already merged with one drop, so taking any more would
            only give him marginal gains, like taking watered-down medicine[3]. </p>
        <p> [3: It’s like when you keep taking a drug, it loses its effectiveness.] </p>
        <p> Moreover, Gu Changge had already felt Yue Mingkong’s growing resentment. </p>
        <p> Although her indifferent expression through the curtain showed nothing of the sort, how could this easily
            seen fact be hidden from him? </p>
        <p> Gu Changge couldn’t help but smile and tease, <strong>“First, you plotted for Ye Ling’s inheritance, and now
                you plot for the True Dragon Blood of Long Teng.”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Mingkong, what manner of insidious thoughts do you have in your head all day? You’re full of
                sinister plots, calculating schemes on your abacus and moving around in the dark.”</strong> </p>
        <p> It was more than acceptable to simply ignore him, but when Yue Mingkong heard such provocative words, she
            could feel a rising annoyance bubbling to the surface. A sudden urge to strangle Gu Changge overwhelmed her.
        </p>
        <p> She had even been somewhat overjoyed at Gu Changge’s earlier praise for her. </p>
        <p> <i>‘What the hell?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘He asked what I thought about all day?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘He said I’m full of sinister plots?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Does this b*****d have even the slightest bit of self-awareness on him?’</i> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong didn’t even know where Ye Ling had gone during this time, but Gu Changge must have been
            watching him, so she couldn’t even get any ideas on how to go about stealing Ye Ling’s inheritance. </p>
        <p> And now this... </p>
        <p> With Gu Changge’s words, she’s afraid she would never have a chance to even see the drop of True Dragon
            Blood in this lifetime. </p>
        <p> With all that in mind, Yue Mingkong simply stopped talking, seemingly not wishing to pay any more mind to Gu
            Changge. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Haha. She looks pissed…’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Just look at your reaction, it’s almost like I’m bullying you.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge continued laughing without the slightest hint of self-awareness. </p>
        <p> <strong>Whoosh!</strong> </p>
        <p> When she heard this, Yue Mingkong abruptly raised her head, her hair fluttering as her picturesque face
            morphed into an expression of anger, her silver teeth clenching tightly together. </p>
        <p> Her look was like a sharpened knife, aiming to gouge his face out. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Gu Changge, you are too brazen! You only know to bully me all day! Besides this, do you have
                nothing else to do in your spare time?”</strong> </p>
        <p> She almost got out of the chariot. Yue Mingkong’s facade cracked, unable to bear it any longer. Gu Changge’s
            words gave her a strong urge to just murder someone. </p>
        <p> She felt wronged. </p>
        <p> What does he mean it only ‘sounds’ like he’s bullying her? </p>
        <p> It was a clear and concise fact! </p>
        <p> Seeing how she almost erupted in anger, Gu Changge reined in his playful thoughts and made an offer with a
            light smile, <strong>“I can give Long Teng’s body to you, but you have to call me hubby.”</strong> </p>
        <p> . </p>
        <p> . </p>
        <p> . </p>
        <p> <strong>“What?!”</strong> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong was stunned when she heard those words. </p>
        <p> Her phoenix eyes widened. </p>
        <p> She was once more made to doubt her own hearing. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Did Gu Changge really plan on giving me Long Teng’s body?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Does he not care about the drop of True Dragon Blood to the point that he’d willingly just give it
                away?’</i> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong suspected that she was actually talking to a fake, a doppelganger Gu Changge with an actual
            conscience and a red-beating heart. </p>
        <p> <strong>“…Hubby.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Soon—afraid of Gu Changge’s duplicitous attitude—Yue Mingkong coldly completed his request. </p>
        <p> A face without any blush, and a heartbeat that remained steady. </p>
        <p> Why would she be embarrassed to say this word? </p>
        <p> Ordinary women might be embarrassed, but she will not be. </p>
        <p> In her last life, she and Gu Changge had already officially married as husband and wife. Moreover, in this
            life, they also became fiancées without fail. </p>
        <p> Saying such a mushy word was quite normal. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge smiled gently and said, <strong>“I didn’t expect Mingkong to be so obedient.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong suddenly felt as if he had tricked her. </p>
        <p> But what is done is still done. </p>
        <p> A brilliance flickered in Gu Changge’s pocket dimension, as a huge dragon corpse appeared from the void and
            laid prone in front of him. </p>
        <p> Long Teng died, so his corpse had returned to its original form. Though he was not really the descendent of
            a True Dragon, just having a drop of blood flowing within him had given his corpse such an incomparable
            size. </p>
        <p> The vitality of the corpse had long dissipated, but it still gave people an intimidating sense that spoke of
            unfathomable strength. </p>
        <p> As if made from black molten iron, dragon scales are cold and radiant, extremely tough, and full of a
            bursting tyrannical aura. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong stared at the huge dragon corpse. </p>
        <p> No traces of refining, nor there are any tricks done to its body. </p>
        <p> This reassured her… </p>
        <p> But Yue Mingkong quickly became suspicious again. The corpse had gone cold, yet Gu Changge never even
            touched it? Her scrutinizing eyes fell on Gu Changge’s face as she asked. </p>
        <p> <strong>“You really don’t intend to refine and devour Long Teng’s corpse?”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“What are you scheming?”</strong> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge possessed the Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art. </p>
        <p> Naturally, he must be concerned with a shortage of various physical resources. </p>
        <p> Would he truly be so kind as to simply gift her the droplet of Long Teng’s True Dragon Blood? </p>
        <p> <i>‘Gu Changge really doesn’t want it? Is this the same Gu Changge I know?’</i> </p>
        <p> One question after another appeared in Yue Mingkong’s mind. </p>
        <p> As he observed her confusion, Gu Changge couldn’t help but laugh and say, <strong>“I indeed planned to
                refine and devour Long Teng whole, but since Mingkong asked so nicely, I will instead give it to
                you.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Of course, the main reason is that there are more cultivation resources waiting for him in the Black
            Heavenly Eagle Clan. Losing Long Teng’s corpse would not be that large of a loss. </p>
        <p> If Yue Mingkong wanted it that badly, he just gave it away. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong grew silent once more. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s unexpected answer made her a little overwhelmed. </p>
        <p> From what she knew of Gu Changge’s previous character, logically speaking, agreeing to her – quite frankly –
            overboard demand should have been impossible. </p>
        <p> If he had any other choice, he wouldn’t have been so pressed to look for cultivation resources to the point
            where he would even attack the Young Supreme from all corners of the Immeasurable Heaven. </p>
        <p> Hence, Long Teng’s Origin should be precious to him. At the very least, most Young Supremes’ Origins are far
            from being Long Teng’s match. </p>
        <p> A priceless origin, yet Gu Changge was willing to give it to her, with no hesitation to be seen. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong felt moved, and her anger towards Gu Changge just now had entirely disappeared… almost. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Since this corpse is quite precious to you, then you should keep it for yourself.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Just then, Yue Mingkong suddenly spoke in an odd and distinctly out-of-character manner. </p>
        <p> As soon as the words came out, she herself was stunned. </p>
        <p> Her mouth had moved almost subconsciously. </p>
        <p> <i>‘It’s hard to deduct something from Gu Changge’s ledger, so why would I just return it?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘What a blunder!’</i>
        </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, there was no use mourning over spilt milk. </p>
        <p> Spoken words are like poured water. </p>
        <p> Even if Yue Mingkong regretted it now, she had to endure it without showing any abnormality, so as to avoid
            being laughed at by Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Since I promised you it would be a gift, then it will indeed be a gift for you.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was a little surprised when he heard this, laughing almost uncontrollably, <strong>“Mingkong is
                so considerate of her hubby; I’m quite touched.”</strong> </p>
        <p> At this moment, Yue Mingkong also calmed down, her face recovering its original indifference. </p>
        <p> <strong>“You’re only realizing that now... but I suppose it’s not too late.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong read between the lines, sensing a bit of dissatisfaction and resentment that Gu Changge had for
            himself. He shook his head and said nothing, sighing, as if he had something left to say but ultimately
            chose not to. </p>
        <p> Of course, he was laughing deep down. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge never thought that Yue Mingkong would suddenly say this, which came as a bit of a surprise for
            him. </p>
        <p> She thought of him first and foremost, even when such good things were thrown directly onto her lap. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Love can indeed make one stupid.’</i> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge didn’t even know what to say to her on this matter. </p>
        <p> This also confirmed one of his biggest doubts in the past. </p>
        <p> In the end, so what if Yue Mingkong’s strength surpassed his, and so what if her Cultivation Base grew
            strong enough to kill him? She would probably be too soft-hearted to even finish the job. </p>
        <p> At most, like a pissed-off lover, she would stamp her feet and throw her sword on the ground, turning around
            and leaving in a rush. </p>
        <p> The future Heavenly Empress, an iron-blooded and indifferent woman… </p>
        <p> Such a woman was unable to take revenge on the man she supposedly ‘hated’? </p>
        <p> That said, Gu Changge also knew that the change in Yue Mingkong’s attitude was the result of his changed
            behaviour during this period of time, so this wasn’t all that unexpected. </p>
        <p> In retrospect, it actually made perfect sense. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge didn’t delay any further, immediately handing over Long Teng’s corpse to Yue Mingkong. </p>
        <p> After all, a great villain like him going back on his words was just petty. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong stared at him silently, unsure of what to say. </p>
        <p> She seemed to have caught a hint of something from Gu Changge’s sigh just now. </p>
        <p> It seemed that Gu Changge shut his mouth at the last moment, almost as if something was wrong. </p>
        <p> <strong>“I’m leaving.”</strong> </p>
        <p> In the end, Gu Changge didn’t dawdle, looking in the direction of the horizon before summoning his followers
            and morphing into a divine rainbow to cross the sky. </p>
        <p> He left as soundlessly as he arrived. </p>
        <p> When he previously fought against Long Teng, Gu Changge recalled that there was a wave of energy rushing
            from a certain direction over yonder. </p>
        <p> Long Teng was dead, but some troublesome matters still needed to be resolved. </p>
        <p> Though they dared not do anything on the surface, none of the Ancient Immortal Races would ever truly come
            to terms with what happened. </p>
        <p> After all... Long Teng is the heir they cultivated through endless blood, sweat, and tears. </p>
        <p> The masters were always bound to appear once their disciples died. </p>
        <p> Long Teng was <i>the</i> peerless example of this fact. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))</p>
        <p> <i>‘With the dragon corpse now in Mingkong’s hands, the Ancient Immortal Races would definitely try to
                snatch it.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘It’s inevitable that she’ll be met with trouble, so let’s solve her troubles beforehand.’</i> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge pondered lightly. </p>
        <p> Additionally, following today’s scene, Gu Changge would leave Yue Mingkong to ferment her thoughts and find
            a few blessed opportunities for herself. </p>
        <p> He had already done too much. </p>
        <p> With Yue Mingkong’s ingenuity and her status as a regressor, she will definitely act according to the
            initial calculations and assumptions made by Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> In this regard, Gu Changge was not worried at all. </p>
        <p> <i>’The matter of Ye Ling’s Reincarnation Inheritance along with the Ancient Deity’s Immortal Cave can both
                be put aside for now. Going by the usual trope, he is unlikely to find the mysterious Immortal Cave in
                such a short while, nor is it something that can be harvested so easily.</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘He might have to undergo a breakthrough in his cultivation or pick up an artifact first.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘And the Immortal Binding Technique will infiltrate the entire Black Heavenly Eagle Clan in due time, so
                being hasty might ruin the plan. So the most worthwhile option is...’</i> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge took many followers in his search for that hidden pulse. </p>
        <p> Many of the cultivators near the mountain had already dispersed at this time, and only a few remained,
            wanting to greet and lick Gu Changge’s boots. </p>
        <p> Obviously, these small fries were ignored. </p>
        <p> ... ... </p>
        <p> Phoenix-like eyes gazed in the direction where Gu Changge disappeared. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong had a complicated expression while seated in her white jade chariot. </p>
        <p> She rubbed her eyebrows, exhausted. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s actions today made her ever so confused. </p>
        <p> At that time, Gu Changge possessed some fleeting emotion and clearly had something to say, which was
            effortlessly caught by the eyes of Yue Mingkong. </p>
        <p> It was because of this that she felt Gu Changge might have... some hidden reasons. </p>
        <p> Whether in the past or this life, she had never seen Gu Changge like this. </p>
        <p> According to her previous life’s knowledge of Gu Changge, this is far too strange, it almost seemed sudden
            enough to have been caused by unexplained circumstances. </p>
        <p> <i>‘In any case, Gu Changge’s demonic nature is deeply rooted. Although he has no ill intentions towards me
                now, there is no guarantee that this will be the case in the future.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘In order to prevent tragedy from repeating itself, I have to become stronger. Gu Changge’s current
                Cultivation Base is unfathomable. If his current performance was actually just meant to confuse me, then
                something terrible awaits…’</i> </p>
        <p> The last possibility was merely Yue Mingkong’s guess. </p>
        <p> Not likely at all. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Why would Gu Changge confuse me though…?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Don’t think too much about such unnecessary things.’</i> </p>
        <p> However, this also strengthened her determination. After leaving the Ancient Immortal Continent, she had to
            investigate every opportunity before Gu Changge laid his grubby hands on them. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong didn’t want to sit still and wait for death. </p>
        <p> Since the last time she met Gu Changge at his house on the peak, she found that Gu Changge had changed a lot
            when compared to before. </p>
        <p> The same is true of his attitude toward Gu Xian’er. </p>
        <p> Allowing himself to be stabbed and purposely going out of his way to help Gu Xian’er with his own hands… it
            seemed as if he was trying to make up for the damage he’d done to Gu Xian’er in the past. </p>
        <p> And today, for the first time in the world, he gifted another his own opportunity. </p>
        <p> Long Teng’s True Dragon Blood. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong always thought that Gu Changge was a person who was absolutely indifferent and whose interests
            always came first above everything else. </p>
        <p> The fact that she fell in love with such a person was her own misfortune. </p>
        <p> To make matters worse, such love was bone-deep, a situation as unfortunate as can be. </p>
        <p> But these few days, in Gu Changge, she saw a transformation. A change. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong felt hope. </p>
        <p> “Go to the Baiheng Mountains in the East.” </p>
        <p> Afterwards, Yue Mingkong issued a command. She must enter the mountains first and make arrangements. </p>
        <p> Because according to the memories she had of her previous life, it was within the vicinity of the Baiheng
            Mountains that the Fairy Spirit would be born.</p>

        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Proofreader: </strong><span style="color: #00ffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color><strong>Silavin </strong></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge ignited the sacrificial scripture, stimulating the vast Power of Faith accumulated by Mortal Palace.</span><span id="more-34831"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the boundless skies of the Upper Realm, startling anomalies surged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivators raised their heads and were stunned to see ancient majestic palaces levitating in the sky. Carvings were etched on the walls of the palaces, emitting golden and vibrant divine beams, as if they were an eternal capital made for Immortals. Even more astonishingly, they heard the magnificent chanting of billions of gods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The occurrence lasted for a long time, causing countless cultivators to confer in shock and guess whether it was a sign of the world changing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, some of them even heard the ancient beckoning sound of Dark Heaven reaching them across the River of Time. Amid the ambiguity, there seemed to be a voice telling them that those who could find Dark Heaven would be able to attain Immortality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This voice was not only heard by ordinary cultivators, but it was also detected by Sacred Emperor Realm experts and True Daoists, who were frightened by it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They understood that such an achievement required not only advanced cultivation from the caster, but also fathomless Power of Faith in order to draw the detection of all beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Does that mean Dark Heaven already had a great number of believers?] Such an inference left the Forces shivering in fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Does that mean Dark Heaven&#8217;s influence has seeped into every corner of the world while we were unaware of it? Even our loved ones could possibly be a follower of Dark Heaven!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many felt a chill up their spines as their scalps tingled, coming to such an alarming realisation. Essentially, judging from what happened in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, Dark Heaven even had the audacity to attack Gu Changge. In other words, there was nothing in the world that Dark Heaven wouldn&#8217;t dare to commit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, cultivators of the older generation expressed their concern. &#8220;We can already foresee the near future. The Upper Realm will face drastic change. Perhaps darkness in ancient times was stirred up by Dark Heaven itself. By then, even True Daoists wouldn&#8217;t even be able to fend themselves as the Upper Realm will be consumed by chaos. No one will be fortunate enough to escape as endless darkness engulfed this world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While darkness was surging in various skies of the Upper Realm, Gu Changge had already left the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and returned to the Immortal Gu Family Residence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he claimed to be seriously injured, given how he went up against three True Daoists single-handedly, he was probably fine by now. Thus, when he returned to the Immortal Gu Family Residence, only his father and a few others came to visit him, while the rest of the family Elders did not show up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, Gu Changge was at the height of his power, be it in the Upper Realm or in the Immortal Gu Family. Even the elusive Ancestors, who were True Daoists, had to treat him with courtesy instead of perceiving him as a mere junior.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had left the matters related to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty to Yin Mei and Yu Tianzheng.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in charge of the Alliance of Thousand Merchants, Yin Mei was extremely focused about managing the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. After all, the Celestial Dynasty was incomparable to her Alliance of Thousand Merchants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was an Immortal Celestial Dynasty that possessed terrifying power, and Gu Changge had only gained preliminary control over it recently, so he had yet to completely infiltrate his men into all seats of power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the powerful beings and ancient ones who were deep in seclusion were not blind. They would surely detect abnormality if he made too many drastic changes. Thus, Gu Changge could only take it slow as he couldn&#8217;t rush such things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, to his surprise, Gu Qingyi took the initiative to meet with him out of nowhere. Although she simply spoke only a few words, it was extremely rare for her to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Immortal Gate is about to open. The old Immortal Domain is about to resurface. With every barrier of the world vanished, everything shall be restored to how they were during Ancient Times of Immortals… It seems the Upper Realm will soon fall into another turmoil. This world has changed drastically with much chaos along with it. Not only does it harbour opportunities to reach Immortality, but it holds numerous futures that cannot be predicted.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing on a boulder, Gu Qingyi appeared extraordinarily stunning, though as cold as the Moon Immortal. As her long sleeves swayed and her hair gracefully danced, she softly spoke. Her speech seemed deliberate as it was rare to her to talk this much.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What kind of turmoil? Are you entering the Immortal Domain?&#8221; Subtle strangeness flashed across Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes as he asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even at this point, he could never perceive Gu Qingyi&#8217;s cultivation level. As a matter of fact, even Remnant Immortals couldn&#8217;t conceal their aura in front of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, from the beginning, Gu Qingyi had never hidden her aura. Her existence resembled that of the striking moon, supremely natural yet incomprehensible at the same time, as if she had merged with the world itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Gu Changge had guessed that his origin was deeply tied to Gu Qingyi, given how exceedingly unusual her background was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Qingyi raised her shimmering gaze and glanced at him before gently shaking her head, after which she nodded wordlessly. She knew Gu Changge very well, so she was confident that the turmoil, even that of the emergence of Immortal Domain in the Upper Realm, would not affect him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Xiao Bai, the little Wang Yue, who was behind her, tensed her nose and stated, &#8220;How irresponsible of you, Master! Sister Qingyi is here to bid you farewell!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bid me farewell?&#8221; At once, Gu Changge was taken aback, peering at Gu Qingyi in daze. &#8220;Are you leaving the Gu Family?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Qingyi was an ancient monster of the Gu Family, where even the Ancestor wasn&#8217;t certain of her true origin, there was no telling whether her departure meant returning to the Immortal Domain or somewhere else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not exactly leaving the Gu Family. I&#8217;m simply returning to where I belong,&#8221; Gu Qingyi softly replied, extending her slender, elegant nails and grooming her hair on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief moment of silence, Gu Changge let out a chuckle. &#8220;Shall we go for a walk then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Qingyi lightly blurted an agreeing response. As she gently waved her arm, Xiao Bai&#8217;s body instantaneously disappeared as she was sent to the Small Universe, which she had been living in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, side by side, the two strolled down from the peak of the mountain towards the foot of the mountain. Their surroundings were filled with vivid lights and swirling mists as a calming breeze blew across the forest, along with the gentle cry of fawns and tweets of birds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge spoke not a word, and so did Gu Qingyi as the two of them casually walked along the path and mountain rivers. It was as though they shared an inexplicable bond that had persisted for millions of years. Even with the passing of countless epochs and endless time, such a bond remained deeply engraved in their bones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that one day, the two traversed across numerous mountains and rivers, walking past innumerable ancient Mystic Mountains, and eventually, under the warm hue of dawn, they arrived at a wide, borderless grassy plain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the mountain breeze blew over, the grass wiggled. The setting of the sun was followed by the delightful radiant moonlight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve last paid attention to this plain.&#8221; Gu Qingyi gazed at everything with some sort of emotion in her eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Took the words right out of my mouth,&#8221; Gu Changge said upon a chuckle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You said that once.&#8221; Gu Qingyi revealed a faint smile and continued, &#8220;Do you still remember our bet?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bet? What bet?&#8221; Gu Changge furrowed his brows lightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ll remember eventually,&#8221; Gu Qingyi replied as she shook her head. As her eyes grew extremely deep, she added, &#8220;After all, that is your final destination.&#8221;</span></p>

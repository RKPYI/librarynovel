          Wudi out of this place. A speck of golden light flickered outside of
          the universe where the Nine Great Mountains were before they walked
          out from it. They had left the Deep Cloud Graveyard and arrived almost
          instantly outside by tearing space apart.</span

          what I&#8217;ve seen today, the Sky Deer Goddess herself has submitted
          to the Upper Realm for some time. You both must be careful in Sky Deer
          City since we don&#8217;t know if she has eyes there.&#8221; The
          Second Mountain Elder sighed as he informed them about some important
          issues. After that, his expression became determined as he turned
          away. He tore apart space once again, and transformed into a golden
          beam of light to return to the Nine Great Mountains to join in the
          fight against the Upper Realm invasion.</span

          move rapidly and soon disappear into the distance. He clenched his
          fists and couldn&#8217;t help despising his weakness and inability to
          protect his Eldest Senior Sister, as well as the Nine Great
          Mountains.</span

          >&#8220;Youngest Junior Brother, it&#8217;s not the time to act on our
          emotions. The Nine Great Mountains may not be so lucky; if anything
          happens to us, who will pass down the teachings of the Nine Great
          Mountains? Are you willing to see the Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s
          efforts go to waste?&#8221; Gu Wudi shook his head and replied
          patiently.

          >He still remembered Gu Changge&#8217;s instruction and wanted to be
          careful. Once he completed his task, there would be a spot for him in
          the Upper Realm. The Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains would be
          completely taken over by the Upper Realm soon, so it wouldn&#8217;t be
          long before the Nine Great Mountains went extinct if it kept on
          resisting. Any intelligent person would know which side to choose in
          this situation. Besides, his life was still in Gu Changge&#8217;s
          hands.</span

          such a cowardly person like you?&#8221; Xiao Yang frowned deeply,
          mocking him. However, he still remembered his Master&#8217;s
          instructions and thus ignored Gu Wudi for now. They transformed into
          divine rainbows and headed for the Aether Abyss. They had their token
          of proof from the Nine Great Mountains, so those from the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains would come to welcome them.

          was on the Upper Realm&#8217;s side, he became annoyed and frustrated.
          She had somehow submitted to the Upper Realm even though she was the
          guardian of Sky Deer City, and many of the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains might not know of this. He didn&#8217;t know how he was going
          to explain this to the cultivators of Sky Deer City and couldn&#8217;t
          ensure that they would believe him.</span

          >Soon, the war in the Nine Great Mountains drew to a close. Many
          Mountain Elders battled with Gu Changge by travelling infinite
          kilometres away to an area away, to fully be able to express the most
          powerful abilities not seen for a very long time. However in the end,
          they still lost. All coughing up blood before exploding into pieces.

          blew in seemingly from another land. It covered an area trillions of
          kilometres wide and blocked away everything in the universe.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge wore a cold expression, his white clothes ethereal and
          otherworldly compared to the universe around him. However, Demonic Qi
          seemed to surge in waves behind him like an enormous ocean.</span

          >&#8220;Do you still want to fight?&#8221; His expression was mild as
          his palm struck downwards and instantly enclosed the universe.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sun, moon, and stars seemed to rotate within, and the palm
          contained the whole universe. The Yin-Yang symbol revolved above him,
          raining down black and white Qi. These seemed to evolve into the six
          paths, as six indestructible doorways appeared and stood in the depths
          of the universe while shining intensely. It was a shocking sight and
          all attacks fell at his feet, all unable to strike him &#8211; only
          eliciting water-like ripples.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >&#8220;Do not be too haughty just yet!&#8221; The True Daoists looked
          stricken, now covered in blood from their injuries. Their expressions
          were grave as their Nirvana Grade Artifacts floated above their heads
          and beamed down Principles as numerous as the stars.</span

          >&#8220;His strength is somewhat strange. We cannot defeat him even
          after working together!&#8221; The Third Mountain Elder&#8217;s body
          shook violently with disbelief, covered in grievous injuries. A
          shimmering Dao Sword appeared in his hand to shield any attacks, while
          a frightening black Qi tangled around his hand. It contained
          unbelievable levels of corrosive power and couldn&#8217;t be removed
          at all. He could feel his body nearly cracking apart from just one
          strike by Gu Changge. [How terrifyingly powerful!]</span

          against me when you can&#8217;t even penetrate my defences?&#8221; Gu
          Changge continued approaching with an expressionless face as if he
          couldn&#8217;t sense any of the attacks that were targeting him. The
          Yin-Yang symbol shielded him from every technique and nothing could
          hit him.</span

          >&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you down!&#8221; The Third Mountain Elder
          looked fierce, a blinding light floating around him. It was the light
          from the aura of a True Daoist. A golden mountain floated behind him
          indistinctly, which could even crush the universe, and its aura swept
          through the battlefield. This was his ultimate technique.

          >&#8220;Now!&#8221; The other Mountain Elders immediately shouted as
          soon as they saw this. They moved their hands to evoke their strongest
          techniques, which exuded the brightest light. Their artifacts also
          glowed brightly as if powerful ancient deities were awakening. They
          had already seen a gap in Gu Changge&#8217;s defences. They knew they
          had to attack simultaneously or they wouldn&#8217;t have any other
          chance.</span

          emanating from her.</span

          >&#8220;You came just in time, Second Mountain Elder. We tried to kill
          him together but his strength is unfathomable…&#8221; The other
          Mountain Elders looked surprised yet hopeful to see the Second
          Mountain Elder, thus pleading with him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were all wounded, with blood all over them, and their usually
          formidable auras felt weak. Even the Third Mountain Elder, who was
          always at odds with him, had a weak aura and sustained terrible
          wounds. They had no other choice but to ask the Second Mountain Elder
          for help, as he was stronger than the Third Mountain Elder. In fact,
          the Second Mountain Elder was currently the strongest in the Nine
          Great Mountains, behind the mysterious Supreme Elder.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Just who are you in the Upper Realm to have managed to achieve
          this at your age?&#8221; The Second Mountain Elder looked serious as
          this was the first time he had seen such a terrifying youth.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This young man had fought against multiple Elders of the Nine Great
          Mountains alone. He even had the upper hand. He also did not even show
          any sign of injury. If this stretched on for a little longer, everyone
          would have died. The Second Mountain Elder also noticed that the Ninth
          Mountain Elder&#8217;s aura had disappeared, which could only mean
          that he had already died before his arrival.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Are all of you present? I&#8217;ve been waiting for you for
          some time.&#8221; Gu Changge did not reply, smiling at the Second
          Mountain Elder instead. Since the Second Mountain Elder was here, that
          meant that his plan had worked.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Family of Protectors of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains had
          been massacred more than 20 years ago. Though most of its members had
          died back then, some still remained and had fled. Xiao Yang had merely
          been one of them. Gu Changge was planning to seek out the final
          remnants of the Family of Protectors via Xiao Yang. After all, their
          Sources and Talents were extraordinary. Not only could they summon
          Immortal Heroic Souls, but they could also reverse Yin and Yang and
          remould Dao Fruits. They were extremely useful to him, so he had sent
          Gu Wudi as his secret pawn to stay beside Xiao Yang.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; The Second Mountain Elder
          felt alarmed by his expression, as the youth frightened him immensely
          and surpassed all logic.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for you so I can kill all of you, of
          course.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled serenely, and a Dao Flask appeared
          above his head. It resembled a bottomless black hole and shone with
          dark light. All terrifying vibrations were easily consumed by it and
          even the universe was seemingly swallowed by it as the sky
          darkened.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is…&#8221;</span></p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It is as those rumours… how is it possible?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Mountain Elders were all frightened by this. The Second Mountain
          Elder froze at first before his expression became stricken. He looked
          like he already understood something.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Mountain Elders all tried to escape but all of a sudden, a giant
          spear surrounded by intertwining Demonic Qi sliced towards them. The
          universe before them felt like it had been split apart from the force,
          with pieces of the River of Time fluttered around it.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >One of the Elders quickly activated the most powerful ability he had
          ever used in his life, making his body glow, but he still
          couldn&#8217;t dodge in time. All his techniques, treasures, and
          abilities collapsed, followed by his body splitting from its centre
          into multiple parts, with the ensuing spray of blood lingered in the
          air.</span
        >
      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Run! What he had on him in a Tool of World Destruction!&#8221;
          The voice of the Second Mountain Elder shook as he came back to
          himself. He quickly transformed into a divine rainbow so he could tear
          apart space and flee; the other Mountain Elders realised this as well
          but it was far too late. A terrifying black fog surged in from the
          edges of the universe, seemingly rooting the space into space.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The power spread to the outside of the universe as stars exploded and
          turned into ashes. Even the Milky Way rotated in the opposite
          direction as countless Principles were haphazardly flickering about.
          The sky and land were in total chaos, as even pieces from the River of
          Time faintly appeared. It was a chaotic sight. No war that involved
          Nirvana Realm experts had had such a great area of impact before, as
          even the surrounding universe was affected. Several smaller worlds had
          already exploded, leading to the meaningless deaths of many.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many Mountain Elders displayed their strongest abilities, which was
          enough to shake the sky. However, it was futile.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A giant hand stretched into the sky and to the ground, its strike
          capable of reaching another universe and terrifying all. In front of
          this giant hand, screams of terror or rage soon return back to
          silence.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This whole universe was now battered and broken, with aftershocks
          from the battle lingering as well as splatters of blood and bone
          everywhere. Shattered artifacts were scattered everywhere, now reduced
          to nothing more than scrap.</span

          >&#8220;Except for the Supreme Mountain Elder, all the rest have been
          dealt with.&#8221; In the silence, a beautiful woman in white landed
          next to Gu Changge. She had flawless features and a tall slender
          figure. She looked otherworldly and perfect, yet she didn&#8217;t look
          too well. She had been hit badly and there was even blood on her
          clothes.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her expression was conflicted as she spoke. since she would have been
          hurt even more seriously if Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t moved to help her
          after dealing with her own opponents. She might be powerful but she
          was still inferior compared to the might of three True Daoists. Thus,
          she remained at a disadvantage.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had now seen abilities Gu Changge had never displayed before and
          felt fearful; even the Third Mountain Elder had instantly broke into
          pieces from his attack.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;This was just the fated result.&#8221; Gu Changge sat
          cross-legged, not opening his eyes even after hearing her speak. An
          aura as monstrous as the sea exuded from him, and the entire universe
          seemed to transform as he meditated. Constellations dimmed and the
          galaxy surged towards him. There even was a crimson-coloured cocoon
          surrounding him, which comprised thick Qi and blood. It was an
          astounding sight to see.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Stars and constellations shone brilliantly, as light concentrated on
          the area as Sources of all the True Daoists entered Gu Changge&#8217;s
          body. Every single pore glowed like an ancient world. As Gu Changge
          opened his mouth and growled, causing the stars to tremble.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!* The sky shook as if an ocean was sweeping towards the land.
          All light was consumed by Gu Changge, like he had transformed into a
          black hole which could swallow up the heavens. Principles collapsed
          and broke into pieces as they entered his mouth.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His cultivation had thus improved once again. His blood, flesh,
          organs, bones, and hair all reflected Chaos Qi. He now looked much
          more powerful than before. This sight continued for half a month
          before the universe eventually quieted down. No being dared approach
          to investigate as the deaths of True Daoists were too frightening to
          behold. Likewise, some strange phenomena hadn&#8217;t completely
          dissipated yet. After all, one drop of these True Daoists&#8217; blood
          could completely penetrate a small world and any lingering aftershocks
          from it was enough to kill.</span

          >[The Fifth-Order Quasi-Nirvana Realm. I&#8217;m now several steps
          closer to the Path of Nirvana.] Gu Changge got up and opened his eyes,
          his aura calming down. It now resembled a deep ocean.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He looked towards the Second Mountain Elder, whose strength had been
          bound, and approached him.

          apart, Even so, Gu Changge could not let him die just yet. He was Xiao
          Yang&#8217;s Master and thus still held some other value. That was why
          Gu Changge had left him alive.</span

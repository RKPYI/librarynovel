        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Proofreader: </strong><span style="color: #00ffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color><strong>Silavin </strong></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shower of silver light beams rained down from the different Domains of the Upper Realm, falling down from the space boundaries and into the vast Lower Realm. </span><span id="more-34838"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless had seen the bright and majestic silver meteor shower, with powerful cultivators attempting to deduce their source but suffering a severe backlash which shocked them. Many Families with expertise in deduction and divination even recorded the phenomena, feeling that the Upper Realm might welcome another golden era in the next few years. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bright shimmering silver meteors were the immature seeds which would bloom and shine brilliantly in this era.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the shock and terror the Upper Realm Forces felt, those in the Lower Realm, infinitely far away, welcomed the tremendous change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge sat cross-legged in Mortal Palace, his Dharma Body enormous and ancient while divine phenomena played within his glowing eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Mmmmm!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As his consciousness flickered, numerous indistinct scenes from ancient times manifested in the void before him. The scenes were extremely numerous and uncountable, seemingly connected to worlds of unknown dimensions in which billions of beings appeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This heavy rain of cheats is a special gift for them, but I wonder how many of those Fortuitous Ones could actually make use of it?&#8221; Gu Changge muttered. Billions of strings of fate stretched within the ether from his location to every Domain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the rain of cheats had been a spontaneous decision, every move or thought at his current cultivation evel would result in unimaginable effects. His trivial move of using the Power of Faith as a medium to create cheats and attract Fortuituous Ones from the myriad of worlds to be his followers could cause a tsunami-like cascade of events. Nevertheless, he was eager for that day to arrive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu was puzzled about what he was doing. From her point of view, the scenes playing out seemed to come from the corners of the Upper Realm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew that this was the application of the Power of Faith. While the techniques of Mortal Palace could do this too, they couldn&#8217;t manifest influence to all of the Upper Realm as Gu Changge had done, since that not only required an enormous amount of Power of Faith as a medium but it also required the caster to have a terrifying level of mental strength to support it. The average True Daoists could never accomplish this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Interesting…&#8221; Something manifested within Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze which he couldn&#8217;t help but praise quietly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu moved close to him from the front to stare at the scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I saw an interesting youth. I am certain he will surprise me tremendously in the future.&#8221; He smiled while his gaze turned warm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene before him was blurry and indistinct, only enabling one to make out some outlines. The world was raining heavily and looked very gloomy, where a youth dressed in tattered clothes and covered in blood was being hunted by someone. His eyes were filled with anger and rebellion as he fought with his pursuers, not yielding even though he was already approaching a cliff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is most likely a faraway Lower Realm World…&#8221; Jiang Chuchu frowned. She had already noticed the youth Gu Changge spoke of, but she couldn&#8217;t see anything special about the youth. In fact, he seemed completely useless to her. However, there must definitely be something extraordinary about this youth if he was so valued by Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An ant may possess the willpower to defeat something much stronger than it. Why have you not considered the possibility of a mortal having the same ability?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled, continuing to study the scene. His gaze seemed to cross an infinite distance to land on the youth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Argh….&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chu Xue, I treated you like my beloved. Why have you done such a thing to me? Why haven&#8217;t you been brave enough to see me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The youth covered in blood stood above the cliff as he let out an angry and desperate scream like an endangered beast. The pursuing soldiers surrounded him and forced him back against the cliff. The freezing wind was filled with a rotting scent which chilled everyone to the bone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wang Qi, you are such a useless bastard. You can&#8217;t tell the difference even now? I shall gladly accept your Black Realm Breakthrough Pill; when I reach the Spiritual Sea Realm, I can become a disciple of the Black Spirit Sect and live happily ever after with Brother Song. I shall always remember your kindness.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slender girl with fine features emerged from behind the soldiers while shaking her head, accompanied by a scholarly-looking tall young man who was looking at the youth with a cold mocking gaze. Both of them wore clean lavish clothes, their expressions extremely condescending; they looked to belong to a completely different world compared to the pitiful youth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hatred flared within Wang Qi&#8217;s eyes at their appearance, his entire body shaking while he gritted his teeth. He had been tricked by Chu Xue into going to the City Lord&#8217;s manor and risking his life to steal the Black Realm Breakthrough Pill. He had thought he could win her heart after doing so, but her entire demeanour had changed after seeing it. She didn&#8217;t just want to steal it but also sent people to kill him in order to tie up any loose ends.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Black Realm Breakthrough Pill was very important, he had already gained the attention of the experts of the City Lord&#8217;s manor. She merely wanted him to be a scapegoat while she savoured the fruits of his labour; such evilness was unfathomable. When Wang Qi realised this though, it was already too late and now the City Lord&#8217;s experts had gone to his home to get the Pill back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I survive this, I will make sure to take your life.&#8221; Wang Qi glared at her angrily and murderously as he spat out the words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You need to survive first though. No one can save you tonight, and the Wang Family shall follow in your footsteps because of your actions.&#8221; Chu Xue was seemingly enraged by the look in his eyes; her cold expression turned livid as her voice became sharp. &#8220;You dare fancy me when you are so useless? You are suicidal. We can&#8217;t let you just die so easily. Someone go and destroy his Dantian, then throw him off the cliff.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she finished the order, many soldiers came up and caught hold of the already seriously injured Wang Qi. They destroyed his Dantian as he watched them angrily and hatefully.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a thick fog beneath the cliff, and the atmosphere was made colder and more gloomy due to the rain. Wang Qi was thrown directly off the cliff and was soon swallowed by the darkness without any noise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Chu Xue and the rest had left, a blinding bolt of silver lightning which resembled a snarling silver dragon shot downwards and right to the bottom of the cliff without anyone seeing it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that the youth&#8217;s life-changing event?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu, who had been watching the scene unfold from Mortal Palace, couldn&#8217;t help but ask quietly when she saw the lightning strike. She knew that Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t focus on this youth without any reason, and it looked like this youth who hadn&#8217;t had any chance of surviving suddenly showed signs of life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Life-changing event? That sounds accurate as well, but I think it should be called a cheat.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and looked away from the scene, already expecting what was about to happen. The youth Wang Qi would be struck with a mysterious bolt of lightning, which restored his shattered Dantian and he would acquire a mysterious heavenly technique. After that, he would personally kill Chu Xue in revenge and thus reign over the world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the typical life story of a Fortuitous One, but Gu Changge had inserted a lot of information about Dark Heaven into that silver bolt of lightning so that his plan would go smoothly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Qi would understand everything when he woke up. Naturally, other Fortuitous Ones from all walks of life would be the same and become his pawns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu nodded with slight understanding as she felt he was implying something else. However, that wasn&#8217;t what she should be thinking about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The next Fortuitous One…&#8221; Gu Changge looked at the other scenes that had manifested. There were in fact plenty of Fortuitous Ones like Wang Qi who had been born in accordance with the Fortuity of their respective worlds and could stir up great storms. Besides, one world would not only give rise to only one of them. To Gu Changge, they weren&#8217;t just his pawns but also tools to reap Fortuity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge eventually left after remaining in Mortal Palace for nearly a month. Jiang Chuchu did not make him stay even though she was reluctant to let him go. She was already satisfied since Gu Changge took a month off from his busy life to accompany her, so she wasn&#8217;t going to demand anything else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving Mortal Palace, Gu Changge had originally planned to go to Peach Village and see his acquired disciple Yao Yao. Considering that Gu Xianer was still missing and uncontactable, it wasn&#8217;t appropriate for him to go there and so he gave up the idea.</span></p>

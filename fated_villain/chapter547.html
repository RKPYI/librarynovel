          had rushed there were all gathered with solemn expressions. The place
          was tranquil and had a stone arch bridge, rock formations, and
          pavilions which added to the elegant charm of the area, yet the

          While some of them hadn&#8217;t been at the Stone-gathering Square,
          they knew what had transpired via different sources. The information
          made them feel frustrated and infuriated as well as unwilling. She was
          the eldest heiress of the An Clan and was the face of their family,
          yet she had been humiliated in such a way by Gu Changge in
          Stone-gathering Square. They had to swallow their anger and cautiously
          put on fake smiles. How could they stand such an embarrassing

          other Forces who cannot stand it. We don&#8217;t have to interfere in
          this at all. He&#8217;s growing stronger by the day, but so what? He
          shines too brilliantly and has already broken the harmony which had
          lasted for eons, so he will get his comeuppance.&#8221;</span

          rage flickering within his gaze. He looked extremely old and frail yet
          exuded a terrifying aura. Had he not arrived in time, the consequences
          would have been unimaginable. Gu Changge might act more flagrantly and
          kill An Xi on the spot.</span

          battlefield in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. The
          garden-variety True Daoist could never win against him. Plus, he was
          only in his early twenties and similar in age to An Xi. Every Force
          was already wary of Gu Changge and the Immortal Gu Family, including
          the An Clan. Otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t have humbled himself that
          much and even made An Xi apologise voluntarily.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, An Wangshan believed that if Gu Changge continued on this
          way, he would soon become targeted by the Forces of the Upper Realm.
          All they needed was an opportunity and a suitable excuse. The Immortal
          Gu Family might be powerful, but could they antagonise the rest of the
          Upper Realm? That was impossible.</span

          brilliance. However, not learning to keep it in would cause
          issues,&#8221; An Wangshan said lightly, his narrowed eyes
          flashing.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I understand, Grand Uncle.“ An Xi nodded in understanding. She
          still felt frustrated, but she could only suppress the feeling of
          humiliation.</span

          >&#8220;Oh, yes. I heard that An Yan has been restless lately.&#8221;
          He asked as if recalling something. When talking about An Yan, there
          was a golden flash in his eyes which seemed meaningful.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Sir, she has really been very restless and is no longer as
          humble as before. She seems to show some inclinations towards the
          position of head of the family. However, she&#8217;s just an immature
          young girl. While she had silently suppressed herself all this time,
          she could never win against me. Don&#8217;t worry, Grand Uncle.&#8221;

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her expression became briefly dismissive before she shook her head.
          She knew that An Yan, her younger sister from a different mother,
          wasn&#8217;t as innocent as she showed herself to be. An Yan had
          always been wary and cautious in her behaviour, and her status in the
          family was inferior to even the most ordinary Direct Disciple. Thus,
          An Xi did not wish to waste any time and effort on her younger sister.
          In her opinion, her future place as head of the family was guaranteed
          and no one could take it from her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You need to watch out for her. I saw her getting quite close
          with Gu Xianer in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. I refuse to
          believe that she doesn&#8217;t have any ulterior motives.&#8221; An
          Wangshan stroked his beard.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As an Ancestor of the An Clan, he naturally wanted An Xi to take
          control of the family. An Yan, who was the current family head&#8217;s
          daughter like An Xi, was the greatest obstacle in that regard.
          However, due to the premature death of An Yan&#8217;s mother, many
          other Ancestors and elders were somewhat caring towards her and so he
          couldn&#8217;t just get rid of her directly.</span

          >&#8220;Getting close with Gu Xianer? Does she want to garner strength
          from a third party? Ha! In her dreams. Once I get the drop of True
          Blood from the Hidden Celestial and fully awaken Niu Tian&#8217;s
          bloodline, what can the other Ancestors say about that?&#8221; An Xi
          laughed coldly, a chilling smile spreading across her beautiful
          face.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          there&#8217;s a young man outside who wants to see you and claims to
          be your friend.&#8221;</span

          friends, since Successors of the other Immortal Forces were on good
          terms with her.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Let him in.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t think too much about it
          and assumed it was one of her admirers, who had heard of her
          humiliation and came to express his concern and reassurance. Soon, a
          tall attractive young man walked into the compound while being led by
          the servant.</span

          >&#8220;Who&#8217;re you? You claim to be my friend? Have we met
          before?&#8221; She frowned, studying the man with a glance. She was
          unfamiliar with him since she never knew him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          after all and we have a common enemy, so we are now friends.&#8221;
          The young man smiled serenely. He had an extraordinary air about him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Niu Tian, who was standing behind her, frowned slightly at the sight
          of the man. He felt like he had seen the other man before.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          little.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Y-you are Niu Tian?&#8221; The young man froze and became
          shocked as if he had just made a discovery. A look of surprise and
          delight appeared on his face and his voice shook as he stared at Niu
          Tian.</span

          several An Clan members, only those who had come with him to the Upper
          Realm in the first place knew who he was in this world. Now that he

          finally had their long-awaited emotional reunion. They were

          while and knowing each other&#8217;s recent exploits.</span

          best friend&#8217;s death and the humiliation of seeing his crush get

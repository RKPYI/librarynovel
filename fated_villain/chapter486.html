          energy. He stood before the ancient battleship like an undefeated war
          god, slicing his spear across the air. Wide cracks formed in the void
          which stretched tens of thousands of kilometres away while the Sword
          Qi approaching Gu Xianer all got destroyed by him. </span

          >His Quasi-Nirvana Realm aura spread in the air, pressing down the
          night sky. All the ancient beings were shocked as they sensed Ah
          Da&#8217;s power. The younger ones, meanwhile, looked enviously at Gu
          Xianer since they did not have a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert like that
          protecting them in secret. After all, Zhao Yunze&#8217;s strike had
          humiliated them and expended one of their protective amulets.</span

          mouth tilted up in a knowing expression. To her, Gu Changge was a
          dishonest man who would belittle her mercilessly but would protect her
          in various ways when she was in danger. [It would be best if I get to
          bully him.]

          >Meanwhile, Zhao Yunze stood far away in the Space Tunnel, his entire
          being glowing while exuding powerful surges of energy. Every strand of
          his hair shone brightly like blades. His expression darkened after
          seeing that his attack had failed, but he didn&#8217;t linger any
          longer and turned to step into the Space Tunnel. Terrifying energy
          rose and fell in the atmosphere, causing mist to swirl from the air
          currents elicited.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No! Are we going to let him escape now?&#8221; The ancient
          beings looked unhappy as they couldn&#8217;t stop him even with their
          attacks. This made them angry and frustrated since Zhao Yunze could
          never be so flagrant before a True Daoist of the Upper Realm.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!* Strong overwhelming energy began to exude from the deepest
          part of the universe nearby, causing the world to collapse and
          transform. Stars began to shake, nearly cracking and forming ashes due
          to the impact. The people of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, who
          had been escaping via the Space Tunnel, turned pale at once.</span
        >
      </p>

          Army…&#8221; Someone&#8217;s voice shook, a look of fear on his face.
          The sight of their supreme experts grievously injured had been so
          shocking that they shivered at the memory. Many others had turned pale
          due to their terror as well. The crowd quickly transformed into divine
          rainbows and fled into the Space Tunnel.</span

          >&#8220;The leader of the Upper Realm Army is back? Just in
          time!&#8221; Zhao Yunze&#8217;s expression shifted as he sensed the
          approaching energy. A bloodthirsty aura began emanating from him.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Come fight me! I would like to see how strong this man can
          be!&#8221; He roared, pausing in his retreat. His figure reappeared in
          the sky instantly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone watched in shock, not expecting him to desire a fight with
          Gu Changge instead of fleeing. His bravery was admirable!</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Si! Si! Si!*</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Beams of sword light appeared and illuminated the ruined universe,
          their energy enough to shake the heavens. Each one was as thick as a
          mountain range, rising into the clouds while emitting multicoloured
          light.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As Zhao Yunze released his attack, the millions of beams of Sword Qi
          clinked together. The world vibrated loudly while the universe seemed
          to split from the impact. Such a strike seemed to be powered by the
          force of the world which condensed into a destructive Sword Qi within
          him. Everyone began to quiver, feeling like their lives could easily
          be cut short at that instant.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the glimmer of another blade appeared within the universe
          like the sun rising. It contained an inconceivable strength,
          illuminating the entire world as it appeared. Its glitter was enough
          to strike fear in the hearts of countless worlds! It was much more
          domineering and made everyone feel anger, happiness, pain, or other
          emotions.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The two sword beams clashed in the depths of the universe with a
          sound resembling that of collapsing universes and mountains. It was
          like the eternal divine light had shone into the world and destroyed
          everything. Principles fell into chaos while the Great Dao collapsed,
          and great clouds of Chaos Qi surged towards every direction.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ancient battleships shook above, emitting innumerable runes into the
          void which then disappeared to counter the shockwave. Everyone did not
          dare look directly at the source, afraid that the brilliant light
          would wipe out their souls. Even Sacred Emperor Realm experts
          couldn&#8217;t discern what had happened, grunting as their eyes
          glowed brightly before bleeding.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The force eventually dissipated along with the light, cracks forming
          in the star-studded sky to reveal nothingness like it had been

          >&#8220;Young Master Changge doesn&#8217;t seem okay. Is he
          wounded?&#8221; Ancient beings of the Upper Realm frowned, sensing
          that something had gone wrong.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Judging by the sheer strength Gu Changge had displayed before, he
          would have easily injured Zhao Yunze seriously. This might mean that
          he wasn&#8217;t in a good condition. They sighed at that before the
          realisation struck them and made them feel relieved instead of
          surprised. They would be more doubtful had he been unharmed after
          battling the three True Daoists. His injured condition reassured them
          since that was normal.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[He&#8217;s really injured…] Gu Xianer frowned deeply, hand clutching
          at her dress unhappily. Gu Changge had feigned injury to trick her
          before, but he might be truly injured now and wasn&#8217;t faking it.
          After all, he had fought three True Daoists. This made her despise her
          insufficient strength, which prevented her from helping him.</span

          >&#8220;The Young Domain Ruler Yunze is truly the champion of his
          peers six hundred million years ago! He managed to match Gu
          Changge&#8217;s strength during an exchange!&#8221; Young prodigies of
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, watching this from the golden
          Space Tunnel, felt exhilarated as they watched this scene. Lin Wu,
          Xiao Yang, and the others began to gain respect for Zhao Yunze since
          he managed to counter Gu Changge in an effort to turn the tide.

          age as you, so this isn&#8217;t something to rejoice over. If the two
          had been of the same age, the Young Domain Ruler would have been
          killed with a palm strike!&#8221; Someone quickly rained on their
          parade with a grave expression and cold words.</span

          only manage to block Gu Changge&#8217;s strike in time, which made
          them sober up. Given more time, even the barriers of Sky Deer City
          wouldn&#8217;t be able to hinder Gu Changge. This monstrosity was
          formidable enough to make anyone lose their will to fight!</span

          weaker than before. He probably isn&#8217;t in a good condition after
          fighting with the three True Daoists, or he would have defeated Young
          Domain Ruler Yunze easily. I&#8217;m not sure if this is something to
          be happy or worried about.&#8221; Several Elders stared sharply at the
          white-clothed man walking from the faraway depths of the universe,

          fall into an uneasy and troubled silence. Their realm didn&#8217;t
          have the upper hand in the war against the Upper Realm, and now here
          was a monstrosity like Gu Changge. This man&#8217;s presence made the
          situation much more difficult for them.</span

          young, extraordinary, handsome, and refined, with a celestial aura he
          exuded. His movements could elicit earthquakes; while he looked like
          any other mortal, his footsteps seemed to resonate in the universe.
          Everyone present felt their heart squeeze tightly as if grabbed by a
          pair of enormous hands.</span

          glittering brightly as he stared at Gu Changge, who was shining
          equally brilliantly. However, his entire body shook as he groaned and
          spat out a mouthful of blood, while his energy quickly faded.</span

          and Ten Domains Army, who looked on in disbelief. Why had Zhao Yunze
          suddenly spat blood when he looked fine just a moment ago? Had he been
          hurt before this but then forced down the feeling? The two sides had
          battled after all. Why else would he suddenly spit blood?</span

          died. Even if they did, they wouldn&#8217;t suspect him. Instead, they
          would think it had been a secret plot by others from the Upper Realm
          to kill off the three fleeing True Daoists.</span

          >Zhao Yunze&#8217;s expression turned frigid as he sensed Gu
          Changge&#8217;s calm yet undisguised intention to kill, then snorted.
          &#8220;You can try.&#8221;</span

          Yunze would be in danger after being targeted by Gu Changge.
          Encountering such a terrifying and unimaginable man would make anyone
          else anxious since even Young Domain Ruler Yunze was weaker than Gu
          Changge in his prime.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Zhao Yunze&#8217;s expression darkened and he turned away without
          another word. Waving his arm, he stepped into the golden Space Tunnel
          behind him where the army had amassed in preparation to leave. The
          Space Tunnel had been built and stabilised by a supreme expert from a
          faraway land and thus was difficult to destroy. Otherwise, they
          wouldn&#8217;t have been so confident.</span

          Wastelands and Ten Domains left. Gu Changge remained standing, his
          expression unchanging as he watched them disappear without doing
          anything.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Upper Realm army behind him did not dare speak out of turn and
          remained silent. If not for him, Zhao Yunze would have put them
          through much more. The Upper Realm army had already won this battle,
          so they shouldn&#8217;t pursue a desperate enemy who might fight back
          and cause them further losses. The other side had already suffered a
          powerful blow, with only less than one-tenth of their army
          successfully escaping.</span

          sects went up to him and asked him respectfully, &#8220;Young Master
          Changge, can you explain the army in the Aether Abyss?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This was something that had puzzled them. They didn&#8217;t expect
          him to place military forces of the Upper Realm within the depths of
          the Aether Abyss, whose sudden charge had taken the other side by
          surprise. They wanted to know if he knew the right path through the
          Aether Abyss.</span

          seen, I&#8217;ve already known of the correct path through the Aether
          Abyss.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;I see. You are truly admirable since you have done something
          we all couldn&#8217;t. We are truly astounded.&#8221; Many ancient
          beings became shocked after obtaining a clear answer, yet did not dare
          enquire further. Gu Changge would never conceal such a thing when the
          Upper Realm would gain so much from it, but this looked to be
          connected to the extinction of the Nine Great Mountains. Many youths
          looked conflicted as they remembered that while they were fighting
          with the younger cultivators from the other side, Gu Changge had
          scared an entire world with his mere presence.</span

          >The Upper Realm Army soon began their victorious march back, enormous
          clusters of ancient battleships, flying boats and demonic mountains
          moving across the universe back to their camp. Now that they knew the
          right way inside the Aether Abyss, the next course of action was to
          discuss how they could invade Sky Deer City. It was their final
          obstacle after dealing with the Nine Great Mountains and the Aether
          Abyss, which made them feel motivated.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Every being and cultivator looked excited and overjoyed since this
          battle had been the fastest and easiest one in the countless years of
          war between the two sides. Gu Changge&#8217;s reputation in the Upper
          Realm was now at an all-time high, with many of the young generation
          discussing him reverently and feverishly at nearly every moment.</span

          >Colourful fog swirled in the majestic palace as Gu Changge sat on his
          bed within, strands of Chaos Qi floating and weaving around him
          faintly. The scene made him resemble a young Immortal Emperor.</span

          >&#8220;Are you badly injured?&#8221; Gu Xianer&#8217;s voice rang out
          suddenly. Her skirts fluttered as she walked, making her look slender,
          while her eyes held a cold yet ethereal aura. She was one of the very
          few who could enter his palace without her visits being reported to
          him. She went up close to the man who appeared to be recuperating and
          couldn&#8217;t help asking him a question.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          his eyes and glanced at her. &#8220;Why are you here?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was like he wasn&#8217;t happy to see her, which made her want to
          roll her eyes at him since she was there to express concern for him.
          However, she had gotten used to his behaviour and wasn&#8217;t
          surprised by it, choosing to retort, &#8221; Of course, I&#8217;m here
          to visit you. Your wounds don&#8217;t look too bad so you won&#8217;t
          die that early.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So you are here to mock me?&#8221; he asked with interest,
          grabbing her face which was close to his.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Let me go. I&#8217;m here because I was worried.&#8221; She
          was annoyed since this bastard loved to bully her when he got the
          chance. [How infuriating!]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it obvious?&#8221; He smiled at her. Seeing her
          all puffed up with anger delighted him because she acted like a cold
          and proud goddess who refused to mix with mere mortals with others and
          even talked back to him mercilessly whenever she wanted.</span

          >&#8220;How can I help you? You cannot utilise the healing items I
          have.&#8221; She was displeased since his current strength enabled him
          to battle with True Daoists. Normal healing items wouldn&#8217;t be
          effective on him. How could she find such items?</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Xianer choked on her breath since that wasn&#8217;t her intention.
          It wasn&#8217;t really her fault though. She could ask several Elders
          about it had she been in the Peach Village, but it was hard to find
          healing items here. Anyone else possessing them would hide them
          carefully too; having one such item during the fight between the two
          realms would be equivalent to gaining another life.</span

          I&#8217;ve come to see you? You can heal faster because of that

      <h4>Chapter 134: To Kill or Not to Kill; You Decide!</h4>
      <p><b>“How’s your injury?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge casually asked Gu Xian’er, who stood behind him, with an
        expression that didn’t show much care for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er, on the other hand, had her mind in a mess, so she responded
        to him with a snort.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Huh? What kind of response is that?”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge raised his eyebrow and asked.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, he knew that Gu Xian’er only received some minor injuries and
        her wounds weren’t as bad as they looked, but right now, even if she
        wasn’t wounded badly, she had to pretend like she was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er wasn’t dumb — she understood the meaning behind Gu Changge’s
        words, and even though her voice still held its coldness, she said in a
        low and aggrieved tone,
        <b
          >“The injury is serious; many of my bones shattered, and all of my
          internal organs were displaced! If you hadn’t arrived in time, I would
          have probably died here alone, without anyone to collect my
          corpse…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er showed a sad expression and almost sobbed as she said those
        words, and that aroused the desire to weep in the hearts of those who
        witnessed her condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many young men in the surroundings couldn’t help but feel pity for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Your injuries are that bad?! The Sea King Palace has gone too
          far!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s expression remained unchanged, but his eyes darkened with
        every passing moment, and he said,
        <b>“No one has ever bullied my, Gu Changge’s, sister!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, he praised the little girl’s wit in his heart — she
        was indeed not stupid and knew to cooperate with him at the moment.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Tell me, how do you want to die?”</b></p>
      <p>
        After that, Gu Changge looked at the creatures of the Sea King Palace in
        front of him and asked with a dreadful tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivators in the surroundings shuddered when they heard his words,
        and couldn’t help but panic.
      </p>
      <p>‘How do you want to die?’</p>
      <p>
        That sentence containing endless murderous intent sounded so natural
        when coming from Gu Changge’s mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        They had a hunch that they would witness a bloody storm in front of them
        in a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expressions of everyone from the Sea King Palace changed after they
        listened to his words, and their faces paled. The worst of their bunch
        were the two Young Supremes who tried to murder Gu Xian’er before — they
        couldn’t help but take a few steps back.
      </p>
      <p>After all, the person in front of them was Gu Changge!</p>
      <p>
        As soon as he made a move, their Seventh Princess was injured and her
        mount exploded, even.
      </p>
      <p>His strength was outrageous!</p>
      <p>
        Before that, they were told that Gu Changge wouldn’t stand up for Gu
        Xian’er; not just them, even the Seventh Princess never expected
        something like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, don’t go too far! If you insist on backing Gu
          Xian’er…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then, the Seventh Princess opened her mouth with a gloom-stricken
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, before she could finished her words, Gu Changge interrupted her
        and said with a playful expression,
        <b
          >“Your Sea King Palace tried to hunt and murder my sister, and now you
          threaten me for helping her? Just what’s the meaning behind your
          actions? Besides, you haven’t answered my question, Seventh Princess;
          I asked, how do you want to die?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s aggressive attitude irritated the Seventh Princess, and her
        expression uglified and she said,
        <b>“Gu Changge, don’t act like you can do whatever you want!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Aren’t you a Young Supreme known as the Reincarnation or a True
          Immortal, so do you think bullying others suits your image? Do you
          really think my Sea King Palace is easy to bully?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, Gu Changge was a single person now no matter how strong
        he might be. Even if he summoned the Disciples of the Heavenly Immortal
        Dao Palace, it wouldn’t be possible for him to go against the Sea King
        Palace and come out on top.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their clash would likely end up in a lose-lose situation for both sides,
        allowing the rest of the Young Supremes to reap the benefits without
        putting in any effort, so she didn’t want to confront Gu Changge right
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for avenging her brother? She would do that after finding another
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, what enraged her still was the fact that when Gu Changge
        arrived here, he didn’t ask them why they were trying to kill Gu
        Xian’er, and directly asked how they wanted to die.
      </p>
      <p>What’s more? He repeated those words twice.</p>
      <p>
        His arrogant attitude, contempt, and indifference left a sour taste in
        the Seventh Princess’ mouth as she couldn’t bring herself to hold back
        her rage.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, she was the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace who could
        dominate over countless Young Supremes and Geniuses of the Sea King
        Palace without much effort, and her identity wasn’t any worse than Gu
        Changge’s either, yet even then, Gu Changge held so much confidence and
        arrogance when talking to her.
      </p>
      <p>How could she, a Young Supreme, endure such humiliating treatment?</p>
      <p><b>“I am bullying you?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he heard her words, and
        said with even more indifference,
        <b>“Sure, I am bullying you! So what are you going to do about it?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er, who was standing behind Gu Changge, felt her heart tremble
        when she heard his words and lowered her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the people of the Sea King Palace were chasing after her, the
        Seventh Princess had a tyrannical and domineering attitude — she said
        that she was stronger than her so she could do whatever she wanted, or
        something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, Gu Changge said similar words in front of all the creatures of
        the Sea King Palace, and that filled her heart with complex and
        unspeakable emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge standing in front of her…his figure gave her relief, and she
        felt like she wanted to rely on him even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, Gu Xian’er understood that Gu Changge was merely putting on
        an act in front of the outsiders. The reason he came to save her was
        probably to make up for what he did back then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complicated thoughts tangled Gu Xian’er’s mind. In fact, after Gu
        Changge took that blade slash from her, he no longer owed her anything
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more? She had the means to escape safely, yet Gu Changge still
        showed up in front of her at a critical moment to stand up for her.
      </p>
      <p>Yet she…she said such hurtful words to him before…</p>
      <p>Gu Xian’er felt guilt and regret well up in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        When she made claims about having a good relationship with him, she
        actually carried a bit of hope…a bit of hope for Gu Changge…she expected
        him to show up but never saw him in the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, since you are going to say that, then how should we
          settle the matter about your sister killing my brother?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess’ expression sank and she gritted her teeth when she
        listened to his words, and questioned in a cold tone.
      </p>
      <p>She no longer wanted to make peace with Gu Changge!</p>
      <p>
        Strands of brilliance appeared around her golden spear as she clenched
        it tightly, and its sharpness intensified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s clearly wasn’t willing to give her any face — he was
        completely unrelenting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“What are you going to do about it? Go down and accompany him?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said.</p>
      <p>
        After that, his figure vanished from its spot and he disappeared into
        the void. When he reappeared again, he was standing in front of the
        Seventh Princess.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess’ pupils shrank and a chill went down her spine —
        the onlookers showed a similar response, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her followers showed a drastic change and shock in their expression.
        They didn’t sense the slightest spatial fluctuation, yet Gu Changge was
        already standing in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>What kind of speed was that?</p>
      <p>
        Was he able to scale the horizon at godspeed, or did he figure out a way
        to shrink miles into inches?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, before they could react, they felt a terrifying aura
        burst forth from the empty space in front of them; at the same time,
        they felt a bright sun press down on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It was his honor to die at Xian’er’s hand! Since you dare to touch
          Xian’er, then you can go and accompany your brother in the
          underworld.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        As Gu Changge said those words, a dazzling sword light appeared from the
        Void in front of him. The sword light released a clanging sound, and
        sparks splattered in the surroundings — the terrifying edge of the sword
        light resembled an Immortal Sword that could cleave the Heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more sword lights bloomed from his fingers as he pointed them in
        front of him like a sword. Sword after sword appeared in the sky and
        hung above the world with the intent to fall and tear apart the universe
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the [Infinite Immortal Wisdom] was a supreme offensive
        technique meant for the Primordial Spirits, Gu Changge could bring forth
        its might in other ways, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        It didn’t involve the use of Spiritual Qi though, but the application of
        the Natural Laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, [Transcendence] brought a qualitative change to his control
        over his countless Mystical Abilities!
      </p>
      <p>
        These sword lights were formed by Natural Laws, and they could destroy
        any cultivator’s Mystical Abilities unless they could bring forth
        Natural Laws of the same level to resist him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could deal with these Young Supremes even without revealing his true
        might with these abilities.
      </p>
      <p>They were nothing but fish on a chopping block in front of him.</p>
      <p>
        Right then, countless of Gu Changge’s followers also appeared in the
        surrounding mountains and started to besiege the creatures of the Sea
        King Palace, killing many of them. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>A great battle broke out.</p>
      <p><b>[Chi!]</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge walked forward with a leisurely and calm expression.</p>
      <p>
        His fingers fell down and the void in front of him blurred — the sword
        lights clanged, as if a terrifying Immortal Sword was unsheathed, and
        the sword intent hung high in the sky like a wispy, large galaxy.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Puff!]</b></p>
      <p><b>“Don’t…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Blood splattered in the Void as a terrifying expression appeared on the
        face of the male Young Supreme with a golden fish body; his face paled,
        and he desperately tried to escape with feelings of regret and pleas of
        mercy.
      </p>
      <p>
        His entire body turned cold, and even his Primordial Spirit trembled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, his entire figure was enveloped by a terrifying killing
        intent!
      </p>
      <p>
        He wanted to resist, and for that, he sacrificed his strongest weapon
        that released all of its Mystical Power like a surging tide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The divine light of the weapon surged like a flood, and held might that
        could obliterate False God Realm masters without issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas! The sword lights in front of him didn’t budge. The might of his
        weapon was reflected without effort, and the sword light penetrated his
        forehead between his eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        The protective brilliance around his body and Primordial Spirit were
        punctured without a hitch, and his soul directly turned into
        nothingness!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“What use would my overwhelming might be if you could resist it?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said calmly.</p>
      <p>
        His Cultivation Base was still in the Conferred King Realm, but he had
        clearly surpassed the level that was possible for those with a similar
        Cultivation Base.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, no one was shocked when the strength came from him.</p>
      <p>
        After all, he was someone who could slaughter a True God in seconds.
      </p>
      <p>‘This…is this Gu Changge’s real strength?’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er was stunned by the scene in front of her. She had always
        wanted to surpass Gu Changge, and also had some other goals, but she
        never expected Gu Changge’s strength to have reached such a point.
      </p>
      <p>
        What kind of swordsmanship was that? His ability was so terrifying, and
        it appeared as if he was born to kill.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Dead…”</b></p>
      <p><b>“A Young Supreme died just like that…”</b></p>
      <p>The creatures of the Sea King Palace were stunned and frightened.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the one in front of them was a Young Supreme in the Middle
        Stage of the Conferred King Realm, yet he died within seconds in Gu
        Changge’s hands — even his Primordial Spirit was annihilated.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s methods scared them.</p>
      <p>
        As a Young Supreme, that person had countless methods to save his life,
        yet in front of Gu Changge, he didn’t get the chance to use even one,
        and was killed with such ease!
      </p>
      <p>
        What did that mean? It meant that Gu Changge’s strength had surpassed
        the level they could resist!
      </p>
      <p>
        Who would dare to approach him when he had such a terror-inducing sword
        technique in his arsenal?
      </p>
      <p>
        There was endless sword energy falling down on them, as if it wanted to
        drown everything.
      </p>
      <p>‘It’s a sword art that can borrow the power of the Natural Laws…’</p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace was horrified at this
        moment. The power of the Natural Laws, something that could only be
        displayed by those in the Sacred Realm, was right now working in Gu
        Changge’s hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        This realization sent a chill down her spine, and even her Primordial
        Spirit trembled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young Supremes had a lot of methods, true, but she never expected Gu
        Changge to have such a card up his sleeve.
      </p>
      <p>
        From her point of view, Gu Changge had mastered an extremely terrifying
        sword technique that was beyond their fighting ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, unless she could bring out something on par with it, she
        wouldn’t be able to compete with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        She estimated that a random sword light from Gu Changge would instantly
        kill off a normal True God Realm cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Gu Changge must be consuming a lot of energy to support that terrifying
        sword art, so he wouldn’t be able to hold on for long!’
      </p>
      <p>‘I still have a chance! I can take the opportunity to kill him!’</p>
      <p>
        With that, she watched the female Young Supreme of the Shark-Dragon
        Family resist Gu Changge’s assault for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, unwilling and down in the dumps, the Young Supreme died in Gu
        Changge’s hands as the sword light pierced through her body. The
        brilliance in her eyes dimmed, and her vitality disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then, a hideous expression appeared on the Seventh Princess’ face
        as she realized she had no other choice left.
      </p>
      <p>If she didn’t kill Gu Changge now, then Gu Changge would kill her!</p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p><b>“Die!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Her figure turned into a golden flame, and her spear swept across the
        sky with a burning radiance, turning into a massive flash that could
        kill anything and everything!
      </p>
      <p>This was her strongest move!</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, she sacrificed a splendid red furnace. The moment she
        opened the furnace’s mouth, a monstrous fire containing traces of
        Natural Laws gushed out and turned into a divine chain that could
        incinerate everything in its path.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Scarlet Yang Furnace’s replica?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge raised his eyebrows as he recognized the furnace as the
        famous imitation of the Supreme Artifact of the Sea King Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The furnace released divine fire containing the power of Natural Laws,
        but he didn’t care about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just an imitation, so no matter how powerful it was, it could
        only exert might at the level of the True God Realm in the hands of the
        Seventh Princess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the battle between the Seventh Princess and Gu Changge broke out
        in front of the shocked gazes of the onlooking cultivators. Dazzling
        brilliance spread everywhere and mountain peaks collapsed one after
        another…it was as if stars were exploding in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sharp, dazzling brilliance made the cultivators close their eyes!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, the fake Scarlet Yang Furnace was blessed away with
        a clicking sound, and a blue-haired figure flew out, covered in blood;
        the figure had an embarrassing appearance and half of her body was blown
        apart.
      </p>
      <p>She looked ahead with a face full of disbelief and horror.</p>
      <p><b>“Why?!”</b></p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess was frightened right now, and couldn’t believe what
        she encountered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now, she and Gu Changge went head-to-head, yet even with her strong
        physique, she couldn’t do anything against him, and had her body almost
        blown to smithereens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, even the Scarlet Yang Furnace was blasted away by Gu Changge’s
        boundless sword energy, and the power of Natural Laws contained in her
        furnace couldn’t compete against him, at all!
      </p>
      <p>
        She believed Gu Changge’s Spiritual Qi wouldn’t last long because of
        that monstrous sword art, but that wasn’t the case.
      </p>
      <p>He wasn’t affected even in the slightest!</p>
      <p>This terrified her.</p>
      <p><b>“It’s because I am a lot stronger than you…a lot.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge showed a playful expression, and his figure disappeared from
        its spot. When he reappeared again, he was already standing in front of
        the Seventh Princess, who had a distorted face because of her
        unwillingness.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        She lifted up her previously-beautiful face, which now resembled a
        ghost’s, and said, <b>“Gu Changge, if you dare to kill me…”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        She had lost her previous Princess attitude, and was thoroughly afraid
        of death. Her Dao Heart collapsed completely the moment she lost to Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p><b>“I won’t kill you.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge interrupted her and then sealed her cultivation base and
        threw her directly in front of Gu Xian’er, who was still in a state of
        shock, and said with an intrigue-filled smile,
        <b
          >“Xian’er, your brother, I, will let you decide her fate. To kill or
          not to kill, you decide.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>He directly let Gu Xian’er decide the Seventh Princess’ fate.</p>

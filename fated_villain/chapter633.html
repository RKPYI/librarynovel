        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terrifying force hanging over the sky finally dispersed. However, a rift that spanned several thousands of kilometres remained.</span><span id="more-34798"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monstrous grey mists carrying Chaos Qi burst out from the rift and shot to the skies, enveloping the whole place in it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an apocalyptic sight, and the surroundings turned devastating even more so. The originally thriving Shu Sect was now in nothing but dust. The area had been blown up, and sheer chaos filled the scene as wails and cries reverberated through the space; fire spread as bones and blood scattered everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shockwaves caused during Gu Changge and the World’s Will&#8217;s fight were devastating. Even the Earth Sword Immortals could only duck and run away, not to mention everyone else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shu Sect&#8217;s defensive array blew up to bits and dispersed into the air at first instance, and the disciples of the Shu Sect blew up, even more so, into bits of flesh, bone shards, and bloody mist like weeds under the force of that one sliver of aftershock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place had turned into a living hell at this point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Earth Sword Immortals who rushed over later on, watched the scene in silence, unable to speak up for a long time. The Shu Sect, which had sat firmly atop the Profound Sword World for hundreds and thousands of years, was now in ruins and no longer existed in this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the fortunate Shu Sect Elders and disciples who survived, they watched the scene with devastation. Many wailed as well as they had a hard time accepting the great tragedy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shu Sect Master, the Abdunace Sword Immortal, too, was pale-faced as he clenched his fists tightly while his body trembled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything&#8217;s gone. Nothing is left…&#8221; he mumbled as endless pain poured from his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal, and the others, on the other hand, stood far away in silence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power shown earlier was far too terrifying. Be it Gu Changge or the World’s Will, neither were beings they could fight against. They were already extremely lucky to have been able to survive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this really the hope we are reliant on? But why would it try to kill us?&#8221; asked Princess Xuan Dea, who was still reeling in fright.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way they saw it, the World’s Will was their last hope in protecting the Profound Sword World. But just now, all living beings perished the moment the impassive and merciless bloody eyes swept its gaze across the land. It basically swatted them away like bugs. It was unbelievable that this was their last hope.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, even more divine rainbows came. They were all supreme experts of the Profound Sword World&#8217;s various Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene rendered them so dumbstruck that they couldn&#8217;t calm down for a long time, and they were even more appalled when they saw the pondering Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thought that Gu Changge could easily obliterate the Profound Sword World caused them great dread. This young man could even defeat the great World’s Will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, everyone&#8217;s gaze at Gu Changge was laced with fear and trepidation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No one will dare question Gu Changge from this day onwards…] sighed the Snow Sword Immortal when she came to her senses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, Gu Changge meant them no harm, or this could very easily become everyone&#8217;s greatest terror.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, Gu Changge came to himself after pondering for a long while. &#8220;Looks like the World’s Will has taken him away,&#8221; he mused while looking at the rift.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he had already obtained the Sword of World Domination, he would like to finish the job cleanly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was no major threat, he still didn&#8217;t want to let the man go so easily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Follow the rift, find him, and kill him,&#8221; said Gu Changge plainly, ordering Ah Da to hunt Tuo Ba Xiao Yao down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Master.&#8221; Ah Da instantly transformed into a black light and headed straight for the rift, disappearing in two shakes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hearts of the surrounding cultivators skipped a beat as they watched the scene envelope, yet none dared say a word.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu…&#8221; Pain laced the Abundance Sword Immortal and the others as they approached Gu Changge. Though the destruction of the Shu Sect had to do with Gu Changge, they dared not blame him for it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please forgive me. It wasn&#8217;t my wish to see the Shu Sect in ruins,&#8221; said Gu Changge with pity after glancing slightly at them, making the Abundance Sword Immortal smile wryly. &#8220;We understand. None of this would&#8217;ve happened if that man hadn&#8217;t suddenly attacked.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, resentment enveloped everyone else&#8217;s faces as they detested Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s escape. After all, he was part of the reason the Shu Sect had turned into ruins. Now, the Elders and disciples of the Shu Sect wanted to mangle the man.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That man might have fled, but as long as he&#8217;s still within our territory, we will certainly be able to catch him,&#8221; said the Abdunance Sword Immortal with a frosty gaze while a terrifying sword aura surfaced within his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why would the World’s Will attack the living beings of this world?&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal couldn&#8217;t help asking what was on everyone&#8217;s mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There seems to be something wrong with your World’s Will. It&#8217;s very different from the ones I recognise…&#8221; Revealed Gu Changge with slight bafflement while shaking his head lightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a chuckle escaped him when he saw that everyone was still baffled, and he continued, &#8220;Looks like the only way to find the answer is to first locate its place of slumber.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Its place of slumber?!&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and the others were astonished. It was their first time finding out that the World’s Will had a place of slumber. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Could the World&#8217;s Will that had appeared just now not be the real one?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please enlighten us, Young Master Gu,&#8221; requested the Yi Sword Immortal solemnly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chuckle escaped Gu Changge again as he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t actually know much about the World’s Will&#8217;s land of slumber. I&#8217;ve only heard about it from ancient records. Also, it&#8217;s time I head back to the Upper Realm. I have already gotten what I came for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? You&#8217;re leaving?&#8221; Everyone, even the other Earth Sword Immortals from the surrounding areas, was stunned, even wondering if they had misheard the man. [To think Gu Changge has no longing for the Profound Sword World! Is he really leaving just like this?!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Has Young Master Gu come just for the sword?] The Snow Sword Immortal was struck with an epiphany when she recalled the azure sword containing the power of Immortality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if that were the case. However, Gu Changge&#8217;s departure was too sudden, and it caught her off guard. Even the Abdunance Sword Immortal was dumbfounded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wouldn&#8217;t be terrible for the Profound Sword World if Gu Changge left just like that. After all, the man was fear-inducing, and it wouldn&#8217;t be an exaggeration to say he was invincible. Who knew what else would happen if he stayed?!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Gu Changge meant the Profound Sword World no harm as of the present. He wouldn&#8217;t aggressively invade and kill like the other Otherworldly Sky Demons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you really returning to the Upper Realm soon, Young Master Gu?&#8221; Ah Qing, who had stayed longest by Gu Changge&#8217;s side, couldn&#8217;t help asking as well as reluctance arose within her. She had expected this day to come. However, she didn&#8217;t think it would be this soon, and actually, she had quite a lot to do with Gu Changge coming to the Profound Sword World. If it weren&#8217;t to send her home, no doubt the man wouldn&#8217;t have come here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Honestly, it&#8217;s rather pointless for me to stay here,&#8221; said Gu Changge while shaking his head lightly as a hint of profoundness flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright, then.&#8221; Ah Qing&#8217;s gaze dimmed. &#8220;You&#8217;re from the world above, after all. You&#8217;re bound to leave this place someday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She actually really wanted to ask him to stay; help them deal with this scourge. But she was also aware that he had no obligations to help the Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princess Xuan Dea and the others wanted to say something too, but they didn&#8217;t know how to put it into words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, it was the Snow Sword Immortal who suddenly turned to Gu Changge and negotiated, &#8220;Can you please give us a pointer or two, Young Master Gu? We&#8217;re willing to pay any price.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was apparent to her that Gu Changge was hiding something from them. He didn&#8217;t really want to talk in length about the World’s Will&#8217;s place of slumber.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you willing to offer for my advice?&#8221; a chuckle escaped Gu Changge at that as a hint of dismissiveness laced his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abdunance Sword Immortal and the others, too, looked toward them with anticipation. The way they saw it, Gu Changge must know something. After all, he could rip apart the bloody eyes the World’s Will manifested. However, what could the Profound Sword World offer that was worth his attention!?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, they basically would not doubt anything Gu Changge said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Forget about the price; it&#8217;s fine,&#8221; sighed Gu Changge, feeling somewhat helpless. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you guys another hint, for Ah Qing&#8217;s sake. The answer you seek is on the World’s Will. The only thing you can do is to find its place of slumber quickly.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s the only way?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though many Earth Sword Immortals had figured that was the case, they were still shocked after hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s words, and many instantly pulled out their jade talismans to give the order right away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, the Thirteen States of the Profound Sword World were almost boundless, but they would eventually find something as long as they dispatched enough men for the search.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for the advice, Young Master Gu.&#8221; At that, the Snow Sword Immortal and the others turned grave and also speedily gave their orders without hesitation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded in response. However, he turned thoughtfully toward the rift in the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had sent the natives of the Profound Sword World on a wild goose chase for the World’s Will. He knew it was likely they wouldn&#8217;t hear any news in a short while. After all, the World’s Will likely wouldn&#8217;t show itself when Gu Changge has just injured it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the next few days, the entire Profound Sword World burst into a tumult. Many Forces had given up fighting the Otherworldly Sky Demons and began searching for clues, especially the various dangerous Forbidden Areas, attempting to search for their last hope.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge, on the other hand, ordered his men to send the Tools of World Domination in his possession back to the Upper Realm during this time, specifically to Yue Mingkong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was still one more thing to do before he could begin merging the seven Tools of World Domination. It would be difficult even for him to gather all the materials for the process in a short time. Hence, he had to ask Yue Mingkong to help out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It just so happened that he could put the key to the Immortal Palace Treasury under her safekeeping. He could unlock it after he was done dealing with the issues in the Profound Sword World.</span></p>

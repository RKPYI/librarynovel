          >&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Yaoxing,&#8221; the crowd behind her
          respectfully greeted the young man, in which he nodded and
          waved.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Let&#8217;s be on our way.&#8221; Hearing that, everyone
          turned into divine rainbows and fled to the mountains, as though in
          search of something.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, Yue Mingkong sat on his bed in the palace of
          Immortal Academy where divine lights loomed, and the Immortal Mist was
          dense. With her tall and slender figure, picturesque beauty, smooth
          and fair skin, she looked as if she came from the greatest artwork
          created by heaven.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At this moment, her delicate hands were flipping through an
          incomplete map that she looked at with squinted eyes. She began to
          have some thoughts.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Logically speaking, the Tower of World Domination will be born in
          this place. There might be a slight discrepancy in time, but it
          can&#8217;t possibly go wrong. The few forces nearby Sky Jade Mountain
          Range are Heavenly Ruin Gates, Ancient Sword Sect, Sunset Cave
          Heaven…]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She silently thought as her slender and flawless fingers landed on an
          area on the map.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge&#8217;s guess was right after all. Yue Mingkong had been
          busy looking for the Seven Tools of World Domination. She already had
          the Seal of World Domination and Mirror of World Domination in her
          hands. On top of that, she knew the whereabouts of the Sword of World
          Domination. However, she needed to put in a little more work if she
          wanted to come up with a plan.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that in mind, she decided to put more attention on the Tower of
          World Domination. According to the memories of her past life, the
          Tower of World Domination existed underground, not in a fixed
          location.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Moreover, the Tower of World Domination was more powerful than the
          other Tools of World Domination. There were rumours that the Tower of
          World Domination could suppress the heaven itself.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There were even rumours that the Tower of World Domination was
          actually carried by an older-than-ancient Celestial Beast, and it
          travelled around the Upper Realm following the ley line.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yue Mingkong had actually spent a lot of time trying to find
          information about the birth of the Tower of World Domination. After
          all, compared with her previous life, many things in this life had
          deviated from how it should have originally developed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Right when Yue Mingkong was thinking about when she should make a
          move, a voice called out to her from outside the palace.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Princess Mingkong, this is something sent by Young Master
          Changge.&#8221; A maid suddenly came in with an exquisite box. Her
          expression was as respectful as it was fearful.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;From Changge?&#8221; Yue Mingkong was taken aback at first,
          but she couldn&#8217;t help the slight smile that soon appeared on her
          indifferent face. This sight made the maid who entered the hall heave
          a sigh of relief. Yue Mingkong only ever smiled when it was about Gu
          Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yue Mingkong prestige and aura had been getting more overwhelming as
          of late, which was also a result of her cultivation level becoming
          more and more unfathomable.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The maids would always feel like they were treading on thin ice when
          they came to her. They would tremble in fear, and wouldn&#8217;t even
          dare say anything unnecessary in fear of getting decapitated for
          saying something wrong.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What is this? How unexpected of him to give me a present. Did
          the sun rise from the West today?&#8221; Despite her words, she could
          barely conceal her joy. At the same time, she raised her slender hand,
          and the exquisite box had fallen into it the next instant.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The surface of this box was covered with cloud-like silk and purple
          mist, giving off a magical feeling. Yue Mingkong knew that this was a
          Space Box that could contain a lot of things.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;After Purple Mansion got annihilated, all of their hidden
          treasures over the years had fallen into his hands. Well, at least he
          doesn&#8217;t leave me out when he has obtained something good. Not
          bad,&#8221; she mused while opening the box.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Swoosh!* She was immediately greeted by the sight of numerous
          exquisite jewellery, earrings, hairpins and other things that gleamed
          with divine splendour, all of which were carved with patterns such as
          a Celestial Phoenix.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As though these items were created by the hands of an Immortal, they
          had various World Principles hanging on them. Each had a powerful aura
          intertwined in between as celestial essence vined around them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Other than that, there were also Sacred Grade Artifacts, Sacred King
          Grade Artifacts, Sacred Herb, Dragon Bones, Phoenix Jade and many more
          that the maids were almost blinded with envy.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >None of the pendants she had received were ordinary Sacred Grade
          Artifact, as they were all produced through a complicated process. Not
          only did they have a strong defensive ability, they could even be
          sacrificed at crucial times as a means of attack. It wouldn&#8217;t be
          an overstatement to say that these items were worth as much as several
          cities.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As a woman, Yue Mingkong naturally liked beautiful things. Even
          though she tried to hide her true feelings, she couldn&#8217;t help
          the joy in her eyes when she saw these presents.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She could tell that Gu Changge had put his heart into picking the
          presents for her. He knew her tastes, and so he picked out the items
          that she would like, and had someone send them over.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, she felt moved at the thought of this. The sacrifices she had
          made for him without his knowledge didn&#8217;t seem in vain after
          all.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She then kept all the items in the box. Her face soon went back to
          looking cold. &#8220;Leave me,&#8221; she instructed the maid while
          dismissively waving her away.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the maid who was familiar with Yue Mingkong knew very well
          that although Yue Mingkong seemed indifferent, happiness was evident
          in her eyes.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The maid was envious, but she knew that Gu Changge was the only man
          in this world that could make Yue Mingkong show such an
          expression.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >And just when Yue Mingkong was about to continue tracking the
          whereabouts of the Tower of World Domination, there were footsteps
          outside the palace again.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; Her eyes drifted to the direction of
          the sound, and as she sat up on the couch, a cool voice asked in
          return,</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What’s the matter? Can&#8217;t I come see my future wife when
          I can finally make time? After all, I’m not like you. You didn&#8217;t
          even ask about me during my battle with Purple Mansion. You would have
          had to live as a widow if I died in their hands.&#8221; Gu Changge
          walked in from outside the hall with a calm expression.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >None of the group of maids outside stopped him from entering.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He then plopped down next to Yue Mingkong without minding the aloof
          and disdainful expression on her face. In an instant, a pleasant smell
          drifted over. It was elegant and cold like a snow lotus blooming on
          the top of an iceberg that had been in existence for hundreds of
          millions of years.</span

          >&#8220;You can&#8217;t. You are not allowed to step into my palace
          without my permission,&#8221; Yue Mingkong said, deadpanned.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Alright. I am leaving. I won&#8217;t ever come back.&#8221; He
          started to stand up.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing this, she blurted out angrily, &#8220;You can&#8217;t!&#8221;
          She then reached out to stop him.</span

          you sent, I’ll let it slide this time.&#8221; Her lips curled into a
          small smile before she quickly wiped it off her face. She liked it
          when he yielded to her.</span

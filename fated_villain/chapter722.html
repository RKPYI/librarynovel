        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The grey mist surged like an endless wave, threatening to engulf and suffocate people with an oppressive feeling. Even the void cracked under the corrosive Eternal Overcast Fog.<span id="more-37242"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The True Daoists from Sky Emperor Mountain and Endless Fire Kingdom were either severely injured or seized, looking grimly pale and beyond ashamed. The other four True Daoists, too, were equally frightened and on guard against Ah Er suddenly making a move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gu Changge, you dare oppress us like this!? We will find a way to deal with the Eternal Overcast ourselves,&#8221; the True Daoists from Purple Cloud Valley said with a stern but uneasy tone, feeling terrified inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was genuinely afraid of Gu Changge at his point, not just because the young man behaved impassively in this situation but also because he made nothing of them. That terrified the Purple Cloud Valley True Daoist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, Gu Changge was probably even more terrifying than the real Successor of Demonic Arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the True Daoists couldn&#8217;t help shivering too. Although Ah Er didn&#8217;t attack them earlier, his fearsome malice continued to make their blood freeze, and their scalps tingle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were Ancestors of Immortal Forces! When had they ever suffered such humiliation? However, they dared not fight back, nor did they have the ability to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall wait and see, then. I hope you won&#8217;t disappoint me, Seniors,&#8221; Gu Changge said with a faint smile, then ordered Ah Er to release the True Daoists of Sky Emperor Mountain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ripples spread before their eyes, and the void became blurred as if there was an endless passage that he easily tore open, directly connecting to the Eternal Overcast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon, Gu Changge, accompanied by Ah Er, walked into the passage and disappeared quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The silence in this place was finally broken by the commotion, and all the cultivators were stunned by what had just happened, unable to react for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it! I will have my revenge sooner or later! Gu Changge is simply too arrogant! Does he really think he rules the universe and no one can stop him!? He will eventually pay a heavy price for his actions!&#8221; The fear on the face of the Endless Fire Kingdom Ancestor disappeared in an instant, replaced by thick resentment and hatred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Someday, he will end up just like those young prodigies before him, dying a miserable death!&#8221; The True Daoist from Sky Emperor Mountain spoke grimly, unable to forget the suffocating feeling from earlier. &#8220;He&#8217;s too dominant. Even at a time like this, he shows no fear of anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the Phoenix Lady, Jun Yao, Chosen Monk Jin Chan, and others were speechless for a long time, unable to snap out of their shock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was the first time they had witnessed a True Daoist being humiliated like this. Especially for someone like the True Daoist of the Endless Fire Kingdom, to have her head smashed by a slap was truly shocking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were these the same True Daoists who they had seen in the past, towering above everyone else and holding the fate of countless living beings in their hands?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lan Yifei, dressed in a blue robe, looked gloomily towards the Phoenix Lady, Jun Yao, and others from inside the ancient battleship of the Immortal Dao Alliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Gu Changge asking me to take action against them?&#8221; He&#8217;d be lying if he didn&#8217;t catch the look in Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes. Gu Changge had planted a Demonic Seed inside him. Even if they were separated by a great distance, Gu Changge could still do as he pleased with him. There was also the fact that he received a transmission from Gu Changge that he would come here this time, or given his low-key and secretive nature, he wouldn&#8217;t appear before the world so easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lan Yifei dared not refuse Gu Changge&#8217;s request. He might have had the courage to resist and fight back if he had no attachments, but he had the Immortal Dao Alliance and his family. Gu Changge could easily obliterate the Immortal Dao Alliance like he destroyed Neraka &#8211; without breaking a sweat. To Gu Changge, he was like a fish struggling in the mud, unable to even properly struggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
[The Eternal Overcast outbreak this time has exposed many Small Universes in the surrounding area, and I just happened to hear about an ancient cave… These young prodigies must&#8217;ve also come for the legacy inside the ancient cave. I will likely have a high chance of success if I attack them there.] Lan Yifei sighed under his breath as he deliberated how to carry out Gu Changge&#8217;s ‘request’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had rarely shown himself in the outside world in recent years and had not demonstrated his true strength. So he was confident in dealing with Jun Yao, Jin Yun, and the others. However, the risk would be towering, and he still needed to consider how to avoid exposing himself. Otherwise, the Immortal Dao Alliance would also face a catastrophic disaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, Gu Changge could abandon him at any time, but he couldn&#8217;t abandon the Immortal Dao Alliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from obeying Gu Changge&#8217;s orders, he had no other choice. From the moment Gu Changge planted the Demonic Seed inside of him, his fate was no longer under his own control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that, Lan Yifei regained his calm and amiable demeanour and greeted Jun Yao and the others. &#8220;Word is that an ancient cave appeared in the southeast direction, and it seems to have something to do with an Immortal from the Celestial Ancient Times. Would any of you be interested in exploring it together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given their abilities, they wouldn&#8217;t be of much help in dealing with the Eternal Overcast Scourge anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Phoenix Lady and others were watching Gu Changge disappear into the Eternal Overcast when they were surprised by an approaching mysterious and low-key cultivator from the Immortal Dao Alliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chosen Monk Jin Chan clasped his hands in prayer after recovering from his split-second shock. &#8220;I have indeed come with that very intention. Word is that the cave has many connections with Buddhist Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are also rumours that the cave will only appear at a specific time, which we still don&#8217;t know of yet,&#8221; Jun Yao added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was quite curious about the Immortal Dao Alliance cultivator before him, for he had encountered another young existence that not even he could see through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cave is a blessed place with treasures. Those who are worthy will seek it. Since everyone intends to explore it, why don&#8217;t we compete for it?&#8221; Jin Yun, who had always been domineering, arrogant, and somewhat disdainful of everyone else, suggested plainly after glancing at Lan Yifei.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that cave is my destiny,&#8221; Lan Yifei said with an amiable smile. &#8220;Since everyone is interested in exploring it, I do plea that you all will show mercy when we meet there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that, he left, leading many young disciples of the Immortal Dao Alliance to the ancient cave. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see you there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Phoenix Lady and the others, too, headed for the ancient cave at once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many young prodigies had indeed gathered there, and the most famous were the Phoenix Lady, Jun Yao, and the others. Because they were born earlier and had previously practised with Gu Changge at the Immortal Academy, they had long been known to the world. But it didn&#8217;t mean that they were the only young prodigies there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Upper Realm was vast and filled with hidden talents and geniuses. Unless one had reached Gu Changge&#8217;s level, they couldn&#8217;t claim to be invincible among their peers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many young prodigies who had emerged earlier, such as Jiang Luoshen of the Godly Illusion Clan and An Yan of the Hidden An Clan, were also well-known, but they didn&#8217;t show up near the Eternal Overcast this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, many other young prodigies fell into the hands of the Successor of Demonic Arts and died from having their Sources devoured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank the heavens. Young Master Gu has personally gone into the Eternal Overcast. Given the Saintess&#8217; relationship with him, he certainly wouldn&#8217;t leave her to fend for herself.&#8221; Elation overcame the Elders of the Mortal Palace as they breathed a sigh of relief, watching Gu Changge disappear into the vast Eternal Overcast Fog. In fact, many of them knew about Gu Changge and Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s intimate relationship but only pretended not to know due to the dignity of the Mortal Palace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside the Eternal Overcast, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t search for the so-called source after entering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He only said that in front of everyone to show off and win their hearts to find a position for himself in the future, when he would attack the various Forces. At the same time, he also wanted to leave himself a perfect alibi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, he knew full well why the Eternal Overcast erupted this time. There was no need to investigate at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just then, a thought came to Gu Chagge, and he sped up, tearing through the Eternal Overcast Fog. &#8220;Jiang Chuchu sure has ventured deep into this place. I should bring her back while I&#8217;m at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was his woman, after all, and he couldn&#8217;t remain indifferent after knowing she had ventured into such a dangerous place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jiang Chuchu always carried more burden than she should on her shoulders, putting the safety of the world first, even at the cost of her own life. Gu Changge knew he couldn&#8217;t persuade her either, for the young woman was even more obstinate than a mule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was usually rather shrewd. However, in times like this, she would never prioritise herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stupidity can be really dangerous. I have to teach her a lesson…&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head lightly as he sensed the various auras within the Eternal Overcast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were powerful beasts and sect ruins swallowed by the Eternal Overcast fog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had been days since Jiang Chuchu entered the Eternal Overcast, and who knew just where she had been trapped?! That said, He wasn&#8217;t worried for her life, since her physique was innately resistant to the fog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, he had Jiang Chuchu help him find the Eternal Overcast Sources in order to devour it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days quickly passed by, and the entire Upper Realm was abuzz with the news of Gu Changge appearing at the Eternal Overcast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, many Forces spread rumours that Gu Changge had hidden away after his identity as the real Successor of Demonic Arts got exposed. However, Gu Changge showed up with many Gu Family cultivators and even declared that they would find the root cause of the Eternal Overcast outbreak and solve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many were shocked and found it hard to believe, it was also a slap in the face to the Forces who spread rumours about Gu Changge being the Successor of Demonic Arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story of the Endless Fire Kingdom and the Sky Emperor Mountain True Daoists being taught a lesson and humiliated by Gu Changge&#8217;s subordinate—a mysterious and powerful Remnant Immortal whose origins were unknown—also spread, causing quite a stir.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn&#8217;t the only incident that spread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that many Forces treated the Eternal Overcast Scourge perfunctorily, never ventured deep into the Eternal Overcast, nor even had the intention to, despite dispatching True Daoists, upset many cultivators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even many ancient beings of the Immortal Academy couldn&#8217;t stand firm and had to speak up to calm the anger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, the largest number of cultivators in the Upper Realm were still wandering cultivators and the Ancient Forces (weaker than Formidable Forces), not the various Immortal Forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that the various Immortal Factions did nothing but instead sent wandering cultivators to their deaths already aroused public anger. Of course, all of this was part of Gu Changge&#8217;s plan. He would come forth at this time mainly to guide the trend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trend was irreversible, but it could be guided, and when the trend of the heavens and the earth collapsed, it would be enough to destroy and crush those Immortal Forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, at this time, Gu Changge still had a trump card in his hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being showed up and made his move, the Eternal Overcast outbreak would naturally be easily resolved. However, the grudges and hatred between the various Forces and all the others had yet to accumulate to a critical point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, Forces like the Sky Emperor Mountain and the Endless Fire Kingdom also realised what Gu Changge would likely be up to, and many ancient beings began to discuss and plan to use other means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present, even if the appearance of many True Daoists could suppress one side, they were still far inferior to the Remnant Immortals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that we&#8217;ll have to expose our foundation. None of us will be able to rest easy until the day Gu Changge is eliminated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deep within the territories of the various Forces, vast divine sense fluctuations intersected and collided. Some beings sealed in the oldest Divine Sources were also invited out, ready at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gu Changge&#8217;s strength, as well as the Remnant Immortal by his side, had made many people restless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a terrifying wave that would sweep across the entire Upper Realm, and all the Forces would inevitably be involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, while all that was happening, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being sat cross-legged inside the palace of the Gu Family Residence, his eyes flashing with mysterious runes as he constructed a strange field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;These runes seem to involve an even older era… The area they touch might even predate the Celestial Ancient Era. Could it be related to the Nine Nethers? Do I need to try again? Maybe I should experiment with the ancient universes I cultivated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These runes were derived from the ancient wells after they shattered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had been studying and comprehending them all this time and had finally made some progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back then, he relied on a bowl of well water given by the Six Great Ancestors to embark on the path of fusing and dividing the Dao Fruit. That said, it was called accumulation if put nicely. In reality, it was merely devouring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, his methods were even more ruthless and indifferent. He directly selected those ancient universes with deep origins as his backyard cultivation land, specifically for cultivating his own Source Dao Fruits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the strongest cultivators of those ancient universes went through countless hardships to finally become True Daoist and bear Dao Fruits, they would only realise a terrifying monster was waiting for them behind the Immortal Gate they would open up, as they approached the Immortal Path, ready to devour them as food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a desperate and cruel truth. But it was precisely what the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had planned and had been doing all along.</p>

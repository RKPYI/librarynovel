        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Am I too dumb or something?&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin opened her eyes after
                listening to Gu Changge&#8217;s explanation, looking somewhat dejected. &#8220;It&#8217;s been three
                whole days, and I still can&#8217;t open up my Spiritual Sea. Not only that, I had even used up many of
                what Young Master Gu had given me, and ingested many pills…&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span><span id="more-29183"></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yan Ji, on the other hand, was rather calm. She shook her head and said,
                &#8220;You are outstandingly gifted. Even the more outstanding geniuses would take months to open up the
                Spiritual Sea when they start cultivating. For you to already sense spiritual energy on your third day
                is already remarkable. If you continue at your current pace, you&#8217;ll be able to open up the
                Spiritual Sea, latest in a month. So, don&#8217;t rush.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Ruoyin felt better and more motivated after hearing so, and she
                nodded. &#8220;I understand, Master. I will try harder.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, she snuck a peek at Gu Changge, then dropped her
                head.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had gotten an understanding of the rumours of the outside world
                lately and had become even more so aware of the common sense and the general forces and whatnot of this
                world. Thus, she felt a lot more stress when she was now aware of just how horrifying Gu Changge really
                was. And because of this, she dared not behave as she used to in front of Gu Changge
                anymore.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the more she learned about him, the more she could see
                their stark difference. It was truly as they said, the ignorant feared nothing.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Ruoyin had to hand it to her past self for having the guts to
                speak to Gu Changge like that.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder he said she was interesting, that she was the first woman
                to ever speak to him like that, for none of the women he had encountered in the past was ignorant as she
                was. They feared him and thus wouldn&#8217;t dare speak like she did.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the revelation crossed her mind, she was rather glad. If she
                weren&#8217;t a transmigrator and did not have the mindset of a modern girl, she probably wouldn&#8217;t
                even have the guts to speak up to Gu Changge. Much less, the right to receive some pointers from him.
                The prodigal damsels around him weren’t just beautiful beyond compare. They were all also gifted, and
                extremely-powerful individuals!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, she was an ignorant idiot.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Xiao Ruoyin was smart. She guessed that Gu Changge thought
                she was interesting because she dared to speak up and talk to him while the other women dared not. Thus,
                she asked, unable to not try and quench her curiosity, while also trying to set a goal for herself
                &#8220;Just out of curiosity, Young Master Gu, how long did it take you to open up your Spiritual
                Sea?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, Gu Changge put his teacup down and looked at her. However,
                she thought his smile was implying she had just asked a stupid question. &#8220;Honestly, it
                didn&#8217;t take me any time as it had formed before I was born…&#8221; He answered surprisingly
                seriously.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her expression froze over, feeling speechless, and she really wanted
                to tell him, &#8216;Well, sorry for bothering.&#8217; [So this is the difference between a genuine
                Genius and a bogus one, huh?!]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before this, she genuinely believed she had great talent, but as it
                turned out, it was all just in her head.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No need to compare yourself with me, Lady Xiao. There are
                thousands and more prodigies in this world, and your talent is already considered one of the best.
                Compared to them, you&#8217;re already one of the best.&#8221; Gu Changge consoled her, seemingly having
                read her mind. The smile on his face looked as gentle and peerless as ever, absolutely
                impeccable.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Ruoyin looked somewhat glum at him. [You call this consolation?
                Then, why do I still feel so defeated?]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ll be able to study at Skyward Schloss with Yan Ji
                sometime later, alright? There will be many Elders who can guide you. Also, there will be many peers you
                can spar with, and test yourself against. It&#8217;ll be of great help to your cultivation,&#8221; Gu
                Changge added, intending to chuck the young woman to Skyward Schloss.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn&#8217;t possibly keep her by his side all the time. Not
                that he thought she was a bother, purely that it was useless when she still hadn&#8217;t recovered her
                memory as the High Priestess of Destiny. What was more, a lot more time was still required for her
                Nihility Destiny Physique to form.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay, you&#8217;re the boss.&#8221; Aspiration showed beneath
                Xiao Ruoxuan&#8217;s eyes after hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s words. &#8220;What kind of place is Skyward
                Schloss?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, she didn&#8217;t know what Gu Changge had in mind. So she
                felt touched as she assumed he decided to have her enter a sect as he thought her practice was too
                monotonous.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Skyward Schloss… the name itself already sounds
                extraordinary.]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, Hei Yanyu sent many cultivators to clean up the warzone.
                Of course, to outsiders, she was indeed doing so. After all, many weapons and storage rings were
                scattered across the place after the war, and it was an immense wealth. Someone had to do the cleaning
                up.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Hei Yanyu also collected the Sources that had yet to
                vanish as Gu Changge had instructed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, unsurprisingly, Gu Changge&#8217;s cultivation level still
                hadn&#8217;t advanced to the Sacred King Realm after devouring and refining those Sources.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, he managed to exchange many Absolute Detachment Bones with
                the Fortuity he got from Chu Hao by obliterating the Vermilion Bird Empire.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all that was settled, Yan Ji brought Xiao Ruoyin to Skyward
                Schloss while Hei Yanyu led the Celestial Ancient Army back to the Celestial Ancient
                Continent.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Gu Changge led his group of followers back to the Immortal
                Academy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the event, Sky King Zhi Yang died a horrible death at Gu
                Changge&#8217;s hands, which also led to the destruction of the Purple Mansion. King with Six Crowns,
                Jun Yao; Chosen Monk, Jin Chanl; the Phoenix Lady, and others stayed far away from him, even more
                so.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, none of those in the Immortal Academy dared to cross Gu
                Changge anymore. The man practically dominated the place; even the Sacred Emperor Realm Elders would
                show him due respect.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Gu Changge returned to the Immortal Academy, the group of
                Elders decided to reward the disciples according to the points they gained as well as the number of
                Eternal Overcast Creatures they killed, although the Sect Trial ended prematurely. And without a shadow
                of a doubt, the disciple who earned the most points was naturally Jiang Chuchu.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless Eternal Overcast Creatures died in her hands, not to
                mention she had also resolved one of the crises caused by the Eternal Overcast. Even the Elders were
                amazed by such ability, and they thought she sure deserved being the Saintess of Mortal
                Palace.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu had honestly wanted to reveal that she wasn&#8217;t the
                one who dealt with the crisis. It was Gu Changge instead. However, the latter never seemed to care much
                about such superficial credit. In fact, he intended not to take the credit after doing the good
                deed—correction, he intended to chuck the credit to her after doing the good deed. And Jiang Chuchu
                honestly didn&#8217;t know what to do about him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the man in question seemed to have entered a retreat after
                returning to the Immortal Academy and wouldn&#8217;t see anyone at all. So even if she wanted to ask him
                some questions, she couldn&#8217;t find a valid reason. Thus, she didn&#8217;t have a chance to see him.
                After all, to outsiders, she and Gu Changge had nothing to do with each other.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Jiang Chuchu still remembered well how he said she gained
                a bunch by putting in barely any effort. Later, when she thought about it again, she grew more certain
                that he was messing with her. Thus, she had a hard time dropping the matter, and as such, she&#8217;d
                want to bite a chuck off of him to vent her anger and ask him what exactly he meant whenever the memory
                returned to her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is he not going to acknowledge it anymore after he&#8217;s
                sated?!]</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></i></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge knew nothing about Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s thoughts. After
                returning to the Immortal Academy, the first thing he naturally did was sort out his loot from
                obliterating the Purple Mansion, then picked out many things Yue Mingkong would use and had people
                deliver them to her. She was his fiancée, after all. Of course, the main reason was that he needed
                something from her subsequently.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, Gu Xianer would constantly loiter in his chamber
                lately, asking random questions just to make her presence known. But of course, Gu Changge knew what she
                was thinking. So he grabbed some Sacred Grade Weapons and heavenly herbs and shooed her
                away.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many forces witnessed how the hidden treasures owned and cultivated
                by Purple Mansion over countless years had landed in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands after its destruction. It
                would be a miracle if none of them was envious. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given Gu Xianer&#8217;s avarice personality, it was already nice
                enough that she didn&#8217;t pester him for a share after knowing he had gained an abundance of
                wealth.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, she might have actually come to his palace to devise a
                plan to knock him out cold immediately so that she could rob him. And Gu Changge believed she could most
                certainly do something like that as the way she had been gazing at him was like a hunter&#8217;s looking
                at its prey.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, when he shooed Gu Xianer away, he naturally bullied her in
                the meantime. So, it was likely the young woman wouldn&#8217;t show herself around him for at least a
                good couple of weeks, for her face was as red as a ripe tomato, and her footsteps were unsteady when she
                ran out of his palace. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Where are we, Senior Black?&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, two people stood in front of a mystical mountain range,
                and the one who had spoken was a sunny, outgoing hunk.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two were none other than Jiang Chen and the Black-Robed Elder,
                who had journeyed across the Vermilion Bird Empire territory.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Elder&#8217;s great powers, the two traversed millions
                of miles in no time, crossing a few teleportation arrays away before they were finally outside the range
                of the battlefield.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen sensed a kind of celestial essence and indescribable
                nobility from the view he was seeing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everywhere he looked, it was peaceful surroundings. Buildings had
                been built within the flourishing forest while the rivers flowed and the birds flew as the beasts
                roared, looking absolutely ethereal.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the Heavenly Ruin Gates,&#8221; said the Black-Robed
                Elder as he pointed to the green boulder aside that wrote &#8216;Gods&#8217; Ruin&#8217;. &#8220;This is
                the strongest force within a five-thousand-kilometre radius. From this day on, you will be practising
                here. According to the legacy I imparted to you, you can become a Spiritual Sea Realm Cultivator within
                a month. If anything happens within this time, just crush this jade talisman, and I will
                appear.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen nodded with a solemn expression. &#8220;I understand,
                Senior.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately, he had been made aware of just how powerful the Everchanging
                Demonic Arts was. Speaking of which, it was an exceedingly malicious succession as it required devouring
                other people&#8217;s powers. That said, Jiang Chen wasn&#8217;t that bothered anymore after accepting
                this inheritance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing was more important than power in this predatorial world—it
                was what the Black-Robed Elder taught him. It wasn&#8217;t that Jiang Chen didn&#8217;t know how to
                adapt to the situation either. After a few days of wavering, he came around and accepted it all much
                easier, given his modern-day mindset.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what if he had to mutilate other cultivators to become stronger?
                In this world, it was a sin to be weak. Only by being strong could anyone survive. </span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t disappoint me,&#8221; said the
                Black-Robed Elder while nodding before vanishing into thin air.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, Jiang Chen took a deep breath and strode towards the
                Heavenly Ruin Gates. From afar, he found two young men kneeling, seemingly pleading.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You should just leave. Your aptitude is too mediocre; it
                won&#8217;t do no matter how hard you two try,&#8221; said a Master Elder as he shook his
                head.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, please give us another chance.&#8221; The two young
                men kept kneeling and pleading, absolutely obstinate.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that, the Master Elder sighed. &#8220;You two have been kneeling
                here for a good two weeks. I&#8217;m no heartless man, but rules are rules. Your aptitude is really just
                too mediocre. You really won&#8217;t pass the test. It&#8217;s best if you just head down the mountains
                now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two young men felt beyond hopeless. They knew nothing would
                change even if they continued to kneel when the Master Elder had already said so.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Heavenly Ruin Gates was the best Sect within this
                five-thousand-kilometre radius. Word was that it was attached to the Heavenly Ruin Sect, a Sect
                affiliated to the Hidden Ji Family.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who could enter the Heavenly Ruin Gates, even if they were
                only to become a handyman, would be basked in glory for the rest of their lives.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen, on the other hand, was impassive the entire time, feeling
                no sympathy for the young men as he strode towards them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, please hold on!&#8221; he spoke up amidst
                everyone&#8217;s baffled gazes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Master Elder was just about to turn around when the unfamiliar
                voice sounded. &#8220;You are…&#8221; he asked with a baffled frown while sizing this unfamiliar
                gentleman up.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to make myself a disciple, Master,&#8221;
                answered Jiang Cheng, feeling absolutely confident in his cultivation talent.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re too old. Even if you have the backbone, you still
                don&#8217;t meet the requirement. We at Heavenly Ruin Gates only accept cultivators below the age of
                eighteen,&#8221; the Master Elder dissuaded gently instead of shooing Jiang Chen away because of the
                latter&#8217;s age.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He still wants to become a disciple even when he&#8217;s above
                eighteen?! Has he not seen the rules of the Heavenly Ruin Gates at all?!&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contempt enveloped the two young men&#8217;s faces after scrutinising
                Jiang Chen&#8217;s shabby outfit, looking nothing like someone from an influential family.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any mortal who could cultivate in this world was either super
                powerful or filthy rich. Even if a beggar like Jiang Chen was talented, he wouldn&#8217;t even have the
                money to purchase the plethora of cultivation resources.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, I believe the Heavenly Ruin Gates will make an
                exception with how gifted I am,&#8221; Jiang Chen bragged with a smile, giving no care for the young
                men&#8217;s sarcasm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Make an exception?! Have you ever looked at yourself in the
                mirror? What a joke!&#8221; The young men mocked upon hearing Jiang Chen&#8217;s words, having nothing
                but contempt for this stranger. &#8220;A beggar, and yet he attempts to become a cultivator. Did he say
                the Heavenly Ruin Gates will make an exception for him?! Ha! That&#8217;s the best joke I&#8217;ve heard
                my whole life!&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Jiang Chen didn&#8217;t want to stoop to their level, it still
                felt upsetting to be looked down upon like that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, he had a pretty positive attitude, so he could keep his
                smile on his face.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believed this Master Elder would be able to tell his constitution
                and backbone were extraordinary. However, to his surprise, the Master Elder became upset upon hearing
                his words. &#8220;If you&#8217;re really here to become a disciple, you should&#8217;ve found out about
                our rules beforehand. If you&#8217;re just here to fool around, don&#8217;t blame me for being
                rude…&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Master Elder believed Jiang Chen was here to prank him. [If
                you&#8217;re so confident in your cultivation aptitude, why don&#8217;t you join some other major sect?
                Why insist on joining us?!]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please hear me out, Master. I&#8217;ve genuinely come to
                become a disciple. It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve travelled long-distance and even encountered many
                vicious beasts. Many of my servants died in their jaws, and only I barely survived. I had to sate my
                hunger by feeding on wild berries before finally arriving here…&#8221; Jiang Chen explained at once,
                relating the dangers and misery he went through on his journey. Even the young men mocking him earlier
                were flabbergasted. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Master Elder was sceptical, he wasn&#8217;t as upset
                anymore after hearing Jiang Chen&#8217;s words. However, he still insisted, &#8220;Rules are rules. Your
                age has already exceeded the prime to practise cultivation, so I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll still have to
                ask you to leave. Heavenly Ruin Gates has never accepted anyone above the age of eighteen since its
                establishment…&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen frowned in response. He was surprised that this Master
                Elder still wouldn&#8217;t allow him to test his talents even when he had already related his
                story.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can I only crush this talisman and ask for the Black-Robed
                Elder&#8217;s assistance now to join the Sect? But wouldn&#8217;t I be too useless and incompetent if I
                can&#8217;t even handle this?]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pfft! Give him a chance, then.&#8221; A crisp, melodious voice
                came from behind the gates just then, like ice dropped onto a porcelain plate, absolutely
                angelic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen&#8217;s heart skipped a beat upon hearing the voice, and
                he reflexively looked in the direction to find a young woman standing on a nephrite step. There
                weren&#8217;t any accessories on her luscious hair, but it sparkled beautifully.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was wearing a long lemonade-yellow dress, and she had a slender
                and feminine figure, looking elfish. However, she had a rather average look, nothing astonishing. Yet,
                her eyes were big and exceptionally clear, as bright and moving as the moon.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Master Elder&#8217;s countenance changed the second he saw the
                young woman, and he hurriedly greeted her deferentially, &#8220;Greetings, Young
                Mistress.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young woman dipped her head in response. At that, she looked
                towards Jiang Chen and smiled. &#8220;You, beggar, are you not going to come in?&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jiang Chen was in a trance, the Artifact Spirit of the
                Celestial Boat of Creation rang in his head &lt;This young woman isn&#8217;t someone that simple. You’d
                better be careful.&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen regained his senses immediately after hearing the Artifact
                Spirit&#8217;s words. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a beggar. My name&#8217;s Jiang Chen.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, he smiled at the Master Elder and strode into the place.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As baffled as the Master Elder was, he dared not ask
                questions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, who&#8217;s that young woman?&#8221; The two young men were
                just as stumped, never expecting the beggar they were just ridiculing had now entered the Heavenly Ruin
                Gates just like that, and they felt incredibly envious and jealous.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She—she&#8217;s not someone people like you deserves to
                know!&#8221; chided the originally gentle-looking Master Elder as he suddenly turned
                impassive.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startled, the young men dared not stay any longer and scurried away from the
                mountain with jealousy and envy towards Jiang Chen.</span></p>

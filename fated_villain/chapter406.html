          surprisingly charming yet emotionless, which sounded awkward. Gu
          Changge stood with his hands behind his back, smiling as he looked at
          Bai Lian&#8217;er and Bai Hua. His shimmering dark ceremonial robes
          were embroidered with noble and mysterious patterns, which looked to

          and woman Gu Changge had taken here, rolled her eyes. She didn&#8217;t
          care about concealing herself since he had already noticed her and
          walked in. She had shiny golden hair, a tall curvy figure, bright

          she did not ask any questions and gazed coldly at Gu Changge. &#8220;I
          hope you will honour your promise. Besides, I&#8217;m much older than

          shifted as he felt both fear and respect towards Gu Changge. He could
          never forget the feeling of being close to death, narrowly avoiding
          such a fate. If Bai Lian&#8217;er hadn&#8217;t stopped the other man,

          Chaos King&#8217;s ambush of the Life Forbidden Area, but Gu Changge
          hadn&#8217;t elaborated much on the subject. He knew she was already
          suspicious of Jun Fan much more than the other young prodigies.
          However, there was no use if she knew Jun Fan was Jun Bufan since she
          had no evidence.

          his father, the Quelling Chaos King, had performed a heroic deed on
          the peak of Sacred Mountain by saving Empress Yao Xi. Claiming that
          Jun Fan was the son of the former Solar Demon Overlord without proof
          would end up distancing the other court officials from her, as they
          would think she was worried about the Quelling Chaos King
          overshadowing her. As of now, the thing Empress Yao Xi most wanted to
          do was to investigate Jun Fan for proof.</span

          >Empress Yao Xi nodded and her expression became thoughtful.
          &#8220;Why did he do so? The Life Forbidden Area has already been
          taken over by Jun Ruoxi six thousand years ago. She even signed a
          contract with me so we don&#8217;t interfere in each other&#8217;s
          affairs.&#8221;</span

          >She had just unified the Demon World back then and it did not have a
          stable foundation yet. At that time, Jun Ruoxi was the eldest daughter
          of the Solar Demon Overlord, who was extremely powerful due to many
          years of cultivation. Thus, she was someone who Yao Xi could not
          offend. Very few knew about this and Empress Yao Xi hadn&#8217;t
          announced it to the public before.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that the Quelling Chaos King had led his army there, Jun Ruoxi
          might think Empress Yao Xi had decided to break the agreement. Empress
          Yao Xi didn&#8217;t really mind that, but she was more concerned about
          why Gu Changge would do that. Because Jun Ruoxi was Jun Bufan&#8217;s
          sister?</span

          him?&#8221; Her slender fingers tapped the tabletop. Her
          investigations of the young prodigies hadn&#8217;t yielded much
          evidence but she had already eliminated many of the suspects. The one
          who she was most suspicious of was Jun Fan as well as Zhao Tian, the
          only son of the military commander. Jun Fan was the greatest suspect,
          while Zhao Tian gained her attention since he held military power and
          thus had a lot of contact with Qing Zhu.</span

          Forbidden Area in the Demon World while claiming he was obeying an
          order from her. She had been stunned at first before realising it
          might have been Gu Changge&#8217;s decision and an investigation
          showed that it to be true.</span

          really is Jun Fan…&#8221; Empress Yao Xi&#8217;s expression cooled.
          She hadn&#8217;t figured out why Gu Changge had descended to the Demon
          World; she had thought he was here to help but had been greatly
          mistaken. It didn&#8217;t make any difference to him whether he helped
          her or not, and there was a change of ruler in the Demon World, None
          of this would affect him since he didn&#8217;t care about the Demon
          World.</span

          with him, and while she hadn&#8217;t thought it through back then, she
          now understood everything clearly. She didn&#8217;t have anything to
          complain about since it was a mutual exchange. All she wanted to know

          World had become much more peaceful these days and the riots had
          decreased. She was still uneasy though, not about Jun Fan&#8217;s
          faked death, but about the missing Six Demon Overlords. [Were they his

          He dismissed her. He would inform her when the time came. Bai
          Lian&#8217;er was already annoyed as she thought she herself already
          being so pretentious, yet it didn&#8217;t even compare to Gu
          Changge&#8217;s behaviour.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After dismissing everyone in the palace, Gu Changge eventually began
          to investigate the brocade bag. It looked extremely ordinary, with
          simple patterns on it, and did not have any runes or arrays around it.
          The material itself was even something seemingly common. However, he
          did sense a special aura from it, which felt mysterious, strange, and
          intensely powerful.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Black and white colours appeared within Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes, and
          the Six Paths of Reincarnation could be faintly seen evolving within
          his eyes. He planned to fully understand the unique character of the
          brocade bag since examining the exterior didn&#8217;t yield many
          results. He did know if others opened it forcefully, the bag would
          self-destruct and release terrifying amounts of energy so it would not
          reveal its contents.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Something left just for Jun Bufan? No one else can open this except
          for him?] He frowned, as the Solar Demon Overlord had truly left
          plenty of defensive techniques. There was something unimaginable
          within, which might involve the secrets of the Demon World. If he
          opened it by force, he might trigger a mechanism within and destroy
          the contents.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Is it that only Jun Bufan can open it? I don&#8217;t believe it.] Gu
          Changge made another attempt. A black-coloured light appeared on his
          palm and he consumed the brocade bag with it.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Light blue smoke emanated from the bag and it shone with blinding
          light. The patterns became distinct and it was clear that a special
          technique had been used to write ancient demon runes on the brocade
          bag. The runes immediately emitted frightening energy as soon as they
          made contact with the energy from his palm, like they had come alive.
          Runes transformed into formidable phantom figures of a vermillion
          bird, azure dragon, white tiger, and black tortoise. All growled so
          loudly and fiercely into the void that the place nearly
          exploded.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Opening it may be troublesome, but there’s still a way.] The Grand
          Flask appeared in the void, hovering while emitting dark light which
          enclosed the brocade bag. The brocade bag stopped moving immediately
          as if confined to space, and a mysterious force and energy field
          appeared.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge began to open it and sensed an all-consuming energy
          spilling from within. It was as if the weight of the entire world had
          landed on him. The void began to collapse and formed a dark hole,
          while a crevice began to form somewhere nearby. This was a much more
          terrifying energy than Chaos as it was as heavy as the heavens.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          terrifying force became calm and tame, like stars in the sky.</span

          >[This is a strand of World Source, on the verge of evolving to a
          higher realm of existence.] Gu Changge raised his eyebrows in
          surprise. He had an Inner World which was incomplete and still in its
          primal form. Thus the aura of a World Source was extremely familiar to
          him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He immediately guessed the motives of the Six Demon Overlords. They
          had hidden in the shadows all these years just to make preparations
          for this. The Demon World would have leaked some energy during the
          process of evolution but the Immortal Sects and Immortal Families
          hadn&#8217;t noticed and ignored the Demon World.</span

          Blade. That was probably a fake Nirvana Grade Artifact. Judging by the
          original Fortuity of the Demon World, developing a Nirvana Realm Being
          was already hard enough, much less melding a Nirvana Grade Artifact.
          There were plenty of flaws and holes now that he thought about it,
          which was an issue he wouldn&#8217;t have noticed if he hadn&#8217;t
          come here.

          those inside of it are the pieces. Jun Bufan and Yao Xi are merely the
          chess pieces they used to conceal everything. The overthrow of the
          leaders of the Demon World six thousand years ago was coincidentally
          used to hide the truth behind the Six Demon Overlords&#8217;
          disappearance, while making Yao Xi the scapegoat. I thought she got
          lucky but instead, she was just an unlucky woman. She&#8217;s easy to

          Six Demon Overlords&#8217; plans, he wasn&#8217;t going to ignore
          them. He already had the feeling that Empress Yao Xi was merely a
          chess piece since he arrived, and the only way of making a move on the
          chessboard was to control her. It seemed that he had more power

          misunderstanding. Empress Yao Xi had poisoned him because the Demon
          Overlords had set up the whole thing and misdirected them on purpose.
          The main motive was to create chaos and make it seem as though the top
          authorities in the Demon World were overthrown. The chaos when Empress
          Yao Xi took the throne and Jun Bufan’s revenge, would distract the

          daughter and son! He now wanted to know Jun Bufan&#8217;s reaction to

          similar, but it was still extremely different compared to the real
          World Source. As for the mechanisms and runes, he only restored part

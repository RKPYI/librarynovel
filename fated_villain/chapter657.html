        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Yin Mei&#8217;s words, Gu Changge&#8217;s expression flickered and he asked, &#8220;What happened to Xianer?&#8221;</span><span id="more-34822"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he hadn&#8217;t returned to the Gu Family residence for a long time, he had always sent people to keep track of everyone close to him. Gu Xianer had returned to Peach Village after the trip to Kun Mountain and heeded the requests from her several Masters to attend a trial somewhere. Her rich Fortuity should mean that she wouldn&#8217;t be in much danger, so he hadn&#8217;t been too focused on her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think she may have been trapped in a secret realm since I hadn&#8217;t heard anything about her,&#8221; replied Yin Mei. She knew that Gu Xianer was extremely important to him and so kept a close eye on her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Trapped in a secret realm?&#8221; Gu Changge was stunned as a strange feeling rose within him. [How could Gu Xianer be trapped within a secret realm for a long time? It’s clear that she has encountered an opportunity that is destined for her.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he shook his head and let go of this for the time being. Gu Xianer might not be in too much danger in the short term since her Masters were all formidable, plus she had Yao Tao’s protection. If anything happened to her, it would be easy for Yao Tao to rescue her. Thus, he decided to look into the issue when his business in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was done.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days soon passed and a momentous event happened that shocked the entire Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Many quivering ministers couldn&#8217;t believe what had happened at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gold shimmering letter declaring war had flown in from millions of kilometres away, and unfolded in the sky above the Imperial Capital, exuding a terrifying royal aura. There was only one word formed by condensed ancient words—&#8217;War&#8217;— which glimmered brightly and illuminated the sky, as if made of billions of stars. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intent it expressed was extremely frightening, with many stars outside the world quivering and nearly falling. It was clear it had come from someone extremely powerful, probably a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert at the very least. Besides, the aura seemed to belong to someone who was a member of the Great Yu Royal Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The declaration of war had arrived just when riots were erupting everywhere in the Dynasty, thus shocking everyone into silence. The Forces camping within the Imperial Capital were all stunned as they wondered who had done so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s Yu Tianzheng. He hadn&#8217;t given up yet even after so many years. He must have a lot of confidence since he sent that declaration in front of so many people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many advisors in the Great Yu Capital became sombre as they instantly recognised who had written that letter. Yu Tianzheng was the brother of the current Yu Emperor and lost by just one move during their fight for the throne. His return, accompanied by a war declaration right before the other Forces, meant he was planning to fight Emperor Yu to the death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yu Tianzheng sent a war declaration? Could the recent riots be connected to him?&#8221; Emperor Yu watched this with a dark expression with an old eunuch standing behind him in the palace. He stretched out his hand, which was surrounded by billions of wisps of Qi that blocked out the sky. He pulled down the war declaration floating in the air. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn&#8217;t about to cower in front of countless people. As far as Emperor Yu was concerned, it might be Yu Tianzheng behind all this and if he beat the latter publicly, he could resolve the chaos within Great Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since Yu Tianzheng wants to die here, then I&#8217;ll fulfil his wish. He has been in hiding all these years. It&#8217;s time to resolve the hatred between us.&#8221; Emperor Yu laughed coldly, confident in his own abilities. It wasn&#8217;t that he was underestimating Yu Tianzheng; after all, he had come into possession of many techniques and Talents as the ruler of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. He had the advantage in terms of fortune. Yu Tianzheng wouldn&#8217;t have a chance of winning even if he had a game-changing opportunity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You need to be careful, your Majesty. Yu Tianzheng probably has the confidence to win since he is brave enough to challenge you. As I see it, you shouldn&#8217;t underestimate your opponent and make preparations for everything,&#8221; the old eunuch reminded him silently, slightly worried at the Emperor&#8217;s unbothered attitude.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know that, of course. Yu Tianzheng has always had a high opinion of himself; if he dared challenge me, he definitely has already made plans for everything. It would be the right time for me to get rid of him once and for all.&#8221; Emperor Yu nodded confidently and waved his hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eunuch didn&#8217;t dare say anything after that. The date and venue of the showdown was as stated in the letter. It would be held at the Imperial Capital Summit in seven days. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the eunuch saw it, Yu Tianzheng probably had something up his sleeve if he was choosing to have a life-or-death showdown with Emperor Yu in the Imperial Capital, despite the disadvantage he would be in here. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the eunuch went into the depths of the Imperial Capital after leaving the Imperial Palace in order to report this to the Ancestors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fights for the throne were a normal occurrence, but Emperor Yu was a more suitable candidate for it compared to Yu Tianzheng. The eunuch had spent time assisting the many previous Emperors and had developed an excellent sense on who was more fit for the throne. This battle invitation clearly reeked of some cunning plot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Someone is trying to act against the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Who could it be?&#8221; The eunuch disappeared into a gloomy mausoleum in the depths of the Imperial Capital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news of a final showdown between Yu Tianzheng and Emperor Yu in seven days quickly spread across the capital and caused shockwaves. Many still didn&#8217;t know who Yu Tianzheng was but thought he was extremely daring to take such a risk. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu was an indomitable figure who ruled over the Celestial Dynasty for years and could cause earthquakes with a single step. Only the heads of the Immortal Forces had the right to be at the same rank as him. Who exactly was Yu Tianzheng anyway?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, many older people who knew about the last battle for the throne didn&#8217;t think so. Yu Tianzheng had always had an edge over Emperor Yu when he was young, and he would have been ruling the Dynasty had he not been tricked by Emperor Yu. After all, Emperor Yu was inferior to Yu Tianzheng in terms of cultivation and talent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the ensuing days, enormous rebel armies came in great numbers from different parts of the Dynasty. Towering beacons flared as the war-hungry soldiers spread across the land and towards the Imperial Capital. It was a terrifying force which made even several Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts frown warily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The army moved in formation on their mounts, as the bloodthirsty aura radiating from them was enough to make passing cultivators turn pale with fear as if these were soldiers from hell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven days passed quickly and the battle at the Summit of the Imperial Capital gained attention from different Forces, as well as the public. Many strong cultivators headed towards the capital to witness the battle. The fights among the younger generation seemed like playground fights or even playing house compared to a showdown of this level. Many cultivators even felt that this was something worthy of being recorded in the history books, since there hadn&#8217;t been anyone daring enough to challenge the ruler of a Celestial Dynasty to a fight like this before.</span></p>

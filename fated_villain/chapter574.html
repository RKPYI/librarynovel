          >Standing on the snow plain enveloped by both a thick gray fog and
          blood mist, the Young War Immortal and Niu Tian quivered in fear,
          feeling the icy grip of terror. Everyone in their expedition group was
          dead, except for the two of them. Even the True Daoists had fallen
          prey to Gu Changge’s lethal prowess, leaving them to question whether
          they had any hope of survival.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Are you trying to threaten me?” Gu Changge smiled, his pristine
          white clothing remained unstained, seamlessly blending with the
          snowscape behind him. He slowly walked toward Niu Tian and the Young
          War Immortal. The sound of snow crunching beneath his feet sounded
          like bones being crushed, causing Niu Tian and the Young War Immortal
          to recoil in fear, desperately seeking a way to escape.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You can’t kill me, Gu Changge. If you do, the truth about your maid
          will be exposed to the public. You better reconsider your action… If
          you spare me, I promise I won’t say a word about today and keep your
          maid’s identity a secret.” The Young War Immortal suppressed the fear
          in his heart and calmly negotiated with Gu Changge, knowing that his
          desire to eliminate him stemmed from this very issue. He bitterly
          regretted revealing his shock at the Divine Rock Conference which drew
          the attention of Gu Changge.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“In my opinion, secrets are only truly kept by those who have passed
          on from this world. The oath you spoke of holds no weight or
          significance to me.” His handsome and flawless face was a dazzling
          sight to behold. Niu Tian and the Young War Immortal were both struck
          with fear in the midst of this chilling snow field.</span

          >“If you take my life, my Master will release the content in the
          photographic stone to the public. Have you considered what will happen
          once the Upper Realm learns of this truth?” The Young War Immortal put
          up a brave front while hoping Gu Changge would consider the grave
          consequences of this revelation</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He had taken extra precautions as a means of pressuring Gu Changge to
          spare his life before coming to Kun Mountain, knowing that any mishap
          could occur here. In the event of his demise, his Master would reveal
          the contents of the photographic stone, which contained a portion of
          his memory, to the public. However, he was still worried that Gu
          Changge would disregard all consequences, even if it meant exposing
          his maid’s true identity. Given his aloof personality, this was a
          distinct possibility.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“That reminds me, who is your Master? I’ll just take care of him and
          dispose of that photographic stone.” Gu Changge remained smiling
          indifferently, unfazed to the Young War Immortal’s threat.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You…!” The Young War Immortal was taken aback when he realised that
          Gu Changge had no intention of sparing him, but was even thinking of
          eliminating his Master. His fear intensified, causing him to break out
          in a sweat despite the freezing temperatures on the snow field. His
          body trembled uncontrollably.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“He never thought of sparing us from the start.” At that moment, Niu
          Tian also came to realise that Gu Changge was enjoying this game of
          cat and mouse. He was just letting them have a taste of the final
          despair before ending their lives.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!* The atmosphere suddenly quivered with an intense force. The
          Young War Immortal clenched his teeth and summoned his Heaven Covering
          Umbrella. His eyes were bloodshot and he looked like he had lost his
          mind. With a swift flick, the umbrella unfurled like a vast expanse of
          the sky, bearing down on Gu Changge with incredible force. It was one
          of his forbidden weapons, but the Young War Immortal was beyond
          caring. If he could inflict even a single blow on Gu Changge, it would
          be worth it. Gu Changge remained unfazed as he continued walking
          toward the Young War Immortal and Niu Tian, undeterred by the
          appearance of the black umbrella.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Crack!* As the black Heaven Covering Umbrella drew closer, Gu
          Changge’s aura intensified and radiated outward with a resounding
          force. The dark clouds dispersed and the umbrella shattered into
          pieces.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Clang, clang, clang…* In a moment of desperation, the Young War
          Immortal unleashed another forbidden weapon, transforming it into
          thousands of divine swords that charged toward Gu Changge. The
          dazzling display of light illuminated the surroundings as they
          resonated with each other. Each one was more than ten metres in length
          and as thick as a water tank. The radiant divine light was almost
          blinding, piercing through the void and engulfing Gu Changge in
          it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unfortunately, it was all ineffective against Gu Changge. He made no
          attempt to block the attack but only shook his head, and all the
          dazzling light immediately faded before him. His physical body seemed
          like a black hole, capable of absorbing any attacks. He truly
          possessed an impenetrable defence, rendering him immune to all divine
          abilities and techniques. The Young War Immortal was left feeling
          hopeless and defeated.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!!* In the next moment, the dimension seemed to contort and
          every living being quivered under the weight of this intense
          disturbance. A giant palm came out of Gu Changge and seized the Young
          War Immortal in a tight grip. With a resounding boom, the Young War
          Immortal was reduced to a cloud of crimson mist, and Gu Changge
          swiftly sealed his soul in a jade jar.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He had no intention of erasing his soul just yet until he dealt with
          the Young War Immortal’s Master. Despite the Young War Immortal’s
          meticulous plans, Gu Changge was confident that his Master would
          remain oblivious to his current state as long as he refrained from
          obliterating him immediately. All he had to do was send someone to
          finish off his Master right after he left Kun Mountain.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“The Hidden Celestial Bloodline…” After dealing with the Young War
          Immortal, Gu Changge once again looked at the desperate Niu Tian. Gu
          Channge deemed that Niu Tian’s physique had its limitations. After
          all, it needed to be awakened with the True Blood of the Hidden
          Celestial. Even so, it still had some value.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Gu Changge, karma will get you sooner or later… Aaah…!” Niu Tian’s
          unfinished sentence turned into a miserable scream.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!!* As Gu Changge extended his finger, a stunning crystal flower
          bloomed in the air. From its delicate petals, a luminous tendril
          emerged and approached Niu Tian’s forehead. It pierced through his
          flesh, blood, bones, internal organs and even his soul, until it
          reached the depths of his spiritual sea, drawing sustenance from his
          very essence.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >An Yan, who had been observing from behind Gu Changge, couldn’t help
          but shudder at the sight. Her face paled as she witnessed the gruesome
          and peculiar sight.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge was actually nurturing a Dao Flower with Niu Tian’s blood
          and Source. With her sharp intellect, she was able to guess what was
          going on. She lowered her head and pretended to see nothing. As long
          as she obeyed Gu Changge and did not cross him, she should be able to
          ensure her safety.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The grey fog quickly lifted, revealing a serene landscape covered
          with glistening silver snow that resembled the scenery from countries
          in the north. Amidst the remnants of the fierce battle, there were
          shattered artifacts and mangled bodies. It was an extremely horrifying
          sight.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge turned his head and glanced in a certain direction, a
          peculiar glint flashed across his eyes. He swiftly regained his
          composure and said to An Yan, “Let’s go.”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He had not brought her along to witness the demise of An Xi and the
          others, but to use her presence as a shield when the news about the An
          Clan and War Immortal Mansion inevitably spread.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This was all part of Gu Changge’s meticulous strategy to deflect any
          potential blame. With An Yan by his side, it was unlikely that many
          would suspect he had anything to do with the An Clan and the War
          Immortal Mansion’s incident because An Yan could easily refute any
          suspicion by stating that she would not have been cruel enough to harm
          her own kin.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After Gu Changge and An Yan departed, a figure appeared nearby. It
          was none other than Xiao Ruoyin.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She furrowed her brow slightly, sensing that Gu Changge had already
          spotted her earlier. Then again, it was unlikely that he would simply
          overlook her presence given his ruthless personality.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She let out a small sigh and found a spot to lay Niu Tian’s body to
          rest. She had watched the entire ordeal, but was unable to intervene.
          Despite her friendship with Niu Tian, she was powerless to save him
          under such circumstances. If she were to show herself just now she
          could have been killed by Gu Changge. An indifferent and heartless
          person like him would not show any mercy to her, just because she was
          trying to rescue a friend. Even at this moment, she was uncertain of
          her safety in his presence.</span

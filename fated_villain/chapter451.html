      <p>
        After Lin Wu entered the Gourd Valley, Lu Luo and the other young
        prodigies heaved a sigh of relief and turned to keep their eyes in the
        distance along with the Elders while drawing out various weapons
        apprehensively.<span id="more-30331"></span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The commotion was honestly too shocking, and they worried Gu Changge
        would rush over after sensing the anomaly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        At present, they didn&#8217;t need to fear anyone else in this space
        apart from Gu Changge. However, the man was genuinely terrifyingly
        powerful. None of them was a match for him, and what they witnessed had
        practically left a bone-chilling and traumatising experience in their
        heads.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;I&#8217;ve already sent a message to my uncle. They will rush
        over once they receive it. Once we have the numbers, we&#8217;ll be safe
        and no longer need to be this worried,&#8221; said Huo Rong as he fixed
        his gaze in the distance, seemingly explaining to the others and also
        seemingly reassuring himself.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        He was also a peerless talent in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.
        Though he wasn&#8217;t as notable as Lu Luo or Lin Wu, he was still a
        force to be reckoned with.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, he was from the Huo Family—a massive and ancient family with a
        long history—and also the young prodigy with the purest God of Flames
        Bloodline in his generation.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The others were reassured after hearing Huo Rong&#8217;s words, as the
        particular uncle had allegedly brought a powerful Huo Family artifact
        that could trigger the force outside at a crucial moment.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It would indeed be reassuring if he would come too.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;We have to obtain the Spirit Gourd Master&#8217;s mythical Gourd.
        That thing belongs to us,&#8221; Lu Luo maintained. &#8220;Our supreme
        treasures in this great battle are clearly lesser than that of the other
        realm. Our situation will only be worse if the gourd also ends up in
        their hands.&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        She was tall and stunning, had luscious hair, and her irises were laced
        with a dark green colour. Right then, she appeared steady and
        magnanimous, like a general about to volunteer to join the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the other young prodigiess would tacitly follow her lead when
        Lin Wu wasn&#8217;t around.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        One had to admit that they were indeed a great match. But given how
        terrible the circumstances in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains at
        present, it wasn&#8217;t wise to immerse themselves in love. Thus, Lin
        Wu and Lu Luo would consciously hold themselves back.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Let&#8217;s hope Lin Wu will be able to obtain the treasure.
        It&#8217;ll be worth it even if we die here.&#8221; Sternness enveloped
        the Elders&#8217; eyes as they prepared themselves for death, determined
        to buy Lin Wu some time to obtain the supreme treasure, even if it meant
        that they would die there and then.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The others, too, nodded gravely in agreement. Though it would be the
        worst-case scenario, they also had to be mentally prepared.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;So it&#8217;s here.&#8221; Alas, faint turbulence travelled from
        mid-air along with a monotone voice of a young man that caused the
        hearts of Lu Luo and the others to skip a beat as their eyes widened
        with incredulity, and in the next second, the space in front of them
        ripped apart, and terrifying Chaos Qi escaped from it.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        *Roar!* The massive Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon appeared from it,
        taking over the world with his immense powers as cold malice shone in
        his six pairs of eyes. On top of his head stood a young figure who
        seemingly made nothing of the people before his eyes but instead looked
        towards the Gourd Valley behind him.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Hazy red divine light shot to the sky as though intense malice
        intertwined there, allowing various incredibly powerful weapons to be
        drawn out. In fact, one could even vaguely hear weapons clashing against
        each other, shaking the world and trembling the universe.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It was a kind of terrifying force. Though it was yet to fully awaken, it
        was already horrifying enough.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge narrowed his eyes in response while still appearing
        unruffled.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;You…&#8221; On the other hand, horror enveloped Lu Luo and the
        others as their bodies trembled the moment Gu Changge showed up. Even
        their souls had seemingly frozen up.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The fear wasn&#8217;t one that they could control nor the trembling.
        Little did they imagine the man appeared through space without warning
        seconds after they had just prayed that he wouldn&#8217;t show up.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Even the most powerful Elders were shaking with gritting teeth, what
        more, the young ones!? For them to remain standing before Gu Changge was
        already the biggest defence they could make.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Once a cultivator advanced to a certain level, every inch of his skin
        could crush the space into dust and make the terrifying turbulence
        unbearable for others, even if he just stood there and did nothing, and
        clearly, in their eyes, Gu Changge and reached that level.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Divine light shone from every inch of his skin as Chaos Qi shrouded him,
        and his physical body had reached an unbelievably powerful degree.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Gu… Gu Changge…&#8221; Lu Luo attempted to speak to the man after
        suppressing her fear and forcing herself to calm down. She intended to
        stall for time: one, to wait for Lin Wu to get to the mythical gourd,
        and two, to wait for their reinforcements to arrive.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;You know who I am?&#8221; Gu Changge withdrew his gaze from the
        valley and turned to the young woman with placid and unfathomable eyes
        upon hearing her voice.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Lu Luo&#8217;s face paled uncontrollably when she saw that Gu
        Changge&#8217;s eyes were placid like the fathomless, bottomless ocean.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It wasn&#8217;t condescension but pure dismissal and indifference like
        he was seeing a speck of dust or a pebble by his feet. It was that
        simple.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the other youths dared not even look into Gu Changge&#8217;s
        eyes as they thought they were even more terrifying than any abilities,
        and those eyes would crush their souls.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Lu Luo, on the other hand, swallowed her fear and kept calm as she said,
        &#8220;I heard that man address you as such.&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Chu Hao had called out to Gu Changge before dying in the latter&#8217;s
        hands, so the name seared in her mind. He was a leading figure of the
        Upper Realm, after all. She naturally had to take note of him.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Oh, are you intending to stall for time?&#8221; Gu Changge asked
        plainly, seeing through her plan at first glance, causing Lu Luo&#8217;s
        face to blanch further as chills ran down her spine. She couldn&#8217;t
        help taking a few steps back, feeling as though a terrifying suffocating
        sensation enveloped her.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The countenances of several Elders turned dramatically, and they stood
        in front of the young lady, attempting to resist Gu Changge&#8217;s
        terrifying intimidation.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;What&#8217;s the name of the person who went in?&#8221; Gu
        Changge asked plainly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Lin Wu,&#8221; Lu Luo answered, biting the bullet.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Lin Wu…&#8221; Gu Changge nodded and said no more, nor did he
        enter the Gourd Valley but only waited outside, for there was no reason
        for him to enter.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      [Looks like this Fortuitous One has quite the luck to bring me the supreme
      treasure.]
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Though the cultivators of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains
        couldn&#8217;t figure out what Gu Changge was thinking, they dared not
        speak up, for they were too scared to even move.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Only Lu Luo&#8217;s heart skipped a beat as she had a good picture of
        what the man had in mind—he intended to snatch the mythical gourd from
        Lin Wu&#8217;s hands as soon as he came out.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Despite the subtle shift in her countenance, she felt a lot more
        reassured.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Word was that many attempted to steal the mythical gourd from the Spirit
        Gourd Master when he first obtained it, only for them to fail in the
        end, as it was nearly impossible for anyone else to activate it after
        the gourd had acknowledged its Master, even when others managed to take
        it for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        As its Master, he&#8217;d be able to call it back to him no matter how
        far the gourd had parted from him.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Sure, Gu Changge was nearly almighty, but it remained unknown who the
        mythical gourd would acknowledge after it stirred completely. It also
        probably wouldn&#8217;t be easy for him to steal it away from Lin Wu.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        And Just when Lu Luo was deep in her thoughts, Gu Changge suddenly
        looked towards her and asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Lu Luo&#8217;s heart skipped a beat again. Still, she dared not conceal
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Lu Luo,&#8221; she answered.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Lu Luo?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled plainly, then suddenly extended
        his hand towards her. Gales howled, and thunder roared the next second
        as runes flashed, seemingly transforming into an enormous palm that
        covered up the sky easily.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Lu Luo…&#8221; Surprise and shock enveloped the Elders&#8217;
        faces, and they drew out various artifacts to resist the palm,
        attempting to save Lu Luo.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*Rumble!*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        However, terrible turbulence rippled across space following the
        thunderous rumble, and their artifacts exploded into bits under the
        enormous palm. All of them coughed up blood, even more so, suffering
        near-fatal injuries.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Everyone became beyond fearful when they realised the devastation of
        fighting an unbeatable foe.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Lu Luo&#8217;s face was ghastly pale as well, but she knew there was no
        use fighting or running away. They could only resignedly close their
        eyes in despair and wait for death to befall them.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Stop!&#8221; A sudden roar of anger came from the horizon as
        several powerful figures rushed in their direction. The voice belonged
        to an Elder holding a green snake cane. A brilliant green glow burst out
        as she wielded the cane, and the glow transformed into a silhouette of
        an ancient divine tree that struck the palm in an attempt to save Lu
        Luo.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains reinforcement had arrived.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The other cultivators, too, launched divine lights of various colours
        towards the palm, and their brilliant techniques and abilities
        interwoven into dense Principle Chains in the air. However, before they
        could even get close, a black spear that appeared out of nowhere swept
        across the chains.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        What followed was a black tide-like ray that came at them, causing their
        countenances to turn awful as they hurriedly countered the attack.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        *Boom!* A thunderous boom reverberated across space as though a star had
        exploded. All their attacks also exploded into dust as the black spear
        swept across them. At that moment, everyone retreated as fear surged
        within them when they saw the Hell Iron armoured figure.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ll kill you now. Why look so
        fearful?&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head as he sounded seemingly
        baffled.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The palm he cast then grabbed Lu Luo, sealed her Spiritual Sea, and set
        up restraints before finally chucking her aside.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Despair remained on Lu Luo&#8217;s face as she dropped to the ground, as
        she couldn&#8217;t believe she was still alive. That said, she still
        couldn&#8217;t help feeling fearful when Gu Changge chucked her aside
        after sealing her cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, she was still a young woman in her twenties, no
        matter how calm and steadily she behaved, and the events of this day
        were genuinely traumatising to her like she had really gone to hell and
        back. So, how could she calm down?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Let Lady Lu Luo go! Who in the world are you?!&#8221; Grimness
        enveloped Grandma Lu Cui&#8217;s face upon seeing the scene, and the
        green snake cane in her hand glowed densely with a green glow at the
        ready to launch her next attack.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        She couldn&#8217;t begin to fathom just how powerful Gu Changge was, but
        it didn&#8217;t mean that she would sit and watch him humiliate the
        Young Mistress of her family.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The rest of the reinforcements, too, gazed apprehensively towards Ah Da,
        whom they sensed terrifyingly powerful energy. Not even someone in the
        Sacred Emperor Realm would be able to do anything to him. The fact that
        a cultivator this strong had snuck to this place left them uneasy.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Leave me be, Grandma Lu Cui! You guys are no match for
        him!&#8221; shouted Lu Luo as she suppressed her fear, worried that Gu
        Changge would suddenly launch an attack on her family&#8217;s Elder.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Lady Lu Luo!&#8221; Grandma Lu Cui widened her eyes with
        incredulity as her heart skipped a beat. Clearly, she hadn&#8217;t
        expected Lu Luo to say such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        She was overcome with stupefaction for a moment while wondering why the
        young man looked blurry, as though he was universes away, even though he
        was standing right in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;If you don&#8217;t wish to see everyone here die, then be a good
        girl and listen to me. Who knows? I might even let you live,&#8221;
        monotoned Gu Changge to Lu Luo, never batting an eyelid at the Eight
        Wastelands and Ten Domains reinforcement that rushed over.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        To him, the only things that mattered were Lin Wu, the mythical
        Immortal-Killing Gourd and the Immortal-Killing Blade. He needn&#8217;t
        bother himself with the lives of others when he could kill them all with
        just a few palm strikes.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; Lu Luo acquiesced as fear surged within her.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;It&#8217;s him… He&#8217;s the one who manifested his Dharma Body
        in front of the Boundary Marker Sea that day! How can it be…&#8221;
        someone behind Grandma Lu Cui exclaimed with wide eyes, shocked when
        they finally recognised Gu Changge as never had they expected to find
        the man here. Though it was just a Dharma Body from countless distances
        away, his aura and energy would remain the same.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Him? What is he doing here?!&#8221; Shocked were Grandma Lu Cui
        and the others.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        They naturally knew of the incident, for it sent a massive blow to the
        fighting spirits of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        They knew it was the doing of the Upper Realm&#8217;s strongest in this
        young generation, but never did they expect the man to be in this realm
        and specifically this place.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        For a moment, fear, too, enveloped them, and they no longer dared to
        attack like they had earlier.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Looks like he&#8217;s coming out soon. Rather quick, I must say.
        He didn&#8217;t disappoint me.&#8221; Gu Changge made nothing of
        everyone&#8217;s fearful faces but rather gazed into the Gourd Valley
        with great interest before smiling a little.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        He could sense the immense aura inside was continuously dispersing, but
        the looming malice in the space earlier was merging continuously like it
        would burst through the sky at any time.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*Buzz!*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The next moment, a burst of intensely malicious energy came like a
        peerless Celestial Sword that could destroy countless stars unsheathing,
        and the inside of the Gourd Valley suddenly cracked. Dust and smoke shot
        to the skies as the mountain peaks aside crumbled with a thunderous
        rumble.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, a glowing amber gourd surrounded by Chaos Qi shot out from
        within and horrifying, rattling sword energy projectile one after
        another as physical swords enveloped in a terrifying scarlet glow
        manifested and circled the opening of the gourd.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The bloody glow was caused by too many killings, and now it had merged
        into a red glow.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Very quickly, the sword energies returned to the gourd, which became
        austere after its brilliance had been tucked away, and it fell from the
        sky into a young man&#8217;s hands in the end.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Gotcha!&#8221; Jubilation and excitement enveloped Lin Wu&#8217;s
        face when he obtained the mythical gourd.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Though it was a difficult process, and he nearly failed midway, he
        ultimately made it show itself.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Good things do come to those who wait. I did it!&#8221;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Of course, Lin Wu was oblivious to what had happened outside the Gourd
        Valley, and he transformed into a phantom to dash out of place after
        retrieving the amber gourd, not daring to stay any longer.

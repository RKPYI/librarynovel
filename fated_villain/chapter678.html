        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The All-Encompassing Border City stood at the ends of the world, and it was so majestic that it seemed to be able to support the universe. This place was where tens of thousands of cultivators gathered and was extremely lively. Some came from all over the Upper Realm, while the others were young prodigies who followed their Sects and came to the Upper Realm for the first time through the cross-realm teleportation array.</span><span id="more-34843"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there seemed to be a clear line between the two groups of cultivators. They didn&#8217;t stay together, and neither did they interfere with each other. Most of the cultivators from the Upper Realm were arrogant and detached, and they were disdainful enough to not think the cultivators from the Lower Realm were worthy of standing with them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones from the Lower Realm were well aware of the situation despite not letting it show. Many of the ones from the younger generations, especially, clenched their fists in humiliation as they held their emotions in. Being the best in the Lower Realm, they could defeat the strongest person of their generation. In their own Sects, they were treated even more outstandingly since they were unmatched. But after arriving in the Upper Realm, they didn&#8217;t shine as brightly anymore and they slowly blended into the crowd. Any young prodigy they could find around them easily had auras more terrifying than theirs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This put them in utter despair as their Dao Hearts turned bleak. However, some of them quickly recovered, and they quietly reminded themselves that they were no worse than the Upper Realm young prodigies. The only thing different between them was the circumstances of their births. As long as they could achieve good results in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, they would naturally be able to become disciples of some Immortal Forces, and one day reach the Immortal Realm, capable of ruling the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We are no weaker than them.’ They told themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, there was a handsome young man in green among the Lower Realm crowd was asking an old man with an aged face and long white beard, &#8220;Third Elder, is our goal this time to obtain the Life Changing Decree or to seize this Realm’s Fortuity on the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man of medium build looked like he was only fifteen or sixteen years old. Yet, he had an aura that was hard to ignore. With delicate features and a proud bearing, he only had to look around slightly to give off a sense as if he could accomplish great things. Although he wasn&#8217;t as strong as all the young prodigies from the Upper Realm, he was an attention-grabber who nevertheless stood out amongst the crowd of young prodigies from the Lower Realm. A lot of young men and women walking with him would also peer at him with apprehensive gazes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Third Elder that the young man was talking to frowned seemingly out of concern when he heard those words. He glanced left and right before whispering to the young man, &#8220;Don&#8217;t bring this up for now. In fact, don&#8217;t ever mention anything about this Realm’s Fortuity before we enter the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That put a frown on the young man&#8217;s face. Even though he didn&#8217;t understand too well, he chose not to ask anything else. He only touched his nose in a somewhat habitual manner. But right then, a fair and delicate lady wearing a long red dress came over from the other side. She seemed to have overheard the conversation before her slender and tall figure moved towards the men. Slightly parting her red lips, she informed the young man in a low voice. &#8220;Lu Ming, my father has specifically mentioned that it would be better for us to not let anyone else hear about this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Sovereign said that?&#8221; The man called Lu Ming was taken aback, but it wasn&#8217;t because of doubt. After all, the unbelievably beautiful young lady standing in front was the daughter of the Sovereign of the Mysterious Rainbow Sect, which was also the Sect backing Lu Ming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of status and identity, the Mysterious Rainbow Sect were respected beyond words in the world they live in—Blue Flood Ancient World. There were four powerful Sects that were overlords, and one of them was the Mysterious Rainbow Sect. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Mysterious Rainbow Sect had sent less than ten young disciples, including Lu Ming, to the Upper Realm, those who were sent were all outstanding students of their generation in their world. Xue Yan, the young lady who spoke to him, had a relatively close relationship with him. Because of that, it was unlikely she would say something that wasn&#8217;t the truth at this moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems like the purpose of this Great War of Hundred Worlds is not only for the Life Changing Decree. It is also for seizing this Realm’s Fortuity.] Lu Ming thought to himself as he looked at the majestic and terrifying ancient city with conflicted eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Life Changing Decree was a reward for those who had reached a certain rank in the Great War of Hundred Worlds. With the Life Changing Decree, they could join the Forces of the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Realm’s Fortuity, on the other hand, involves the evolution, prosperity and aging of a world or realm. Not only their world, but other worlds were also trying their best to get their hands on it at all costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The many Immortal Forces of the Upper Realm had control over the Fortuity of the Upper Realm. If those from the Lower Realm didn&#8217;t want their worlds to collapse, they must find a way to seize some to maintain their worlds&#8217; stability for the next millions of years. This method was similar to raising Gu Insects—they wanted to get the many Cultivators from the Lower Realm to cannibalise each other so that they could select the most powerful ‘Gu Insect’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another direction, many young prodigies from other ancient worlds were staring at those from Blue Flood Ancient World with unpleasant looks on their faces. &#8220;None of the young prodigies who came from the Blue Flood Ancient World look formidable this time. They probably won’t be able to put up a good fight. We can take our chance during the Great War of Hundred Worlds to settle accounts with them for what happened last time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the Lower Realm ancient worlds were not in harmony. They regarded each other as enemies even more due to the Great War of Hundred Worlds. Like fire and water, they couldn&#8217;t wait to completely destroy each other here. It wasn&#8217;t like they were targeting the Blue Flood Ancient World though. It was just that as soon as the young prodigies from the ancient worlds entered the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, their life and death were no longer within their control. Unless they were valued by the Forces of the Upper Realm and were accepted in advance, they were bound to face endless fights and massacre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, the patrol guards at the gate of the border city suddenly looked over and coldly stated, &#8220;Everyone who wants to enter the city, come here. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are from the Lower Realm or anywhere else. Get your ass here and obediently accept interrogation.&#8221; Their voices contained some kind of Principles, which made everyone&#8217;s Life Force boil. Those with weaker cultivation almost lost their footing and fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tall and burly patrolling guards were all wearing battle suits made of Hell&#8217;s Iron. Their ferocity rocketed as they rode on fierce beasts while holding Heavenly Swords and Heavenly Daggers. No one could fathom how powerful they were. Even those in the Sacred Realm did not dare to say anything for fear of offending these patrolling guards. Left with no choice, they could only obediently abide by the rules of this place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are so scary. The Elders in the Sect may not even be their opponents. They might even get killed with a single blow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It feels like one look from them will shatter our souls&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Lower Realm young prodigies turned pale. All they could feel now was their souls shivering as fear completely consumed them. This was their first time in the Upper Realm and encountering such terrifying patrol guards. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I can only hope for there to be a day when we are as powerful as them.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Ming, Xue Yan, and the others from Rainbow Ancient World also didn&#8217;t dare say anything. They could only follow behind the crowd obediently as they waited for the patrol guards at the city gate to check their backgrounds and interrogate them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not only those from the Lower Realm, but even those from the Upper Realm as well. They all did the same for fear of offending these patrol guards. The reason for that was that these patrolling guards represented the rules of the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. Furthermore, no one would dare underestimate these guards when they had various Immortal Forces supporting them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Chosen One&#8217;s Commandment Token&#8230;&#8221; At this time, a commotion suddenly sounded from a seemingly shocked patrol guard, who was investigating someone on the other side. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patrol guard was riding a gigantic celestial wolf and was standing in front of a figure wearing a hat with a black scarf. Seeing a token handed out by the figure, the guard didn&#8217;t seem to know what to do with it for a moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tall and strong man, who looked like a commander among the guards, came over when he heard the commotion. After glancing at the commandment token and confirming its authenticity, he calmly instructed, &#8220;There is no need to interrogate this one since he has the Chosen One&#8217;s Commandment Token. Just let him in.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds managed to survive till this day was because of the many Forces behind it. Having the Chosen One&#8217;s Commandment Token meant that this figure was here under the order of a certain influential figure in the Upper Realm. Naturally, the guards wouldn&#8217;t ask him any more questions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scene surprised everyone. After all, only a few people understood what the Chosen One&#8217;s Commandment Token was and represented. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite their envious gazes, they couldn&#8217;t bring themselves to say anything. Except for the Successor of major Forces, the rest who entered the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds were basically wandering cultivators without any affiliation to a Force in the Upper Realm. It was the main reason they were here to try their luck. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successors of such major Forces were the only ones who had a Chosen One&#8217;s Commandment Token. This wasn&#8217;t something that ordinary people had much contact with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Ming and everyone from the Mysterious Rainbow Sect were surprised as well when they noticed this. They began to guess who that figure clad in black was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He must be someone important. He didn&#8217;t even need to be examined to go in…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wonder what&#8217;s a Chosen One&#8217;s Commandment Token?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were amazed by almost everything since it was their first time in the Upper Realm. However, they know that someone like the figure was probably not from the same world as them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Roar!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And right when everyone was shocked by the Chosen One&#8217;s Commandment Token and were guessing the identity of the black figure, the stars in the depths of the sky in the distance trembled. There was suddenly the roars of dragons that shook the sky, so clear they could pierce eardrums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the mountain-like Azure Dragons made their way over while crushing all the stars, the surrounding land and sky began to tremble. The majestic and terrifying pressure felt as though ancient ferocious beasts had been revived. With their overwhelming, ferocious prestige, they looked like they were about to sweep over the world and shatter the void.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Azure Dragons, who had reached the Sacred Lord Realm, had bodies as thick as a hill. They were pulling along a resplendent carriage gleaming with divine light as they crossed the sky in an unscrupulous and rampant manner. They were trying to cross the city wall to go to the depths of the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An Azure-Dragon-drawn carriage? Could it be&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why would he come to the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds? Surely no one other than him would act like this in the Upper Realm?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, almost everyone couldn&#8217;t help but go weak in their legs. They wanted to kneel down and pay respects to those behemoths. Even those in the Sacred Realm immediately sported frightened and alarmed expressions on their faces. They knew how petrifying the Azure Dragons were, but the truly fearsome one was the identity of the person riding in the carriage! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Who is this?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[They are making such ferocious beasts draw the carriage? Just who is in the golden carriage? How frightening…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone from the Lower Realm started feeling as inferior as ants. They had turned pale from the fear. It seemed possible to them that one of the dragons pulling the carriage was enough to kill everyone here. If creatures like the Azure Dragons appeared in the Lower Realm, they would definitely bring about a catastrophic disaster. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yet, they are being used as tools to draw a carriage!?] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, they were washed over by a bone-chilling terror. This was something they could not and could never imagine to be possible. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Judging from their reaction, they must know who is in the carriage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The patrol guards are pretending like they are clueless about someone blatantly barging into the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. They even seem wary and fearful…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Ming&#8217;s group also felt their skin crawl. They had to witness something so eerie right on the first day they arrived in the Upper Realm. A shadow of fear had cast over them. It was still fresh in their minds how differently these guards acted before. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area in front of the All-Encompassing Border City was a forbidden space. No matter who it was, anyone who was brave enough to break the rule would be making an enemy of the entire Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. However, those patrol guards didn&#8217;t dare question the person who was now unscrupulously barging into this place under everyone&#8217;s watchful eyes. They even pretended not to know. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those from the Lower Realm felt their mouths run dry when they witnessed what they would regard as ‘true power’, something which they were experiencing for the first time. Perhaps, such figures thought everyone else and the ancient worlds they came from no different from ants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What… Why is he here on the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds? Sure he didn&#8217;t…] The black-clad figure wearing a black veil over her face and a rain hat was frozen in place like the rest of them here. Her elegant fists were clenched without her realising. She didn&#8217;t think she would bump into Gu Changge after she rushed over to the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was probably no one in the massive Upper Realm other than Gu Changge who would ride a carriage drawn by Azure Dragons when travelling. At this point, almost everyone in the Upper Realm would think of Gu Changge as long as they saw Azure Dragons pulling a carriage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Su Qingge had spent a considerable amount of time by Gu Changge&#8217;s side in the past. Even though she was standing far away from the carriage, she was absolutely certain that the person sitting in the carriage was Gu Changge. The only thing Su Qingge couldn&#8217;t figure out was why he would be here in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds when his wedding was right around the corner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A massive wave hit the outside of the All-Encompassing Border City when the Azure-Dragon-driven carriage crossed the wall. Manywho took charge of matters in the city were also shocked when they first got the news of Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were six main regions in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, which were clearly divided, and they would be each other&#8217;s enemies until the end of time. However, it didn&#8217;t mean that the leaders of these six regions were enemies. On the contrary, they were close enough to secretly keep in touch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the extremely dark underground palace, a gaunt, gloomy old man in a black robe was pacing back and forth and muttering to himself. &#8220;What is Gu Changge&#8217;s purpose for suddenly appearing here…&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many bones piled up in the underground palace, and even the steps were stacked with shiny skulls where hazy brilliance flowed. Other than that, inexplicable murderous intent intertwined and permeated the air in the underground palace where many black shadows knelt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skeletal elderly man had a cold gaze when he waved his hand and instructed the figures in the dark, &#8220;Someone, inform the other nine Palace Lords to be more vigilant and not let any news leak. I have a feeling that there is a connection between Nephrite Breeze Pavilion and Gu Changge. Otherwise, why do we keep getting information about him as they have wrecked so many of our plans.&#8221;</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sir, the Young Lady from Blue Flood Ancient World has been brought here,&#8221; a servant reported from outside the palace just as Gu Changge put the jade tablet down.</span><span id="more-36150"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Has she? Let her come in, then,&#8221; Gu Changge nodded as his countenance returned to normal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, the Third Treasurer led Xue Yan into the palace. She wore a red dress and had a delicate, fair face with eyes like water and hair like clouds. However, she appeared somewhat nervous and anxious, her hands tightly gripping her sleeves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plethora of intimidating cultivators hid in the most splendid palace in the Vermilion Bird Hall. Their divine senses were vast like the abyss, and their auras were like a volcanic eruption, suppressing even the sky above them. Their gazes alone suffocated Xue Yan and made her tremble in fear. It wouldn&#8217;t even be an exaggeration to say that any one of them, who were ancient-deity-like, could easily wipe out Blue Flood Ancient World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Xue Yan?&#8221; Gu Changge spoke up with a smile just as the young woman was overwhelmed with various thoughts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was dressed in all white, with his black hair hung loosely. His figure was slender and upright, appearing very simple and plain. On his handsome face, he carried a smile that could easily calm one&#8217;s chaotic thoughts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Xue Yan didn&#8217;t consider herself a common woman, she was stunned by the man in white, who seemed like a transcendent Immortal before her eyes. Her cheeks flushed with a rosy hue, and it took her a long while to finally come around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Gu.&#8221; She bowed respectfully, and her gaze fell upon Ah Qing, who was standing behind Gu Changge and making tea for him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The million-year-old Spring Tree Core was boiling, and the Enlightenment Tea Leaves were tumbling, emitting a strong aroma as many anomalies appeared. Dao intertwined, sunlight filled the room, and various precious artifacts such as a small golden sword, an ancient bell the size of a palm, and a small golden cauldron surfaced. In terms of value, this cup of tea was worth a city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xue Yan had only seen such legendary artifacts in ancient texts. It could help cultivators comprehend the Great Dao. Even just smelling the tea’s aroma could boost their cultivation by leaps and bounds. She never expected to see them with her own eyes one day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was more, they were merely used to make ordinary tea for daily consumption. Not even the word ‘luxury’ could begin to describe it. [Surely only those peerless beings can achieve such a thing…] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xue Yan quickly recovered from her trance, unaffected by these things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;May I know the reason you have summoned me today, Young Master Gu?&#8221; she asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I need your assistance with something, naturally.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and gestured for her to sit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xue Yan hesitated, not understanding what business required Gu Changge to seek her. If even Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t handle it, could she? Still, she sat down and waited for Gu Changge to continue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ah Qing went over and poured her a cup of Enlightenment Tea, then returned to standing deferentially behind Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew that Gu Changge was devising a big plot, and Xue Yan was the perfect pawn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Enlightenment Tea&#8230;&#8221; Xue Yan was stunned for a moment when she saw the tea in front of her. She never thought that one day she would be able to drink Enlightenment Tea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Enlightenment Tea boiled and emitted an intoxicating aura of the Dao. A palm-sized bell emerged and rang while a divine sword shone brilliantly as though they existed in reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt every pore in her body expanding; even her soul absorbed this Enlightenment aura, and her cultivation, which had been stuck for a while, also showed signs of loosening. That said, she averted her gaze with great difficulty and did not waver from her original intention because of the Enlightenment Tea. &#8220;This thing is too precious. I&#8217;m unworthy of enjoying it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s just tea. It&#8217;s nothing compared to the help I need from you, Lady Xue Yan,&#8221; Gu Changge waved his hand with a smile and a hint of admiration in his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it that you require me to do then, Young Master Gu?&#8221; she asked with great interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want you to keep an eye on someone for me,&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and tapped the table in front of him slowly and leisurely. &#8220;Report everything he does and everything that happens around him to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Someone?&#8221; Xue Yan was stunned again. [Who could it be that required me to keep an eye on and even report their every action to Young Master Gu?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe you know this person,&#8221; Gu Changge said with a smile, unsurprised by Xue Yan&#8217;s reaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Ah Qing went up to Xue Yan and handed her a jade tablet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xue Yan&#8217;s divine sense penetrated the jade tablet. &#8220;This is&#8230; Senior Brother Lu Ming?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What she saw inside stunned her, causing her to widen her eyes with incredulity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with him, Lady Xue Yan.&#8221; In actuality, Gu Changge was surprised that this Fortuitous One, which he made nothing of, would have an inexplicable connection with Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Alliance of Thousand Merchants&#8217; eyes and ears are spread throughout the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, barely anything would go unnoticed by him. Hence, even when Lu Ming had been super careful about gathering news about Neraka, it was very obvious to those who were attentive. Especially when Gu Changge, too, was searching for Neraka&#8217;s whereabouts. However, to avoid alerting the enemy, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t send his men to capture Lu Ming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, after careful consideration, he decided to use the Fortuitous One&#8217;s Destined Woman to see if he could find out how Lu Ming made contact with Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;May I know the reason, Young Master Gu?&#8221; Xue Yan, in a dilemma, dared not refuse Gu Changge&#8217;s request. She was quick-witted and knew she was in no position to negotiate or speak to Gu Changge as an equal. Naturally, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t need her consent either. He naturally had ways to control or threaten her. But she never thought this &#8216;someone&#8217; turned out to be Lu Ming, who she was extremely familiar with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two were pretty close and often sparred. In fact, she even had some indescribable feelings for him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because he has a trace of someone I&#8217;m looking for on him. So, I want to find that person through him. Don&#8217;t worry, I have no ill intentions towards your Senior Brother,&#8221; Gu Changge answered with a smile, taking a sip of tea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He naturally wouldn&#8217;t say that he wanted to find Neraka through Lu Ming. Xue Yan didn&#8217;t need to know that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see.&#8221; Xue Yan nodded a little solemnly. That said, she didn&#8217;t believe Gu Changge completely. She knew the man would never tell her everything, given her status. The only thing she could do was follow Gu Changge&#8217;s orders obediently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Gu Changge&#8217;s current gentle appearance, Xue Yan had heard many rumours about his cruelty, which were no less than those of a terrifying demon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that, Gu Changge ordered Ah Qing to hand Xue Yan a communication jade talisman. It had a special restriction that could sense her whereabouts and actions. In addition, many things about Lu Ming could also be transmitted through this jade talisman. Of course, the most important thing was that if Xue Yan dared to leak any of this, Gu Changge&#8217;s people would notice it and take action immediately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You will be rewarded nicely if you do the job right.&#8221; Said Ah Qing with a smile as she gave Xue Yan the communication jade talisman even though she thought nothing of Xue Yan. But because of Gu Changge, she dared not look down or mock the Young Lady from Blue Flood Ancient World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Got it,&#8221; Xue Yan nodded and took the communication jade talisman, but she felt a bit heavy-hearted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, she thought Gu Changge had summoned her in the middle of the night for something else. In the end, it was all just in her head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Given Gu Changge&#8217;s status, he would&#8217;ve likely seen all sorts of women in the Upper Realm. Why would he fall for a Lower Realm woman like me!?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Take this pot of Enlightenment Tea back with you for your fellow disciples, Lady Xue Yan,&#8221; Gu Changge said with a smile after Xue Yan took up the task, having no intention of keeping her any longer and began bidding her farewell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xue Yan hesitated a little. She couldn&#8217;t imagine the value of this pot of Enlightenment Tea. But since it was a casual gift from Gu Changge, she didn&#8217;t want to be too difficult and thanked him before taking the teapot and leaving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Third Treasurer who had brought her over stood at the palace gate, awaiting her return. Envy flashed across his eyes when he saw Xue Yan coming out with Enlightenment Tea. Even with his status, it would cost him a great deal if he wanted to taste it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from Gu Changge, there likely weren&#8217;t many in the Upper Realm who could afford such luxury. Of course, this night was an exception. Gu Changge had ordered Ah Qing to brew two pots of tea. Hence, he would have the chance to savour the exquisite tea later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the palace, after Xue Yan left, Gu Changge&#8217;s smile disappeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His gaze turned unfathomable for a moment, and he ordered Ah Qing, &#8220;Keep an eye on everyone from Blue Flood Ancient World these next few days. Also, I want to know everything about Lu Ming. Take control of all his friends and relatives in Blue Flood Ancient World. Don&#8217;t let anyone slip away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Lu Ming was the Fortuitous One, and anything unexpected could happen. To ensure nothing went wrong, Gu Changge decided to control his relatives and friends first. As such, even if Xue Yan blew her cover, he would still have the means to make Lu Ming yield and take him to Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing&#8217;s heart skipped a beat, and she nodded gravely, &#8220;Rest assured, Young Master Gu. I will see to it right away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Flood Ancient World was infinitely far away from here but was one of the many nearby Lower Realms. It was like a tiny speck of dust in the vast galaxy. Even if Gu Changge destroyed it with a strike of his hand, it wouldn&#8217;t cause any ripples, let alone control some people there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since you won&#8217;t come to me even when you&#8217;re here in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, then I shall go to you.] After giving Ah Qing the order, Gu Changge dismissed the others in the palace and gazed at the shimmering moon outside. He shook his head gently, then took a step forward and disappeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Qingge&#8217;s situation surprised him, and he would have to solve this unexpected problem himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battlefield of Hundred Worlds might be vast, but it was still a piece of cake for Gu Changge to search for someone, especially when that someone cultivated the Forbidden Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Lan Yifei of the Immortal Dao Alliance appeared in a secluded courtyard in Dark Net Hall. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Chosen One&#8217;s Commandment Token seems to be working well for you. As expected of the Forbidden Demonic Arts. Your aura has grown much stronger in just a few days!&#8221; he sighed in admiration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did you know I was here?&#8221; Su Qingge asked in an incredibly raspy and impassive voice, standing far away, shrouded in black mist, making it hard for anyone to see her figure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Immortal Dao Alliance happens to back Dark Net Hall, so it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that I should know you&#8217;re here,&#8221; he said with a smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, Su Qingge regained composure and asked, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid I&#8217;ll kill you here and now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not really. You don&#8217;t have that ability right now.&#8221; Lan Yifei shook his head. &#8220;The reason I came to find you is to know the identity of the true Successor of Demonic Arts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had been studying the Forbidden Demonic Arts Su Qingge gave him lately, and he thought a new door to cultivation had opened up before him. He didn&#8217;t suppress his desire to test it out either, and ultimately he scouted several corpses to use in his cultivation. It felt so good that it got out of control, and it even made him want to destroy his previous foundation and rebuild it with the Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, he wanted to know who the true Successor of Demonic Arts was so that he could obtain the complete Forbidden Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will tell you when the time is right. This is not the time yet,&#8221; Su Qingge said plainly, having no intention of revealing it to Lan Yifei.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you really think I won&#8217;t attack you?&#8221; Lan Yifei frowned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, he was beginning to doubt if Su Qingge actually knew who the real Successor of Demonic Art was or if she was only a pawn kept in the dark like him. Hence, she would come up with such an excuse to stall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Try me,&#8221; Su Qingge dared, unfazed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She might not have been able to defeat Lan Yifie before, but now that she had consumed many Sources within the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, her cultivation had advanced greatly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You just don&#8217;t know when to give up. You are no match for me unless the real Successor of Demonic Arts shows up, especially when we&#8217;re in the Immortal Dao Alliance&#8217;s turf,&#8221; Lan Yifei said icily, his smile gradually disappearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like I said, try me.&#8221; Su Qingge smirked disdainfully though the mist was obstructing her beautiful face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lan Yifei locked his brows into a tight furrow. Honestly, he didn&#8217;t want to fight Su Qingge here, as he couldn&#8217;t be sure if she had any more tricks up her sleeve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you so unwilling to tell me who the Successor of Demonic Arts is then?&#8221; he questioned rudely with hints of suspicion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hint of indifference flashed across Su Qingge&#8217;s eyes, and she explained plainly, &#8220;You just need to know that you&#8217;re in no position to learn about him now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Would you still have the confidence to seize the complete Forbidden Demonic Arts if you knew who the real Successor of Demonic Arts was? Laughable.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Lan Yifei had no idea what was running through Su Qingge&#8217;s mind, and he looked slightly grim, having thought he had been looked down upon. &#8220;You&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He nearly sneered in anger and wanted to fight Su Qingge, making her realise the stark difference between their strengths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, a strange space fluctuation appeared in the courtyard, accompanied by the voice of a young man. &#8220;Sounds like you&#8217;re looking for me.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horror struck Su Qingge under the mist as her face instantly turned ghastly pale.</span></p>

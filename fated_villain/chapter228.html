      <h4>
        Chapter 228-1: Yue Mingkongs plan to catch the turtle in the jar, You
        have to pay attention to your Master (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge always felt that there was something fishy between
        the reincarnation of the different Human Ancestors and the so-called
        ‘snatchers’ who took over other people’s bodies, but when all was said
        and done, there was definitely a big difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        An old fried dough stick like the Human Ancestor had been reincarnated
        so many times, how could there be no means to help him conceal the
        creation of a situation leading to dual soul symbiosis from the outside
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if the strongest cultivator was there to investigate, don't even
        think about finding the traces of snatching, at most they would only
        explain that the memories of his previous life were awakened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge telling Yaoyao that Jiang Yang had been taken away in such a
        righteous manner was no different from a framed accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because he didn't have any powerful means now, he could not directly
        prove that Jiang Yang was not what he used to be.
      </p>
      <p>But that didn't matter either.</p>
      <p>After all, Yaoyao trusted him very much.</p>
      <p>
        What he wanted was to make Yaoyao doubt Jiang Yang and let her give
        birth to vigilance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Jiang Yang was stupid enough to directly attack Yaoyao, then it would
        be exactly what Gu Changge wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fate of the Heavenly Star Realm leaning on both sides would collide,
        and he could take advantage being the fisherman, and make up for the
        Human Ancestor at the critical moment.
      </p>
      <p>Wasn't it wonderful?</p>
      <p>
        "According to the current methods of Human Ancestor, it is unlikely that
        he would retain Jiang Yang's original consciousness and become the
        dominating one casually. The so-called honesty is only an image that he
        maintained on the surface."
      </p>
      <p>
        "After all, among righteous people, who will choose Holy Maidens from
        generation to generation…"
      </p>
      <p>
        "In other words, the elder brother before Yaoyao should have
        disappeared, so she should hate the Human Ancestor."
      </p>
      <p>
        "As a Master, I would help her, so there's nothing wrong with that."
      </p>
      <p>Many thoughts flashed in Gu Changge's mind.</p>
      <p>
        There was still a warm expression on his face, no sign of abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for taking advantage of Yaoyao's guilt, he didn't care about it at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than being used by the Human Ancestor, she would not reject her
        Master helping in avenging her brother's murderer.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, take good care of this jade pendant. It contains a strand of
        the Dao Dharma body of your Master. When you are in danger, crush it and
        your Master will be able to sense it."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge pondered for a while, then continued to speak.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, a crystal clear jade pendant appeared in the palm of
        his hand, and many runes flickered, which was simple and mysterious.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an astonishing aura on it, and a wisp of it seemed capable of
        making the sky crumble.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Master." Yaoyao obediently accepted it.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled slightly.</p>
      <p>He knew that Yaoyao was unlikely to be in danger.</p>
      <p>
        At a critical moment, if the Dao fruit's power exploded, who could hurt
        her?
      </p>
      <p>But Yaoyao herself didn't know that.</p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, the reason why Gu Changge gave her this jade pendant was
        because he was worried that Jiang Yang would hurt her while he was away.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>This moved her heart.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, Gu Changge had another purpose. What this jade pendant
        contained was not the so-called Dao Dharma body, but his Myriad Demonic
        body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Myriad Demonic Body was similar to Divine Sense which was equivalent to
        a strand of his Divine Soul. With this, he could always know Yaoyao's
        movements.
      </p>
      <p>
        He knew that Jiang Yang would definitely look for Yaoyao next, and under
        the guise of taking her to play, he would actually try to gain Yaoyao's
        trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, if this Master intervened, Jiang Yang would inevitably be
        suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Jiang Yang intended to deal with him. But he also understood
        that now was not the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't intend to startle the snake, so he planned to control
        all of Jiang Yang's movements through Yaoyao. Even if Jiang Yang had any
        doubt, it would be impossible to guess Gu Changge's purpose.
      </p>
      <p>"Dao Dharma body…"</p>
      <p>
        Silver haired granny glanced enviously, she could feel the horror and
        extraordinariness of this jade pendant.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this jade pendant to protect herself, it was estimated that even a
        Sacred Realm cultivator would not be able to hurt Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>Her Master was really powerful!</p>
      <p>Was there anything else he couldn't bring out?</p>
      <p>
        But soon, thinking of Jiang Yang's current changes, her face displayed
        sadness, helplessness, entanglement and other emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, even Yaoyao’s Master said that he was not sure, and there was
        a need to discuss this again, so who was Jiang Yang now? Was he really
        possessed?
      </p>
      <p>Just when Yaoyao and Granny Yinhua were suspicious of Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge also heard the system prompt sound.</p>
      <p>Jiang Yang's Luck points decreased by a lot again.</p>
      <p>
        He could see with his own eyes that some illusory Luck between heaven
        and earth was quickly fading away.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to this trend, when Jiang Yang's Luck points in the Heavenly
        Star Realm had declined to a certain extent, he could start to consider
        plundering, which had a relatively high chance of success.
      </p>
      <p>
        "When the Son of Luck's Luck points trigger the clear drop rule, what
        kind of treasure chest will be dropped?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could it be something like the Seal of Reincarnation or the Dao Fruit?"
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Gu Changge was thinking about the final reward.</p>
      <p>He would eat the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor to death.</p>
      <p>
        From Jiang Chuchu's mouth, he had already learned that the Reincarnation
        Seal of the Human Ancestor was the biggest trump card. Jiang Yang had
        recently made an explosive breakthrough and with his body, he would soon
        break through to the True God Realm if he survived.
      </p>
      <p>How far was it from Gu Changge's true strength?</p>
      <p>
        Even if the Human Ancestor reincarnated and had the means to borrow the
        general trend of the world, Gu Changge didn't need to care.
      </p>
      <p>
        At most he would have to pay attention to the Ancestor of the Immortal
        Lun Sect, that was, the means left by Immortal Lun Supreme.
      </p>
      <p>Supreme phantom?</p>
      <p>Or a Supreme weapon?</p>
      <p>
        "If the Eight Desolate Magic Halberd is revived, it should be able to
        compete with the weapons from the Ancestor of Immortal Lun." Gu Changge
        narrowed his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the Supreme phantom? Don't forget that the phantom left by the
        Heavenly Lord of Reincarnation that belonged to the original
        reincarnation was also swallowed by Gu Changge with his treasure bottle.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        In front of Heavenly Lord of Reincarnation, the Supreme Being was too
        far behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only after the Quasi-Supreme Realm completed the Nine Heavens cycle
        could they have the opportunity to break through the Supreme Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when one reached the Supreme Realm, they would have the opportunity
        to become a Taoist Emperor!
      </p>
      <p>
        The so-called Taoist Emperor were the names of beings who have proven
        the Tao in the ancient times, and some of them have even gone a long way
        on the road to enlightenment, and were already close to becoming
        Immortals!
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to being born with a demonic heart, Gu Changge was actually
        accompanied by the treasure bottle.
      </p>
      <p>
        That treasure bottle was not a phantom condensed based from the Immortal
        Devouring Demonic Art, but a real existence that was floating somewhere
        in the deepest part of his spiritual sea.
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't until he started to practice that it slowly emerged.</p>
      <p>No one knew about it except him.</p>
      <p>For more than 20 years, Gu Changge had only used it once.</p>
      <p>
        That treasure bottle was also one of Gu Changge's most powerful cards!
      </p>
      <p>
        And in the next few days, Gu Changge took Yaoyao and others to
        temporarily stay in the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The news of his arrival at the Immortal Lun Sect also spread quickly
        from the Immortal Lun Sect. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, many cultivators had witnessed Gu Changge's entry into the
        Immortal Lun Sect's mountain gate that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, news circulated in all parts of the Heavenly Domain,
        causing a stir and causing many cultivators to start speculating, who
        were very puzzled and shocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many forces and Sacred Mountains sent people to visit, but they were all
        met with closed doors. It was then many people discovered that the
        relationship between the Immortal Lun Sect and Gu Changge did not seem
        to be very harmonious.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was temporarily residing in Immortal Lun Sect.</p>
      <p>
        They could only obey cautiously, not dare to show the slightest
        dissatisfaction. Instead they had to treat him with awe and flattery.
      </p>
      <p>
        This appearance and attitude shocked many forces, and then they secretly
        snickered.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the usually strong and domineering habit of the Immortal Lun Sect,
        there was still such a day.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Yue Mingkong also received the news about the
        Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her methods were very secretive, but she also secretly controlled a lot
        of local powerful forces, and there were several big ancient clans in
        the Heavenly Domain that were now under her control.
      </p>
      <p>
        What happened in the Heavenly Domain was difficult to hide from her
        ears.
      </p>
      <p>Immortal Lun Sect’s matter was no exception.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she looked cold and profound, frowning at the group of
        people kneeling below, and there was a terrifying pressure.
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Yang……"</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong murmured this name to herself, and there was a shocking
        killing aura and cold intent diffused in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>"After hiding for so long, you have finally revealed yourself."</p>
      <p>
        This name was still something she had only just learned from the mouth
        of one of her men.
      </p>
      <p>
        A disciple of the Immortal Lun Sect, bearing the Desolate Holy Body that
        had unlocked the curse, was beginning to rise to fame.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No wonder there wasn't any news before, so it was a waste body like the
        Desolate Holy Body, is that why there hasn't been any news for so many
        years?"
      </p>
      <p>"It's really not a lot of work."</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong's expression looked increasingly cold, and her killing
        intent was astonishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her original intention was to wait for the emergence of that Nirvana
        Green Lotus at the Heavenly pond and pick it in advance. This would make
        the Human Ancestor's intention of returning from all the worlds to one
        in vain. But now, she changed her mind.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 228-2: Yue Mingkongs plan to catch the turtle in the jar, You
        have to pay attention to your Master (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Since the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor body had already appeared,
        what she must do now was definitely to find a way to end him.
      </p>
      <p>No matter what the chances of success were, she had to try first.</p>
      <p>
        <i
          >I just don't know if the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor’s body
          has awakened the memory of his past life or not at this time.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>"If it has not awakened, then it will be much easier."</p>
      <p>
        "But if it awakens, it will be a bit more troublesome, but the Human
        Ancestor’s reincarnation body does not know that I am going to attack
        him."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If he takes me as the rest of the Dao forces that came down to seek
        him……"
      </p>
      <p>
        A cold smile flowed from Yue Mingkong's stunning Immortal face under the
        veil.
      </p>
      <p>Her plan was actually simple.</p>
      <p>
        To kill the reincarnated body of the Human Ancestor, she definitely had
        to set it up in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of Jiang Yang's many tricks, it was far more difficult to deal
        with him than the Ancient Heavenly Lord of Reincarnation's heir Ye Ling
        from last time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her slightest mistake would definitely let him escape, or even seriously
        injure him to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong also did not want to take a big risk, so she had to make a
        detailed plan and arrangement first.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If my memory is correct, the Ancestor of this Immortal Lun Sect is
        actually greatly related to the Human Ancestor, an innate being that he
        had enlightened in one of his lives."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Immortal Lun Sect must have something set up by the Human Ancestor.
        I have to find a way to lure him out, it would be better if he is
        alone……"
      </p>
      <p>Many thoughts flashed through Yue Mingkong's mind.</p>
      <p>Soon she had a plan.</p>
      <p>
        First of all, she had to identify a place where she could set up all the
        formations and manpower in advance, and then attract the reincarnated
        body of the Human Ancestor to come here to catch the turtle in a jar.
      </p>
      <p>
        She did not believe that the Human Ancestor’s reincarnation alone would
        have a way to escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Yue Mingkong's eyes flashed, her jade hand held a pen as she
        began to write, intending to find someone and send this letter to Jiang
        Yang at the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she was worried that the Upper Realm Immortal would ruin
        her plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the news, the sister of the reincarnated body of the Human Ancestor
        in this life was valued by that Superior Immortal, she was accepted as
        his disciple, after which he brought her to the Immortal Lun Sect just
        in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is this all too much of a coincidence? Or is that Superior Immortal, in
        fact, also here to search for the reincarnated body of the Human
        Ancestor?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong frowned, for her, the only advantage now was that she was
        in the dark and the other party was in the light.
      </p>
      <p>That Superior Immortal was completely unaware of her existence.</p>
      <p>
        If that Upper Realm Immortal got in the way of her plans, she didn't
        mind doing something about him in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time when she came down to the Lower Realm, she had prepared a lot
        and brought a lot of things with her, among which there were even many
        terrifying forbidden weapons and even a Quasi-Supreme weapon.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, three thousand miles outside the Immortal Lun Sect, in
        an ancient city, the lively and noisy street, many cultivators and
        creatures were walking to and fro.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two sides were lined with pavilions and stores, palaces and divine
        courts, surging with divine fog, which was extremely grand and
        atmospheric.

        "This is your first time to come to the Immortal Lun Sect. As a brother,
        I have to take you for a good stroll today."
      </p>
      <p>
        With an apologetic smile on his face, Jiang Yang was leading Yaoyao and
        Granny Yinhua, to stroll around the place, while talking casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind them followed the Immortal Lun Sect's Elder Zhao Yi, who looked
        like a servant girl from the looks of it, but was actually Jiang Yang's
        protector.
      </p>
      <p>
        What happened in the hall that day had damaged Jiang Yang's face and his
        image in the mind of Zhao Yi fell a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon under Jiang Yang's guidance and means, Zhao Yi's cultivation
        realm, which had been stagnant for years, showed signs of a
        breakthrough, causing her to be extremely shocked. This had changed her
        view and attitude towards Jiang Yang once again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi also felt that everything that happened in the Great Hall that
        day was an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's methods were becoming more mysterious and unpredictable,
        making her even more impervious.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Jiang Yang was smiling and speaking to Yaoyao and Granny
        Yinhua, intending to gain Yaoyao's trust once again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially on the way, he also mentioned his childhood several times.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all kinds of looks and tone of voice, he also gradually became the
        same as the brother that Yaoyao used to be familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that night, Gu Changge had informed the two of them something that
        was like a thorn in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it was Yaoyao or Granny Yinhua, they were not very willing to be
        close to Jiang Yang's attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not quite cold to say. But there was always a sense of disconnect
        and distance between them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Jiang Yang frown incomprehensibly, but his expression still
        did not show any abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was still very enthusiastic while talking to both, as if he was
        trying to make up for his previous attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, Gu Changge did not come out with the two of them. Although he
        was her Master, if he had been on the side, it would make him seem like
        an eyesore and out of place.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang did not feel there was anything wrong.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he sensed a jade pendant on Yaoyao's body.</p>
      <p>There was some aura of Gu Changge on it.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang felt that it might be something given by Gu Changge in order
        to determine Yaoyao's location.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't care, because it was impossible for him to do anything to
        Yaoyao, Gu Changge was completely overthinking it.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother, I'm a little tired and want to go back."</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Yaoyao's face also showed a trace of tiredness as she
        glanced at Jiang Yang and said softly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Jiang Yang took her and her grandma away from the Immortal Lun
        Sect to the nearby ancient city for a walk. He said that he hadn't seen
        them for a long time and wanted to chat with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the jade pendant given by the Master, Yaoyao was not worried and
        agreed.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, she still remembered what Gu Changge said.</p>
      <p>
        She intended to see what was wrong with Jiang Yang, whether it was
        really a big change in his temperament or was he taken over by someone
        else.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Yaoyao quietly observed all the way, but found that Jiang Yang's
        expression, tone, or the way he looked at her was the same as before.
      </p>
      <p>Or the brother that she knew.</p>
      <p>
        He remembered her favorite food, and also remembered that when the two
        of them were at the entrance of the village, they met a fierce beast.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the fierce beast was trembling with fear for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it was before, then she might have felt that this was her brother and
        there would be no problem. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        But the words Gu Changge said last night were still echoing in her ears,
        making Yaoyao and Granny Yinhua feel chills on their backs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It could be said that Jiang Yang's current appearance was very different
        from the appearance in the hall that day.
      </p>
      <p>And that was just one night.</p>
      <p>
        Regarding the events of that day, Jiang Yang's explanation was that he
        was too impulsive, and he was so jealous that he lost control.
      </p>
      <p>Yaoyao and Granny Yinhua were silent and did not comment on this.</p>
      <p>"Since Yaoyao is tired, then let's go back."</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Jiang Yang was slightly taken aback when he heard these
        words, and then said with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't intend to regain Yaoyao’s trust so easily.</p>
      <p>
        So he wasn't in a hurry, and just thought that she was really tired.
      </p>
      <p>
        After fusing with the previous consciousness, Jiang Yang himself still
        loved Yaoyao, a well-behaved younger sister, not to mention that her own
        background was not simple, even if she was by his side in the future,
        she could still help him.
      </p>
      <p>This made Jiang Yang quite satisfied.</p>
      <p>
        As for Gu Changge, after thinking about it, he felt that he had arrived
        to the Lower Realm, but he just passed by this place by chance as he
        found out that Yaoyao had an extraordinary origin, so he accepted her as
        a disciple, intending to bring her back to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        After thinking about all this, Jiang Yang would definitely not let Gu
        Changge succeed. He wanted to take Yaoyao away from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his eyes, Gu Changge was a thing with eyes but not that great, and
        sooner or later he would have to pay the price for humiliating him in
        the hall that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother, is there anything you haven't told Yaoyao, do you have any
        hardships?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao nodded. Then, her big eyes suddenly stared at Jiang Yang, full of
        doubts and confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, she still wanted to know about it personally from Jiang Yang's
        mouth.
      </p>
      <p>"Didn't you say you believed me then?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang smiled and did not seem to be surprised that Yaoyao would ask
        this question again.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, he continued to speak and said the words he had already
        thought up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many things were not different from what Gu Changge had told Yaoyao, but
        the difference was that at the end, Jiang Yang did not say anything
        about the ominous aura.
      </p>
      <p>He just used a sentence to cover up this incident.</p>
      <p>
        And it was precisely this sentence that made Granny Yinhua's complexion
        change slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that you are very lucky, you are the only one who survived."
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was silent, seeing that Jiang Yang didn't inform the details, but
        just covered up the past with an accident, and also understood that
        there must be a problem in this matter.
      </p>
      <p>"By the way, Yaoyao, you have to pay attention to your Master."</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang noticed Yaoyao's expression and his eyes moved slightly,
        knowing that she might have heard what Gu Changge said, but he didn't
        care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of his reincarnation method, even if any Supreme being made a
        move, they would not be able to find abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't believe that Gu Changge could see through.</p>
      <p>At this point, it was just speculation.</p>
      <p>"Huh?"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was stunned when she heard the words, but she didn't expect Jiang
        Yang to suddenly say this, asking her to pay attention to her teacher.
      </p>
      <p>"What's wrong?"</p>
      <p>
        She was puzzled and didn't understand what Jiang Yang meant. Could it be
        that he wanted her to alienate from the Master?
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she subconsciously excluded Jiang Yang, treating him as a
        stranger.

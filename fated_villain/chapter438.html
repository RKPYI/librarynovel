          accidentally leaked it, causing nearby objects to explode and almost
          destroying the whole space. After all, he was in the Sacred King
          Realm. Even if he was poisoned, ordinary cultivators wouldn&#8217;t be
          able to get close to him.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He continuously vomited black blood along with bits of his fractured
          organs, but the excruciating pain wouldn&#8217;t cease, as if every
          organ inside of his body was about to liquify. It was undoubtedly a
          horrifying, revolting sight.</span

          ground. Enduring the agonising pain, he withdrew numerous pills from
          his storage ring and shoved them into his mouth before sitting down
          with his legs crossed to attempt to extract the poison from his body
          as he realised that he was poisoned.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He understood that he was poisoned because of his negligent
          assumption that Tang Wan wouldn&#8217;t harm him. For a moment there,
          the sense of caution he had cultivated back in the Nine Realm was
          non-existent. It was why he didn&#8217;t notice that the dishes were
          poisoned by Tang Wan beforehand.</span

          deliberately prepared a huge meal and invited him over in the middle
          of the night.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          life, all the things I have done for her all this time, does she not
          see any value in them?] Qin Wuya couldn&#8217;t fathom why Tang Wan
          would harm him, given that there wasn&#8217;t any grudge between the
          two of them.</span

          choice.&#8221; Tang Wan&#8217;s expression was much calmer than Qin
          Wuya expected, and the way she conveyed her message was awfully
          apathetic. Such an attitude of hers aggravated Qin Wuya&#8217;s pain
          as he grew more dejected.</span

          body. Every trace of them was incomparably dazzling as he tried to
          vaporise the poison. It was a Secret Technique from the Nine Realms.
          Alas, the poison was so aggressive that it already seeped into his
          soul.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since there was no way Tang Wan was capable of acquiring such poison,
          someone must be manipulating or threatening her in the dark, forcing
          her to pull off such an atrocious act.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, Tang Wan silently looked at him as she wordlessly stood
          still. She never imagined Qin Wuya to possess such terrifying
          strength. Certainly, the Immortal-Burying Water was terrorising, but
          Qin Wuya, being able to withstand it for so long and even managed to
          recover some of his vigour, showed just how strong he was.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Not only did he resort to some mysterious Secret Technique, but he
          also exhibited his mastery over numerous rare herbs and pills,
          temporarily alleviating the poison.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Frankly, Qin Wuya, I have known about my identity for quite
          some time now. I am thankful for all you&#8217;ve done these past
          days, but ultimately, there will be no future between us. I am not
          your Dao Partner, and we shouldn&#8217;t have had any encounters in
          this life.&#8221; Right when Qin Wuya was enduring the torturing pain,
          Tang Wan calmly stated a harsh truth that left his mind ringing and
          blanking out.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What…&#8221; Qin Wuya widened his eyes in incredulity after
          hearing such words coming from Tang Wan, especially with how she even
          called him by his real name. As such, he could only accept such a
          shocking truth.</span

          >&#8220;All this time, you&#8217;ve known that you were my Dao Partner
          in our previous life…&#8221; Qin Wuya&#8217;s voice was shaking. [Does
          that mean, she was merely playing along with me for the past few days,
          while I was too ignorant to see it?]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, Qin Wuya&#8217;s face was twisted into a rageful grimace, as
          though he was a ferocious beast. Never did he expect that he would be
          slapped with such a harsh truth that left him extremely agonised,
          hopeless, and enraged.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Tang Wan tranquilly nodded. As she stared at Qin Wuya&#8217;s current
          look, the remorse that just began to arise in her heart accordingly
          waned.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In Qin Wuya&#8217;s eyes, she was merely his Dao Partner from their
          previous lives, which was the sole reason as to why he was so
          protective of her. And Tang Wan was aware of that.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Who&#8217;s the mastermind behind all this? I&#8217;ve been
          deceived from the beginning. You&#8217;ve always seen through every
          action of mine, hence tonight&#8217;s incident…&#8221; At this point,
          Qin Wuya finally thought things through as his gaze grew cold. Tang
          Wan was aware of his identity, yet she still treated him so poorly. He
          was naturally infuriated, and the fiery rage in his heart was
          inextinguishable.</span

          Reincarnation. So, how does she know about this? Had she perhaps
          reawakened her memory from her past life?]</span

          punishment for having offended someone you shouldn&#8217;t
          have,&#8221; Tang Wan blandly noted. Once Qin Wuya had been dealt
          with, the Tang Family&#8217;s troubles would definitely be resolved.
          To her, that would mean all that she went through would be worth
          it.</span

          mouthful of black blood.</span

          >&#8220;Let me rectify. It wasn&#8217;t her.&#8221; Right at this
          moment, a faint snicker from outside the courtyard was heard. A
          slender figure appeared from the void, and it belonged to Gu Changge
          who was walking over with a fascinated expression.</span
        >
      </p>

          >&#8220;You sure did not disappoint me.&#8221; Gu Changge casually
          smiled as he steadily walked towards the shocked, dismayed Qin
          Wuya.</span

          >&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare to defy your will, Young Master
          Changge.&#8221; Hearing that, Tang Wan lowered her head out of
          reverence for Gu Changge. Simultaneously, it was also an implicit
          explanation for Qin Wuya regarding who was the true mastermind behind
          his fall.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Clenching his teeth, Qin Wuya was overwhelmed by his vexation as he
          was unable to retain his usual composure. After all, he expected
          neither Gu Changge&#8217;s appearance nor the fact that Tang Wan was
          under Gu Changge&#8217;s control.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Back then, the scenery wherein his Junior, Sky King Zhi Yang, was
          ruthlessly murdered remained deeply engraved in his mind as he was
          unable to forget it; now that Gu Changge, his greatest enemy, came out
          of nowhere, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel the thumping urge to fight
          him to death.</span

          didn&#8217;t cherish it, so don&#8217;t blame me now.&#8221; Carrying
          a bright smile, Gu Changge stopped before Qin Wuya and glared at him
          with an interested gaze, as if he was looking at a bug struggling for
          its life.</span

          disgrace your position as the best within the young generation of the
          Upper Realm!&#8221; Qin Wuya felt a chill up his spine and loudly
          rebuked as resentment and anger surged in his eyes.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Being under Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze, he felt as though his entire
          body was about to blow up. Especially in his poisoned state, he was
          unable to use his full power.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Besides, Gu Changge&#8217;s strength was obviously much more
          terrifying than it was before. It was as vast as the abyss, which left
          Qin Wuya shivering.</span

          bug that is about to be drowned by the sea very soon.&#8221;
          Unaffected by Qin Wuya&#8217;s insult, Gu Changge retained his breezy
          smile. &#8220;Though, I am more curious about how you managed to
          survive in the Nine Realms for so many years given your capabilities.
          Did you perhaps live at the sides of the regions? Or have I
          overestimated you?&#8221;</span

          hundreds of years of survival experience in Nine Realms were his
          biggest secret, which was known only by him and no other. Yet, Gu

          only teleport an individual across the same timeline. Although it
          allowed one to travel great or even infinite distances, the time they

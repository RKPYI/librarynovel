        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The army from Neraka was so vast that they seemed to be endless. There were various cultivators from different factions and clans on the ancient battleship charging over, and their loud war cries left the stars trembling. Behind them were those in the Sacred Emperor Realm and Quasi-Nirvana Realm, who could no longer stay out of this battle. They had no choice but to fight in a chaotic battle that involved countless territories. </span><span id="more-36157"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering that this was a fight that even those in the Sacred Realm would struggle to get out alive from, ordinary cultivators could do nothing but collapse like straw in the wind. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between heaven and earth, the Sacred Emperor Realm experts fighting each had a Sacred Emperor Grade Artifact dripping with tens of thousands of brilliant lights on their heads. The power they displayed was enough to destroy the universe. Naturally, to ordinary cultivators, the existence of someone in the Sacred King Realm was already akin to a deity, who could destroy their land and break the stars beyond with only the raise of their hand. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fluctuations of power coming from a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert was even more horrifying. Dharma Bodies, mighty and tall, stood in the midst of the clouds kilometers away. Surrounding them were portals made of light that released powerful fluctuations in space, as they connected to universes everywhere. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, swarms of armies that looked like black pythons gushed out from the light portals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a battle hardly ever happened. Almost every Force in the Upper Realm was involved in it. Even the fight that broke out between the Immortal Gu Family and Purple Mansion hadn&#8217;t reached such a terrifying magnitude. This fight, on the other hand, nearly turned the entire Upper Realm upside down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a spider&#8217;s web, Neraka had left traces across the many parts of the Upper Realm. The Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was just its centre. However, the scope of territory that was involved was extensive. Even Gu Changge could not guarantee that Neraka could be completely eradicated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will not be at peace as long as the Neraka is around. We must destroy Neraka today. Return my grandson to me!&#8221; An Elder, who was glowing all over, shouted in the middle of battle as his Life Force was stimulated to its maximum. He had an immense hatred for the assassin guild after the grandchild he adored the most lost his life to Neraka. Up until today, the old man was still left in the dark about the identity of the person who had paid the large sum of money to hire the assassins to kill his grandchild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from him, there were plenty of others who had deep-rooted hatred for Neraka. In addition to the Immortal and Formidable Forces, the children of a handful of wandering cultivators had also met their end because of Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It is about time.  Even though Neraka has always been fairly powerful, it is doomed this time.] Gu Changge only watched the tragedy happen with barely a change in his expression. As he took a step, his figure disappeared and tore through space, towards where Neraka&#8217;s headquarters was hiding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giant Wave Ancient World was a Lower Realm World around the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. In terms of ranking, this world was not even in the top 100. Yet, this ancient world was where Neraka&#8217;s biggest secret was held.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> *Bang!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A space altar, which seemed to have been summoned from ancient times, was present. It tore through space and the chaos within it to reach different universes. Currently, a space portal was opened with a massive army descended from it, to wipe out Giant Wave Ancient World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a shocking sight where war cries shook the skies as if all the ancient worlds were being slaughtered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the gate of the hidden world was discovered, it was blown apart by a few mysterious True Daoists. The Palaces of Neraka, who could not hide any longer, had no choice but to be exposed. Rushing out from the destroyed gates were countless assassins from Neraka. They usually hid in the dark, but from the moment the battle broke out, they had to fight the experts from all the different Forces, since they had nowhere to hide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Neraka&#8217;s Fortuity has deteriorated, which means that Neraka will be destroyed today. Are you still keeping your hopes up?&#8221; a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert above the sky asked. He had a big golden bell on top of his head. As the ripple-like waves spread from it, all experts from Neraka coughed up blood and exploded, both bodies and spirits destroyed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opposite him was a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert from Neraka hiding in the darkness, the only item visible was a bloody divine sword seemingly capable of slicing a world open. One slash from it filled the place with endless blood and Chaos Qi.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even though Neraka will meet its demise one day, all of you will have to pay a costly price for it. On top of that, the spirit of Neraka will never be put out. The legacy of Neraka will live on where there is darkness.&#8221; The Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert from Neraka snorted, completely indifferent towards life and death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see you still refuse to come to your senses… Do you think that your obsessions will allow you to live now that you are dealing with almost all the Forces of the Upper Realm?&#8221; The other man wore a solemn demeanour even when he was dealing with someone who was also in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them continued to duel it out again, releasing piercing light that suppressed all living beings in their surroundings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the battles that broke out between the Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts, the other battles were just as brutal. Apart from True Daoists, most of the cultivators were all in different cultivation levels and were going for each other&#8217;s necks. The whole sky was dyed red, which caused hearts to palpitate as the smell of blood drifted in the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge soon appeared and observed the scene before him as he gently shook his head. [All living beings have been greatly afflicted… Too bad this does nothing to me.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If only his cultivation level was not about to reach the Late Stage Nirvana Realm, he could have used the Grand Flask to condense the tattered Sources of this place for his own use. However, at his current level, it was useless of him to do so. In fact, not even the Source of an average True Daoist would be useful to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s figure seemed to fade out as he made his way through the battlefield, as those engaged in battle around him seemed not to have noticed his presence. Even if Gu Changge were to stop in his tracks for a moment around them, not even a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert could detect the slightest trace of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s this place right here…] Gu Changge paused for a second, but he did not linger for long. Instead, he reached out to draw a stroke in the air while pointing at the world below him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!*  As if intending to split apart the chaos, an infinite and vast amount of divine power exploded at this moment. Together with the universe, the world in front of him was suddenly divided into two. It was such an appalling sight that even those fighting Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts were so frightened they trembled all over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another area of vast expanse, there were black mists surrounding a palace. There were fierce figures that stood like erect mountains among evil spirits. They felt chills all over their bodies at this very moment. They couldn&#8217;t help but look up in the direction where they thought they felt a pair of eyes watching them from above.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He still discovered us.&#8221; The tall and strong figure standing in the middle of the palace calmly spoke before he rose to his full height. In his hand was a black Heavenly Dagger with a bubbling energy that seemed to be capable of slicing through time itself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fourth Palace Lord…&#8221; All present collapsed to their knees in unison as killing intent and determination filled their eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a total of ten Palaces in Neraka, but the one that was recognised by the majority as the strongest was the Fourth Palace. Yan Luo was the Fourth Palace Lord, and nobody knew how long he had lived or how high his cultivation was. They were only aware that he was alive way before Neraka was known as Neraka. Even the Ruler of Neraka was rather courteous when he saw the Fourth Palace Lord.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I would like to meet this man who is deemed the most incredible person throughout the course of time.] The strong Fourth Palace Lord took his Heavenly Dagger with him outside the palace. He looked far into the distance as his thirst for battle grew evident on his heroic face. He knew that Gu Changge was searching for this place. There would not have been such terrifyingly energy that even made him feel danger otherwise. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Yan Luo&#8217;s cultivation was that of a Remnant Immortal. Although he had no way of progressing over the years, he was still strong enough to surpass the strongest experts from the Forces of the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will join hands with you to fight our enemies and destroy everything, Fourth Palace Lord.&#8221; The moment the Fourth Palace Lord, Yan Luo, rose, a loud sound resembling a tsunami could be heard as many higher-ups of Neraka clamoured in an unconcerned yet murderous manner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright!&#8221; The Fourth Palace Lord roared as he held the Heavenly Dagger towards the sky. He already sensed that Gu Changge was causing havoc in this world and was about to descend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a sword-like beam so bright it looked like the first twilight before this world was formed. It was faster than the Fourth Palace Lord. Sword Qi spread across the area and caused the sky to tremble. Unable to withstand the power of the sword-like beam, the world began to crumble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the upper echelons of Neraka were trembling. They felt as if they had become ants whose lives and deaths were now out of their control. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s really a Remnant Immortal… You didn&#8217;t disappoint me after all.&#8221; Following the sword-like beam was Gu Changge. He tore through the barriers of this world and had arrived. He was now staring at the Fourth Palace Lord, Yan Luo, as though he had his interest piqued. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yan Luo&#8217;s gaze, on the other hand, was solemn. He felt a feeling of impending doom. It was as though he was prey that a predator had its eyes on. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, there was a place that was extremely distant from the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds where many terrifying figures stood. They looked at the distant battlefield with deep gazes. It was as if the universe was undergoing an evolution as the moon and stars fell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is to annihilate Neraka. Since Gu Changge is secretly behind this, he must have another purpose. We have to be careful. Nephrite Breeze Pavilion has been on the rise, and they have become unstoppable over the last couple of years. I suspect that this is the reason Gu Changge attacked Neraka. He is related to Nephrite Breeze Pavilion.&#8221; The people speaking softly about the matters surrounding Neraka were True Daoists, Ancestor level figures from the various Forces. Although they were not on the battlefield, they were well aware of anything that happened on it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is no need to doubt. The person who controls Nephrite Breeze Pavilion </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge. He appears to be exterminating Neraka, but he&#8217;s merely eliminating dissidents. It is such a pity that we are only finding this out now.&#8221; Another Ancient Being shook his head as he spoke with regret.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another scary-looking figure with an appearance different from the human race coldly mentioned in a voice dripping with killing intent, &#8220;Gu Changge has outgrown himself in just a few years. I think he&#8217;ll lay his hands on us soon enough.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not an unwarranted speculation; he came to this deduction from the clues they found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge might have been gentle and elegant in the eyes of many, but the various Forces knew what he had done behind their backs. The fact that there was a crusade to destroy Neraka in a flash was enough to leave everyone uneasy. What if Gu Changge had attacked their Forces instead of Neraka this time? No one could guarantee that they wouldn&#8217;t end up like Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal and Formidable Forces had had many enemies since the day they came into existence. Furthermore, the Upper Realm was a dog-eat-dog world. Everyone would seize the opportunity to attack when their enemies lost power. There was no place for soft-heartedness here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Gu Changge had both authority and power. He was a man revered by all. Yet, the flip side was also true. He was feared by all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge is not a saint. Now that the Immortal Path is about to be revealed, the Upper Realm will experience changes that could either be good or bad. His powers have grown enough for him to threaten all of us. If we don&#8217;t resolve this, I&#8217;m afraid that there will be consequences that will lead to an imbalance.&#8221; A figure who was covered in golden-coloured flames urged. His eyes were like two suns; they were as bright as they were intimidating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, a female True Daoist added, &#8220;The Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s powers are unknown, and they have inextricable ties with the Immortal Domain… We can&#8217;t be rash. We will suffer heavy losses if we don&#8217;t plan this out well enough. The Immortal Gu Family only showed part of what they are capable of when they annihilated Purple Mansion.&#8221; Her voice was soft and gentle, and yet, everyone was in awe upon hearing her words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there were many True Daoists, there were still differences between all of them. The female True Daoist standing in front of them was such a powerful person, who used to kill so much that everyone was afraid of her back then. She hadn&#8217;t appeared in the past tens of millions of years, but her strength now was unfathomable. It would only be a matter of time before she achieved the Immortal Realm.</span></p>

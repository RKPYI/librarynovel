          Though it was still just a cub, its ability had already surpassed
          other beasts. Hence, even if it was raised in the wild, it could still
          live a pretty decent life. Furthermore, the Gu Family&#8217;s
          Territory stretched to the horizon, and there were also endless rich
          star territories within. Unless there were people audacious enough to
          not worry about retaliation from the Immortal Gu Family, who would

          Changge was saying, as grievance had laced its big crystal-clear eyes.

          lying in its spot, motionlessly.</span

          agreed on back in the Palace of World Domination. The man claimed it

          of food, but now, he wasn&#8217;t even willing to raise it!</span

          for its opinion, for it instantly backed up towards the platform like
          it had been startled, looking absolutely defenceless, vulnerable, and
          pitiful as fear enveloped its big eyes.</span

          living a good life with me when I can even let you devour an entire
          star territory? Don&#8217;t tell me you want to go back to that
          useless piece of garbage?&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To that, the beast cub looked hesitantly at him for a while before
          finally nodding with affirmation. Despite knowing full well Gu Changge
          was dangerous, its instinct told it that it wouldn&#8217;t suffer if
          it followed the man.</span

          me?&#8221; Gu Changge countered with great interest.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          A crisp voice sounded out just then, and a newcomer showed themselves
          in. Though her face was obscured, she had a tall and slender figure,
          and her fluttering hair gave her an otherworldly vibe. She was none
          other than Gu Qingyi.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many Elders were surprised by her appearance, clearly never expecting
          Gu Qingyi to show up, and their attitude towards her was obviously
          different towards Gu Changge, who, despite being the young master, was
          still just their Junior. However, Gu Qingyi had a much higher
          seniority than them. Moreover, her powers were also fathomless. Word
          was that she would become a True Daoist before Gu Lintian, the current
          Head of the Gu Family.</span

          this point. In fact, they weren&#8217;t even sure if this was her true
          form.</span

          Celestial Jade Platform with mixed emotions. However, it lasted for
          only a split second before returning to impassiveness.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          ask why either.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          acknowledgement.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The woman also pulled a rare smile. Though it only happened for a
          split second, Gu Changge still caught it perfectly, and he quirked a
          brow in response. He knew the woman well enough to know that she would
          rarely reveal such an expression.</span

          Little Wang Yue was upset and opposed to it, Gu Changge had no
          intentions of renaming it. It wasn&#8217;t like Gu Changge was trying
          to be mean. Rather, he purely did it because he thought it was too

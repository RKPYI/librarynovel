      <h4>
        Chapter 247: The old guys in Village, Xianer brought someone back from
        her parents home
      </h4>
      <p>And in the blink of an eye, several days passed.</p>
      <p>Upper Realm, outer domain.</p>
      <p>Deep in the abandoned land.</p>
      <p>
        With the chaotic mist shrouding all directions, the mountains were
        majestic, and the wind was invisible.
      </p>
      <p>Accompanied by ancient trees that looked endless.</p>
      <p>
        All kinds of fierce beasts with shocking auras were wandering, like an
        abandoned place that existed even before the world was created.
      </p>
      <p>Usually, no cultivator would dare to pass through this area.</p>
      <p>
        Even in the outer rim of the Land of Immortal Abandonment, one would be
        torn apart by various powerful beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, this place was filled with all kinds of miasma. If cultivators
        inhaled it, their origin would get contaminated, and it would be
        difficult. Over time, the Land of Immortals became an abandoned place.
      </p>
      <p>There were also very few cultivators who came here to cultivate.</p>
      <p>
        In the depths, there was a small village, it was not very big, and
        looked very peaceful.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were very few villagers in the village, only about a hundred
        people, men, women, and children of all ages, with simple faces.
      </p>
      <p>
        But everyone had an amazing aura, even stronger than some cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the entrance of the village, there was a tall and gorgeous Peach
        Tree, each blossom was shining brightly, as crystal clear as jade,
        hanging down various chains of laws, accompanied by chaotic mist, which
        was very mysterious.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Xian'er, has been gone for so long, and I don't know how things are
        now? At that time, the old lame said to go out to solve some problems,
        but he hasn't come back now…"
      </p>
      <p>
        "The old lame’s sword is unparalleled. Is there anything he can't solve
        with one shot? It's really not good. If it's a big deal, I'll do it
        again."
      </p>
      <p>
        At the entrance of the village, several old guys were gathered together,
        either smoking dry cigarettes or sipping tea, looking very leisurely.
      </p>
      <p>But their appearance was very strange.</p>
      <p>
        They were either blind or had broken arms, or had no ears, or were mute.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, it was a blind man who spoke, and he sighed with his
        arms on his back.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was very worried about Gu Xian'er who had been away from the Village
        for a long time, knowing that she had a deep hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        They still didn't know what happened outside the Village. They had been
        living in seclusion for a long time, and they could hardly escape from
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they weren't worried about Gu Xian'er, they wouldn't have wondered
        what happened in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Xian'er shoulders the inheritance of the few of us. When she walks
        outside, who can harm her, not to mention there is also the protection
        from the Senior Taoyao, so let's not worry about it."
      </p>
      <p>
        The one who spoke was an old man with a broken arm. He smiled and was
        very confident about their common heir.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm not worried about this. I'm afraid that Xian'er's worries before
        she left last time will become a prophecy, and she will bring back some
        sweetheart."
      </p>
      <p>
        This time it was the Chief of the Village. He looked like a normal
        person, neither deaf nor dumb, nor lacking arms or legs.
      </p>
      <p>But those who knew it all knew that he actually lacked a soul.</p>
      <p>Now it was just a body.</p>
      <p>
        His words also made a few old guys look bad, because the Village Chief's
        words almost always had the effect of a prophecy, saying that he was a
        crow's mouth, but they could expect a lot of good things.
      </p>

            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        But the matter involving Gu Xian'er made them all feel that the cabbage
        they had been growing for a long time was choked by pigs.
      </p>
      <p>"Someone is coming!"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, the expressions of several old guys suddenly changed, and
        they felt the branches and leaves on the Peach Tree, shaking and making
        noises.
      </p>
      <p>
        They all looked at the mountains in the distance, where there seemed to
        be a divine light that crossed the sky and came here.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>"Master, Second Master, Third Master, Fourth Master…"</p>
      <p>
        At the entrance of the Village, a group of three people was standing
        here. It was Gu Changge, Yaoyao, and Gu Xianer who had come all the way
        to the Land of Immortal Abandonment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er took the initiative to mention that she wanted to come here,
        and Gu Changge didn't refuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Abandoned Land was full of dangers, it was not a problem
        for the three of them to pass through here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that the big red bird beside Gu Xian'er knew the path and
        was extremely familiar with the path, and there were no twists and turns
        in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Xian'er's brows and eyes were curved and she seemed
        very happy as she was greeting several masters at the entrance of the
        village one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        A group of villagers from the Village also appeared, surrounded by men,
        women, and children, it was very lively.
      </p>
      <p>They were very happy about Gu Xian'er's return.</p>
      <p>
        Several aunts even pulled Gu Xian'er to ask questions, and even asked
        what the relationship between her and Gu Changge beside her was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, on the other hand, was standing quietly at the entrance of
        the village.
      </p>
      <p>
        A strange color flashed in his eyes as he looked at the Peach Tree at
        the entrance of the Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        From his point of view, the Peach Tree on the screen that was prompted
        by the system didn't actually look much different.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that there was less power to destroy the world, more natural
        tranquility, and something more.
      </p>
      <p>As he looked at the Peach Tree, the Peach Tree also looked at him.</p>
      <p>To be honest, it was looking at Yaoyao beside him.</p>
      <p>
        The branches and leaves were colorful, the brilliance was hanging down,
        and there was a mysterious atmosphere circulating.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge felt that its state was not quite right. Although he
        could feel the connection between Yaoyao and it, he couldn't remember
        too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps in that chaotic true thunder tribulation that destroyed the sky
        and the earth, it really suffered a catastrophe and forgot a lot of
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Yaoyao herself seemed to have noticed that strange connection.
      </p>
      <p>"Master…"</p>
      <p>
        She was still a little worried and afraid of this situation and hid
        behind Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"With Master here, it's alright."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge comforted and said that he believed in his own judgment that
        this mysterious Peach Tree would not do anything to Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Yaoyao encountered it, she might be able to improve her situation,
        after all, the little girl had always been troubled by the fact that her
        body didn't grow up.
      </p>
      <p>"Xian'er, who is this young mister?"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, after reminiscing with her several masters, Gu Xian'er was
        about to introduce Gu Changge to them, but the Village Chief was the
        first to speak.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        With a scrutiny in his eyes, he stared at Gu Changge up and down like a
        wolf guard.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You forgot what Master said to you. When you walk outside, be careful.
        Those good-looking men like to lie to simple girls like you the most."
      </p>
      <p>
        Another old woman with a hunched waist also spoke up, looking like she
        hated her. Why did she go out for so long before she returned to the
        village with a strange man?
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn't directly investigate the origin of Gu Changge. After all, it
        was Gu Xian'er who brought him. It would be too rude for them to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of Gu Xian'er's masters also had different expressions. They
        looked at Gu Changge up and down, and they looked like they were
        guarding against thieves, for fear that he would abduct Gu Xian'er away.
      </p>
      <p>
        And just now the Village Chief was saying that he was worried that Gu
        Xian'er would bring a sweetheart back, but in the next moment, someone
        came from outside the village.
      </p>
      <p>Couldn’t this crow's mouth say something good?</p>
      <p>
        It was not that they didn't want to see Gu Xian'er bringing people back,
        but they must be able to take a look at it so that they won't be
        deceived.
      </p>
      <p>"Xian'er, did you bring someone back from your parent's house?"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, an old lady also said with a smile, feeling that the man
        in white clothes in front of him was as handsome as a jade, like an
        immortal, with the feeling of a young god, and he was a perfect match
        for Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, Gu Xian'er was about to introduce him.</p>
      <p>
        Her face was a little red, and she quickly waved her hand to deny,
        "Master, what are you guessing, things are not what you think…"
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't know why the masters and aunts would guess in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could it be that she really looked like a good match for Gu Changge?
      </p>
      <p>However, they… were just cousins!</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge, who had a dull expression, finally said, "My
        surname is Gu, seniors, don't think about it too much."
      </p>
      <p>"Surnamed Gu?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the village chief and the others were stunned for a
        moment, but their expressions softened slightly. Since his surname was
        Gu, it meant that they were from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family behind
        Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>They might be overthinking.</p>
      <p>"Yes, Gu Changge, I have met all the seniors."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded and said plainly again, his expression did not change
        much.
      </p>
      <p>"What!?"</p>
      <p>"Gu Changge?"</p>
      <p>
        "You're the… Gu Changge who dug out the Dao bone of Xian'er when he was
        a child?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, everyone at the entrance of the Village was stunned for a
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then their expression changed, thinking that they had heard it wrong.
      </p>
      <p>They were shocked beyond belief.</p>
      <p>
        How dare he come here? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially the Village Chief and others, their complexion changed for a
        while, and it was extremely gloomy.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The terrifying pressure emerged here and a terrifying vision appeared in
        the high altitude of the Land Abandoned by Immortals, the stars
        collapsed, turned into dust and powder, shocking millions of miles
        around!
      </p>
      <p>This was still the case with their intentional repression.</p>
      <p>
        Such powerhouses had reached an unfathomable level of cultivation and
        could destroy everything with every move.

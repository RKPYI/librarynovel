        Chapter 180: Uselessly Declining the Emotions Sent in Goodwill;
        Beginning My Plans for Gu Xianer Once More!
      </h4>
      <p><b>Demonic Translations </b></p>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p>
        After all, Gu Xian'er was a Favoured Daughter of Heaven, backed by – not
        one – but two overpowered protagonist tropes. Whether it was the Peach
        Tree in the Peach Village or her other masters, they were nothing to
        scoff at.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the beginning, Gu Changge never intended to kill Gu Xian’er but to
        control her. To achieve this, he would have to arrange quite a few
        things
      </p>
      <p>
        And, thanks to a bit of “good guidance”, this naive girl had now fallen
        into his clutches… it won’t be long before he would be rewarded for his
        hard work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, Gu Changge was quite sure that the current Gu Xian’er does not
        have any intention to kill him.
      </p>
      <p>
        At best, she would vent her anger by retaliating at every opportunity
        she gets to recover the losses she suffered at his hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was not interested in petty revenge stories, so he suppressed
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        And besides, going by the ancestor’s attitude towards Gu Xian'er, Gu
        Changge knew that he could use the ancestor’s guilt for what happened to
        Gu Xian’er to make him cooperate.
      </p>
      <p>In truth, Gu Changge had a very simple plan.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Nashan, as the ancestor of Gu Xian’er’s line, would definitely not
        want to see his branch family decline.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Gu Changge’s current actions were in the interests of the whole
        family, so he shouldn’t encounter any issues on that front. In fact,
        he’s sure to win the praise of several elders.
      </p>
      <p>And the reason?</p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Continent was a large, delicious pie. And thanks to
        Gu Changge’s actions, the Gu Family attained the largest piece of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When compared with the rest of the younger generation, Gu Changge’s
        schemes alone were quite impressive. So they will come to understand
        that, in his hands, the Gu Family would not only go downhill as they
        originally thought. On the contrary, it will flourish and reach even
        greater heights.
      </p>
      <p>
        And with the current situation, the first thing that Gu Nashan would
        need to do, to teach Gu Changge a lesson, was to find a secluded area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, Gu Xian’er possesses a very awkward identity. She was the
        young princess of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. However, no one dared
        to acknowledge her for the fear of offending Gu Changge and the main
        family branch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s status covered the Gu Family like the sky. Those who wanted
        to seek justice for Gu Xian’er’s branch family did not dare to speak for
        fear of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, in the end, it was Gu Xian’er who dealt the final killing
        blow to the Sea King Palace’s Seventh Princess. So they can't even blame
        him for this incident.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of this moment, however, Gu Changge had other matters to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The True Dragon Clan is the most difficult bone to chew; they're quite
        the nuisance…’
      </p>
      <p>‘What a wonderful opportunity!’</p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s eyes narrowed.</p>
      <p><b>Rumble! </b></p>
      <p>
        Soon, multiple majestic auras descended into the Ancient Immortal
        Continent, soaring across the skies as they shook the heavens. This
        attracted the attention of many elders and disciples of the Heavenly Dao
        Immortal Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ancient, gigantic purple-copper warship emitted an ancient and
        powerful aura as it rested on the Supreme Peak.
      </p>
      <p><b>“We greet the Young Master!” </b></p>
      <p>
        Several of the Primordial Divine Sects’ elites gathered, with respect
        written on their faces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge gave a slight nod, telling them to settle down and rest at
        the Supreme Peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the great sects’ elites were stationed at the Mountain Gate
        of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace.
      </p>
      <p>Such an act could be called a provocation.</p>
      <p>
        However, no one in the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace dared to say a word
        against it.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's power had reached an unprecedented peak.</p>
      <p><b>“How are things going?”</b> Gu Changge asked.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Young Master, the issue regarding the remnants of the Tiangou Clan
          that were scattered across the continent has been resolved.”</b
        >
        The group of elites from the Primordial Divine Sect replied
        respectfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were ordered to head to the Immeasurable Heavens as quickly as they
        could. From there, they would follow Gu Changge’s orders and help him
        resolve the issues within the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tiangou Clan was the first to bear the brunt of this assault.
        However, there were still many clansmen scattered throughout the
        continent, even after the clan itself had fallen.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Very good.” </b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded his head, satisfied. He adhered to his principle of
        cutting off the grass at its roots. Naturally, he never had any
        intentions of letting them go.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now that he had deterred the entire Ancient Immortal Continent, he
        no longer needed to use this group of elites from the Primordial Divine
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        They’ll be stationed here, at the Supreme Peak, where they could be
        readily dispatched at any time. Otherwise, they might cause unnecessary
        trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as these people returned, in the distance, a large number of sounds
        could be heard from the sky. Like the gallop of a thousand armies that
        rushed through heaven and earth with the intent to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gu Family’s immortal-armoured soldiers had also returned to the
        Supreme Peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Good work.”</b> When he looked at them, Gu Changge couldn’t help but
        smile when he spoke.
      </p>
      <p><b>“We follow the young master wherever he leads.” </b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“And when the day comes that the Young Master truly takes the charge
          of the family, we will tread through the sea and fire for the future
          prosperity of the Gu Family.”

        [TL/N: “Great job!” “Thanks, I’ll be there when you get promoted.” Bro,
        what?]
      </p>
      <p>
        The sky was filled with immortal light as one of the soldier’s great
        voices echoed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their collective murderous aura shook the sky, before quickly receding.
      </p>
      <p>
        This killing intent was so strong that it lingered in the air even after
        they had left. Many disciples situated at the other peaks were stunned
        by this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stood at his Supreme Peak, watching them leave with a puzzled
        expression on his face.
      </p>
      <p>‘An incredible force…’</p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the day when he could fully control and command these
        soldiers had not yet come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, they were scattered across the realms, killing and cultivating.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only time they would use the spatial channels and rush here was when
        they were summoned by the Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, they were dispatched to follow Gu Changge’s orders and
        conquer the Tiangou Clan, and purge the forces who dared to offend the
        Ancient Immortal Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>Once this mission is completed, they will leave.</p>
      <p>
        Unless Gu Changge were to officially become the family head, he would
        not be qualified to control this powerful and horrifying force.
      </p>
      <p>It could be said that this was a one-time exception.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the rest of the Daoist Sects and Families were also eyeing
        the Ancient Immortal Continent. The Ancient Immortal Gu Family’s crusade
        against the Tiangou Clan was a hot topic amongst them. Was there really
        any need to say anymore?
      </p>
      <p>As for the rest?</p>

      <p>
        They have no excuse to send their elites to the Ancient Immortal
        Continent since they had announced that they only wanted to protect
        their descendants.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, those descendants would get crippled or even perish.</p>
      <p>However, the Ancient Immortal Races were not stupid.</p>
      <p>
        After watching the Tiangou Clan getting suppressed and subdued by Gu
        Changge, it was very unlikely that they would return to their old ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a turtle retreating into its shell, they dared not leave their
        clans for the fear that they might provoke “someone”.
      </p>
      <p>
        They reacted very quickly regarding this matter, leaving the Daoist
        forces helpless, as they were now unable to find any excuses to attack
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in this world, there was a silver lining: everyone likes
        rationality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, one of those powerful clans would have likely tried a
        counterattack. Such an event would not be conducive to their long-term
        stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was, of course, unless they were strong enough to take on the
        entirety of the Daoist Sects by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if that were the case, then why stop there? Why not dominate the
        entire Upper Realm?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Young Master, how did things go?”</b> The Supreme Peak was quiet
        until a clear and cold voice rang out from within the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji’s figure appeared, her clear and picturesque features were cold
        yet charming.
      </p>
      <p>[TL/N: Mommy? Sor-]</p>
      <p>
        She was cultivating at the Supreme Peak all this time, awaiting Gu
        Changge’s return.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge did not take her with him during the trip to the Ancient
        Immortal Continent, and she was instructed to seclude herself,
        concealing her whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“They went well.”</b> Gu Changge smiled, before remembering
        something. He then gave her new instructions,
        <b>“I happen to have a matter here that requires your attention.” </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Please give the order, Young Master.”</b> Yan Ji replied with doubt
        in her gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        She hadn't seen him for a while, and she began to see through him less
        and less. Back then, she could feel a slight sense of danger from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, she couldn’t sense anything anymore. It was like facing a vast
        sea in a state of deep calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        This didn’t necessarily mean that she grew stronger, nor did it mean
        that Gu Changge grew weaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather, it means that Gu Changge has attained even more power, becoming
        far more terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Ji’s heart could only sigh. Such talent was a rarity no matter when
        one looked, he truly was worthy of being called her master.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It's nothing major. I just need someone to help me find a few people
          who have vanished on a world in a different realm for more than 10
          years.”</b
        >
        Gu Changge said with a slight smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, a flash of light swept across the palm of his hand. He
        bought a few Boundary Breaking Talismans from the system mall, handing
        them to Yan Ji.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“You’re looking for someone?”</b> Yan Ji was confused but did not ask
        much. As a mere follower, it would be improper for her to know too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Yes, a few people. I'll have someone gather their information and
          hand it to you later. If you encounter any danger in that realm, it’s
          best that you escape first. I would be greatly saddened if you were to
          lose your life.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled, his words revealing his sincerity as well as his
        worry for Yan Ji.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Don't worry; I’ll be careful.”</b> A warm current flowed through Yan
        Ji's heart, obviously touched by Gu Changge's worry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Boundary Breaking Talisman was something that was many times more
        precious than the Domain Traversing Talisman.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the lower realms, the Boundary Breaking Talismans can be considered a
        divine object that can forcefully destroy space barriers and escape
        critical situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was these same talismans that Gu Changge brought out for her to use,
        leaving her with a method by which she could save her life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, Yan Ji was very confident in her own strength, considering
        that she was in the Great Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, Gu Changge did this because he was worried about her
        safety and wanted to give her a little more protection.
      </p>
      <p>With this observation alone, Yan Ji could feel his sincerity.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, unknown to Yan Ji, Gu Changge gave her these talismans
        because he believed that this trip would be an extremely dangerous one.
      </p>
      <p>Although Yan Ji was strong, even she was not unassailable.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the person he was looking for was none other than Gu
        Xian'er's parents and grandfather.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the beginning, Gu Xian'er's grandfather was trapped in a realm and
        had difficulty breaking free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s parents rushed to support him with several of their clan
        members in tow, but they too disappeared, leaving Gu Xian’er with a few
        family members.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, the former Gu Changge took this opportunity to mercilessly
        attack Gu Xian’er and dig up her Dao Bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, from the current Gu Changge’s point of view, there should be no
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking into account Gu Xian’er’s terrible luck[1], it’s highly likely
        that her parents and grandparents were fine all this time. In fact, her
        parents likely encountered a blessing in disguise, growing stronger from
        this incident.
      </p>
      <p>
        [1. He’s referring to how protags have good luck even when they or
        someone close to them are in critical situations.]
      </p>
      <p>‘So cliche,’ he thought.</p>
      <p>
        ‘It’s highly likely that Gu Xian’er simply doesn’t know and is simply
        worrying for nothing.’
      </p>
      <p>And so, Gu Changge plotted against Gu Xian’er once more.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Naturally, I’m not playing favourites for no reason. Why would I do
        such a thing?’
      </p>
      <p>
        First, everything must be done in secret. Neither Gu Xian’er nor the
        people backing Gu Changge should know about it.
      </p>
      <p>‘One should take credit for doing good things.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘However, there is a proper time and place for taking credit and now is
        not the time.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge's eyes, there was currently no better candidate than Yan
        Ji to assist him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge will send someone to find information regarding Gu
        Xian’er’s parents and grandfather. Then, he’ll hand it over to Yan Ji.
      </p>
      <p>Upon receiving her task, Yan Ji left immediately.</p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Gu Changge not only had Yin Mei help him collect
        cultivation resources in secret, but she was also responsible for
        training and cultivating his very own Death Corps[2].
      </p>
      <p>
        [2. It literally translates to “dead soldiers” and is implied to be a
        group of warriors who do not fear death.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, Gu Changge would show up in various places, looking for
        adolescents with good talent. Then Yin Mei would train them so that they
        may serve him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had sent Yin Mei a message, asking her to send over some of the
        soldiers to wait in a secluded area. There, they will await Yan Ji’s
        orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge is incredibly meticulous and does not reveal his cards
        easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, the fewer people who know of Yan Ji's existence, the better.

      <p>Time flew, and a few days passed by in a flash.</p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t just Gu Changge who led his people away from the Ancient
        Immortal Continent, other Young Supremes also did the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The training venture was over, as they were all led away by their
        elders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the word of the Fairy Gate has spread, many Ancient Freaks checked
        out the area.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Continent was in a state of chaos. To continue
        training would be next to impossible. As such, it was best that everyone
        simply head home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of, the many events that had transpired within the Ancient
        Immortal Continent were finally reaching the ears of those in the
        outside world, causing an uproar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor, Ye Ling had appeared. Gu Changge
        fought him and he disappeared after being dealt a serious injury. And
        what’s more, the True Dragon Clan’s Young Master, Long Teng, had died in
        Gu Changge’s hands…
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's reputation among the younger generation had reached
        unprecedented heights. Whether it was by his deeds or his strength that
        stood at the level of a Young Asura, he was someone to be admired.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, many fervent admirers of Gu Changge appeared all around.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, people felt wary of Ye Ling. This powerful inheritor of the
        Forbidden Demonic Arts had the ability to escape from Gu Changge’s
        clutches.
      </p>
      <p>
        It went without saying that Ye Ling’s strength was beyond that of any
        ordinary Young Supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The White Tiger Clan grew to hate Ye Ling even more, as they continued
        to attempt to track his whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family was also involved in this matter,
        considering that Yin Mei, their Holy Maiden was also “almost killed by
        Ye Ling.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She naturally acted with the flow, coming forward and vowing that she
        would kill Ye Ling so that she may avenge her long-dead fiancé, Bai Lie.
      </p>
      <p>Yin Mei’s stance left everyone in awe.</p>
      <p>
        She dared to stand against the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts.
        Such courage and boldness were beyond any ordinary person.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the outside eye, it would seem that Ye Ling’s deception of Yin Mei
        has planted a deep hatred in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people thought back to the time when Yin Mei’s life was on the
        line. They remembered that it was Gu Changge who stood up and saved her.
      </p>
      <p>The people became even more impressed.</p>
      <p>
        Outside the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace, many young cultivators came to
        visit Gu Changge, as several Young Supremes offered to become his
        followers.
      </p>
      <p>In this regard, Gu Changge did not refuse.</p>
      <p>
        In the younger generation, a follower was a symbol of status and power.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be a Young Supreme meant that they were the best in their generation,
        possessing an indomitable heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        To submit to him without even exchanging blows meant that their awe and
        admiration for Gu Changge were deeply rooted.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Gu Changge being the true Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic
        Arts? That thought never crossed anyone’s mind, nor will it, in the near
        foreseeable future.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, they began to become wary of the rest of the Young
        Supremes. Doubts like, “Perhaps Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor is
        hiding somewhere among us?” plagued the hearts of many cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand…</p>
      <p>
        When Bai Lie died, the White Tiger Clan took the initiative to annul the
        marriage contract between Bai Lie and Yin Mei, as they began to spiral
        further down the road of revenge. Their hatred for the Forbidden Demonic
        Arts’ Inheritors had reached a new peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, no one knew that Ye Ling's bones had long been turned
        into ashes and buried in a dry well within the Ancient Immortal
        Continent.
      </p>
      <p>No one will be able to find Ye Ling.</p>
      <p>
        And because of this, the Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritor grew to be
        more mysterious and powerful in the eyes of the people, giving way to
        panic.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was also at this moment that the many feuds which accumulated within
        the Ancient Immortal Continent had erupted for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A prime example would be how the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace
        was suppressed by Gu Changge in the Immortal Ancient Continent before
        the final blow was dealt by a little girl named Gu Xian’er.
      </p>
      <p>This incident triggered the fury of the Sea King Palace.</p>
      <p>
        As the overlord of the Endless Sea Clan, the Seventh Princess' position
        in the Sea King Palace needed no further explanation. After all, she was
        even trained to be the next palace master.
      </p>
      <p>They did not dare offend Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>However, Gu Xian'er was different.</p>
      <p>
        When Sea King Palace investigated Gu Xian'er's identity, they found out
        something was off. Although she was a member of the Gu Family, there was
        no one who was ready to acknowledge her.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, it seems that there was a grudge between her and Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This girl with her strange origins was said to have powerful talent
        comparable to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        She came from the Land of Abandoned Immortals, an outer world. She had
        survived in the barbaric land since she was a child.
      </p>
      <p>
        This incident cheered up a group of beings from the Sea King Palace,
        feeling that they had stumbled upon a scandal of the Ancient Immortal Gu
        Family.
      </p>
      <p>[TL/N: Courting death?]</p>
      <p>
        Since they did not recognize her identity, there was nothing stopping
        them from taking their revenge. Who would dare to deny them of this?
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Gu Xian’er struck first! She had killed the Seventh Princess’
        brother!
      </p>
      <p>She must answer for her crimes with her life!</p>
      <p>
        The only time it wouldn’t come to pass is if the Ancient Immortal Gu
        Family were to risk a scandal and formally recognize her. Such a topic
        is sure to become a sensation across the Upper Realm, becoming an object
        of shame for the Daoist Sects and Families.
      </p>
      <p>If not, who would dare stand up for her?</p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace? That won't work
        either!
      </p>
      <p>
        In a flash, many of the Sea Clan’s elites poured forth from the Infinite
        Sea, intending to bring Gu Xian’er to justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace, Gu Changge received this news,
        and he couldn’t help but smile a bit.
      </p>
      <p>‘How unexpected. For the Sea King Palace to come at such a time…’</p>
      <p>
        After receiving the news, he went up the mountain to where the Great
        Elder was, who was waiting for Gu Xian’er’s return.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time…</p>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p><b>[In the Ancient Immortal Continent] </b></p>
      <p>
        In the middle of a vast mountain range, a terrifying heavenly might
        unfolded, threatening to extinguish the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Quasi-Supreme ancestor of the Tiangou Clan was determined to escape
        and was headed for the Dragon Island where the True Dragon Clan was
        located. Unfortunately for him, he was intercepted by Gu Nashan.
      </p>
      <p>
        His tyrannical strength quickly extinguished the Tiangou Clan’s old
        geezer.
      </p>
      <p>Behind him followed Gu Xian’er, led by the Great Elder.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er's eyebrows jumped with joy, as she “appropriated” the Tiangou
        Clan’s ancestor’s belongings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“A family with Quasi-Supremes truly is rich…”</b> Gu Xian'er's clear
        and stunning little face was overflowing with smiles, unable to put up
        the slightest bit of resistance in the face of treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, she was left completely unaware that Gu Changge was
        setting up a trap for her at this very moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Nanshan was also enthusiastic to grab some loot, he was too
        embarrassed to do so in front of his own descendant!
      </p>
      <p>An ancestor must maintain his dignity!</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Thank you, ancestor!” </b>Naturally, Gu Xian'er noticed her
        ancestor’s reluctance. Her eyes curved into little crescents as she
        thanked him like a good girl would.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn’t believe the ancestor was doing it just because she was a good
        girl. ‘He’s probably just shy.’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er had a smug look on her face.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Nanshan couldn’t believe that such a sweet girl had the guts to rob
        her ancestor blind.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, he couldn’t help but smile.
        <b
          >“Hoho, this little lass. Why so formal? Do you not see this old
          ancestor as a family?”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>“Hehe, ancestor is so nice to me.” </b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er sweet smile could even melt a glacier, her words were like
        dripping honey, as she played the part of a cute and obedient
        descendant.

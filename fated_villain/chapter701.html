        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the final Palace of Neraka was still broken through, filled with thundering shouts as the cries of war spread afar. Countless formidable cultivators charged forward as Principles continuously drizzled down from the vaporising starry skies.</span><span id="more-36164"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every killer in Neraka was roaring, fighting with all their might, even if it meant dying along with the enemy. After all, there were no weaklings among them. They were all raised to be the strongest. Only a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert could stand still and withstand the shockwave of the war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This world was too vast. It remained unaffected even with the Palm of True World&#8217;s constant manipulation of the World Principles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been many years, but there was never a war as great as this. Even the Immortal Wars between Forces were never this gruesome. Men&#8217;s lives were more fragile than a grass blade, with many formidable cultivators dying, staining the sky and land with their blood. Such an apocalyptic scene drove everyone mad. Even the True Daoists turned insane from the killings, not backing down until they finally slaughtered their foes as their eyes reddened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Right at that moment, an endless sacrificial scripture burned in the sky, emitting limitless lights that penetrated through the skies as if they were interlocking every Principle of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such energy was as vast as the ocean, boundless and unending, instantaneously surging from the deepest parts of Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, cultivators uncontrollably shivered, their souls in fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is this aura?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Has the Ruler of Neraka appeared?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, the True Daoists on killing sprees felt something was off as their souls trembled. Their faces dramatically grew taut as they glared attentively at the deepest parts of Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, fog emerged and erupted, resembling Chaos Qi which had existed for billions of years. The overwhelming aura filled the universe as starry skies shattered. This was when an ambiguous figure slowly appeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* In the figure&#8217;s palm, dense crimson lights intertwined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ancient divine land was now bursting with millions of light beams. It appeared infinitely brighter and more vibrant than when it was in the hand of the Third Palace Lord, as if it was a blinding sun.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the divine land&#8217;s Principles wafted, everyone else shook profusely, feeling the urge to kneel towards the aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is… Has the Ruler of Neraka resurfaced? This aura is strange. We&#8217;re definitely no match for him!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Principles of this world have drastically changed! We might even have a hard time escaping!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The True Daoists from various Forces revealed faces of fear and helplessness. They never expected the mysterious Ruler of Neraka to be hiding in the deepest part of the palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the scene, the formidable cultivators of Neraka cried in joy, their faces full of excitement. Their dejection and disappointment vanished as if they were welcoming a new life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that really the Ruler of Neraka?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, those hiding in the dark remained sceptical, wondering why the Ruler of Neraka, if he was alive all this time, only chose to intervene after Neraka reached such a state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Where is Young Master Gu? Isn&#8217;t he interested in that mysterious Ruler of Neraka?&#8221; At that moment, Bai Lian&#8217;er, who also hurried over, noticed that Gu Changge was no longer on the ancient battleship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ah Da, who always followed Gu Changge, stood alone, sturdy as a metal tower of darkness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Bai Lian&#8217;er grew suspicious of the Ruler of Neraka&#8217;s true identity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appearance of the Ruler of Neraka left everyone on the battlefield stunned for a moment, but they quickly immersed themselves back in the savage war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* The sky trembled. The world was falling apart under the surge of power that shone unendingly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long bronze bell, which was a broken Immortal Grade Artifact containing a god, emerged in the horizon. Endless light beams and Chaos Qi shot out. Every beam was immeasurably dense, containing power that exceeded that of a True Daoist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiftly, everyone else retreated, knowing that getting hit would mean death. Under the pressure of such might, even a Nirvana Realm expert would explode before being disintegrated by the overpowering blow as no one could withstand the power of a broken Immortal Grade Artifact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancient battleships crumbled, and the True Daoists on them spewed blood as they were overtaken by the aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That damaged Immortal Grade Artifact is being used by someone. It isn’t autonomously acting like before. The person using it must not be an ordinary True Daoist. It&#8217;s possible he is the Ruler of Neraka himself.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A female True Daoist from Purple Cloud Valley frowned as she turned around to look at the space barrier of this world and felt that things were getting worse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Ruler of Neraka didn&#8217;t appear, she might still have had the chance to evacuate everyone safely. Alas, not only did the space barrier recover, but it was now shrouded in a vast, supreme force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the other True Daoists also grew restless. After all, it was rumoured that the Ruler of Neraka was someone who lived the longest in the Upper Realm, but no one knew how terrifying his abilities were.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, the True Daoists came because their respective Forces intended to test whether the Ruler of Neraka was still alive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Charge!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, at this moment, due to the appearance of the Ruler of Neraka, the warriors of Neraka fought even more fearlessly and ferociously, as though they had taken stimulants. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the border of Neraka, cold and indifferent, a figure was standing tall amid the thick fog. He raised his hand, slowly pushing forward. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, as if the whole world was under the grasp of the Ruler of Neraka, a pair of shapeless and enormous palms surged into the sky and charged towards the huge army before them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Such a devastating, frightening force was vast and boundless, causing mountains to crumble as Chaos Qi wildly gushed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, even True Daoists felt as insignificant as ants, unable to resist the force. They quickly realised and understood that the whole world was acting strangely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Ruler of Neraka was in control of a divine land, which had merged with this world and was now under his control, his will would be the will of this world. Anyone who dared to defy him would be defying the world and restricted by the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky, already crucially damaged, trembled even more violently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With stern faces, the True Daoists flew upwards, intending to go up against the force together. Their Principles burned brightly, resembling the scorching sun.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, the True Daoists of Neraka also rushed upwards to fend off their enemies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an unimaginable battle broke out, giant stars were turned into dust, while ancient battleships exploded and fell apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the divine land and this world were fusing, the Ruler of Neraka, being in control of the world and its Principles, was seemingly the god of this world. His eyes were glacial and emotionless as he stood at the border of the sky, pushing forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the gargantuan palms plummeted like a comet, crushing anyone who opposed him. Blood rained down and corpses piled up into mountains. The brutal scenes that filled the battleground were enough to scare ordinary cultivators.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great war that obliterated Neraka persisted for a few days. At its end, the True Daoists from various Forces reached the point of exhaustion and were forced to resort to their ultimate moves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, they noticed that the terrifying figure wasn&#8217;t the Ruler of Neraka himself but merely a Dharma Body that was left behind. Given that the power the figure harboured was speedily waning, as long as they could persevere to the end, they might be able to survive this war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few days, they had attempted to contact their respective Forces, only to be disappointed by the discovery that the barrier of the world was extremely strong, as though it was made of Immortal Gold. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, they couldn&#8217;t report their situation to the outside world. In other words, even if they could wipe out everyone from Neraka, they would still eventually die with their enemies. It was such an inevitable outcome that was difficult for them to accept.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, how frustrating! How did it all come to this…&#8221; A True Daoist roared in absolute reluctance, unable to persist any longer as he reached his limit. With that, his body collapsed and turned into a mist of blood as if it was a horrifying rain of blood that engulfed the entire universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far away, some True Daoists also screamed in extreme devastation before exploding, as they were unable to last until the final moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the once-vast army tremendously dwindled as merely a few ancient battleships remained floating in the sky, though still greatly damaged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the war ended with Neraka almost obliterated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the invading Forces faced an even worse loss. Their army was thoroughly annihilated without any survivors. To them, it was a critical loss of manpower, and such news would indubitably startle the whole Upper Realm.</span></p>

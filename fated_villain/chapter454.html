          shake, ready to crack from the immense amount of energy exuding from
          the mirror. It no longer resembled a mirror but rather, looked like a
          giant continent which could drop down at any time. Beams of blinding
          light wove around it and formed hills about to fall from the

          of Heaven and Earth was a precious treasure belonging to the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains and would only be awakened during a
          momentous event. Even though their side had battled the Upper Realm
          for nearly half a year, it had never been brought out since activating
          it took a terrifying amount of energy. The resources burned away each
          time were hard to estimate since a lot of spiritual energy from many
          stars was consumed.</span

          >The current activation of the Mirror of Heaven and Earth had been a
          unanimous decision by the ancient forces in the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains after hearing that Gu Changge had suddenly arrived in
          their territory, right where the Spirit Gourd Master and the Ancestor
          of Supreme Cave Heaven had fought and died. It didn&#8217;t take a
          lengthy discussion for them to agree on using it to destroy and lay
          him to rest there. After all, it would resolve many of their woes if
          he got eliminated here..</span

          there, including young prodigies who were the best in their force and
          had great potential, Gu Changge’s death far exceeded their worth. They
          had to do everything they could, since Gu Changge was a greater threat
          than even the other experts in the other realm. Plus, he was said to
          only be in his early twenties! Such a genius could be considered
          peerless in history. If he continued to develop, he would definitely
          be a grave threat to them.</span

          Ten Domains became shocked. This was also the first time many of their
          own had witnessed the awakening of the Mirror of Heaven and Earth. It
          was a grand and majestic sight where countless moons and stars seemed
          to gather together and fall towards one direction. Even a True Daoist
          might not have hope of surviving the energy it would unleash.</span

          forces were naturally angered by this. They wanted to stop this but
          had no idea how to do so. After all, their forces had hoped to
          retrieve the precious Immortal-Killing Gourd from inside that place.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thankfully, the power of the Mirror had dissipated in time and did
          not hurtle downwards, which saved the lives of the young prodigies
          there. Since Gu Changge had already left by tearing a hole in space,
          striking would only be a waste of resources and also cause unnecessary
          harm.</span

          he had lost the Gourd solely because of romantic love. Gu Changge
          possessing such a treasure would only multiply his strength. Since he
          was already unrivalled, who could balance him out?</span

          many young prodigies were angered by this. However, no one dared to go
          rescue her. Regardless of the fact that its shore was populated by the
          Upper Realm Army camps, who was confident enough to find and rescue
          her from Gu Changge&#8217;s clutches? There was no way to resolve

          Realm. They looked fearful and quickly expressed their gratitude. They
          had thought they would be dead there and then when they felt the
          frightening energy from the Mirror of Heaven and Earth. If not for Gu
          Changge&#8217;s actions, they would all have died there. So, they were
          deeply grateful to him.</span

          Cave Heaven colluding with the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains could
          no longer be changed even though was most likely untrue. After all,
          anyone smart enough would know what to say. Would they be willing to
          offend someone over a force whose Sect Master and Elders had already
          been killed? Or, would they try to maintain a good relationship with
          him? There was no need to ponder over this.

          and the Aether Abyss.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head, glancing at Lu
          Luo before saying, &#8220;We can meet up with our respective force for
          now, since we haven&#8217;t reached the beginning of the final battle.

          >Everyone transformed into divine rainbows and left the long deserted
          town for the Upper Realm army camps. During the journey, Gu Changge
          projected Dao Runes in order to consume the Immortal-Killing Gourd,
          which gradually rubbed off great amounts of its repelling force. As an
          innate attacking weapon, it could consume murderous Qi and meld it
          into an Immortal-Killing Blade. Such power was terrifying and
          unrivalled.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The effects it produced would also change depending on who wielded
          it. If Gu Changge used it, he might not be able to slay a Nirvana
          Realm being with a single strike, but seriously wounding his opponent
          wasn&#8217;t an issue. If he were to refine the blade with the
          Primordial True Feather he got from the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord
          of the Demon World, its power would increase by several folds.</span

          attack and defend. Its offensive capabilities far exceed many Nirvana
          Grade artifacts while its defensive abilities were comparable to that
          of the Tower of World Domination.

          as well as the Spacetime Stone and Mirror of Wonders which came from
          the Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest—all acquired after killing Fortuitous
          Ones, the greatest treasures he had found were the Immortal-Killing
          Gourd and the Supreme Dao Diagram. These two were a level stronger
          than many other nurtured Nirvana-grade artifacts since they had innate
          Dao patterns and aura.

          well. For example, the Solar Heavenly Blade, Primordial True Feather
          had been formed via nurturing. It would be hard for them to improve
          drastically unless they overcame their innate state or were re-forged.

          nurture. It was just that the method of making them was so unique that
          their power far exceeded many Nirvana grade artifacts. However, their
          true strength was still inferior to Nirvana-grade weapons since grade
          and strength did not equal each other.

          energy of the Immortal Palace. If its grade wasn&#8217;t sufficiently
          high, it could never do so. Meanwhile, the Sword of World Domination
          basically represents the killing power of the Immortal Palace. It
          could draw energy from heaven and even rouse the Great Dao. It could
          even manipulate the four elements above the Nine Heavens, and so

          expect that the others couldn&#8217;t escape.&#8221;</span

          >He sighed and the others fell silent without asking further
          questions. They couldn&#8217;t really overly state their doubts, since
          the truth of his explanation was difficult to judge. But since they
          were all beings who had lived for a long time, they would never trust
          his claim so easily.</span

          >He then discussed what had happened inside the Void Space with the
          others, making no mention of Supreme Cave Heaven. While everyone was
          curious about the Immortal-Killing Gourd, they tactfully did not ask
          about it. They didn&#8217;t have the strength nor the courage to steal
          it from him after all.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After bidding farewell to everyone, he transformed into a divine
          rainbow and headed towards where the Immortal Gu Family had set up
          their camp. Naturally, he brought along his hostage, Lu Luo. Gu
          Yingshuang had also separated from him after arriving and he did not
          plan on talking to her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Lu Luo had been desperate initially, but seeing that he ignored her
          and treated her as if she was invisible made her eventually calm down.
          She was going to die anyway so there was nothing to fear.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The terrifying and overwhelming scene in front of her made her shiver
          and sent chills all over, to her very core. She could see the power of
          the Upper Realm. Nearly every force had been able to effortlessly send
          out military forces with millions of people. She even wondered if the
          Upper Realm forces could send out armies with billions of soldiers in
          the final battle. This was unimaginable. If not for the Upper Realm
          forces battling separately, by now, the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains would have already been conquered by them.</span

          after half a month?&#8221; Gu Changge sudden words interrupted her
          train of thought.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had let go of her fear and was much calmer now, replying
          neutrally, &#8220;I believe Lin Wu will come and save me, but I
          don&#8217;t want him to endanger himself.&#8221;</span

          think he can save you?&#8221; Gu Changge said carelessly. &#8220;I
          guess you don&#8217;t want him to die too.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There was a ripple of emotion within her eyes since she truly did not
          want Lin Wu to die for her since it wasn&#8217;t worth it. If her
          cultivation hadn&#8217;t been sealed by Gu Changge, she would have
          committed suicide.</span

          Not only will I let you live unharmed but him as well.&#8221; Gu
          Changge smiled. Without any further explanation, he ordered someone to
          take her to her cell in the dungeon.</span

          >&#8220;You—&#8221; Lu Luo was slightly terrified since she had a
          faint idea of what Gu Changge intended to do. A chill spread through
          her body.</span

          >After she was taken away, Gu Changge dismissed everyone and prepared
          to enter his Inner World to observe Chan Hongyi&#8217;s development.
          Before he could open it though, he could already sense some hostility
          emerging from within.</span

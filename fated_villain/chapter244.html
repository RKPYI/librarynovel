      <h4>Chapter 244-1: Are you Master‚Äôs wife? Brain goes blank (1)</h4>
      <p>
        "Many clansmen at that time saw Young Master Changge come back from
        outside the mountain gate with a little girl who was five or six years
        old."
      </p>
      <p>"That little girl looks cute and quiet‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        After listening to the words reported by the maid, Gu Xian'er was a
        little silent, and she felt more and more uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>Pretty cute?</p>
      <p>
        Could it be that Gu Changge liked a sister with that kind of
        personality?
      </p>
      <p>
        And her character, indeed, had nothing to do with being quiet and
        well-behaved, and sometimes she liked to go against Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>So‚Ä¶ Gu Changge found a new sister?</p>
      <p>"How can that be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er suddenly felt an inexplicable pressure. She didn't believe
        the news at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now it was something that many clansmen had witnessed with their own
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to what Changge did in the past, how could he have a little
        girl by his side?
      </p>
      <p>
        For Gu Changge, it was a burden. If the sun hadn't risen from the west,
        then something must have been wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        And he also said there was something special about that little girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        But no matter what she said, at this moment, Gu Xian'er felt jealousy in
        her heart. After all, before this, she was the one and only younger
        sister of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now there was a little girl, what if Gu Changge doesn't spoil her in the
        future? She didn't say that she would fight for favor with a little girl
        or something.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Pooh.</strong></p>
      <p>
        It was just that Gu Changge finally showed his tenderness towards her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't want to see Gu Changge being so nice to the other little
        girls. And what she had worked so hard to get, why did that little girl
        get it so easily?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was not a saint, and she had her own selfishness. Thinking of
        this, she felt even more jealous.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, it was her who hated Gu Changge the most, and now she
        was the one who felt the most distressed and guilty toward Gu Changge
        the most.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge's attitude towards her made her a little uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>For a time, Gu Xian'er was a little worried.</p>
      <p>
        Was it because she didn't visit Gu Changge some time ago, making him
        think it was better to bring back a new younger sister?
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was clear that his attitude was very cold, and he didn't pay
        attention to herself at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        She began to think wildly, suspiciously not as smart and cunning as
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Gu Xian'er breathed a sigh of relief, and her expression
        returned to a cold and calm state.
      </p>
      <p>
        She said, "Take me to see the little girl that Gu Changge brought back.
        As a sister, I should take a good look at her."
      </p>
      <p>
        Her last sentence was as if she said it to himself, and gave herself an
        excuse.
      </p>
      <p>"Got it, miss."</p>

      <p>
        The maid who reported smiled bitterly. She didn't dare to miss this kind
        of thing, but after the report, Gu Xian'er probably wouldn't let it go.
      </p>
      <p>She was a little worried in case Gu Changge blamed her.</p>
      <p>
        And soon, under the guidance of the maid, Gu Xian'er went to the island
        where Gu Changge was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, many people who saw her were a little surprised and
        unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a deep hatred between Gu Xian'er and Gu Changge. ùí©eew updates
        ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, although they knew that Gu Changge had already dug his
        bones and returned to his sister, how could this kind of hatred be
        resolved so easily?
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn't know the many grievances between Gu Xian'er and Gu Changge
        during this period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now they still thought that these two veins were a little old and dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If I remember correctly, this is the first time Miss Xian'er has come
        to this island where the young master is, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah, before this, I heard that she never set foot here for half a
        step, but I don't know why‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that she saw the young master leaving and planned to visit
        and have a look?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Last time I heard that in the Nirvana Pond, the young master went into
        trouble for some reason, and Miss Xian'er and others were greatly
        affected."
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, Miss Xian'er has broken through her cultivation again during
        this period. It's really too strong, but it's a pity. If she hadn't been
        left out all these years, she would now be comparable to the young
        master."
      </p>
      <p>
        Many clansmen watched this scene and whispered, very curious and amazed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er's celestial appearance needed no further explanation, many
        Clan Elders thought that it was comparable to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, Gu Xian'er also arrived at the palace where Yaoyao was
        currently living.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't care about the many voices of the nearby clansmen. She mainly
        wanted to see how beautiful this little girl was.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in the palace, the maid who brought Yaoyao here was whispering
        something about the rules of the Ancient Immortal Gu family to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two of them had no idea that Gu Xian'er had already gone outside the
        hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's little face was serious, listening to the rules of the Ancient
        Immortal Gu family, the family where the Master belonged was far more
        terrifying than any force she knew.
      </p>
      <p>The strictness of the rules alone was shocking.</p>
      <p>"You are the little girl that Gu Changge brought back?"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Xian'er at the entrance of the palace suddenly opened
        her mouth, her voice was cold and calm, and she looked at it, which
        surprised the two people in the palace, and only then did they realize
        her arrival.
      </p>
      <p>"Miss Xian'er!"</p>
      <p>
        The maid in the hall looked shocked when she heard the voice, and then
        quickly said respectfully.
      </p>
      <p>But she was curious why Miss Xian'er came to this place.</p>
      <p>Yaoyao also looked over in surprise.</p>
      <p>
        At the gate of the palace, they wondered when a beautiful and
        over-the-top sister stood.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a slender figure, a wide-sleeved fluttering immortal skirt, with a
        fairy-like appearance, she looked like a nine-day fairy, and her eyes
        were dusty and cold, without a trace of dust.
      </p>
      <p>"You‚Ä¶ are you a Master‚Äôs wife?"</p>
      <p>
        She was still a bit at a loss, not knowing who this beautiful sister
        was.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        So she spoke subconsciously, thinking that she was the Daoist companion
        of the master.
      </p>
      <p>But looking at the age, she doesn't seem to be old, right?</p>
      <p>"Eh‚Ä¶ what?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Xian'er suddenly squinted, unable to keep the cold
        expression just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her head buzzed as if he had been hit by some kind of hammer, and it
        suddenly became empty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The suet jade-like flawless and delicate face instantly rose into a
        haze, and then she quickly waved her hand to deny it, her heart was
        beating very fast, and she couldn't help but panic.
      </p>
      <p>"I'm not, it's not me, don't talk nonsense."</p>
      <p>
        This little girl, why did she talk like this, and she asked if she was
        the Master‚Äôs wife?
      </p>
      <p>She was just Gu Changge's younger sister.</p>
      <p>Mistress‚Ä¶ how was that possible‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        However, this little girl looked very well-behaved and spoke nicely.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er's brows could not help but twitch.</p>
      <p>
        Before coming here, there was some hostility, and inexplicably, but now
        it felt like it disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        She loved this little girl who was full of fairy spirit and looked like
        a porcelain doll.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all‚Ä¶ Judging from the title, she should be Gu Changge's little
        disicple.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, it didn‚Äôt threaten her status as a sister at all.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, in Yaoyao, Gu Xian'er felt a strange and familiar aura,
        extremely natural and peaceful, just like the feeling she had when she
        was listening to Sister Taoyao when she was in Peach Village.
      </p>
      <p>How could she be hostile again?</p>
      <p>She was an Elder now.</p>
      <p>
        "What's your name? Gu Changge is my brother, but I'm not your Master‚Äôs
        wife."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Gu Xian'er couldn't help but burst into a smile,
        crouched down, and touched Yaoyao's head.
      </p>
      <p>"Hello, Senior Sister, my name is Yaoyao."</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao also felt Gu Xian'er's kindness, she was a little timid at first,
        but she couldn't help but relax a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Senior Sister? Yaoyao's name is really nice. Yaoyao is so beautiful.
        Since you call me that, then I have to give you a gift, otherwise Gu
        Changge may talk bad about me later."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was stunned for a moment, but she was quite satisfied with
        this title.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, she smiled even deeper, and with a wave of her jade
        hand, a series of Divine weapons suddenly appeared in the void in front
        of her.
      </p>
      <p>Jade tripod, golden seal, big bell, plain belt‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>The golden light was surging and the power was vast.</p>
      <p>
        Each piece was extremely precious, and it could cause cultivators to
        scramble for their heads in the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        With her stingy character as a money fan, she could take out these
        precious items to give away.
      </p>
      <p>It was enough to show that she had paid for it.</p>
      <p>
        After all, back then‚Ä¶ she even wanted to dig a few more pieces of Gu
        Changge's Divine weapons.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Senior Sister."</p>
      <p>Yaoyao showed a cute smile.</p>
      <h4>Chapter 244-2: Are you Master‚Äôs wife? Brain goes blank (2)</h4>
      <p>
        She knew a lot about the principles of dealing with others and
        understood that if she didn't accept it, Gu Xian'er would inevitably
        think that she was ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she honestly accepted it, but she couldn't cultivate and these Divine
        weapons were generally useless to her.
      </p>
      <p>"Nice." Gu Xian'er nodded and showed an Elder-like smile.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's big eyes flashed, and she inexplicably had a favorable
        impression of this beautiful, over-the-top Senior Sister, as if the two
        of them had known each other for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Gu Xian'er stayed here and asked Yaoyao a lot of questions,
        asking about Gu Changge's whereabouts and news during this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When returning to the Ancient Immortal Gu family, Gu Changge had already
        explained many things to Yaoyao, and now that she was asked by Gu
        Xian'er, she answered without any hindrance.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge actually went to the Lower Realm to pay back a favor?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's purpose for visiting the Lower Realm, Gu Xian'er
        was a little surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then from Yaoyao's mouth, she also heard the heroic deeds of Gu Changge
        being a savior once, suppressing a terrifying True Demon in the Lower
        Realm, and saving the world.
      </p>
      <p>This made her speechless for a long time.</p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, Gu Changge was indeed like this. No matter how indifferent
        he looked on the outside, he was very gentle on the inside. Otherwise,
        why would he make a move to save the world?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking like this, Gu Xian'er felt that she had to find a good time to
        have a showdown with Gu Changge, and she couldn't let him bear this
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Gu Changge naturally learned about Gu Xian'er running
        to visit Yaoyao, but he didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since he brought Yaoyao back to the family, he had already thought of
        all the countermeasures, and he was not afraid of being asked about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Xian'er should have noticed the strangeness of Yaoyao, but I wonder
        if she can contact the Peach Tree behind her?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's expression was a little strange.</p>
      <p>
        After the last incident in Nirvana Pond, he had left Gu Xian'er for so
        long. According to her character, she couldn't continue to hold back.
      </p>
      <p>
        To resolve this bone-digging hatred, Gu Changge took great pains, and
        now he was waiting for Gu Xian'er to take him back to the Peach Village
        to meet her Masters.
      </p>
      <p>In this way, this hatred could almost come to an end.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er had a relatively simple and kind personality, but the Old
        Monsters behind her were not that easy to fool.
      </p>
      <p>So he had to prepare a lot.</p>
      <p>"Counting the time, it's about time for Yan Ji to come back."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge remembered another very important thing. Although he could
        fool the truth a little, he could not fool around for his whole life.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now Jiang Chuchu also wanted to understand a little bit. Gu Changge
        decided to give her a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, once Wang Ziji, another descendant of the Human Ancestor
        Hall, noticed the abnormality, it would affect his plan. As a traveler,
        Wang Ziji was not a fuel-efficient lamp.
      </p>
      <p>So he sent a message to let Yan Ji return.</p>
      <p>
        As for the excuse, it was nothing more than seeing Gu Changge in
        retreat, coming to visit, and discussing how to crusade the inheritors
        of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next few days, the news of Gu Changge's return was spread from
        the Gu family, causing shock to many of the younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the Gu family couldn't say that Gu Changge had returned from
        the outside world, so it was said that his cultivation base had once
        again gone out of the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, the Upper Realm, which was originally unsettled, made waves
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Immortal Sects and the descendants of the Supreme Dao
        heritages all felt the pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Ancient freaks who were born recently were frowning and felt
        that the atmosphere was not right. The younger generation was in awe of
        Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had always been called the strongest person of the younger
        generation. Now that he had been out of the loop, his cultivation had
        become profound again. Did it mean that the gap between the younger
        generation and him had been infinitely widened again?
      </p>
      <p>There were many younger generations who had such thoughts.</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, the inheritor of the demonic art fell silent
        again, and the various forces did not hear the news of the inheritor of
        the demonic art, and no one died under the demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>This sparked a lot of debate.</p>
      <p>
        Heavenly Emperor Ying‚Äôs son Ying Shuang also stayed in the Heavenly
        Emperor Mountain and there was no news of his departure.
      </p>
      <p>Many cultivators felt that this was strange.</p>
      <p>
        During the time when the inheritor of demonic art disappeared, Ying
        Shuang did not show up again.
      </p>
      <p>Was this too coincidental?</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>At the same time, on the Heavenly Emperor Mountain.</p>
      <p>
        As the party involved, Ying Shuang could only grit his teeth and swallow
        his pride, feeling extremely aggrieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he left the Heavenly Emperor Mountain, he would be attacked by some
        cultivators and creatures who were holding the banner of crusade against
        the inheritor of demonic arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if he didn't leave the Emperor Mountain, and the inheritor of the
        demonic art didn't show up. Even if he jumped into the Yellow River, he
        couldn't wash this blame.
      </p>
      <p>It was a complete dilemma.</p>
      <p>
        Unless the true inheritor of demonic art showed up and killed the rest
        of the young people and took the initiative to clear his name,
        otherwise, during this period of time, the black pot would be locked up
        on him.

      <p>
        "Anyway, the matter of the inheritor of demonic arts has nothing to do
        with you, brother. No matter how wronged the outside world is, it cannot
        be true."
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the hall, Ying Yu, with long silver hair, opened her mouth while
        frowning slightly, and comforted Ying Shuang, who was not very
        good-looking.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I know, but I've been wronged like this all the time, and it will be
        the same for every other person."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang said with a wry smile and sighed, "I don't know who I
        offended to be framed for no reason."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have no grudges with Gu Changge and the descendants of the Human
        Ancestor Hall. Why did they put this blame on me?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang said so, putting himself on the victim's side, with a very
        helpless tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in his heart, he gritted his teeth with hatred towards Gu Changge
        and the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, he had found a lot of ways, and compared with the
        previous Ying Shuang, it seemed that the difference was not that big.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the fact that the strength of the cultivation base was
        not as good as the previous Ying Shuang, in other aspects, even Ying Yu
        couldn't find any abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, Ying Shuang was relieved. It was the only good thing among
        so many bad things.
      </p>
      <p>
        While acting as the Prince, he became more and more satisfactory, as if
        this was the real him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There must be something wrong with this matter. If it's just Gu Changge
        saying that, then it's probably still an accident, but the two
        descendants of the Human Ancestor Hall thinking that the inheritor of
        demonic art is the Elder brother‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Isn't it too coincidental, I feel like there must be something odd
        about it."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu whispered, while her eyes were fixed on Ying Shuang's
        expression, trying to see something abnormal on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also didn't know whether Ying Shuang was hiding something from her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Ying Shuang's heart jumped, but his expression was very
        calm, "Sister, what you said is also what I am suspicious of. Logically
        speaking, I have never met the three of them."
      </p>
      <p>
        His biggest secret was still inexplicably the matter of taking over Ying
        Shuang. It was still a little uncomfortable to be stared at by Ying Yu
        like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Forget it, anyway, soon the True Immortal Academy will be completed,
        and the Emperor Mountain will also send the strongest person to go
        there. I heard that it's the person who lived the same generation as the
        father."
      </p>
      <p>
        "When the time comes, he will protect me and wait. In the True Immortal
        Academy, there will be no one who does not have long eyes and dares to
        provoke."
      </p>
      <p>
        When she mentioned the True Immortal Academy, there was a sense of
        yearning in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it was an academy that gathered the resources of many Dao
        Sects in the Upper Realm, and aims to cultivate a True Immortal in this
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although her talent was powerful, she was also the descendant of the
        Emperor, and her bloodline was amazing, but she was not sure that she
        would be able to compete with many young talents in this life.
      </p>
      <p>And True Immortal Academy was just the perfect place to train her.</p>
      <p>
        All the younger generation were looking forward to it, hoping to jump to
        the Dragon Gate there and move to another world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Ying Shuang's smile was a little stiff. To be honest, he
        didn't want to go to the True Immortal Academy. He also knew his
        ability. How many people could he win against many younger generations?
      </p>
      <p>But as the Prince, this couldn't be done by him.</p>
      <p>
        "My sister is right. After staying in the Emperor's Palace for so long,
        when it's time to go to the True Immortal Academy, it's time for me to
        show the prestige of the Emperor's Mountain." Geett the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels on
        no/v/elbin(.)c/om
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Ying Shuang had a confident look on his face, while saying
        this, Ying Yu couldn't help admiring, this was indeed the brother she
        was familiar with.

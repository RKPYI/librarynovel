          crash his wedding to take his fiancee from her on his big day and
          blatantly insult him. Were he still in his delirious state, he
          wouldn&#8217;t have been bothered by those words. Nevertheless, a
          surge of coldness arose in his heart. All these years, the last person

          with bloodmist. She couldn&#8217;t even manage to let out a painful
          shriek. At her very last moment, hopelessness, shock, and immense

          Luo Clan before landing his gaze on Luo Feng&#8217;s face with a

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The profound path was bathed in a golden mist. It was incredibly overt, as it extended all the way from a distant place. Everyone was stunned upon seeing it. They never expected that this partially completed Reincarnation Platform would attract such a terrifying anomaly.</span><span id="more-36177"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems my hypothesis was right. This </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a marker left behind by the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being,&#8221; murmured Gu Changge. His eyes were filled with a peculiar gleam as his thoughts raced. Somehow, he wasn&#8217;t surprised at all. He had already suspected that someone had conjured up a major scheme behind the backs of people of the Eternal Overcast. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After careful consideration, he came to the conclusion that the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being must be the culprit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being must have visited Eternal Overcast in the past. Otherwise, Jia Nan and the others would not have been searching for his Successor, to help forge the Reincarnation Platform. Looking at it now, it seemed that the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had planned it all along. He had used the platform to leave coordinates so that he could come back here again in the future. As for his intentions, Gu Changge thought that they were most likely related to the origins of the Eternal Overcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which, the true Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had fallen victim to his schemes. The numerous legacies left behind by the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had also now fallen into his hands. Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t say for sure whether the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being would be an enemy or an ally if he truly appeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s going on? The Reincarnation Platform hasn&#8217;t even been fully forged yet. Why is this happening all of a sudden?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is someone about to descend?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The radiant golden path pierced through the darkness of Eternal Overcast and spread in an instant, leaving many Eternal Overcast Beings gawking in shock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This path&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this supposed to light up the path to that place? Why is it now leading someone here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Were all of us deceived?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, the Great Ancestors reacted instantly. Their expressions turned incredibly grim. The Reincarnation Platform was meant to help them illuminate a path to that mysterious and eerie place. But now, it had been prematurely ignited, serving as a beacon to guide someone else to the coordinates here. They couldn&#8217;t believe that nothing was wrong with this. After all, the Reincarnation Platform had yet to be fully forged—it was merely still a scaffolding that hadn&#8217;t met their expectations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this that brat’s doing?&#8221; asked one of the Great Ancestors who stared at Gu Changge, his words laced with a chilling tone. Although two Great Ancestors met their end by the hands of Gu Changge, the existence of the ancient wells allowed them to reshape their bodies. Because of that, they still hadn&#8217;t truly felt the gravity of the danger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Great Ancestor spoke up, his tone resolute and unwavering without a hint of doubt.&#8221;It&#8217;s not him. This might be the handiwork of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being!&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, several other Great Ancestors were also hit by the realisation. The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was the one who bestowed the method of forging the Reincarnation Platform upon them. He also informed them that the mysterious land could be revealed through the Reincarnation Platform. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had made any moves, they would be helpless. And even if he really did tamper with something, it wasn&#8217;t like they could do anything about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He has deceived us!&#8221; One of the Great Ancestors&#8217; faces turned sour immediately. The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was an Absolute Being from the Celestial Ancient Times. He controlled the Principles of Reincarnation and could traverse through the River of Time. It would be difficult for the Great Ancestors&#8217; to detect it once someone like him was determined to set them up. Moreover, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being swore upon his Dao Heart when he made a deal with them. No one would have thought that the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being would dare to break a Dao Oath he made on his Dao Heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see you folks are not complete fools. You finally understood. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s too late now.&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled lightly, and when he observed the expressions of the Great Ancestors, he knew that they had already realised the truth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it! Everything is in vain in the end! Dammit!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrifying mist once again swept in from the depths of the Eternal Overcast. Not only that, ominous black bolts of lightning tore through the sky as if it wanted to split the universe in half.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Great Ancestors understood everything, their emotions fluctuated greatly. They were filled with anger, regret, and above all, despair. The ancient wells were on the verge of drying up, and if they could not find that mysterious land soon, it wouldn&#8217;t be long before they would be corroded by decay and truly perish without any chance of resurrecting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, all the Eternal Overcast Beings felt the Great Ancestors&#8217; profound despair. They couldn&#8217;t help but prostrate themselves on the ground as they trembled uncontrollably. They didn&#8217;t know why the Great Ancestors had fallen into such despair, nor could they fathom it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, there seemed to be frightening fluctuations permeating the air in the distant sky. As that golden path continued to spread endlessly, a divine radiance dripped from it like a hymn that was beckoning someone&#8217;s arrival. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone then saw the vague figure, seemingly crossing through the stars to come here. Even people like Jia Nan and the others couldn&#8217;t help but feel a sense of trepidation as if their souls were frozen under the gaze of that figure. This immense power was more terrifying and awe-inspiring than their Great Ancestors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is indeed him!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Ancestors&#8217; faces fell when they saw this man’s silhouette. They were filled with an incomparable sense of rage and killing intent. They never expected that the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, who had vanished for countless ages, would still exist in this world and even descend upon Eternal Overcast in such a manner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s intrigued gaze also fell upon the figure. [So, this is the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being? His aura is truly profound unlike an ordinary person&#8217;s. He truly deserves to be the overlord of the Celestial Ancient Era.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could sense the movement from the Stage of Reincarnation Enlightenment he obtained back in the Celestial Ancient Continent as the numerous runes in it awakened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, after obtaining this object, he devoured and absorbed the Power of Reincarnation within it and refined a Symbol of Reincarnation as an insurance to his life &#8211; a second life. Subsequently, the object became lifeless like it was dead, completely devoid of any spiritual power. However, he never thought it would revive today and manifest an entirely different power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems that the legacy the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being left behind is more to meet the eyes.] With a thought, Gu Changge suppressed the Stage of Reincarnation. The look in his eyes deepened in that second. He was genuinely curious about what the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, who had been hiding behind the heavens for such a long time, had been plotting and scheming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his peak, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had definitely surpassed the level of a True Daoist. His ambitions were certainly not as simple as reaching the Immortal Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, a golden walkway extended from beyond the sky and swiftly descended to the centre of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom. The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being then appeared looking majestic and otherworldly as his robe fluttered with each step. He appeared to be in his thirties or forties, and yet he exuded an immortal aura that evoked a sense of both worldly wisdom and divine transcendence. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a gentle smile, he lightly brushed against the Reincarnation Platform before him, his gaze seemingly filled with nostalgia and emotions. &#8220;Greetings, Fellow Daoists,&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hummed before continuing. &#8220;I managed to find my way back thanks to this.&#8221; He sounded reminiscent as he spoke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the few Great Ancestors standing in the depths of the Eternal Overcast homeland remained silent, their gazes cold and indifferent as they looked at him. They were not stupid. It was because of the Dao Oath that they had mistakenly believed in the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being. But now that they had realised the truth, they understood that the scheming Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had another agenda.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He obviously came harbouring ill intentions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, you must be my Successor.&#8221; The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being shifted his gaze from the Reincarnation Platform and looked kindly at Gu Changge as he spoke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge maintained his indifferent demeanour and smiled casually as he replied, &#8220;You have mistaken me for someone else, Senior. I am not your Successor. On the contrary, I killed the person you chose to be your Successor and claimed that legacy of his for myself.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He spoke with such ease and comfort without hiding anything. Since the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had already planned everything, he must have known that Gu Changge was not his chosen Successor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Eternal Overcast Beings were shaken and shocked upon hearing this. They had always believed that Gu Changge was the true Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, they were completely unaware of the truth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The true Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was killed by him a long time ago?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s expression barely changed when he heard that. In fact, it even seemed like he had known it long ago. He only offered a small smile and replied, &#8220;Regardless of the circumstances, you are my Successor as long as you obtain my legacy.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, no matter how Gu Changge obtained his legacy, he would be considered the Successor because it had ended up in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, should I call you Master then, Senior?&#8221; Gu Changge raised an eyebrow casually with a faint smile hanging on his lips. There wasn&#8217;t a hint of respect in his words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being seemed unperturbed by this. &#8220;You and me,&#8221; he smiled, &#8220;why should we bother with such mundane formalities between us?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truth be told, he felt as astonished and incredulous when he first laid eyes on Gu Changge. After all, Gu Changge seemed relatively young judging from his age and aptitude. Despite that, his cultivation had reached a level that even the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being thought was expansive enough to give him an extreme sense of danger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had intended to trace back the Fragments of Time and deduce Gu Changge&#8217;s origins and future. However, right when he attempted to do so, a great crisis and unimaginable terror suddenly enveloped him, nearly causing a severe backlash. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had to stop right there and then. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t dare to continue prying after that. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The background of this Successor of his who had appeared out of nowhere was beyond his imagination. At least for now, it was beyond his reach. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you two birds of a feather? Reminiscing and showing sympathy for each other at a moment like this?&#8221; The Great Ancestors had been watching all of this with cold eyes. They never expected that the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being would pay no attention to Gu Changge&#8217;s identity, nor did he care that Gu Changge had killed the real Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being to seize his opportunity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing these words, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being shifted his gaze away from Gu Changge and smiled politely at the Great Ancestors rather indifferently. &#8220;How have you all been, Fellow Daoists? In my opinion, you must be nearing the end of your ropes.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his average stature, he appeared minuscule standing before the towering figures of the Great Ancestors. However, a terrifying aura emanating from him that blurred even the World Principles made it impossible for anyone to underestimate him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You made a Dao Oath upon your Dao Heart to help us find that mysterious place in the past. Yet now, you are breaking the oath and betraying us? Aren&#8217;t you afraid of retribution?&#8221; One of the Great Ancestors frowned at having the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being expose their worry right from the get-go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I did make a vow to help you in finding that place. Of course, I&#8217;ll do that under the pretext that you would hand over those three mysterious ancient wells to me&#8230;&#8221; Unlike the gentle smile the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being maintained on his face, his eyes displayed a cold and indifferent depth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He no longer concealed his intentions and goals. His purpose had remained unchanged from the beginning. Initially, he was wary of the methods the undying Six Great Ancestors possess. However, he later realised that they most relied on those three mysterious ancient wells. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From then on, he began calculating and planning, waiting for the moment when the well water was about to dry up before taking action. That was because even if the Six Great Ancestors could resurrect, they would still experience a period of weakness. The process of resurrection and reconstruction consumed the water from those three mysterious ancient wells. The day the well water eventually dried up would be the day the Great Ancestors had to face their deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t even think about it! The ancient wells are the essence of our existence. How can we allow an outsider like you to taint them?&#8221; Apart from the Great Ancestor, whose physical body had not been reconstructed yet, the faces of the other five Great Ancestors darkened, and a surge of killing intent filled the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fellow Daoist, since my Successor is here today, he and I will claim these three wells for ourselves. If you are wise, you would know it&#8217;s better not to stubbornly resist.&#8221; The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being shook his head and spoke as though he was advising the Great Ancestors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He appeared to have an ethereal and dignified demeanour, but since he had been able to make such an extensive plan from the shadows of different worlds, he certainly wasn&#8217;t a simple and benevolent individual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, he could tell that this Successor of his had already fought against the Six Great Ancestors before he arrived here. Two of the Great Ancestors had even been defeated in the process, and they were forced to reconstruct their bodies and enter a period of weakness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Changge looked at the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being with a slightly curious gaze. He found it difficult to guess the latter&#8217;s true intentions. It sounded suspiciously simple if the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had been lurking for so long just for ancient these wells. Gu Changge had a feeling that the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had other motives. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He must be plotting something else after hiding in the shadows for so many years. Let&#8217;s see what he&#8217;s plotting. Maybe I can make use of it.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various thoughts flashed through Gu Changge&#8217;s mind. His expression returned to normal, and he smiled at the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, saying, &#8220;Since you have said so, Master, I shall assist you in obtaining these three mysterious ancient wells.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very well. My disciple and I will be taking these wells today. Naturally, we will need to have a glimpse of the secrets of eternal life,&#8221; the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being replied with a nod and a smile after being slightly taken aback. He hadn&#8217;t expected Gu Changge to switch sides so quickly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just moments ago, Gu Changge had appeared indifferent and unconcerned. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But thinking about it, I was a prominent figure during the Celestial Ancient Era. There are even many legends about me that have remained even in the present world. Even though I can&#8217;t look into Gu Changge&#8217;s background, I&#8217;m sure he isn&#8217;t a fool. He knows he should make the right choice in this situation. Rather than offending him, I might as well seize the opportunity to establish a good relationship with him and gain more benefits from him.]</span></p>

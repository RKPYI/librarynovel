      <h4>
        Chapter 224-1: This assistance is really timely, Everyone is dumbfounded
        (1)
      </h4>
      <p>Outside the mountain gate of Immortal Lun Sect.</p>
      <p>The clouds were shrouded in mist, and it was extremely magnificent.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge and Yaoyao traveled all the way to this location.</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, he was serious about becoming a Master, and
        he couldn't say how much he cared about it, but he still did his job
        with diligence, so that people wouldn't find anything wrong.
      </p>
      <p>Although Yaoyao couldn't cultivate, it didn't matter.</p>
      <p>
        As a Master, he took her to play all the way, leaving footprints in the
        vast mountains and rivers, and the ancient cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Yaoyao understood the truth, although she couldn't
        cultivate, but with a Master like him, no one could bully her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge also took her to the ancient restricted areas and the ancient
        sacred mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this little girl was very sticky to him, saying that her Master was
        the best person for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even her silver haired granny who followed behind had gained a lot of
        enlightenment and knowledge, and was very envious of Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Gu Changge's intentional care, Yaoyao now almost regarded him as
        her closest person.
      </p>
      <p>
        She even felt that her brother was not like her Master, who was
        meticulous to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, after all, she had depended on her brother and her granny for
        so many years, and he still had a very important position in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>This point, Gu Changge was also clear, so he was not in a hurry.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he raised his eyes and looked at this majestic ancient
        place, as he was holding Yaoyao by his side, with a strange expression
        on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, in his opinion, the Luck of the Immortal Lun Sect was
        changing at a strange speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an image of a Dragon, but obviously some time ago, he felt
        that the Luck of this location was fading.
      </p>
      <p>But in a blink of an eye, it started to recover.</p>
      <p>
        This change could only explain what the Immortal Lun Sect had done, and
        it had begun to conform to the changes in heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could it be because of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor that
        caused this change? It seems that the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor is not as simple as a Child of Luck, but he is also in the
        Heavenly Star?"
      </p>
      <p>Various thoughts flashed in Gu Changge's mind.</p>
      <p>He stood here, tall and vague, as if standing in the other world.</p>
      <p>
        He was dressed in a moon-white robe, with wide sleeves, and fluttering
        hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        His face was blurred, and it felt more otherworldly, which made people
        unable to help but feel a sense of adoration.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Reporting… reporting to the Immortal, someone has been sent to report
        your arrival."
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at him, the disciples of the Immortal Lun Sect in front of him
        were stammering and their voices were shaking.
      </p>
      <p>They couldn’t even stand steadily.</p>
      <p>
        None of them expected that the terrifying Immortal from the rumors would
        actually visit them in person today and come to the door of the Immortal
        Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made them shocked, horrified, worried, frightened, and had all
        kinds of emotions, which was very complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because during this period of time, many restricted areas and ancient
        sacred mountains had been led away by this Immortal, asking for a lot of
        good things, and those who refused to obey were destroyed by his palm.
      </p>
      <p>Their end was domineering and tyrannical.</p>
      <p>
        There were several ancient existences in those places, who had created
        several dark turmoils, making countless forces and creatures jealous.
      </p>
      <p>But they were also annihilated by this Immortal.</p>
      <p>
        Now that he brought this little girl to Immortal Lun Sect, was he trying
        to beat their Ancestors?
      </p>
      <p>
        This made them terrified and felt that their own mountain gate could not
        stop this Immortal at all.
      </p>
      <p>Unless their Ancestors were awakened.</p>
      <p>"What's the matter? Are you a little worried about my arrival?"</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge suddenly opened his mouth and asked with a
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't care about the disciples of the Immortal Lun Sect in front of
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was asking Yaoyao next to him, feeling that her little hands were a
        little cold at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>Of course this was a well-informed question.</p>
      <p>
        On the way, in fact, under his intentional inquiry, he also caught some
        disciples of Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>He did ask some news about Yaoyao's brother.</p>
      <p>Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>
        Today, his status in the Immortal Lun Sect was not trivial, not even the
        Holy Son and the Holy Maiden could compare with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was different from what Yaoyao had guessed, her brother was doing
        very well without encountering any troubles or difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for why he didn't choose to return home, to visit Yaoyao and her
        grandma.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>This reason was no longer important.</p>
      <p>Or maybe he forgot about them and didn’t want to share his wealth.</p>
      <p>Maybe he was too busy to find time…</p>
      <p>
        During this process, Gu Changge had already sensed that some Luck was
        disappearing from the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, and then
        gathered on him.
      </p>
      <p>The system's prompt also made him feel that his guess was correct.</p>
      <p>
        Under his various hints, Yaoyao was indeed a little disappointed in her
        elder brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Granny Yinhua, who had always known Jiang Yang, sighed, feeling
        that Jiang Yang had changed, and was a little disappointed in him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, do you think brother has forgotten Yaoyao and grandma?" Yaoyao
        asked Gu Changge softly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How could he forget you? He should be cultivating and couldn't find
        time to see you."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge touched her head with a gentle expression and said
        comfortingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, please stop comforting Yaoyao, brother would never be like this
        before, he has changed…"
      </p>
      <p>Yaoyao's voice was a little gloomy.</p>
      <p>
        Her grandma used to tell her that people were unpredictable, and no one
        knew what would happen over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared with the mortal world, the world of cultivation had too many
        temptations.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Gu Changge brought her to see all kinds of prosperity
        and magnificence, which made her yearn for them at a young age.
      </p>
      <p>
        She could understand that her brother would indulge in such bustling
        scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Yaoyao still hoped to see him with her own eyes and get an
        answer before she could leave with her Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Master had been with her for a long time, and Master could no longer be
        bothered by her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that the memory of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor has
        indeed awakened, otherwise it shouldn't be like this."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I thought I needed to plan things out, but I didn't expect it to be so
        simple."
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing Yaoyao's expression like this, Gu Changge couldn't help but burst
        into laughter, thinking so.
      </p>
      <p>But there was nothing unusual about his face.</p>
      <p>
        <strong><i>Boom!!</i></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><i>Boom!!</i></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, in the mountains ahead, divine lights rose to the sky, and
        several tyrannical auras began to converge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person in the lead was the current Holy Master Xian Lun, with a
        sturdy figure and a tyrannical aura, with many elders behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        His mighty and astonishing momentum, shocked everyone, as he came to
        greet Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"Greetings, Mr. Immortal!"</p>
      <p>
        "It's an honor for our clan to be visited by the Immortal in person!
        This is a great honor for our clan!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I hope you will be generous and will not take offense if we have been
        negligent!"
      </p>
      <p>"I just don't know what is the reason for your visit to our clan?"</p>
      <p>
        Before people arrived, there were respectful, flattering and pleasing
        voices resounding from far away.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crowd of Immortal Lun Sect outside, and many unknown cultivators
        stared at this scene in shock, completely unaware of what was happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, silver haired granny and Yaoyao were already familiar
        with this sight and were not surprised in the least.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, no matter where Gu Changge took them, it was
        always like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those local cultivators, no matter how honorable their status was, were
        close to falling to their knees to greet them personally.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's go, and meet that brother of yours."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge held Xiaoyao's small hand and waved his robe.</p>
      <p>
        The many runic formations in front of her disappeared from under her
        feet, leading her towards them.
      </p>
      <p>
        He did not care about the people of the Immortal Lun Sect in front of
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, as a Superior Immortal, he was not someone a cat or dog could
        take care of.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crowd of Immortal Lun Sect’s elders, looked at Gu Changge with
        sarcastic expressions, although it was in their territory, but no one
        dared to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>"I don't know if the Superior Immortal……"</p>
      <p>
        Immortal Lun Saint Lord was a Sacred Realm cultivator, he reacted after
        several changes, and went ahead to ask.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"This lord wants to see a person named Jiang Yang."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge swept a glance at him and spoke indifferently.</p>
      <p><i>Jiang Yang?</i></p>
      <p><i>How could it be Jiang Yang?</i></p>
      <p>
        <i
          >What was so strange about him? What was so strange about him that he
          had attracted this Immortal to personally call him by his name?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words, a group of Immortal Lun Holy Land elders, including the
        Holy Master of Immortal Lun Sect, their heads exploded and they all
        stared in shock.
      </p>
      <p>"This is the little girl we saw in that little village back then……"</p>
      <p>
        It was the Green Ghost who recognized Yaoyao, completely different from
        the appearance of the face full of mud and dirt, but her aura did not
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that this Superior Immortal came to the Immortal Lun Sect
        because of this little girl's matter?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I was really blind at first! I can't believe I didn't see that there
        was something odd about this little girl."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, the Green Ghost's eyes widened and he sighed in his
        heart for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of which, the disciple named Jiang Yang was this little girl's
        brother!
      </p>
      <p>
        How could he be so lucky, not only was he respected by a bunch of old
        antiques, but now his sister had met such a terrifying Immortal from the
        Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this relationship, wouldn't he be able to talk to this Immortal and
        even climb into a relationship?
      </p>
      <p>This made Green Ghost incomparably envious and jealous.</p>
      <p>
        And noticing the Green Ghost's expression, the Holy Master Immortal Lun
        Sect gave him a look with a movement in his expression. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew
        upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        The Green Ghost also understood and hurriedly informed the Immortal Lun
        Saint Lord about the origin of Jiang Yang and the Immortal in front of
        him through voice transmission.
      </p>
      <p>"There is still this relationship?"</p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Saint Lord was delighted to hear that the little girl
        beside Gu Changge actually had this relationship with Jiang Yang and was
        his sister.
      </p>
      <p>Was not this heaven's help to the Immortal Lun Sect?</p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Yang is now cultivating in the sect, he is very much valued by a
        group of old ancestors, whether it is qualification or talent, both are
        rare to find one in a hundred million years……"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I am afraid that in a few years, Jiang Yang will be able to succeed as
        the next Holy Master of the Immortal Lun Sect and lead the Immortal Lun
        Sect to glory."
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the Immortal Lun Saint Lord said respectfully and gave
        Gu Changge the lead, heading inside the mountain gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, he naturally had to find a way to say that Jiang Yang was
        doing very well in the Immortal Lun Sect, and his status was above ten
        thousand people.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the matter of throwing Jiang Yang to be a hard worker some time
        ago, he didn't even dare to mention it.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, is that so?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded with a calm expression, his eyes becoming deeper and
        deeper, so that no one could feel his joy or anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Yaoyao, who was on the side, was feeling that her Master, at this
        moment, seemed to be a little angry.
      </p>
      <p>This made her a little sad, and her mood suddenly turned bad.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao felt that her Master was a little angry at her brother's actions
        because he heard these words from the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although her brother didn't care about her and her grandma anymore, now,
        she had her Master to take care of her!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, the Superior Immortal has no idea, during this period of time
        Jiang Yang has invoked the shadow of our Immortal Lun Sect's Ancestor,
        which means that his talent has been recognized by the Ancestor."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Yang is so talented, how could we not see it? We will definitely
        use most of our resources on him……"
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this moment, Holy Master of the Immortal Lun Sect, who was still
        unaware of Gu Changge's thoughts, was still talking to himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mentioning how much better Jiang Yang was living in the Immortal Lun
        Sect nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, how could he know the purpose of Gu Changge for bringing
        Yaoyao here, and he subconsciously thought that Yaoyao was here to visit
        her brother.
      </p>
      <p>"It seems that Jiang Yang is living a good life."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded and said indifferently, although his face was calm at
        this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he was actually already laughing in his heart, he almost cast an
        appreciative glance at the Holy Master of Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was a smart guy as he was not even aware of the backlash of his
        words.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this wave of assistance really came just in time for Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>It also saved him the effort of sowing dissension.</p>
      <p>The first thing he had to do was to take care of one’s family.</p>
      <p>
        Her brother was doing so well in the Immortal Lun Sect, when he said
        that he would come back to visit her and his grandma.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Jiang Yang didn’t, instead he seemed to have forgotten and abandoned
        the two of them.
      </p>
      <p>This made her heart very sad.</p>
      <p>
        Now Holy Master's words were tantamount to sprinkling salt on the wound,
        further confirming her previous various speculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Gu Changge from time to time at the side with various words
        hint, pushing the wave.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 224-2: This assistance is really timely, Everyone is dumbfounded
        (2)
      </h4>
      <p>The fact that Yaoyao thought so was completely reasonable.</p>
      <p>
        "Then have you ever heard his sister's matter from Jiang Yang's mouth?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge looked at the Holy Master of the Immortal Lun
        Sect and asked with an inexplicable meaning at the corner of his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Holy Master Xian Lun froze at his words, and felt a chill by this
        look from Gu Changge, producing cold sweat, not understanding why Gu
        Changge suddenly asked such a question.
      </p>
      <p>He himself was not very clear about this kind of thing.</p>
      <p>The words he said just now were indeed true.</p>
      <p>
        But if this question was not answered properly, who knew what kind of
        consequences he would face?
      </p>
      <p>Before, he didn't even know there was a disciple named Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>
        The fact that Jiang Yang had a sister was something that he only knew
        about after the Green Ghost told him just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment, the Immortal Lun Sect's expression suddenly became a
        little grim, and he did not answer, afraid to say the wrong thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this scene of silence fell in the eyes of Yaoyao, so that her small
        face could not help but turn pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, this silence was the denial of the Holy Master of
        Immortal Lun Sect, her brother did not mention her sister in the
        Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>As for the reason?</p>
      <p>It was because he disliked her and her grandma's humble origins.</p>
      <p>
        "Ding, the status of her brother in the heart of Yaoyao has declined,
        Jiang Yang, the Son of Reincarnation’s Luck, has suffered damage to his
        Luck points, you gained six thousand :uck points and thirty thousand
        Destiny value."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, rift between loved ones widened, Son of Luck’s Reincarnation,
        Jiang Yang suffered Luck damage, you gained five hundred Luck points,
        two thousand five hundred Destiny value."
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this time, with the system's prompting voice, Gu Changge’s eyes
        could not help but narrow slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reaction of the Holy Master of Immortal Lun Sect was within his
        expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This large amount of Luck points and Destiny value coming in made him
        think that the key was really in Yaoyao and Granny Yinhua.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, both of them were Jiang Yang's relatives and had
        extraordinary significance to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially, the young girl herself, was a supreme existence in a sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of thing was too mysterious, no one could say exactly what it
        was.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was possible that one day, after the young girl would suddenly
        awaken, she could instantly reach her peak power.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves that the Peach Village in the land of Immortal Abandonment,
        the Peach Tree definitely had some kind of problem.
      </p>
      <p>But its cultivation was still astounding.</p>
      <p>This showed how terrifying it was at its peak.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt that the strength of that Peach Tree probably exceeded
        that of a True Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the trust that Yaoyao had in him now, and Gu Xian'er's current
        attitude…… The possibility of that Peach Tree getting used by him was
        high.
      </p>
      <p>
        "From the set up, Jiang Yang should have some unspeakable secret,
        otherwise he would not let his loved ones be in danger…… It’s just that
        he can’t let Yaoyao know about this unspeakable secret."
      </p>
      <p>
        "First there was a misunderstanding, and then the misunderstanding was
        solved, so it became even more troublesome."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But since it's a misunderstanding, it's good to let the
        misunderstanding go on. She doesn't need to know this either."
      </p>
      <p>For a moment, Gu Changge's eyes became deep.</p>
      <p>
        But on the other hand, this reincarnation body of the Human Ancestor as
        a leek was really fat.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of Luck points alone, it had already surpassed any Son of Luck
        Gu Changge had encountered in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        After harvesting from the reincarnation body of the Human Ancestor, he
        could start to consider the matter of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Destiny value could be omnipotent, and he could completely
        rely on it to refine the Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Devouring Demon Technique, under the Absolute Heavenly
        Extinction, could also play a role in counteracting the effect of
        resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, the news of Gu Changge's descent into the Immortal Lun Sect
        soon spread sensationally from this side of the mountain gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        After hearing that he called out Jiang Yang, many elders immediately
        turned into lapdogs and rushed to Jiang Yang’s cultivation place, to
        bring him.

      </div>
      <p>
        At this time, who cared about Jiang Yang’s cultivation talent, in the
        Immortal Lun Sect. status was the most important.
      </p>
      <p>Since the Supreme Immortal wanted to see him.</p>
      <p>That was his honor, so he must be brought immediately!</p>
      <p>
        Inside the main hall, Gu Changge was sitting at the top place, sipping
        tea, looking calm.
      </p>
      <p>Next to him, Yaoyao looked very uneasy and nervous.</p>
      <p>
        The people below the Immortal Lun Hall were even more nervous and
        anxious than Yaoyao, and their backs were wet with cold sweat!
      </p>
      <p>At this time, they clearly felt that the atmosphere was not right.</p>
      <p>
        Holy Master Xian Lun's expression was also a little pale, feeling that
        this Jiang Yang would not bring a scourge, right?
      </p>
      <p>…….</p>
      <p>
        Deep in the Immortal Lun Sect, in a cave, the divine light was
        flickering, the aura was rushing like a tide, the mantle of light were
        flowing like water.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle, a clean-cut young man was sitting on his knees, his face
        was very calm, he looked very bland, and was here to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>Many visions emerged and manifested at his dantian.</p>
      <p>
        Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, True
        Phoenix…… All kinds of terrifying beasts, like guards, were floating
        around him, emitting ear-splitting roars that were terrifying and
        amazing.
      </p>
      <p>Hoo hoo hoo!!!</p>
      <p>As he breathed a horrifying vision appeared above his head.</p>
      <p>
        The stars of the heavens, the universe, in the middle of a magnificent
        figure, bowing and worshiping, emitting a sacrificial sound.
      </p>
      <p>The grand and ancient world’s sound resounded around the cave!</p>
      <p>If someone was here, they would be stunned by this vision.</p>
      <p>The youth himself, however, appeared indifferent.</p>
      <p>
        At the entrance of the cave, a beautiful woman dressed in a palace
        costume was staring closely at him, letting out a sound of admiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        "As expected of a Desolate Holy Body that has unlocked the curse, this
        kind of vision is truly amazing."
      </p>
      <p>
        The beautiful woman in the palace dress was none other than Zhao Yi, the
        current Supreme Elder of the Immortal Lun Sect, who had the cultivation
        of the Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she looked very young, she was actually already an existence
        from a very ancient generation.
      </p>
      <p>She was the current protector of Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>
        After all, its natural talent alarmed the Ancestor’s shadow, and was
        worthy of such treatment by their group from the older generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future of the Immortal Lun Sect depended on the Jiang Yang in front
        of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        And hearing Zhao Yi's words, Jiang Yang himself still looked calm and
        unconcerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, he said with a slight sigh, "In a full month, the
        cultivation level only reached the Divine realm, this speed is still too
        slow."
      </p>
      <p>
        The corners of Zhao Yi's mouth could not help but twitch, feeling that
        his words were meant to hit people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crossing several realms in a month, this kind of record, except for
        Jiang Yang, she had never heard of.
      </p>
      <p>This was a monster, who could not be measured by common sense.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang looked at Zhao Yi in front of him and said, "These resources
        are not enough, I want to break through to the Conferred King realm
        within half a year, it's still far from that."
      </p>
      <p>Half a year to break through the Conferred King Realm?</p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi's expression stiffened again, how could he really say these
        words so naturally. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
      </p>
      <p>Divine power, Great power, Holy Lord, Conferred King.</p>
      <p>Between these realms, the later ones were the more difficult.</p>
      <p>
        Let alone half a year, even if he had another three years, it was
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        But considering the Jiang Yang in front of her, whose talent was truly
        terrifying, she also nodded her head in faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking that she was a tai-senpai, in front of Jiang Yang, a young
        disciple, she was unable to lift her head and could not help but be
        suppressed by him.
      </p>
      <p>Who was the junior in the end?</p>
      <p>In this regard, she was also confused, and felt very inexplicable.</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang had an aura that made people couldn't help but submit to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's really confusing to see, this is really a mysterious guy." Zhao Yi
        shook her head.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang did not take Zhao Yi's opinion seriously.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he closed his eyes again and put his mind on
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, in his mind, he said indifferently, "See? This is all
        you can get after you accept me."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Do you still want to go back to that gloomy place to continue to be a
        hard digger?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Another voice with resignation and stubbornness sounded out, "You are
        you, I am me, we are different, there is no way I can accept you!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Young people can be really stubborn, did you forget who was the one who
        couldn't hold on and finally gave in to me at that time. If it wasn't
        for me, at that time you would have been eroded by that ominous aura,
        how would you still be alive right now?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression was bland, as if he did not care about anything.
      </p>
      <p>After he took over his body, how could a mere ominousness stop him?</p>
      <p>
        He was the Human Ancestor who was worshiped by millions of living
        beings, and his faith was spread in every world.
      </p>
      <p>His believers were infinite like the mud and sand of the galaxy.</p>
      <p>
        At that time, by using a little means to change the direction of the
        terrain, causing a conflict between the dragon veins, it instantly broke
        the Immortal Lun Sect’s Road to Immortality, so that their plans to
        raise the religion to ascend to the top were all in vain.
      </p>
      <p>And the Immortal Lun Sect was still unaware of this.</p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, he showed strong talent, borrowed special means, attracted
        a shadow of the Ancestor of the Immortal Lun Sect, and his status rose
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without him, the original Jiang Yang was now estimated to be dead,
        exhausted alive on the Road to Immortality.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was magnanimous, unwilling to take action to erase his True Spirit,
        which was left until now, waiting for it to figure it all out, and self
        disperse.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original Jiang Yang's consciousness, could stay until now, of
        course, there was part of the reason, because it involved him after the
        reincarnation mark of all lives to one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just when Jiang Yang's mind was deep in thought, a voice came from
        outside the cave, causing him to frown.
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Yang! Come out quickly!"</p>
      <p>"Did you hear that?"</p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Yang, the Supreme Immortal wants to see you, hurry up and come
        out, don't neglect the Supreme Immortal!"
      </p>
      <p>
        With a divine light, one elder rushed here, and shouted by voice
        transmission into the cave.
      </p>
      <p>"The Supreme immortal?!"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, Zhao Yi's expression changed slightly and she
        reacted immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Supreme Elder of the Immortal Lun Sect, she naturally knew about
        that Supreme Immortal who had been making a lot of noise in the Heavenly
        Domain during this period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did he come to the Immortal Lun Sect and even called Jiang Yang?
      </p>
      <p>"The Supreme Immortal?"</p>
      <p>"Is it finally here?"</p>
      <p>And at that moment, Jiang Yang's reaction shocked her even more.</p>
      <p>
        It was as if he had already known about it, his expression was bland and
        calm, and there was even a smile at the corner of his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene made Zhao Yi's eyes glaze over, why did Jiang Yang know? What
        exactly was his origin?
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, Jiang Yang took the initiative to get up and walked
        towards the outside of the cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the group of elders in front of him, he said indifferently,
        "Go tell that so-called Superior Immortal to come over and say that I am
        waiting for him here, and for the onlookers, don't come."
      </p>
      <p>"What?!"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Jiang Yang's bland and confident words, the elders were all
        dumbfounded and couldn't believe their ears.
      </p>
      <p><i>Let the immortal come by himself?</i></p>
      <p><i>And wait for him?</i></p>
      <p><i>Did they hear it right?</i></p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Is this Jiang Yang's brain probably dumbed down during this period of
          cultivation?</i

      <h4>
        Chapter 258-1: This Gu will accept your origin, As if he was going to
        seek justice (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "Prince Ying is so cruel! I have never offended him, but he still wants
        to kill me like this!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Qilin Clan's Young Master‚Äôs expression was extremely difficult to see,
        and he couldn't help shouting again, trying to transmit the voice to a
        far away area. But the other two Great Sacred Realm existences had very
        cold eyes, and they shot, directly isolating his voice in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Prince Ying? You think too much, he is not the master behind us." A
        black figure smiled coldly and did not admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "At this time, what else do you want to quibble about? Do you think I
        won't know if you don't admit it?" Qilin Clan's Young Master‚Äôs eyes were
        extremely cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then they saw that the place between his eyebrows started to shine with
        bright brilliance, and there were multicolored lights intertwining as if
        an ancient god was about to appear.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        His aura was changing rapidly, as if there was an invincible existence
        emerging behind him. It was an unparalleled Demon Emperor, very vague,
        accompanied by the sound of footsteps, arriving from a long lost period
        of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The light in it‚Äôs eyes penetrated the sky and the earth, shattering the
        universe. Seeing this scene, Qilin Clan's Young Master‚Äôs remaining
        followers suddenly cheered and felt hope.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master still has the means!"</p>
      <p>"We still have a chance!"</p>
      <p>"Fight them!"</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, they took another shot, unleashing another divine
        weapon, intending to explode themselves, in order to create an
        opportunity for their Young Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Demon Umbrella covered the sky, the splendid war whip that
        was several miles long, the Heaven-shattering Seal like a mountain, the
        blood-colored Giant Sword that ripped apart the sky‚Ä¶ all of them were
        dazzling.
      </p>
      <p>Murderous and wild, igniting and trying to self-destruct.</p>
      <p>"Is this the Qilin Demon Emperor's life-saving means?"</p>
      <p>
        In the dark shadow's eyes existed a coldness, as if he had expected it
        long ago, "Thanks to the master for giving me this thing!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The black big palm print pushed the boundless sideways, pressing down on
        the many divine soldiers in front, not afraid of its self-destructing
        power. The strength of this group of followers was only at the level of
        True God and Heavenly God Realm. In front of the Great Sacred Realm
        existences, they were indeed no different from ants.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, the other two Great Sacred Realm existences shot again,
        and the Dao flower bloomed between their eyebrows with the black light
        fell from it, faintly turning into a treasure bottle that floated up and
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that this Dao bottle did not really exist. Instead, it was
        made of runes!
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, with the three Great Sacred Realm existences taking
        action together, the phantom of the Dao bottle suddenly appeared, that
        was terrifying as if it was covering the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside it was like a star hanging down, and the wisps of Dao were
        intertwined, like a black hole, devouring everything!
      </p>
      <p>"This‚Ä¶ this is‚Ä¶" UppTodatùíÜd frùíêm n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m</p>
      <p>"Great Dao treasure bottle‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        The Qilin Clan's Young Master‚Äôs face changed color and he recognized the
        figure floating in the void of the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, the Demon Emperor phantom behind him stepped forward,
        surging, taking the initiative to attack, and fighting the Dao treasure
        bottle in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, a peerless and terrifying fluctuation broke out. The divine light
        filled the sky, causing all the peaks to tremble as if they were about
        to crack.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of terrifying power, motivated by the three Great Sacred Realm
        existences together, could even slaughter a Quasi-Supreme existence!
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, this phantom was not real and had no subsequent support.
        Although it was absolutely powerful, it quickly became blurred and
        wanted to dissipate.
      </p>
      <p>"Boom‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Qilin Clan's Young Master spurted blood, and his complexion suddenly
        paled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then something came to his mind, and he made his decision! He urged the
        secret technique, knowing that life and death in this battle were
        unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
        A message was burned by his bloodline and left behind by a secret
        method. As long as there was a strong member of the Qilin Clan, he would
        definitely be able to detect it!
      </p>
      <p>"Murderer, Prince Ying!"</p>
      <p>
        At the position between his eyebrows, there was the aura of a divine
        weapon to revive. It was a small golden cauldron that was floating in
        his vast sea of ??consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>The Primordial God in it also suddenly became extremely terrifying.</p>
      <p>But at this moment!</p>
      <p>
        There were strange fluctuations between heaven and earth, as if someone
        was walking in time and space, and the sound of footsteps resounded in
        the heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately after, there were crystal petals blooming in the virtual
        space.
      </p>
      <p>Boo boo‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        The dark fairy flower took root in the void, and then penetrated many
        creatures below, and seemed to use it as nourishment to grow.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Puff!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Qilin Clan's Young Master felt a tingling pain between his brows as if
        it was being penetrated by a peerless immortal sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        His expression suddenly changed, and at the end of his line of sight, a
        vague figure appeared in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opponent's fingers were close together like swords, like ancient
        immortal swords, they seemed to fall from the vast universe in a trance,
        killing him all at once!
      </p>
      <p>"How is this possible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"How could it be you‚Ä¶ Gu‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Qilin Clan's Young Master‚Äôs voice trembled, and his soul almost froze.
        His expression became horrified, unbelievable, frightened, and even
        desperate! He never imagined that‚Ä¶ all of this was not arranged by
        Prince Ying.
      </p>
      <p>
        From beginning to end, Prince Ying was just the one who took the blame.
        The biggest mastermind, the person who played everyone in the world in
        the palm of his hand, turned out to be Gu Changge!
      </p>
      <p>
        This made him tremble, and he felt fear for the first time in his life.
        Even in the face of death, he could be remain calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        But‚Ä¶ at this time, fear emerged from the depth of his soul. Gu Changge
        looked at him with a calm expression, without the slightest disturbance.
        Then, he nodded slightly.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Qilin has a good way. This Gu will accept your origin."</p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, the terrifying black light fell, like the endless
        starlight, and instantly drowned the figure of Qilin Clan's Young
        Master.
      </p>
      <p>"Greetings, master!"</p>
      <p>"Greetings, master!"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing Gu Changge appear, the three Great Sacred Realm figures who had
        ended the battle fell one after another and said respectfully behind
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were all puppets left to Ye Ling by the Heavenly Lord of
        Reincarnation. It was just that now, they had been re-enhanced by Gu
        Changge and had become his demonic puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge closed his eyes slightly and did not speak. Qilin Clan's
        Young Master‚Äôs talent was indeed unique, seeking good luck and avoiding
        evil, predicting the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that his strength had not reached the point where he could
        predict the future. Otherwise, it would be impossible for Gu Changge to
        kill him so easily.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's go."</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge felt that the Great Dao treasure bottle had
        digested it, and only then did he open his eyes, and there was a sense
        of darkness in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pursuing good fortune and avoiding evil was of little use to him. What
        he valued was predicting the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he had also studied and cultivated the power of time, and the
        power of reincarnation involved years and time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to predict the future was even more powerful for him. Though
        with his current strength, he couldn't reach it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge estimated that it would be possible after he breaks through
        to the level of the Great Sacred Realm. He then moved to find the second
        target on the list that was now in the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        A young king of the Endless Fire Kingdom who had been sealed until now.
        Yan Ying was a mid-Quasi-Sacred realm cultivator with the talent of
        devouring fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge mainly wanted to know what the differences were between his
        fire-devouring talent and his forbidden demon technique. In the blink of
        an eye, several days passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vast Heavenly Extinction battlefield was calm and quiet, and nothing
        big happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past few days, there had been several other places where Heavenly
        Extinction battlefields had been discovered, and many young existences
        from the outside world had rushed in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young existences from far away places also rushed to come here, even
        Yue Mingkong also rushed to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Extinction battlefield she eventually went to was not the
        one where Gu Changge was. During this period, the entire Southern Heaven
        became more and more lively.
      </p>
      <p>In the Outer Realm.</p>
      <p>
        Inside a pavilion, a group of living beings with frightened faces and
        trembling souls, crouched on the ground, their backs all wet with cold
        sweat, not even daring to raise their heads.
      </p>
      <p>"The young master's soul lamp has been extinguished."</p>
      <p>"All of us are going to be finished!"</p>
      <p>
        In front of them was an old man with a clear face, but the old man's
        expression, however, was gloomy, ugly, and angry to the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was even fear, uneasiness, and panic. He was the protector of the
        Qilin Clan's Young Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        He did not follow him into the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield because
        the True Immortal Academy had a rule that the points earned must be
        based on their own strength. That was why he chose to wait outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he did not wait for the Qilin Clan's Young Master but waited for the
        news of the Qilin Clan's Young Master‚Äôs death from the clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was like a thunderbolt that directly exploded in his head, so he
        was shocked and frozen for half a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why would the Young Master, who had all kinds of life-preserving means,
        die in the Heavenly Extinction battlefield?
      </p>
      <p>"Something big has happened!"</p>
      <p>
        "No matter what the reason is, I can hardly be blamed, and neither can
        you guys."
      </p>
      <p>
        "At this time, I hope that the young lord encountered the dangers of the
        Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, and not being assassinated ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man with a clear face was iron blue, with a horrible aura that
        simply wanted to overturn this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, he disregarded the rules of the True Immortal Academy and forcibly
        broke into the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        The news of Qilin Clan's Young Master‚Äôs death was no longer concealed,
        like a shocking wave, causing an earthquake-like horrific stir in the
        Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, and even in the Southern Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this news.</p>
      <p>
        Countless cultivators were shocked and horrified, from head to toe were
        cold through, and their souls almost froze.
      </p>
      <p>
        Qilin Clan's Young Master‚Äôs was a famous ancient freak, many people even
        thought that it was qualified to compete with Gu Changge and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, he had fallen in the Heavenly Extinction battlefield. The
        sensation caused by this matter was too terrible!
      </p>
      <p>
        In an instant, countless speculations rose in all directions. Many young
        existences who had already entered the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield
        were even more uneasy and terrified.
      </p>
      <p>"The murderer, Prince Ying!"</p>
      <p>
        And soon, the protector of the Qilin Clan's Young Master led the way to
        the area where the great battle had occurred in the first place.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 258-2: This Gu will accept your origin, As if he was going to
        seek justice (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Here, he perceived the fluctuation of the secret technique left by his
        Young Master. This was a secret technique that only the Qilin clan could
        perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than him, no one else could perceive it. So in this instant, the
        face of that old man suddenly became incomparably iron blue and angry,
        and his eyes were glowing red.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Heavenly Emperor Mountain, daring to kill my young master, this revenge
        will never be spared!"
      </p>
      <p>
        With his angry hiss, horrendous fluctuations roared in all directions,
        and even the few oldies who had followed him chose to remain silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't the work of Prince Ying. Why would Young Master leave such
        a message at the end? About the secret arts of the Qilin clan they had
        not understood, but it was also clear if there was no evidence, the
        protector, would not say this.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he couldn't be that stupid to offend the Heavenly Emperor
        Mountain. Even if the Qilin Clan was strong, but in front of the
        Heavenly Emperor Mountain, it was ultimately several levels weaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, many strong people moved out to detect the aura. But they
        found that the other side was very careful and cautious, they already
        removed all of the remaining aura, so that they could not detect
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it seemed that they also did not expect that Qilin Clan‚Äôs Young
        Master would leave such a sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, this matter immediately stirred up the whole Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield, causing everyone to be shocked, appalled,
        uneasy, and frightened.
      </p>
      <p>Prince Ying!</p>
      <p>
        Today's biggest suspected inheritor of Demonic art. Most likely‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ He was
        the one who killed the Qilin Clan‚Äôs Young Master!
      </p>
      <p>
        According to all the signs, the possibility was indeed high that he made
        a move to kill the Qilin Clan‚Äôs Young Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, many people associated with the other day when Prince Ying lost
        in humiliation at the hands of the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall,
        could it be that he was really showing weakness at that time?
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, it was only to let the crowd down their guard, so as to
        secretly strike. And then within a few days, the second major event
        happened again, causing a sensation no different from the fall of the
        Qilin Clan‚Äôs Young Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ancient young king of the Endless Fire Kingdom, Yan Ying, also fell
        in the Heavenly Extinction battlefield. His death was almost identical
        to that of the Qilin.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that there was not any evidence left on the battlefield to
        prove who did it. These two events were like earthquakes, that almost
        turned the entire Heavenly Extinction battlefield upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stir that was created caused countless people to be horrified and
        frightened. Many young existences who had entered the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield felt uneasy and everyone was in danger, no one
        knew if they would be the next target.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How did he dare to strike so openly? Does he really think that the sky
        is seamless?"
      </p>
      <p>"Or is he not afraid of getting exposed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ at all?"</p>
      <p>
        At a mountain range. Ye Langtian, Ye Liuli, Wang Wushuang, Chi Ling, and
        the others were silent, and their hearts trembling with fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The news in the past few days had really shocked and disturbed them.
      </p>
      <p>
        They had always felt that Ying Shuang was the biggest suspect of the
        inheritor of demonic art, and now that such a big event had happened in
        the Heavenly Extinction battlefield, it could be said that it was
        inextricably linked to him.
      </p>
      <p>What will be the attitude of Ying Shuang this time?</p>
      <p>
        Would he continue to disguise? Or would he tear the mask and declare war
        on the world?
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>This made them tremble and uneasy.</p>
      <p>
        Although the fallen ones were two Ancient freaks, but no one was sure
        that the next one would not be them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Moreover, apart from Ying Shuang, there is another inheritor of demonic
        art‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Ye Langtian was even more uneasy.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        "You claim that it is related to me, but have you ever seen me strike,
        these days I have been with my sister, almost every inch of the way."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Where did you get the evidence that I killed Qilin Clan‚Äôs Young
        Master?"
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this time, in a deserted plain. UppTodatùíÜd frùíêm
        n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
      </p>
      <p>
        The group from Heavenly Emperor Mountain was trying to kill the Heavenly
        Extinction beings for the True Immortal Academy quota was being stopped
        by that protector from the Qilin Clan, as well as many beings of the
        Qilin Clan, coming aggressively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang stood in front of the old protector and asked with a calm
        expression, not seeing any stage fright at all. He did not know why
        somehow the blame was put on his head, and the other side still took the
        bait that he killed the Qilin Clan‚Äôs Young Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had also heard about the two major events that happened recently in
        the Heavenly Extinction battlefield. But he really did not expect the
        Qilin clan would be so sure that he killed their Young Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, although Ying Shuang was very uneasy, but he also understood
        that at this moment he could not show the slightest flaw. Otherwise,
        this blame would be firmly placed on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        So he argued, after all, Ying Yu and others could give his testimony
        that he did not leave them half a step. At this time, where would he get
        the time and opportunity to kill Qilin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention whether he had that strength, even the time was not
        right. This was the first time he saw that someone was framing him,
        which made Ying Shuang‚Äôs heart suffocate with anger, but there was
        nothing he could do.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hehe, I know you won't admit it. That's why you're so calm and
        fearless, right?"
      </p>
      <p>The old man Qing sneered and became even angrier.</p>
      <p>
        In his opinion, Ying Shuang's attitude was that he was not worried at
        all. He felt that they couldn't come up with evidence, so he had
        confidence and did not panic at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you want to frame me like this, you better come up with evidence.
        I've been with my people from Emperor Mountain all this time, who saw me
        make a move? You can ask the people behind me!"
      </p>
      <p>Ying Shuang frowned, trying to keep his composure.</p>
      <p>
        But at this time, even Ying Yu and the others behind him changed their
        expressions, contacting what Gu Changge said some time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang's move was to drag the entire Emperor Mountain into his
        muddy water. Therefore, even Ying Yu and the others chose to remain
        silent, and beware of Ying Shuang in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, what happened last time at the Ancient Immortal Gu Family
        showed that Ying Shuang had other means. He could send someone else to
        do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, even if he didn't do it himself, he still had other options. That
        was why he was so fearless and so calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't think that with the Emperor Mountain behind you and your father
        being Emperor Ying, so you can do whatever you want. Let me tell you, as
        the inheritor of demonic arts, you will soon become enemies of the
        world!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man Qing was incomparably cold, and he had already torn his face
        with Ying Shuang, so he almost took it down without making a move.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        At this time, Ying Shuang's expression changed slightly, and he suddenly
        felt that something was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people of Emperor Mountain behind him were also suspicious of him?
        How could that be? He obviously didn't do anything!
      </p>
      <p>
        "I‚Äôll suppress you today, bring you back to my Qilin family, and wait
        for the verdict! To give justice to my young master."
      </p>
      <p>
        After the old man Qing said this, his eyes were cold, and he suddenly
        shot at Ying Shuang, and the cultivation of the Great Sacred Realm broke
        out, and he wanted to suppress him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang's expression changed, and at this time he felt this
        terrifying oppression. In his sea of ????knowledge, the divine soul
        weapon that had never changed suddenly appeared bright.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying atmosphere suddenly burst out here! This was a force that
        transcended the Sacred Realm, and it was like a supreme being reviving,
        trying to break through everything.
      </p>
      <p>"How come‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"This is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        This scene made the expression of the old man Qing change dramatically,
        which was a bit unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        He felt that the Luck point of Ying Shuang was decaying again in the
        form of an avalanche. Gu Changge, who had disappeared for a while, under
        the attention of many monks, appeared at the entrance of the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>The smile on the corner of his mouth was somewhat intriguing.</p>
      <p>"When I was away, something really big seemed to happen."</p>
      <p>
        And hearing his almost murmuring words. A proud woman suddenly summoned
        up her courage and came to him with a flushed face, and was very
        nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
        She stammered and trembled, "Young Master Changge, something really
        happened during this time‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, she repeated what happened during this time and informed Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, Gu Changge was an existence who had fought against the
        inheritor of demonic arts and severely damaged him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only he could make people feel at ease. Gu Changge listened with a
        slight smile on his face, then his expression gradually became solemn,
        and in the end, he sighed slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother Qilin‚Ä¶ Yan Ying, I have heard about of both of them. I thought
        they were rivals, and I thought I would have a chance to compete with
        them in the future."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I didn't expect to hear such bad news. Thank you for letting me know."
      </p>
      <p>Then, he shook his head, took one step, and disappeared from here.</p>
      <p>
        "Young Master Changge is really as gentle as jade, humble and polite as
        rumored‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "His strength is obviously much stronger than Qilin Clan‚Äôs Young Master
        and Yan Ying, but he still said that."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Young Master Changge is back to the Heavenly Extinction battlefield,
        and the inheritors of demonic art should be afraid and would probably
        stop for a while‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        This beautiful girl watched Gu Changge go away, and her eyes couldn't
        help showing admiration. Many young people around her were envious and
        admired her for daring to take the initiative to talk to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn't have the guts. Soon after, the news of Gu Changge's
        reappearance on the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield spread.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the younger generations couldn't help but be overjoyed and
        heaved a sigh of relief as if they had found an invincible backing. Gu
        Changge first summoned his followers before heading for the area where
        Ying Shuang was located.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the eyes of many people, he seemed to be seeking justice for the
        fallen two Ancient freaks!

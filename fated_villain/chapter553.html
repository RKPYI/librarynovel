          open? For real?” Upon hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s words, everyone
          present couldn&#8217;t help but look over in shock. Even the nearby
          cultivators who were inspecting the other remaining Divine Rocks

          Chen earlier. Being an extremely rare Divine Source Master, Jiang Chen
          could be considered a prominent figure right now. It was hard to find
          anyone that didn’t know who he was.</span

          >Moments ago, Jiang Chen won the favor of several Elders by helping
          them extract Longevity Herbs from different stones. However, when the
          offended old man arrived on the scene, everyone’s response was the
          same. They chose to remain silent and ignore the situation, even
          though they were all keeping a watchful eye from a distance.</span

          rapidly throughout the surrounding area, causing a great stir. The
          Immortal Foetus was well-known as the most valuable of the Seven
          Divine Rocks, and everyone knew that no one could afford to cut
          it.</span

          in excitement after hearing the news. They were all convinced that Gu
          Changge was not joking about it.

          Crystals. We Maybe we’ll be lucky enough to feast our eyes upon the
          treasure in the Divine Rock!” The Phoenix Lady&#8217;s charming face
          was filled with uncertainty as she whispered, “That Divine Source
          Master doesn’t seem like someone who has Immortal Crystals.”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Only very few individuals could capture the attention of a prideful
          woman like her, and Gu Changge was one of them. When Jiang Chen
          expressed his desire to cut the Divine Rock, she furrowed her brow,
          thinking to herself that this person had too much confidence in
          himself.</span

          really be lucky enough to get a glimpse of what is inside the Immortal
          Foetus today, thanks to him.” Princess Yu Feiya gazed intently at Gu
          Changge with her beautiful eyes.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The princess stood tall and slender, with skin as flawless as
          crystal. Her presence exuded a regal aura, and her every movement
          exuded grace and refinement. She was completely fixated on Gu
          Changge&#8217;s figure, breaking the hearts of many young men who had
          been admiring her from a distance.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I’m pretty confident that Young Master Gu has enough. Rumor has it
          that he not only deprived the Purple Mansion of its resources, but
          also stripped the ancient clans of their most valuable resources
          during his time at the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.” The King
          with Six Crowns could barely hide the envy in his voice. Despite their
          considerable wealth, they were less than beggars when compared to Gu
          Changge.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Are you truly serious about this, Young Master Changge?” The old man
          was equally taken aback upon hearing the remarks from those around
          him. To him, Jiang Chen and Gu Changge were not even in the same
          league. Even describing the difference between the two as heaven and
          earth, would still be an insult to Gu Changge.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Someone like Jiang Chen was unworthy of cutting the Immortal Foetus,
          as he likely had never even laid eyes on an Immortal Crystal. Even if
          he was a Divine Source Master, he was no more than a regular
          cultivator in the eyes of a True Daoist like him. However, should
          someone of Gu Changge’s caliber expressed his interest to cut the
          Immortal Foetus open, he would have to take his request
          seriously.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Absolutely. Do you think I am joking around, Senior? The Immortal
          Foetus isn’t something to be handled by just anyone,” Gu Changge
          replied calmly with a small smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The old man cast a brief glance toward Jiang Chen before smiling and
          agreeing, “You are absolutely right about that, Young Master
          Changge.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The underlying meaning behind their conversation was evident to
          everyone, and Jiang Chen was immediately met with looks of mockery and
          amusement.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*BOOM!!* Waves of terrifying aura fluctuations swept over from the
          skies. Ancient beings arrived on the scene, their dignified
          countenances obscured by the Chaos Qi that shrouded them. Many among
          them were those who had established the Heaven Dao Oath, committing
          themselves to its unbreakable principles.</span

          >&#8220;Can Gu Changge really offer up that many Immortal Crystals…?”
          Jiang Chen&#8217;s face turned sour as he felt a burning heat rise to
          his cheeks. The sting of humiliation was palpable, as if he had been
          slapped in the face in front of everyone.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >One of the ancient beings solemnly said, &#8220;Young Master Changge,
          when we established the Heaven Dao Oath, we have determined that the
          Immortal Foetus holds a value of a hundred Immortal Crystals. Offer
          them up and the divine rock shall be yours.” Despite being a True
          Daoist, he humbly conversed with Gu Changge as if they were equals and
          refrained from displaying any arrogance.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gasps were heard all around as everyone’s anticipation turned into
          shock. All their faces contorted in disbelief. Elders, Sect Masters,
          and others who were very familiar with Immortal Crystals felt their
          scalps go numb as their eyes widened in surprise when they heard the
          price. They had truly underestimated the value of the Immortal Foetus,
          assuming that its value would be no more than ten Immortal
          Crystals.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The price of a hundred Immortal Crystals was exorbitant and beyond
          what anyone could imagine. Collecting a hundred Immortal Crystals in
          the Upper Realm was an unimaginably difficult task. No Force could
          confidently claim that they could gather that amount.</span

          of the An Clan, An Wangshan, appeared behind An Xi and her companions,
          his face twitching in surprise.</span

          worth?” An Xi, Jiang Chen, and the others looked clueless. Judging
          from the pale faces of the prominent figures around them, they could
          tell that it must be a significant amount.</span

          I even cherished it as a treasure. Thanks to it, I was able to break
          through to the Intermediate Nirvana Realm because it contained traces
          of Immortality.”</span

          stared at Gu Changge with bloodshot eyes. He gritted his teeth and
          clenched his fists in frustration. For the sake of acquiring a few
          cultivation resources, he had the blood of countless people on his
          hands and even nearly lost his life on a few occasions. Yet, he still
          had no idea what an Immortal Crystal looked like.</span

          one hundred Immortal Crystals and maintained his air of superiority.
          This made Jiang Chen feel even more frustrated, as he was reminded of
          Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s determination to leave him back then.</span

          his chest like an invisible mountain and making it difficult for him

      <h4>
        Chapter 153: Sowing Discord In Exchange For My Life; I Thought Master
        Didn’t Want Me Anymore.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The bones above the Tanliang Gai[1] underwent a complex transformation
        at once, turning translucent as they became enshrouded with an aura
        similar to that of a True Immortal!
      </p>
      <p>[1. A part of the skull.]</p>
      <p>
        One could even feel the terrifying and radiant haze of light and blood,
        like a mighty dragon, a surging sun that could shatter the very heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt that his essence had been refined and improved many
        times over what it was before.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of strength alone, it gave off a great impression. Even if the
        universe had collapsed, he alone would be left standing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was precisely the benefit that comes from the Transcendent Bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of enhancement was comprehensive, but the position of the
        cranium is where the Sea of Consciousness is located, where the
        Primordial Spirit resides.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he felt a vague metamorphosis take place in his Innate
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transforming… from a deity to an immortal, the power of the Primordial
        Spirit took on a nine-coloured glazed hue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only that, but his spine, his bones, his hands, and even his legs
        underwent similar mysterious transformations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spine resembled a magnificent Dragon, piercing through the four
        limbs as the drop of rainbow-coloured True Dragon Blood began to
        resonate with it, emitting a dragon roar that shook the sky!
      </p>
      <p>“What a good way to spend money!”</p>
      <p>Gu Changge opened his eyes and spoke with satisfaction.</p>
      <p>
        He intuitively sensed his strength growing several times over what it
        was.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was able to see all the various rules and mysteries of both Heaven
        and Earth with great clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the palm of his outstretched hand, hundreds of thousands of Dao laws
        congealed, linking into an endless chain. Seamless and perfect, to the
        point where it formed a blade made purely from the natural law and order
        of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I could already slaughter Quasi-Sacred Realm cultivators within mere
        seconds before this. But now, it seems that most average Sacred Realm
        Cultivators will also easily perish by my hand.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If I were to breakthrough from the God King Realm to the Quasi-sacred
        Realm, then I might even be able to compete with Great Sacred Realm
        cultivators ‘
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s claims were not without reason. His ability to control the
        Dao Law and his ability to utilise the Rules were superb, possibly
        unmatched by most Sacred and Great Sacred Realm existences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among all the major clans and even the major sects, those in the Sage
        Realm were considered to be ancient monsters, demons of the oldest
        generations.
      </p>
      <p>Peers? What even was that?</p>
      <p>It was impossible for them to even grasp his shadow.</p>
      <p>
        ‘With such a variable as myself, I am afraid that the Heavenly Dao will
        ensure that future Favoured Sons of Heaven will become even more
        powerful. That’s fine with me though. After all, they are nothing but
        leeks waiting to be harvested.’
      </p>
      <p>When he thought of this, Gu Changge remembered Ye Ling.</p>
      <p>
        After giving him more than a month’s time, he should have found the
        Immortal Cave reserved for him by the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, Gu Changge followed the traces Yin Mei had left for him, heading
        towards Ye Ling and the others’ current location.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        “Brother Kong, what do you think those Black Heavenly Eagle and Ancient
        Serpent clansmen have been doing all this time? They seem to be
        searching for something?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Do you think it could be related to Ye Lin and the others? It’s been
        more than a month since Miss Chi Ling and the others left, and yet no
        news has come through.”
      </p>
      <p>In the middle of a mountain range…</p>
      <p>
        A group of young cultivators were camped around a campfire, discussing
        various matters.
      </p>
      <p>They were the followers of Chi Ling and Yin Mei.</p>
      <p>
        Among them were both male and female, from the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox
        Family and the Vermilion Bird Clan, as well as various other places of
        the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were all of different cultivation levels, with the weakest being at
        the Conferred Lord Realm, and the strong being at the Conferred King
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>The person who spoke was also one of Chi Ling’s followers.</p>
      <p>
        In front of him was a handsome man with a gloomy expression, it was Kong
        Yang of the Peacock Clan, an admirer of Chi Ling and her follower at the
        same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, Kong Yang spoke with an unpleasant look on his face,
        “Ye Lin has no good intentions, he clearly knows what is hidden here,
        yet he did not tell us. Instead, he took only Chi Ling and Yin Mei with
        him!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s obvious that the intention of a drunkard is no more than wine,
        don’t you understand that? Now that a month has passed, apart from
        seeing some creatures searching around, does anyone have any news of
        them?”
      </p>
      <p>The more he spoke, the angrier he became.</p>
      <p>
        While he was more at ease with Chi Ling, it was a different story with
        Ye Lin by her side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given Ye Lin’s background, considerable strength, and the fact he looked
        as though he knew every nook and cranny…
      </p>
      <p>How could he not be suspicious of Ye Ling?</p>
      <p>
        “As a matter of fact, I suspect that this Ye Lin is related to the
        Forbidden Demonic Arts inheritor who appeared some time ago…”
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Kong Yang suddenly opened his mouth, his voice holding a
        deep bitterness that immediately attracted the attention of all those
        present here as they looked over.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the matter of the Demonic Arts Inheritor has recently caused
        a great deal of turmoil.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even the Young Master of the White Tiger Clan, Bai Lie, had lost his
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even now, the White Tiger Clan was still in the midst of frantically
        searching for the Demonic Arts Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Brother Kong Yang, this is not something you can say casually, please
        think carefully.” Upon hearing this, a man from the Nine-Tailed Heavenly
        Fox Clan – Yin Mei’s clan – spoke with a grave expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        The matter of the Inheritor of the Demonic Arts was a very serious one,
        and if Ye Lin really was the one, then their Young Lady would be in
        great danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he heard this, Kong Yang’s face held an expression as deep as the
        ocean. “I think you’ve all seen what Ye Lin is capable of. He holds
        strange and mysterious methods, no weaker than some of the Young
        Supremes. And most importantly… doesn’t the name ‘Ye Lin’ sound familiar
        to you?”
      </p>
      <p>“Ye Lin… Ye Lin…”</p>
      <p>“The name is quite familiar, could it be… that Ye Ling?”</p>
      <p>
        When they heard Kong Yang’s words, they felt uncertain. But after a bit
        more thought, his words rang true.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire group was frozen, their eyes wide as a chill ran down their
        backs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was true that Ye Lin did not look like much at first, but the way he
        showed off his skills, later on, had shocked the crowd. That strength
        was equal to that of an upper-level Young Supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time, they didn’t think much of it, but now that they thought
        about it again, why would a man with the power of a Young Supreme become
        a follower of Chi Ling?
      </p>
      <p>And what were his intentions?</p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, combined with Kong Yang’s words now, it suddenly sent a
        chill through their bodies, from head to toe.
      </p>
      <p>“The name Ye Lin… Ye Ling… it’s not a coincidence…”</p>
      <p>
        Their voices trembled. All those gathered here naturally knew that Bai
        Lie’s “good brother” was called Ye Ling, the same name that was
        suspicious to be the Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, when Ye Lin introduced himself, they thought the name
        was familiar and somewhat resembled a common sound.
      </p>
      <p>But now that Kong Yang had mentioned it, everyone was stunned.</p>
      <p>
        This was probably deliberate on Ye Ling’s part, thinking he didn’t care
        one bit whether he was discovered or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Ye Ling could easily change his appearance and identity and
        keep on fleeing.
      </p>
      <p>‘How arrogant!’</p>
      <p>They shuddered at the very thought.</p>
      <p>
        “It was too dangerous for Miss Chi Ling and Lady Yin Mei to trust Ye Lin
        so much.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Make no mistake, they are now with Ye Ling, and I am afraid that they
        are in grave danger. There is no telling what evil plan Ye Ling has that
        he took both of them with him!” Kong Yang showed an expression filled
        with guilt, his fists clenched as self-hatred boiled within for his
        failure to recognize the truth earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It looks like we can only send out a message that Ye Ling is here so
        that the rest of the cultivators will come. If not, the consequences
        would simply be unimaginable!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The group discussed this for a while and came up with such a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        They could only hope that this would make Ye Ling wary of attacking Chi
        Ling and Yin Mei so easily!
      </p>
      <p>
        Kong Yang also slowly nodded his head and said, “There is no time to
        lose. If we let Ye Ling’s whereabouts be revealed, Chi Ling and Yin Mei
        will be safer!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, everyone started to take action, using various transmitting
        talismans to spread the news about the place, with the intention of
        attracting other cultivators to come and fight against Ye Ling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone who has inherited the Forbidden Demonic Arts will be killed.
      </p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, while Kong Yang and others were spreading the news of
        Ye Ling’s location…
      </p>
      <p>The three of them hurried towards an ancient city in front of them.</p>
      <p>
        The trees on the mountain were tall and ancient. They had vines like
        clouds, allowing them to remain unnoticed as they hurried along the
        mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to a month ago, the three of them were now in a bit of a mess,
        their faces stained with blood, thanks to the pursuit of the Black
        Heavenly Eagle and other major clans along the way.
      </p>
      <p>Eventually, their whereabouts were discovered.</p>
      <p>
        Due to the slave mark, some Experts of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan
        were able to sense Ye Ling’s vague location and determine the direction
        he went in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, among the three of them, there seemed to be a hidden wave
        coming from them, surprising and confusing them at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was as if someone was transmitting Ye Ling’s exact location to
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, the three of them had spent all this time avoiding the
        pursuit.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, by chance, Ye Ling was able to make a breakthrough in his
        cultivation and find some good items along the way.
      </p>
      <p>Such good fortune left Chi Ling at a loss for words.</p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, she and Yin Mei had many dangerous encounters and were
        so physically and mentally exhausted along the way that they were almost
        severely injured several times.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were not as lucky as Ye Ling, and on their journey with Ye Ling,
        they had only come across a few relatively good herbs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from that, they did not get anything. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at
        no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>Instead, they suffered many injuries.</p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling was a righteous and trustworthy person. And since she had
        promised to accompany Ye Ling, she would not easily go back on her
        promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she couldn’t understand why they were always found, no matter
        where Ye Ling was hiding with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        She suspected that there was something on Ye Ling’s body that allowed
        everyone to track the three of them.
      </p>
      <p>Yet when she said this, Ye Ling didn’t believe her at all.</p>
      <p>And Chi Ling could do nothing about it… Ye Ling had let her down.</p>
      <p>
        “Old Turtle, I have a feeling that the Immortal Cave is located in the
        Ancient City ahead.”
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, Ye Ling’s face showed a faint sign of excitement as he
        communicated with the Old Turtle inside his pendant.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had relied on this hunch to avoid many dangers, even managing to gain
        several benefits during his search.
      </p>
      <p>Now, he was even more convinced.</p>
      <p>
        “By the way, Old Turtle, what do you think this is about? Why is it that
        no matter where I hide, those creatures always find me?”
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling asked another question afterwards.</p>
      <p>
        He was frustrated by the fact that Chi Ling had mentioned this to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, Ye Ling simply ignored it because he had asked the Old
        Turtle and learned that the creatures could only vaguely sense where he
        was. That said, they shouldn’t be able to pinpoint his actual location.
      </p>
      <p>So why? Why had these creatures always found him?</p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling even suspected that Chi Ling was deliberately leaking his
        whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had suspected Yin Mei as well, but she was the one who suffered the
        most on this journey. Currently, she looked so pale and exhausted that
        he couldn’t even bring himself to be suspicious of her.
      </p>
      <p>Besides, he truly trusted her.</p>
      <p>
        He understood from her previous actions that, deep down, she was an
        incredibly strong woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in the face of Gu Changge’s oppression within the Sect, she had the
        courage to resist.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, Ye Ling was convinced of Yin Mei’s feelings for him.</p>
      <p>
        However, suspecting Chi Ling wasn’t easy either… after all, he
        considered Chi Ling to be an old friend, and she was someone who readily
        believed him after he was framed as the Inheritor of the Forbidden
        Demonic Arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the Old Turtle’s voice had reached Ye Ling’s ears as he
        felt a buzz in his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This situation can only mean that one of the two is definitely a
        suspect, so Ye Ling, you should be careful and decide based on your own
        judgement.”
      </p>
      <p>The Old Turtle’s words plunged Ye Ling into a state of silence.</p>
      <p>
        In truth, he had already guessed it himself, but he just didn’t want to
        accept it.
      </p>
      <p>Among the two, one of them had chosen to betray him.</p>
      <p>
        “Old Turtle, I want to hear your opinion.” It was then that Ye Ling
        asked with a very solemn expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ye Ling, I shall try to exclude my emotions, but know that this is just
        my opinion. You can listen to it, but in the end, the final decision is
        yours.” In response, the Old Turtle inside the pendant pondered for a
        moment and spoke slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling gave a nod and said, “Go on, Old Turtle, I trust what you have
        to say.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “In my opinion, Chi Ling is the biggest suspect. If the person who
        betrayed you was Yin Mei, then what are her intentions? It’s hard to
        say. You were the one who came to her rescue. If it weren’t for that,
        your paths would’ve never crossed.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “If your paths never crossed, you wouldn’t have been able to bring her
        here. Thus, her being here can be said to be nothing more than
        coincidence, an accident.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Turtle spoke up, analysing the situation according to its point
        of view, without the slightest emotion.
      </p>
      <p>Upon hearing these words, Ye Ling fell silent.</p>
      <p>He was already well aware of this.</p>
      <p>
        What could Yin Mei possibly have in mind for him? In all honesty, he was
        the one who desired Yin Mei’s beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he had not saved her in the first place, she would not have come to
        this place with him now.
      </p>
      <p>It was far too coincidental.</p>
      <p>
        If Yin Mei had deliberately set it all up, then… it would be too
        terrible to imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, Ye Ling suspected that Gu Changge was the Inheritor of
        the Forbidden Demonic Arts, who Yin Mei had offended.
      </p>
      <p>They were both in the same situation.</p>
      <p>
        “Old Turtle, continue.” Ye Ling said with a serious expression on his
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        “On the other hand, Chi Ling is incredibly suspicious. Since the
        beginning, she has firmly believed in you and even said that she found
        someone who would be able to help you clear the suspicion of being the
        Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts…”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Because she had helped you voluntarily, I had nothing to say. However,
        at this very moment, someone is leaking your whereabouts. And what’s
        more, Chi Ling should be aware that you are the successor of the Ancient
        Deity of Reincarnation. She has been following you all this time… and
        it’s quite obvious what she’s up to.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Turtle continued, stating the things it thought to be
        suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, Chi Ling was also likely to know the true identity of Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling repeatedly warned her to be wary of Gu Changge, but in the end,
        Chi Ling was unconcerned.
      </p>
      <p>Who knew what went on in her head?</p>
      <p>Ye Ling nodded, his heart heavy from the words.</p>
      <p>He could see the reason behind Old Turtle’s statements.</p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling looked at Yin Mei, who was resting on a green stone with her
        eyes shut.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her face was as white as pure jade, her eyebrows curved, her nose
        straight, her red lips dotted, her teeth crystal clear, and her hair
        smooth as silk.
      </p>
      <p>However, at this moment, she appeared very pale, frail even.</p>
      <p>Her dress was stained with blood.</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Chi Ling’s delicate face and her eyes which shone
        like jewels, looked undisturbed as she appeared to have sustained
        minimal injuries.
      </p>
      <p>By now, he had already made up his mind.</p>
      <p>As he thought of this, Ye Ling stood up.</p>
      <p>
        Both Chi Ling and Yin Mei were recuperating at the moment, and when they
        saw Ye Ling suddenly get up, they both looked at him with a bit of
        surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The rest of the journey will be very dangerous, so why don’t we split
        up? Since Yin Mei is very badly injured, I’ll go with her, it’ll be
        dangerous if she goes alone…”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Since you’re not that injured, we should meet up at the Ancient City
        ahead.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact of the matter was, he wasn’t prepared to tear face with Chi
        Ling just yet.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, he tried to use natural and reasonable words.</p>
      <p>
        When the time comes for them to meet up once more if he didn’t show up,
        what could Chi Ling possibly do?
      </p>
      <p>
        In his opinion, if Chi Ling truly was after his opportunities, then she
        would simply accept his absence, even if she didn’t want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they heard this, both Yin Mei and Chi Ling were stunned, their eyes
        widened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially Yin Mei, who could not help but speak with some measure of
        concern and anxiety, “What are you saying, Ye Ling? How can we split up
        now? It’s better for us to stay together.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling stared blankly at Ye Ling, her expression gradually turning
        colder and stranger by the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘What does Ye Ling mean by suddenly proposing to split up at this
        point?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Could it be that he wants to take all the opportunities for himself
        because he saw that the place of opportunity is about to arrive?’
      </p>
      <p>‘Is that why he wants to split up?’</p>
      <p>Chi Ling couldn’t help but feel a bit cold for a moment.</p>
      <p>She wasn’t greedy for Ye Ling’s opportunities.</p>
      <p>
        If she hadn’t promised Ye Ling that she would help him, she wouldn’t
        have come to this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were numerous opportunities in the Ancient Immortal Continent, and
        she had already wasted a lot of time coming here.
      </p>
      <p>Now that Ye Ling had suddenly said that, she was too shocked.</p>
      <p>
        She had been suspecting that there was an abnormal relationship between
        Ye Ling and Yin Mei for more than a day or two, and now that Ye Ling had
        suddenly made it clear, she could not help but want to laugh.
      </p>
      <p>“All right, since Ye Ling has said so, let’s split up.”</p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling casually spoke with a cold, arrogant, and indifferent face.
      </p>
      <p>She did not explain anything, nor did she ask any questions.</p>
      <p>
        From today onwards, the relationship between her and Ye Ling as friends
        should be concluded.
      </p>
      <p>“I found you!”</p>
      <p>
        And at that very moment, a terrifying pressure suddenly came from the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were several powerful figures from the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan
        and the Ancient Serpent Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the weakest among them were in the Heavenly God Realm, and there
        was even an existence in the God King Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the sake of taking down Ye Ling and the others, all the major clans
        had mobilised an extremely powerful force.
      </p>
      <p>“Not good!”</p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling paled at this scene. Without any time to react, his body quickly
        morphed into a divine rainbow and disappeared into the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Yin Mei heard a voice from afar saying, “It’s too
        late, let’s each escape first and meet up at the ancient city.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, he had intended to bring Yin Mei with him, but the situation
        was so sudden that he was unable to do so.
      </p>
      <p>The target was him, so he might be able to draw his opponents away.</p>
      <p>He thought it might also help to lessen the burden on Yin Mei.</p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling suspected that these powerful men were, in fact, suddenly drawn
        in by Chi Ling; otherwise, how could the other side have discovered
        their whereabouts so quickly?
      </p>
      <p>However, he could not settle the score with Chi Ling right now.</p>
      <p>“Why are you just standing there? Run!”</p>
      <p>
        Seeing how Yin Mei was frozen in place, Chi Ling frowned and then
        quickly fled, crushing a Divine Traversing Talisman at the same time,
        ready to leave the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling had disappointed her so much that she already planned to draw a
        line between her and him.
      </p>
      <p>As for Ye Ling’s opportunities, she didn’t care about them at all.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, both Ye Ling and Chi Ling disappeared, quickly escaping from the
        mountain range.
      </p>
      <p>
        The worried look on Yin Mei’s face as she sat on the greenstone
        disappeared, showing calm, even relief, though it was mixed with a bit
        of reluctance.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Master, the task you gave me has finally been accomplished.” Yin Mei
        whispered softly.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had never forgotten the mission that Gu Changge had assigned to her,
        to sow discord between Chi Ling and Ye Ling.
      </p>
      <p>And today, it finally came to pass.</p>
      <p>
        However, along the way, she has drawn many powerful people, and she
        herself was indeed severely wounded. She wasn’t as lucky as Ye Ling and
        Chi Ling.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, her opponents were all Heavenly Gods, and there were even
        many God Kings.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had only broken through to the middle stage of the Conferred King
        Realm, so the gap between them was too great.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have survived several times was already the result of the Nine-Tailed
        Celestial Fox’s good fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        To put it bluntly, she had succeeded in fulfilling Gu Changge’s orders
        to sow discord between Ye Ling and Chi Ling… in exchange for her own
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was now severely injured. Even if she escaped, she wouldn’t get very
        far.
      </p>
      <p>Yin Mei was at peace with the situation.</p>
      <p>
        But somehow, the fact that she wouldn’t see Gu Changge again before she
        died made her feel sadness and regret.
      </p>
      <p>There was… something unspeakable in her feelings.</p>
      <p>
        After all, she was just a pawn in Gu Changge’s hands, the kind that he
        would throw away as soon as he was done with, the kind he wouldn’t give
        a second glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh, this fellow is not running away, are you waiting for death? After
        running away for so long, it seems that she has given up on her fate.
        But upon closer inspection, she appears to be a pure and beautiful
        girl…”
      </p>
      <p>In the sky stood two mighty beings.</p>
      <p>
        One was a Heavenly God and the other was a God King, their auras were
        terrifying, powerful… so powerful that their auras crushed the sky and
        caused tremendous fluctuations of Qi and vitality, causing the mountains
        in all directions to fall dead silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one who spoke now was the God King creature with a snake’s tail,
        most likely a member of the Ancient Serpent Clan.
      </p>
      <p>He stared at Yin Mei with a lustful gaze, somewhat tempted.</p>
      <p>
        “How about this? If you willingly submit to me, I will spare your life.”
        He opened his mouth and spoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        As she looked at the expressions of the two mighty beings before her,
        Yin Mei held a calm face as she indifferently replied, “Stop dreaming, I
        wouldn’t let you have your way even if I have to blow up my own body.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she did not want to die, she would not live in such a
        disgraceful way either.
      </p>
      <p>After all, it still depends on the individual.</p>
      <p>
        She may have submitted to Gu Changge and recognized him as her master,
        but that didn’t mean she’ll submit to just about anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, Yin Mei would rather die.</p>
      <p>“Hmph, talking tough even though you’re on the verge of death!”</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei’s words made the God King Realm being in the sky furious, not
        expecting this girl to be so ungrateful.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        Right then, he immediately struck out, and his powerful aura fell in the
        sky, turning into a big palm to grab Yin Mei.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei’s face remained cold and unafraid as she chose to self-destruct.
      </p>
      <p>Buzz!</p>
      <p>
        All of a sudden, an even more terrifying aura appeared in front of her,
        transforming into a radiant and unparalleled sword Qi, exploding and
        splitting the Heavenly God Realm being in front of her into two halves
        with a single slash.
      </p>
      <p>“Who is it?”</p>
      <p>
        The other being in the God King Realm reacted with immense anger and
        looked in the direction where the sword ray came from, his killing
        intent soaring.
      </p>
      <p>“Master…”</p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei was also frozen at this moment, her beautiful eyes wide open,
        unable to believe what had just happened… as she looked at the young man
        who suddenly stepped out of the void in front of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then she suddenly jumped into Gu Changge’s arms, “You are so mean,
        Master, I thought you didn’t want me anymore…”

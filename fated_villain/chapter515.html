          Principles filled the air as they wielded their abilities, seemingly

          prepared to leave in secret.

          not surprised by this. His eyes were focused on the calm and
          chillingly dark sea deep inside the tiny world, formed when black
          rivers resembling the Spring of Death converged. Principles
          interweaved inside the deathly quiet waters; it was clear that the

          cloud of glittering dust and moved into the vast sea, which exuded a

          Technique.&#8221; The Bone Ancestor frowned, not waiting for Gu
          Changge&#8217;s order before he stepped forward and stretched out his
          hand, which had been concealed within his robes. The bony hand
          glimmered chillingly, blocking out the sky as it headed towards Lin
          Zhan.</span

          before, but I didn&#8217;t expect you to help the enemy without
          considering the morality of it.&#8221; Lin Zhan looked at the Bone
          Ancestor, his cold gaze intensifying as he stretched out his hand as
          well. An overpowering aura swept through the world and destroyed
          several star systems.</span

          >He had been waiting for the Fruit of Epoch to ripen but he
          didn&#8217;t have enough time. If Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t attacked, he
          had the huge possibility of breaking the shackles of this world and
          return to his peak. In other words, return to becoming a True Immortal
          far above the Nirvana Realm! However, his clan members had all been
          killed before the opportunity came, including his son, who had died in
          battle. His expression became frigid, wishing he could tear Gu Changge
          to pieces.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge did not care about the fight between the both of them,
          since he was somewhat confident in the Bone Ancestor. Of course, he
          would attack if the Bone Ancestor lost. For now, he was focused on the
          Tree of Epoch, which was glowing with traces of life. To be exact, it
          was in the midst of a transformation since many of its branches were
          dead and withered. However, other parts of it were filled with a
          powerful and overwhelming Life Force.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The enormous Tree of Epoch lay in the centre of the tiny world,
          glittering with tiny green lights while being cloaked in Chaos Qi. One
          of its leaves could hold swathes of stars, showing how majestic it
          was. The Gu Family entourage could sense an overwhelming world
          consciousness even before approaching it which could easily crush
          them. Stars hanging from the rejuvenated branches rotated with a
          rumbling sound.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge blinked and the void blurred as he transformed into a
          divine rainbow and approached the Tree of Epoch, planning to take it
          quickly. However, he suddenly sensed a strange vibration from within
          his Inner Universe.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With a loud boom, the Force of the Principle pressed down from the
          sky, resulting in a violent collision which made the Tree of Epoch
          shake as if in an earthquake. Many were taken aback as they felt their
          soul always being swept away.

          towards every direction.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The steaming and brilliant force of the Principle swept through the
          entire world; he could indistinctly see a World Seed landing in the
          great universe inside of him, using the stars as its soil and Chaos as
          its sustenance while it began to grow robustly and develop into a
          World Tree.

          at an unfathomable rate. At the centre of his Inner Universe, a giant
          sapling with an unbelievably divine aura stood tall like a pillar
          supporting the world. A powerful silhouette appeared as well,
          suppressing everyone to the point of suffocation. They could feel
          their skin about to split apart as the silhouette prepared to
          materialise and become part of this world.</span

          over his head, making it appear as if he was carrying it. His
          unrivalled strength gave the impression that he could easily wave his
          hand and use the power of the World Tree to destroy his enemies with a
          swat.</span

          something wrong when Gu Changge rushed towards it. The scene unfolding
          before him made him turn pale with shock.</span

          Bone Ancestor snorted coldly, sweeping his enormous hand in a
          horizontal direction. It landed on Lin Zhan and made him cough blood.

          landed. Soon, the spot he had landed on became blurry and chaotic, all
          Principles and aura gone. The fight between the Bone Ancestor and Lin
          Zhan was something that even normal Nirvana Realm experts would not
          dare to watch. It went on for a very long time and became messy
          towards the end.</span

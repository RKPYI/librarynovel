        <h4>Chapter 158: Final Confrontation With Ye Ling; Who Will Carry The Black Pot If I Die?</h4>
        <p> <strong>“Sure enough, destiny is at my side!”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling couldn’t help but laugh as he hurriedly stepped towards the Immortal Cave ahead. </p>
        <p> After having gone through so many obstacles, he had finally arrived as he shook with excitement. </p>
        <p> At this moment, he could see the light of many divine treasures, powerful and mysterious weapons that
            emitted a dazzling light that gushed out of the Immortal Cave. </p>
        <p> <strong>“All this hard work didn’t go to waste!”</strong> </p>
        <p> Even the Old Turtle couldn’t help but exclaim as much. </p>
        <p> <i>‘The road was difficult and unpredictable, but now I need only enter the Immortal Cave and refine its
                core.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘After that, everything here will belong to me.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘If I have the Immortal Cave with me, I can easily take shelter within if someone dares chase me in the
                future. When that happens, no one will be able to find me.’</i> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling felt extremely excited at the mere thought. </p>
        <p> He could now finally expose his true identity, openly and honestly. </p>
        <p> The Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation. </p>
        <p> Not some Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor. </p>
        <p> With this Immortal Cave, even if someone coveted his inheritance, he would be able to safely escape. </p>
        <p> Ye Ling was not afraid. </p>
        <p> <i>‘After today, it will be my opportunity to turn the tables on Gu Changge. Once my identity is known to
                the public, everyone will understand who the real Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts is.’</i> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling silently swore in his heart. He was the kind of guy who always believed that he could rise against
            the fate dictated by the very heavens. </p>
        <p> Even if the current situation was bad to the point where everyone shouted and beat him, even if there was no
            hope in this life… </p>
        <p> He still firmly believed that he would turn the crisis into an opportunity. </p>
        <p> After all, situations like this had happened before, and they were all too common. </p>
        <p> Even if the situation was more dangerous than that, he would still be able to turn the tables in his favour.
        </p>
        <p> From Ye Ling’s point of view, Gu Changge was nothing more than a stepping stone. He was a whetstone with
            which Ye Ling will hone his strength on the path to greatness. </p>
        <p> And now, this stepping stone, this whetstone shall now be crushed by him! </p>
        <p> When Ye Ling thought of this… </p>
        <p> He almost trembled with excitement. He could barely control the hand opening the door into the Immortal
            Cave. </p>
        <p> It was like hiding the methods of a True Immortal, something so discreet yet so powerful that he could soar
            in an instant to achieve immortality! </p>
        <p> <strong>“Yin Mei, wait for me outside.”</strong> </p>
        <p> At the same time, Ye Ling tried to calm himself down as he spoke to Yin Mei behind him. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Ye Ling, won’t you let me go in and have a look?”</strong> </p>
        <p> However, it was at this moment that Yin Mei suddenly spoke up as her usual tender, flirtatious face
            disappeared. </p>
        <p> She looked calm and cold. </p>
        <p> Ye Ling was slightly taken aback by what she said. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Yin Mei also wants to go in and have a look?’</i> </p>
        <p> He suddenly hesitated. </p>
        <p> After all, this was an opportunity exclusively for him, and it was reserved for him by the Ancient Deity of
            Reincarnation. </p>
        <p> He would give something to Yin Mei, but he wanted her to wait ‘til he completed the refining. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately for him, he had yet to notice the change in Yin Mei’s expression. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Ye Ling, something is not right….”</strong> The Old Turtle in the pendant spoke with a slight yet
            sudden change in tone. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Forget it. Just forget it if you don’t want to.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Yin Mei interrupted Ye Ling’s silence and shook her head, her expression as flat as though Ye Ling was but a
            stranger. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Yin Mei, what do you mean?”</strong> </p>
        <p> It was then that Ye Ling’s eyes widened at this unbelievable scene. </p>
        <p> His head suddenly buzzed as it went blank. </p>
        <p> In Yin Mei’s eyes, he saw a faint mockery. </p>
        <p> This was completely different from the Yin Mei he was familiar with. </p>
        <p> There was a sudden thump in Ye Ling’s heart! </p>
        <p> He wasn’t stupid, and he could easily tell something was wrong. </p>
        <p> <strong>“You don’t even want to share the opportunity with me… Ye Ling, do I mean nothing to you?”</strong>
            Yin Mei asked lightly. </p>
        <p> Ye Ling looked at this strange woman. </p>
        <p> The familiar jade–white face… </p>
        <p> A pair of curved dark eyebrows, a pointed nose, a delicate pair of small red lips, shining crystal teeth,
            and hair smooth as silk. </p>
        <p> [PR/N: For those wondering, she has thus far been revealed to have black hair and white tails.] </p>
        <p> Such a beautiful woman. </p>
        <p> How did she suddenly turn cold as ice? </p>
        <p> <strong>“Yin Mei, how…”</strong> Ye Ling’s eyes had a trace of regret and disbelief. He didn’t expect that
            Yin Mei would actually be the one to have deceived him. </p>
        <p> But now, her true intentions were revealed as the bitter truth surfaced. </p>
        <p> As it turns out, Yin Mei was also aiming for his opportunities. </p>
        <p> Only now did she tear all face with him. </p>
        <p> Ye Ling felt his heart ache, the same heart that told him to trust and care for Yin Mei. </p>
        <p> However, it was unavoidable. Yin Mei had done away with her facade, likely because she believed she would be
            able to snatch the Immortal Cave and the other opportunities within. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Then Chi Ling…”</strong> Suddenly, Ye Ling thought of something. Before, he and Old Turtle both
            suspected that Chi Ling had leaked his whereabouts. </p>
        <p> <strong>“You wronged her; I did it.”</strong> Yin Mei’s answer was calm and natural. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Hahahaha… ha- You b***h! How dare you plot against me like this?!”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling’s face suddenly turned pale as he began to deeply regret his actions. At this moment, his heart
            recalled Chi Ling’s cold eyes. </p>
        <p> Yin Mei orchestrated everything from the shadows! </p>
        <p> <strong>“Then the gap between me and Brother Bai Lie…and me coming to save you, everything was part of your
                plan, wasn’t it? Your heart must be rotten to have come up with such a plan.” </strong>Ye Ling stared at
            Yin Mei coldly, with a bit of chill on his back. </p>
        <p> Such a stunningly beautiful woman… with a stunningly poisonous heart. </p>
        <p> He was furious, hate bubbling within. </p>
        <p> <i>‘I was blind! I trusted her… no, I was obsessed.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘But in the end, I couldn’t take advantage of her and was even caught in her trap.’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“I couldn’t have done this if it weren’t for your stupidity.”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“You didn’t trust her enough. Can you really blame me for that?”</strong> </p>
        <p> Yin Mei spoke mockingly. </p>
        <p> She had long wanted to confront Ye Ling. </p>
        <p> It was not easy to find such opportunities, especially in the future. It was only natural she wouldn’t waste
            the opportunity. </p>
        <p> Ye Ling was the type to think it was fine to hurt others but not the other way around. </p>
        <p> He thinks it’s natural for others to treat him well. And if someone didn’t treat him well, he’d kill their
            whole family without a second thought. </p>
        <p> A person with such double standards made Yin Mei feel sick. </p>
        <p> If it weren’t for Gu Changge’s mission, she wouldn’t have been able to put up with it ‘til now. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Shut up, you b***h! It’s all because of you!”</strong> Ye Ling was furious as Yin Mei’s words poke
            and prodded at his heart. He would never allow anyone to say such things to him. </p>
        <p> <i>‘If it wasn’t for her…’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘If it wasn’t for her, how else could I have been separated with Brother Bai Lie, how else could I have
                parted ways with Chi Ling?!’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“And so what? In a world where strength speaks, do you think your little conspiracies and tricks
                will have any effect on the absolute?”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Even if you fight me, just what do you think you’ll achieve? Yin Mei, you overestimate yourself.
                Today is the day you’ll die.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling couldn’t help but laugh at this moment, then stared at Yin Mei coldly with a gaze saying, <i>“You’re
                dead!”.</i> </p>
        <p> He was confident that his trump cards were enough to kill Yin Mei. </p>
        <p> Even if someone in the Great Sacred Realm fought him, he still had ways to either kill or subdue them with
            these cards! </p>
        <p> What could a mere Yin Mei achieve? </p>
        <p> <strong>“You think too highly of yourself!”</strong> Yin Mei looked at him coldly, with no fear in her ruby
            ??eyes. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Someone like you is merely </strong><strong><i>COURTING DEATH!!”</i></strong> </p>
        <p> Yin Mei said with a calm, frosty voice. </p>
        <p> <strong>“If both of us are seeking death, then I’ll make sure you meet it first!”</strong> Ye Ling shouted
            as coldly as his eyes as he wanted nothing more than to kill Yin Mei. </p>
        <p> Victory was at hand. </p>
        <p> At this moment, his strength that lay at the early stage of the Conferred King Realm exploded with full
            force. </p>
        <p> After his recent breakthrough, he had caught up with many Young Supremes. </p>
        <p> If the people had the chance to see the speed at which he broke through the cultivation realms, there would
            be a huge wave and massive sensations that follow. </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom! </strong> </p>
        <p> A magnificent golden figure appeared behind him, like a young deity with a burning body and radiant hair.
        </p>
        <p> It was as if the vast seas surged and flooded the sky as the great palm moved towards Yin Mei. </p>
        <p> This was Ye Ling’s Dharma body. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Even now, you still don’t understand?”</strong> Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m
        </p>
        <p> Yin Mei still had that calm mocking look, uncaring of Ye Ling’s sudden move. </p>
        <p> Since she dared to confess to Ye Ling, she naturally had confidence. </p>
        <p> Just then… </p>
        <p> Every inch of the void in the space before them suddenly fell silent, and a terrifying divine force fell
            from the sky. </p>
        <p> <strong>“What?!”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Not good!”</strong> </p>
        <p> Even the Old Turtle in the pendant looked up in surprise. </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!</strong> </p>
        <p> A golden palm covering the sun and sky fell from the void in front of Yin Mei, its outline surrounded in a
            hazy mist. </p>
        <p> Chaotic strands of energy rose and fell, resembling the great hand of an Immortal Emperor, silencing the
            very heavens! </p>
        <p> <strong>“Who…?”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling’s heart suddenly jumped, his complexion changing drastically. </p>
        <p> He never expected that someone more powerful would be behind Yin Mei. </p>
        <p> This was something he didn’t expect. </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <p> The palm fell, so strong, so heavy, and so terrifying that it felt like the void itself came crashing down
            on him. </p>
        <p> <strong>Puff!</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“So strong…”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling couldn’t believe it as he suddenly coughed up a big mouthful of blood. It was like being struck by
            lightning! </p>
        <p> The sheer weight of the blow was enough to shatter the magnificent golden Dharma Body. </p>
        <p> To avoid being swatted to death, he hurriedly used an Ancient Talisman, as a layer of black and white light
            appeared all over his body. </p>
        <p> Then, he immediately yet awkwardly rolled to the side to avoid it… but half his body still took the hit, and
            his arm was broken. </p>
        <p> He vomited blood as his entire body shook from the pain. At least five internal organs were injured with
            several bones broken. </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <p> However, the palm didn’t intend to stop there as it merely continued to fall. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Break for me!”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling gritted his teeth as his entire body exhumed a bright light. A black sun imbued with divine energies
            emerged behind him, its very radiance containing the power of time – shining with murderous and terrifying
            intent. </p>
        <p> It made for a powerful scene as the black sun rose to burn the very skies! </p>
        <p> Strands of black divine brilliance erupted and covered the sky with might so great that it would seriously
            injure even those in the True God Realm. </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <p> It was as if several stars exploded as terrifying energies were released at this very moment. </p>
        <p> If it weren’t for the bronze pillars and the many formations that supported this place alongside the strange
            powers that shielded it, it would have surely been reduced to ruin. </p>
        <p> <strong>Bang!</strong> </p>
        <p> The Black Sacred Sun bursted into ashes. </p>
        <p> In spite of the gravity of this attack, Ye Ling merely spurted blood, flying upside down like a torn sack as
            he hit a rock wall in an instant. </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <p> Then, the palm disappeared, leaving a large terrifying crack in space that caused the entire Immortal Cave
            to tremble. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Who is it?”</strong> Ye Ling stared in Yin Mei’s direction. His body was torn in several places, he
            was covered in blood, and his earlier confidence had simply vanished. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Master.”</strong> It was at this moment that Yin Mei loudly greeted her master with respect and
            obedience.. </p>
        <p> <strong>“As expected of the Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation, to receive a strike from me and not
                die is an achievement to be proud of. With such a feat, you might even leave a name for yourself in the
                world.”</strong> </p>
        <p> With a faint chuckle, Gu Changge stepped forth from the void. </p>
        <p> As he said these words, he stood with his hands behind his back and had a faint smile on his face. He looked
            at the abode and then at Ye Ling, the shocked, pale, and incredulous Ye Ling. </p>
        <p> Naturally, the palm from earlier was but a random strike. </p>
        <p> If he used his true strength, Ye Ling wouldn’t have gotten away with just mere injuries. </p>
        <p> If he didn’t have any life-saving treasures, he would’ve been slapped to death, both body and soul
            destroyed. </p>
        <p> Naturally, Gu Changge found his way here thanks to the trail left by Yin Mei. </p>
        <p> And of course, it was thanks to Ye Ling that he had such a smooth journey. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Gu Changge…!”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling was about to breathe fire. </p>
        <p> He stared at Gu Changge as he gritted his teeth in hatred, somehow managing to speak his name. </p>
        <p> And it was at that moment he realised it as his body went cold. </p>
        <p> It was like someone poured ice water directly on his head. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge stood behind Yin Mei. </p>
        <p> This was something he failed to even consider, but it was the truth, the horrifying truth that sent chills
            down his spine. </p>
        <p> <i>‘If I didn’t see it with my one eyes, I wouldn’t have believed Yin Mei is one of Gu Changge’s
                people..’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Their hand is too deeply entrenched in darkness.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Gu Changge must’ve been in control from the start, which means that Brother Bai Lie was probably killed
                in similar fashion.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘After that, he put the black pot of Brother Bai Lie’s death on my head.’</i> </p>
        <p> As Ye Ling thought of these things, he made eye contact with the calm Yin Mei. </p>
        <p> His heart beat like a drum as the blood on his face steadily disappeared. </p>
        <p> Things have gone beyond his expectations. </p>
        <p> This was his first head-to-head confrontation with Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> The result? He used all of his strength only to be crushed with a random palm from Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Gu Changge’s strength is precisely as the rumours entail, simply unfathomable.’</i> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling even felt that the earlier strike from Gu Changge was just him playing around. </p>
        <p> And yet, he could barely put up any resistance. </p>
        <p> At this moment, Ye Ling’s heart sank to the bottom. </p>
        <p> <strong>“I’m afraid today’s an unfortunate day. The mind of this Gu Changge is simply so terrifying that it
                would make people from all walks of life shudder in fear. How could there be such a terrible person in
                this world…?”</strong> </p>
        <p> The Old Turtle in the pendant had a grave yet solemn expression. </p>
        <p> He had seen far too many Young Supremes, and they had either suppressed the people of their era with either
            their talent or their knowledge. </p>
        <p> But he had never seen a young man such as Gu Changge. No, he’d simply never seen someone so casually toy
            with the entire world. </p>
        <p> Devil! </p>
        <p> <i>‘This is a person more terrifying than a demon.’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Old Turtle, what should I do now?”</strong> Cold sweat ran down Ye Ling’s back. His former
            excitement and self-confidence had completely turned into an icy feeling of regret. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was definitely brought here by Yin Mei. </p>
        <p> And he just broke all the obstacles for Gu Changge, allowing him to easily enter. </p>
        <p> Compared to Yin Mei, Gu Changge was vastly more terrifying. He never appeared in front of him but planned
            everything and plotted against the whole world without anyone knowing. </p>
        <p> And it wasn’t just that, his own strength was exceptional too. </p>
        <p> <strong>“I can only pray that Gu Changge doesn’t know about the cards you hold, or it might very well be
                that the Ancient Deity had a premonition that this day will come which would explain why he left you
                with so many cards to play.”</strong> The Old Turtle spoke with a serious tone, not daring to relax.
        </p>
        <p> <i>‘Today’s battle will be a battle of life and death.’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Gu Changge, what is your purpose?”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling was busy forcing himself to calm down as he wiped off the bloodstains and asked, staring at Gu
            Changge. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge looked at the Immortal Cave behind him and the Lake of Reincarnation within as he casually
            replied, <strong>“No purpose, I’m just here to kill you.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling did not disappoint him. </p>
        <p> These were indeed the treasures left behind by the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation. </p>
        <p> The surging power of Reincarnation had already thickened into a mist. </p>
        <p> But now, Ye Ling had nothing more to offer. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Gu Changge, if you kill me, who will carry your black pot of being the Forbidden Demonic Arts’
                Inheritor?”</strong> </p>
        <p> After hearing Gu Changge’s words, Ye Ling’s breathing was stagnant, but he calmed himself and planned to
            negotiate with Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> He did have his trump card on hand, but since Gu Changge dared to show up… Ye Ling was worried that Gu
            Changge was confident in his ability to deal with him. </p>

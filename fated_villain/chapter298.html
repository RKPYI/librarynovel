          startled as she instantaneously discerned the item. Although it had
          been a long time, she was fear-struck as she still remembered this
          terrifying urn.</span

          the Forbidden Demonic Arts in a ruin, she wouldn&#8217;t have
          developed such a deep bond with him, and it was not until later when
          she revealed her true feelings that Gu Changge released the Demonic
          Manipulation Urn. Nevertheless, the intuitive fear lingered somewhere
          deep in her soul, and there was no way she could drive it away.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The terror of the Demonic Manipulation Urn was just that difficult to
          defend against, and it was especially effective to those who let their
          guards down even for a moment. Moreover, given its power to manipulate
          one&#8217;s mind, it was basically irresistible, and not even ancient
          experts that were proficient in souls could detect its effect; even if
          they could, there was nothing they could do to dispel it, and they
          would only end up disintegrated along with their souls.</span

          Master plans to kill her right here, right now? Or does he have any
          other intentions?] Questions flashed across Yin Mei&#8217;s mind as

          this?&#8221; Seeing that, Tang Wan sternly questioned despite the

          forcing herself to calm down, knowing that she mustn&#8217;t panic at
          such a moment as that would make her appear weak.</span

          know?&#8221; Gu Changge casually smiled as the dark gleam in his palm
          grew denser, as though it was the frightening source of darkness that
          engulfed the entire world.</span

          not that I don&#8217;t like your hopeless, struggling look though. The
          more you struggle, the faster you&#8217;ll die upon a stomp of my
          feet.&#8221; Although he spoke with such casualness, his words left
          Tang Wan&#8217;s face blanching and her legs shaking.</span

          deliver her signal for help to the outside world.</span

          Changge&#8217;s tender, amiable pretence was his terrorizing, shocking
          true self. In her opinion, from scheming Tang Tian to deceiving her,
          everything was near perfect without the slightest flaw as Gu Changge
          even took her thoughts into consideration.</span

          some sort of misunderstanding? If there is, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s
          not unresolvable. Whatever happened today, I swear on my Dao Heart,
          I&#8217;ll keep it between us. Tell me what you want, and I&#8217;ll
          give it to you as long as it&#8217;s within my
          capabilities.&#8221;</span

          be, he was merely a young man at the end of the day, while she, having
          worked under the Alliance of Thousand Merchants for hundreds of years,
          was confident that she developed a mastery over the human mind. And as
          long as she fulfilled Gu Changge&#8217;s wish, he wouldn&#8217;t dare
          to take the risk of killing her.</span

          think I&#8217;ll ever need whatever you have? It seems you are as
          shameless as Chu Hao.&#8221; Gu Changge revealed a faint smile that
          carried condescension and indifference. [She was the one who started
          to work with Chu Hao in the dark to try and take me down. Yet, now,
          she dares claim not to bear any hard feelings?]</span

          he claimed her to be shameless, Tang Wan seemed awfully perturbed. She
          then gritted her teeth and asked, &#8220;What is your true intention,

          if I&#8217;ll slaughter him.&#8221; Gu Changge retained his unaffected
          grin while the Demonic Manipulation Urn in his hand was still emitting

          Family will come after you. And do you seriously think I care that
          much about my brother? You must know, what you&#8217;re doing now
          cannot be disclosed to the public. Even with the Immortal Gu Family
          backing you up, you know you can&#8217;t afford to be this
          rampant.&#8221; Unusually calm, Tang Wan coldly stated, as if she had
          predicted that Gu Changge would use her brother to threaten her.</span

          >However, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t seem surprised as his subtle grin
          persisted. &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s simply an example. There are
          unlimited ways I can do this. I don&#8217;t have to kill your brother,
          but I can control him and have him return to the Tang Family Manor.
          Repent for his mistakes, turn a new leaf, be a better man… I can even
          help him become the leader of the Tang Family. And one day, when the
          entire Tang Family is celebrating, I&#8217;ll have him murder your
          parents, your grandfather, and every each one of the Tang Family
          members. What do you think of that? Sounds fun to me.&#8221;</span

          uncontrollably.</span

          mindlessly as if they were stating facts. Yet, Gu Changge&#8217;s
          words managed to lead Tang Wan into imagining the scenario, which sent
          a chill up her spine. Her entire body violently trembled because of
          it. At this point, she could give up Tang Tian, but she could never
          disregard her family and her parents.</span

          chuckle. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a choice, though I&#8217;ve been
          known for my impatience. Sacrifice yourself to save the Tang Family,

          >&#8220;You brother seems to be useful,&#8221; Gu Changge leisurely
          said. Simultaneously, he reached out his hand for Tang Tian&#8217;s
          forehead and it penetrated through his skull. Accordingly, he dragged
          Tang Tian&#8217;s soul out of his body, as if he could kill him
          anytime he wished.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If I crush his soul, do you think he&#8217;ll become disabled,
          or will he die right away?&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly asked.</span

          >Gazing at his grin, Tang Wan could only feel shivers all over her
          body, while her heart was overwhelmed by sorrow, resentment, agony,
          and hopelessness. Eventually, she gritted her teeth and reluctantly
          said, &#8220;Let go of my brother and I&#8217;ll accept your condition
          but only if you swear one thing on your Dao Heart to me. Or else,
          I&#8217;ll never compromise even if it means the end of my
          family—&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then, Gu Changge interrupted her with a grin, &#8220;Of course. Not
          to kill Chu Hao, right? Easy. I, Gu Changge, swear on my Dao Heart.
          Should betrayal occur, my Dao Heart shall collapse and my body shall
          burn in hell as the world crumbles. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</span

          >Seeing how Gu Changge took on the oath, Tang Wan was dazed and in
          dismay. She had an intuition that things weren&#8217;t as simple as it
          seemed, but she couldn&#8217;t quite put her finger on it.</span

          against. No one would ever trap themself this way. Even Immortals
          wouldn&#8217;t dare to go back on their Dao Heart Oaths. Naturally,
          this includes Gu Changge.] Thinking that, Tang Wan felt somewhat
          relieved, though her heart remained devastated.</span

          >Tang Wan didn&#8217;t even detect any sort of disturbance, and she
          was startled by such an unheard method of imposing a Slave Mark. In
          that instant, in her Knowledge Sea, she could see grey mists arising,
          wherein a mysterious, shapeless, inexplicable divine being was
          sitting. She would have gone insane and delusive were she to take
          another glance at that being.</span

          gradually cooled down, much like her usual expression. Though, her
          heart remained fearful as she could barely keep up with the drastic
          change. She was in dismay as her physical behaviour contradicted her
          mind and will. She never expected to address Gu Changge as
          &#8216;Master,&#8217; yet her mouth would uncontrollably say it.</span

          her body with how severe her injuries were. Even though Gu Changge had
          no intentions of killing her, one strike of his palm alone was enough
          to torment her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Followingly, Gu Changge looked at Tang Wan&#8217;s face and smiled
          and assured, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I bear no ill intent.
          You&#8217;re just a defensive measure against Chu Hao, should he dare
          to engage me. As long as he stays out of my way and fulfils his role
          as the Third Prince of Vermilion Bird Empire, he&#8217;ll be fine.
          You&#8217;re his best friend yet he knows nothing about this, but
          I&#8217;m not going to tell him either. I see this as an absolute win,
          don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Tang Wan was taken aback, but after thinking about it,
          Gu Changge&#8217;s words sounded quite reasonable. As long as Chu Hao
          stayed out of Gu Changge&#8217;s way, his feud with Gu Changge
          wouldn&#8217;t develop into a fight for life or death.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As Chu Hao still remembered how he was publicly humiliated by Gu
          Changge, Tang Wan thought perhaps she could talk him into enduring the
          shame, and things would be over. However, if he still insisted on
          taking down Gu Changge, he would only walk straight into his own death
          as there was no way he could beat Gu Changge.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite having personally experienced Gu Changge&#8217;s terror, Tang
          Wan was still uncertain whether Gu Changge had any other motives
          against Chu Hao or he was simply taking his revenge over the feud back
          in Vermilion Bird Empire.</span

          isn&#8217;t going to resolve itself.&#8221; Then, after passing on
          some instructions to Yin Mei, Gu Changge tarried no longer and left as
          he was quite at ease to have Yin Mei clean up the mess. Since he had
          been absent in Vermilion Bird Empire lately, he would draw suspicion
          onto himself if he didn&#8217;t show himself soon.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Regardless, his plan today was quite smooth as he even encountered a
          surprise. It turned out, he discovered that Tang Wan&#8217;s visage
          bore tremendous similarity to the lover of Qin Wuya, the Fortuitous
          One who returned from Nine Realms, he saw back then in that
          vision.</span

          >In fact, the vision the System showed him comprised four people of
          the Borderless Sect, including the past selves of Sky King Zhi Yang,
          Gu Xianer, as well as Qin Wuya&#8217;s mentor and lover. Gu Changge
          remembered the details vividly, though he was unsure whether Tang Wan
          was precisely the reincarnation of Qin Wuya&#8217;s lover.</span

          >Moreover, he also discovered Tang Wan&#8217;s abundant Fortuity,
          though it was still significantly lower than that of an actual
          Fortuitous Lady. Nevertheless, it was her resemblance that could
          smoothen his plans, and if it weren&#8217;t for that, he
          wouldn&#8217;t have wasted his time and effort extending their
          conversation.</span

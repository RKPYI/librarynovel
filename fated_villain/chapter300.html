          Wan told him to be patient and look past the matter. He couldn&#8217;t
          believe those words actually came out from her mouth. Just a while
          ago, she was so confident. She promised that as long as they worked
          together with Gu Changge&#8217;s foes, the humiliation he faced could
          be washed away.</span

          recklessly against enemies he couldn&#8217;t beat. Although Gu
          Changge&#8217;s background was powerful, it wasn&#8217;t at a level
          where he could only choose to retreat. In terms of cultivation, Chu
          Hao was almost at the Sacred Emperor Realm. Thus, even if Gu Changge
          used a Sacred Emperor Grade Weapon, Gu Changge, as a Junior,
          wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance against him.</span

          such words from his childhood friend, Chu Hao didn&#8217;t. As
          thoughts flashed across his mind, he quickly calmed himself down
          without doubting Tang Wan&#8217;s intentions since he knew her well
          enough to understand that she would never cause him harm, and she must
          only be telling him to temporarily compromise after receiving some
          kind of news.</span

          Eternal Overcast creatures? Just how did he find the time to do that?

          her heart, yet she was unable to disclose anything about Gu Changge to
          Chu Hao, and the reason she was so upfront with Chu Hao because she
          knew him very well, so she wasn&#8217;t worried that he would be
          angered.</span

          dealt with this crisis caused by the Eternal Overcast, I think you
          should retreat to the Sect for now. As long as you don&#8217;t provoke
          Gu Changge, he will never come and attack you,&#8221; Tang Wan

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Tang Wan shook her head in agony and she could only grin bitterly,
          saying, “Please, you have to believe me, but I can&#8217;t tell you
          the reasons just yet.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, Chu Hao grew wordless as he remembered the Alliance of
          Thousand Merchants and thought, [Were her actions perhaps discovered
          by the Alliance of Thousand Merchants, who then warned her not to
          upset Gu Changge, as that would prove no benefit to the
          alliance?]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that in mind, Chu Hao nodded and replied, &#8220;Alright, I
          understand. But don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll soon become the Sect
          Master of the Supreme Cave Heaven very soon. By then, the factions
          behind you will not dare force you like this anymore.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Bearing an ambitious dream, Chu Hao clenched his fists. Vermilion
          Bird Empire was a relatively small empire, and due to its fragility,
          it would fall under the immense pressure from other forces. Therefore,
          he swore that, after he attained the Great Dao, he would build a
          peerless and indescribable dynasty that would conquer worlds and even
          the Nine Heavens, which all would worship.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Due to his strengthening resolve, he could feel his Primordial Spirit
          shake as his Peak Sacred King Realm cultivation dazzlingly lit up all
          of a sudden, granting Chu Hao a glimpse into a vague vision.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[What is this?] Chu Hao was dazed as he saw a mysteriously glowing
          halo above his soul which then turned into a weak, tiny quail.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He watched as the little quail thrived from weakness, gradually
          growing stronger and evolved into a python as it dreamt to be a dragon
          that would rise to Nine Heavens. As if he became the little quail, Chu
          Hao witnessed its growth and evolution, and eventually, the quail
          would morph into a dragon that soared through the skies.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[What is happening? This emotion… Is this a beacon for help?] In that
          instant, Chu Hao widened his eyes in stupefaction, thinking that he
          was seeing things as he actually sensed desperation in the tiny eyes
          of the quail, and that crushed him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[How can I save you…] He subconsciously asked.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Alas, the next moment, Chu Hao was absolutely shocked as glistening
          blood splattered before his eyes. A gigantic black sword was seen
          landing upon the little quail that was on the brink of evolving into a
          dragon, pulverising its skull and leaving a pool of blood.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even at the moment of its death, the devastating dread and
          hopelessness lingered in the quail&#8217;s eyes. Through the eyes of
          the quail, he vaguely saw a hazy figure of a young man. The young man
          carried a harmonious smile, yet there was not a hint of warmth in his
          eyes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Gu Changge? What does this mean?] Chu Hao felt the top of his head
          tingle, feeling as if the quail was closely bound to him, as if
          something important to him was mysteriously, speedily drifting away
          from him. [Is Gu Changge perhaps… my fated archnemesis?]</span
        >

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Chu Hao? Chu Hao? Are you alright?&#8221; Swiftly, Tang
          Wan&#8217;s voice awoke him from the dazing vision. At a loss for
          words in that instant, he could only silently peer at her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Perhaps I should give you some time to consider it. Then, I
          shall take my leave.&#8221; Seeing that, Tang Wan let out a sigh since
          the decision was solely up to Chu Hao as his thoughts and actions were
          out of her control.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that, Tang Wan excused herself and departed. Nevertheless,
          unlike how she would usually leave with a space artifact, she simply
          walked out through the gates of the palace.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon that sight, Chu Hao furrowed his brows in confusion. He always
          knew Tang Wan to be a cautious woman, who had always been assiduous.
          Be it visiting or leaving, she would always travel with her space
          artifact rather than walking through the gates of the palace out of
          concern that she would be noticed by Gu Changge&#8217;s men.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, there was no way she would be careless enough to forget this.
          In other words, Tang Wan must feel that she no longer had the need to
          be discreet, and she could now openly come and visit him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[What in the world is going on? Wan’er is being so strange today. She
          seems to be holding onto something frustrating, yet she won&#8217;t
          tell me about it…] Restlessness arose in Chu Hao&#8217;s heart as he
          wondered.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Accordingly, he suddenly made a decision. With his cultivation level
          in the Sacred King Realm, he could tail Tang Wan without getting
          detected by her. Given his personality, he would never resort to
          stalking in the past. However, it was Tang Wan&#8217;s awfully
          suspicious behaviour that troubled him, and she was obviously hiding
          something from him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Whoosh!* Bearing that in mind, Chu Hao regained his composure. As he
          stepped forward, his body disappeared into the void as he hastily
          followed after Tang Wan.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, Chu Hao was relieved to find that Tang Wan, after
          leaving the palace, went nowhere but a merchant building, and that
          building was none other than the base of the Alliance of Thousand
          Merchants.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Did I have it wrong?] Chu Hao heaved a sigh of relief. Right when he
          was about to leave, his face suddenly froze as he almost failed to
          hide himself in the void.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As he used his divine sense to scan the building, he noticed Tang Wan
          exited the merchant building through the backdoor and she was headed
          towards another direction where enormous, magnificent pavilions and
          palaces stood, and that place was where the young prodigies of the
          Immortal Academy were currently staying. Back when the young prodigies
          first arrived, it was the Vermilion Bird Empire who arranged the
          accommodation for them in order to avoid upsetting them.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On usual days, Chu Hao would never come to this region since he
          couldn&#8217;t stand the smug looks of the vain young prodigies, but
          now, he was left with no choice but to enter this region. Given he had
          reached the Sacred King Realm, he was confident no one would be able
          to discover his tracks so easily.</span

          continued to tail Tang Wan with his divine sense, only to find a
          figure he painfully abhorred in a pavilion. Thereupon, he was taken
          aback as daze was all over his face. [Tang Wan left the palace just to
          come and meet Gu Changge?]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Fiery rage gushed in his heart as his intuition urged him to confront
          and question her, but his rational mind reminded him that it was no
          time to show himself yet, since Tang Wan&#8217;s distressed face
          indicated that she was only coerced to come to the pavilion.</span

          The Tang Family wouldn&#8217;t miss to seize such an opportunity.] Chu
          Hao&#8217;s face instantly changed as he arrived at the thought,
          trying hard to suppress his vexation. He was curious to find out what

          used to accommodate important guests and it was usually closed to the

          Though, I actually thought you&#8217;d directly return to the Tang
          Family Manor because of your reluctance to meet with me. It seems you
          care very deeply about Chu Hao. But rest assured, a man is only as
          good as his words. As long as Chu Hao stays out of my way, I
          don&#8217;t give a crap about him. Or, well, you know, killing him is
          no different than killing a bug.&#8221;</span

          back, still working on something he was writing. His tone was ever so
          leisurely, as if Chu Hao was no one significant to him.</span

          she simply stood still and remained silent. She felt somewhat relieved
          when Gu Changge didn&#8217;t have her refer to him as
          &#8216;Master,&#8217; since that would be discomforting and
          humiliating. But of course, as Gu Changge stated, she wouldn&#8217;t
          have come to remind him if she didn&#8217;t care about Chu Hao.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >[What is Gu Changge talking about? Where did he gain his confidence,
          saying that he could easily kill me?] Hiding in the dark, Chu Hao
          heard the conversation that then left him infuriated as someone as
          prideful as him had never been belittled this way. Yet, Tang Wan
          wouldn&#8217;t defend him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, from the conversation, Chu Hao finally understood why Tang
          Wan advised him to be patient. Although she only did that out of
          concern for him, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel annoyed. [Why is she
          so confident that I can&#8217;t beat Gu Changge? Why must I put up
          with all this?]</span

          >[It seems Wan’er has been grievously coerced by her family, but
          there&#8217;s no telling what role Gu Changge plays in this yet.] Chu
          Hao suppressed his anger so as not to alert his enemies. After knowing
          Tang Wan&#8217;s frustration, he was a lot more relieved as the
          distressing idea of her betraying him completely disappeared from his
          mind.</span

          >&#8220;G-Gu Changge, are you serious?&#8221; In the pavilion, Tang
          Wan was still oblivious to the fact that her minor negligence led to
          Chu Hao following her in the dark.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon Gu Changge&#8217;s assurance, hope arose in her heart. She
          didn&#8217;t know why Gu Changge looked for her, but after a moment of
          contemplation, she couldn&#8217;t fathom what intention Gu Changge
          might bear towards Chu Hao.</span

          Chu Hao?&#8221; Gu Changge casually asked with a smile without turning
          around as he was still writing.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          grudge, and if it&#8217;s possible, I wish both of you can be allies.
          That should be the best, I—&#8221; Tang Wan replied as she
          nodded.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No need for that. I didn&#8217;t look for you for such a
          trivial matter. Even if he does bear a grudge towards me, should I
          even worry about it?&#8221; Gu Changge interrupted her speech. With a
          faint smile, he continued, &#8220;You&#8217;re getting ahead of
          yourself.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Stunned, Tang Wan spoke not a word. Having witnessed Gu
          Changge&#8217;s terror, she could tell that he wasn&#8217;t bluffing.
          Be it his strength or background, Chu Hao indeed was nothing but a bug
          to him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Gu Changge… What despicable attitude! One day, I will make sure he
          regrets this!] Seeing that, Chu Hao, who was hiding in the dark,
          hideously frowned as he clenched his fists. If it weren&#8217;t for
          his strong mental fortitude, he would have revealed his powers by
          now.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Chu Hao&#8217;s heart was burning with wrath upon Gu Changge&#8217;s
          condescending, indifferent attitude, and he was especially enraged and
          frustrated by how Gu Changge was defaming him to Tang Wan. In fact, he
          would simply laugh it off if Gu Changge said the same thing to anyone
          else, since the listener would not care about it too much. However, it
          had to be Tang Wan who Gu Changge spoke to, and that made him feel as
          though he was looked down on by Tang Wan. After all, Gu
          Changge&#8217;s actions was intolerable for a man.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, Chu Hao took the jab patiently, not wanting Tang
          Wan&#8217;s hard work to go in vain. If he were to suddenly show up
          and attack Gu Changge now, forget the probability of success,
          Vermilion Bird Empire and Tang Wan&#8217;s family would definitely be
          doomed, becoming a target for the rest of the world.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So, G-Gu Changge, why did you want to see me?&#8221; After
          hesitating for a bit, Tang Wan curiously asked.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In response, Gu Changge put down his quill and turned around. Without
          answering the question, he leisurely grinned. &#8220;Ah, I&#8217;ve
          been writing for too long. My neck aches.&#8221;</span

          >Catching the twitch on Tang Wan&#8217;s face, Gu Changge, casual as
          usual, stated, &#8220;The Tang Family doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing
          well among the Alliance of Thousand Merchants.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, without elaborating his point, Gu Changge went off on a
          tangent, &#8220;To be honest, I didn&#8217;t have you come over for
          anything big. I simply appreciate your beauty, which is why I may need
          your help to warm my bed tonight.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, Tang Wan&#8217;s face drastically changed. Were the speaker
          somebody else, she would have dismembered them right away, yet it was
          Gu Changge, who planted a Slave Mark in her. As such, she grew anxious
          and panicked.</span

          escort or some sort.&#8221; Gu Changge was still grinning
          breezily.</span

          degrading words, Chu Hao, despite cultivating his mind for countless
          years, was so exasperated that his face turned blue. His murderous
          intent was severe enough to shatter the sky. In that instant,
          consequences no longer meant anything to him as he was going to appear
          and take Tang Wan away.</span

          of course, those are only lies. I am not the slightest bit interested
          in you. Though, this ache on my neck persists.&#8221; His grin grew

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge’s unexpected appearance sent a wave of unease through Jiang Chen’s heart. His anxiety only grew when he heard Gu Changge’s words, causing his heart to skip a beat. He was aware that despite Ji Shengchu’s current state of meditation and recovery, he was still keeping a close eye on the situation. Gu Changge’s arrival was unlikely to have gone unnoticed by him.</span><span id="more-32763"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jiang Chen could defend himself against being falsely accused as the Successor of Demonic Arts, he couldn’t deny the fact that he had released the Daoist Sage from the mysterious jade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge arrived, he took in the surroundings, particularly the platform. It struck him as peculiar, as he had been in this vicinity for some time, yet had never set foot in this area because he was waiting for Jiang Chen to break the restrictions that trapped Ji Shengchu. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was well aware of the existence of the True Dragon Clan in Kun Mountain and the circumstances surrounding the death of their Dragon King. This event was intimately tied to him, though it was more accurately linked to Chan Hongyi, who had personally slain the Dragon King. In fact, it was how her wooden comb ended up here before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the time before the Immortal Epoch, Kun Mountain and Lun Mountain were revered as the two divine peaks in the Upper Realm. Lun Mountain was single-handedly destroyed by the Devil Lord. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking to emulate the Demon Lord’s destructive power, Chan Hongyi had challenged the Dragon King of Kun Mountain in a bid to obliterate the mountain. The outcome of this battle remained vaguely documented in the ancient records: the Immortal King of Kun Mountain perished, rendering the area uninhabitable. For eons, this enigma remained a mystery. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge surveyed the pools of blood before him, with a mix of emotions swirling in his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vast expanse of purple brilliance mixed with Chaos Qi hovered above the platform, resembling a cluster of twinkling stars in the night sky. Ji Shengchu sitting cross-legged there, his figure blurry and frail, as he absorbed the spiritual energy from the surroundings to recover his strength. His eyelids fluttered, and his once withered face began to plump with a healthy glow. Suddenly, a light illuminated the darkness, casting a brilliant glow in all directions like a lantern. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then gazed toward Gu Changge, his brow furrowed in confusion, as if his words had perplexed him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is this about?” Ji Shengchu was slightly perplexed and turned to Jiang Chen for answers. Initially, he had viewed Jiang Chen as a Junior who came to his rescue, but now he was uncertain of the situation. Jiang Chen had not divulged much, only mentioning his close connection with Ji Chuyue, the Young Mistress of the Ji Family. From the sound of it, there may be more to the story. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Successor of Demonic Arts and the release of the Daoist Sage from the mysterious jade… Neither of those bode well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first time Ji Shengchu had ever heard of the Successor of Demonic Arts in his life. He reckoned that anyone who could be called as such was likely linked to the person who had slain the Dragon King of Kun Mountain. Furthermore, he had alerted those outside when he detected erratic movements from the mysterious jade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jiang Chen heard Ji Shengchu’s question, he found himself momentarily flustered, unsure of how to respond. He had put in a lot of effort to get on Ji Shengchu’s good side, he could not allow Gu Changge to undermine his hard work with just a few words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen inhaled deeply, casting a disdainful gaze toward Gu Changge and said, “I can explain, Senior. I was left with no option but to break that mysterious jade outside the cavern. Otherwise, it would have been nearly impossible for us to come to your rescue. Please believe me, I’m not a malevolent person. The man before us is the epitome of evil, with a human facade and a heart of a beast. He has committed heinous acts and is completely deranged.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Shengchu was no fool who could easily swayed by a few words. He sensed that Jiang Chen was hiding something and was not being entirely truthful. With a heavy sigh, he reassured, “You needn’t worry, young one. As my saviour, I will undoubtedly repay you generously once we are out of this mountain. As for your past, it matters not to me.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing Ji Shengchu’s assurance, Jiang Chen let out a deep breath and felt a sense of relief wash over him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Greetings, Senior Ji Shengchu. I am Gu Changge from the Immortal Gu Family.” Gu Changge came forward and greeted Ji Shengchu with a smile on his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Immortal Gu Family?” Ji Shengchu’s expression shifted slightly, and then a realisation seemed to dawn on him as he inquired, “You must be the current Young Master of the Immortal Gu Family.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His voice held a resolute tone. He could sense that Gu Changge’s unfathomable strength, despite his youthful appearance that made him seem to be about the same age as Jiang Chen. His voice softened greatly too, as he recognized his man’s elevated status, surpassing even that of Jiang Chen before him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge respectfully cupped his fist with a smile and replied, “Indeed, I am. Upon learning of Senior’s plight, I immediately sought counsel with Ji Hao and others. Together, we united all the Forces from the Upper Realm to embark on a rescue mission. Sadly, our efforts were thwarted by the treacherous actions of a villain who released the Daoist Sage in the mysterious jade, resulting in significant losses for our Forces. By the grace of the divine, I managed to escape and find my way here.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so?” The expression on Ji Shengchu’s face suddenly turned cryptic. Having lived for countless years, he was far from a fool and remained sceptical toward both Gu Changge and Jiang Chen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gu Changge, it became clear that Jiang Chen’s actions were truly heinous. For some reason, Gu Changge made him feel uneasy too. He could sense that the Young Master of Gu Family was more than meets the eye. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Ji Shengchu could not read someone’s mind, he was still able to discern the sincerity of Gu Changge’s words through subtle changes in his speech and expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge claimed that he managed to escape by the grace of the divine, but he appeared unscathed and unfrazzled. He seemed to have everything under his control. In contrast, Jiang Chen was visibly anxious and cautious upon Gu Changge’s arrival, displaying an intense sense of fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ji Shengchu’s mind was consumed by various thoughts, Gu Changge smiled and said, “It appears that Senior doubts my good intentions.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen’s expression shifted greatly, his heart was filled with dread. [Is it possible that Gu Changge’s real intention for venturing into Kun Mountain is to kill Ji Shengchu? Could this all be a ploy to kill him instead of rescuing him?] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mere thought of it left Jiang Chen in disbelief. How could Gu Changge muster the courage to attack an ancient and invincible opponent? When Ji Shengchu was in his prime, he was unmatched by any adversary as he possessed unimaginable strength.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Shengchu furrowed his brow, then replied, “Young Master Gu, your kindness is much appreciated. I vow to repay the generosity of all those who have helped me once I escape from Kun Mountain.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite his words, a sense of unease crept over him, much like it did for Jiang Chen. There was something about the Gu Family’s Young Master that seemed suspicious and ill-intentioned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge shook his head and said, “Senior, there’s no need to wait for that moment. You can repay us now, as I fear you will change your mind when that time comes.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing this, Ji Shengchu’s expression turned sombre. “What do you mean? If you require compensation, I shall provide it without delay.” In this moment, anyone could sense the Gu Changge’s deep malice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It appears that Senior has gone senile after being trapped here for a long time. I think it would be better for me to personally claim the compensation for myself.” Gu Changge smiled, but his words held a hint of detachment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Shengchu’s expression immediately darkened. The moment Gu Changge finished speaking, a loud whoosh was heard in the distance, accompanied by the stench of blood and a terrifying evil aura. Within moments, a shadowy figure swiftly appeared before them. It was none other than Daoist Sage in flowing robes, who had been released from the mysterious jade. His sleeves were stained with blood, serving as a stark reminder of the viciousness of the preceding battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why is the Daoist Sage?” Jiang Chen was taken aback when he saw the Daoist Sage from mysterious jade unexpectedly appear before him. His initial surprise quickly turned into joy as he recalled the Daoist Sage’s promise to him. He had vowed to take down Gu Changge in exchange for his rescue. Unfortunately, Jiang Chen’s joy was short-lived as he soon stood frozen in disbelief, unable to process what was happening before him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daoist Sage descended from the air in his flowing robes, paying no heed to the look of anticipation on Jiang Chen’s face. With an evil chuckle, he turned to address Gu Changge, “I have already fulfilled my promise to you. I hope you will uphold your end of the bargain.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you kill them all?” Gu Changge asked nonchalantly, as if he had already expected the Daoist Sage’s arrival.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daoist Sage shook his head and reported, “Some managed to flee, but I have killed the majority of them, thus fulfilling your request.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded in acknowledgement and smiled. “Fine. You can rest assured, I’ll keep my word. Once we leave Kun Mountain, you will not only regain your freedom, but also receive a new identity. The world will be your oyster and no one will be able to hold you back.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daoist Sage’s eyes sparkled with excitement at the prospect of such a life. As a mere fragment of the Ancient Feather Supreme Being, he yearned for the freedom to explore the vast world around him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could move freely in Kun Mountain but beyond its confines, he would be akin to a fleeting mayfly, with no firm grounding and vulnerable to sudden upheavals that could result in his vanishing without a trace. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had promised to impart upon him the techniques from the Path of the Dead so that he could regain full control over the corpse of the Ancient Feather Supreme Being. With those, it was not impossible for him to achieve the Ancient Feather Supreme Being’s former glory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you speak to me before this because it was under Gu Changge’s instructions?” Jiang Chen stared at the Daoist Sage, his expression contorted with disgust as if he had just ingested a dead fly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was now apparent to him that the Daoist Sage and Gu Changge had struck a deal, and he had been foolishly unaware of it all along. He was even confident that he could end Gu Changge’s life for good. Little did he realise everything was part of Gu Changge’s master plan, including the release of the Daoist Sage from mysterious jade!!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems that you are not really that stupid.” The Daoist Sage merely sneered disdainfully, not bothering to answer Jiang Chen’s question properly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen’s expression soured. “You swore on your Dao Heart that you would keep your word. Are you not afraid of incurring the wrath of heaven?”</span></p>

          Artifacts. They had gone through the vicissitudes of life and were
          wise beyond their years. Thus, they were extremely cautious and only
          appeared in their Dharma bodies. Still, they were powerless in the
          face of the Demoness. As they fought against her, they continuously
          coughed up blood and retreated. Not to mention, their divine abilities
          also proved to be ineffective towards her.

          able to resist at all. It was a terrifying scene that shook everyone

          Regardless, her aura did not falter or change in any way. As usual, it
          was so strong that it could reach another realm and even made everyone

          once again, many retreated as they coughed up blood. An old monster
          was aghast and before he knew it. The Demoness had shown up beside
          him. Her slender jade hands wrapped around his neck and with little
          effort, she lifted him off the ground.</span

          the Demoness. However, with a light twist, the Demoness instantly
          decapitated him.

          Daoists and those at the Quasi-Nirvana Realm were powerless and
          couldn’t protect themselves in front of the Demoness. So, how could

          impossible for her to reach us in such a short amount of time.” At the
          eye of the formation, several old monsters whispered. Their pupils
          dilated in shock but still remained fiery as they peered into the
          distance where the battlefield was.

          become exhausted after a while. Even if she reaches the eye of the
          formation, she would be tired. For them, that was the best opportunity
          to strike.

          lives to kill the Demoness, I sincerely respect all of you from the
          bottom of my heart.” The many ancient monks from Buddhist Mountain put
          their palms together. With compassionate expressions, they looked
          towards the battle happening faraway. At the same time, they focused
          their Buddha aura between their palms. The Buddha aura converged into
          the eye of the formation to maintain it.

          >All along, Gu Changge felt that he underestimated her strength. Now,
          it looked like he had overestimated her. [I had expected her to stand
          in front of me by now. But, she still isn’t done with the others yet,
          not to mention this formation…]</span

          here to seek revenge from me. Like usual, she’s determined as ever.]
          Gu Changge nodded his head. He felt bad that she was still this
          foolish. He casually cast a few spells and runes into the eye of the
          formation. This alerted the many old monsters around the eye of the
          formation, before they turned their gaze back to the Demoness.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >From Gu Changge’s direction, he could see her figure. Even her skin,
          which was as white as snow, was stained with traces of blood. Through
          the array, her cold and emotionless eyes caught sight of Gu Changge.
          However, Gu Changge merely chuckled at her, whose eyes were now filled
          with a petrifying amount of hostility.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With a wave of a palm, she pushed all the cultivators who were behind
          her. As her hatred erupted, her power grew exponentially. Those who
          weren’t at least in the Sacred Emperor Realm instantly exploded into
          droplets of blood after being hit. The evil spirits that surrounded
          her shot up and in the direction where Gu Changge was.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It could be said that her power had reached its limits. Like white
          jade porcelain, cracks surfaced on her body. It looked as though she
          would shatter into billions of pieces at any time.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Quick! Activate that array! Hurry!” Suddenly, a Sect Master
          bellowed. When he realised the cracks on the Demoness’ body, there was
          a glint in his eyes and he offered up a forbidden weapon. This
          forbidden weapon was extremely different from the usual forbidden
          weapons. Its production process was unimaginably difficult, which
          added to its strength.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >Without hesitation, they began to cast their most potent divine
          abilities. This was the moment that they had waited so long for, and
          they could not wait any further. If not, all of them would be
          slaughtered by the Demoness. By then, the loss would outweigh the
          gains.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, the eye of the formation glowed and luminous
          brilliance flowed in all directions. Quaint yet crystal-clear Grand
          Runes flowed in the atmosphere. Like spotless mirrors, they reflected
          different runes that fell from the sky. They were golden ancient runes
          that contained the power of the Great Dao.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They each contained seemingly infinite divine power. If their divine
          power was harnessed to make into different kinds of weapons, such as
          swords, guns, halberds, axes, hooks and etc, the Demoness wouldn’t
          stand a chance.

          >In a more elevated area, Grand Runes transformed into a gigantic
          bright red millstone that was capable of bringing about the end of the
          world. Its loud rumbles sent tremors through the earth.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Wisps of golden light poured down. The power it brought surpassed
          that of even the Nirvana Realm. The ground cracked and turned into
          dust. As they watched this scene, everyone felt that hope had been
          reignited and they cheered out loud. Without hesitation, the rest of
          the experts activated their forbidden weapons in their hands and
          charged towards the Demoness.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The four city gates then intertwined into beams of light that were as
          thick as mountains and shot towards the Demoness. It was so strong
          that even a hole appeared in the surrounding space. Through the hole,
          endless light shot through. As if planned, the stars fell from the
          sky. It was as if a catastrophe fell from the sky to destroy everyone.
          In the vast aura, laid the intent of doomsday. This intent was simply
          horrifying and unimaginable.
        </span>

          >A loud boom resonated through the sky. It travelled millions of
          kilometres and reached even the deepest corners. Even those that had
          escaped could hear the boom from where they were.

          >Nonetheless, the expression of the Demoness remained cold, as she
          walked towards the area where Gu Changge was. There were no attempts
          from her to hide from any of the attacks, which was why every light
          beam that was shot directly struck her. Immediately, green smoke rose
          from the Demoness’ body and the evil spirits around her also
          dissipated, as if they were washed away. It was so difficult for her
          to stand still that she started to stagger.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The ground under her feet shattered and caused terrifying cracks that
          seemed to stretch to Hell. On her body, the cracks were even clearer,
          even more so with the blood that now flowed out. The Demoness’ body
          was absolutely frightening. It was beyond comprehension. Her physical
          body was so strong that no one could injure her. It was just that her
          previous injuries, which were difficult to heal, had recurred after
          these attacks.

          cheered and let out a sigh of relief. The Demoness was not invincible
          and she would be killed by them soon enough. The injuries on her body
          was the best proof.

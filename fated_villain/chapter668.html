        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty was located within the central region of the Upper Realm. Wide and boundless, it was referred to as the Greatest Celestial Dynasty of the Upper Realm. Even the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, which was also a Celestial Dynasty, was far inferior compared to the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty in terms of power.</span><span id="more-34833"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this world, there were a huge number of ancient empires and Celestial Dynasties, so the Force that dared to take upon the name &#8216;Unrivalled&#8217; must indubitably reflect what the word meant—tremendous power, enough to subdue other Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this, one could fathom how confident and formidable the founding Emperor of Unrivalled Celestial  Dynasty must have been.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite endless epochs through the ages, even as thunder and lightning faded, the unparalleled Immortal Celestial Dynasty still stood resolutely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most prosperous place in the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty was its capital. Resembling heavenly palaces that nestled among the mortal world, the capital radiated amid Celestial Mists, almost too spectacular to believe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless ancient, Divine Mountains with silver waterfalls cascading down floated as buildings were shrouded in Mists of Chaos, all incredibly magnificent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During these years, Yue Mingkong established the Security Department, the Control Department, and the Strategic Department and assigned 365 commanders in charge of punishment, patrol, defence, and other duties, each tending to their assigned obligations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under her governance, the entire capital became orderly and well managed. After combining the old laws of the Founding Emperor, she concluded new laws in accordance with governance over her people, leaving the beings of the older generation deeply impressed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This day, in Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, no cultivator spoke of Yue Mingkong without reverence, and everyone believed that someday she would be the Empress of the Celestial Dynasty</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That basically became the people&#8217;s consensus. Now that her father, Emperor Yue, had retired, the many affairs of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty were now passed on to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the eyes of many higher-ups, Yue Mingkong&#8217;s prestige exceeded even that of her father, Emperor Yue. At such a young age, she already possessed the qualities of an extraordinary Empress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, deep within the Capital of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, in a stunningly grand and ancient palace, Yue Mingkong sat on the phoenix throne in her wide robe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her goddess-like face was as stunning as a drawing, and her hair was loosely tied up, revealing her delicate and snow-white neck. Blessed with eyebrows as elegant as jade, she was reading through numerous documents with her deep, calm eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below her, several carefully selected female officials, who gained her respect, were softly reporting the various news and affairs related to the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, the Forces and Factions of the Upper Realm, and Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;News regarding Dark Heaven is being spread around, causing enormous panic. Your Highness, shall we make preparations in advance to prevent Dark Heaven from infiltrating the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty?&#8221; A female official spoke in a soft, respectful tone as she looked at Yue Mingkong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dark Heaven?&#8221; Hearing that, Yue Mingkong gently opened her cherry lips without raising her head and blandly replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she had never left the Capital of Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty recently, not even the tiniest details in the Upper Realm could escape her eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what she could tell, Gu Changge definitely had a hand in the manifestation of Dark Heaven, and it was highly possible that he was the one who started it, making him the mastermind behind Dark Heaven.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Your highness.&#8221; In response, the female official dared not to question Yue Mingkong despite her curiosity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the appearance of the Dark Heaven might stir up chaos in the Upper Realm, it is far from enough to shake the foundation of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, in the official&#8217;s eyes, Yue Mingkong telling them not to worry was a display of boldness—an implication that she wasn&#8217;t at all worried about Dark Heaven.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By the way, Your Highness, the Immortal Gu Family has sent news, saying that Young Master Gu has almost fully recovered from his injuries. He left the Immortal Gu Family residence a few days ago, and judging by the direction he was heading, he seemed to be coming to see you.&#8221; The female official suddenly remembered something and reported it softly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As I was told.&#8221; Yue Mingkong nodded as her lips slightly curved, but she quickly composed herself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, months ago, when she received the Seven Tools of World Domination delivered by Gu Changge&#8217;s men from the Profound Sword World, she understood that he had planned to make a move on the Immortal Palace Treasury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her previous life, it was right before their wedding that Gu Changge sent his men to investigate all the clues about the Seven Tools of World Domination. Therefore, it seemed that the timeline was pushed three thousand years in advance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Yue Mingkong was a regressor, many things in her current life had deviated from her original timeline, which made her unable to determine whether the future scenes she experienced before her regression would remain the same.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, lately, especially when she was resting with her eyes closed, inexplicable images would often float through her mind. In a distant and unknown place, deep and sacred, vast and ancient, she saw herself, yet it wasn&#8217;t herself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Through the ages, one dynasty after another has come and gone…] At that time, she seemed to have become a different person, cold and aloof, as if she was a deity standing tall above the world, overlooking all mortals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, those images weren&#8217;t clear and were blurry fragments at times, so she had to guess whether those were memories from her previous life, but after pondering about it, she thought that the odds were low.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, she could still vividly remember everything that had taken place from back when she was murdered by Gu Changge until the moment she had regressed, which was six months before Gu Changge had returned from the Lower Realm. It was as though those memories were deeply engraved in the deepest part of her mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A dream of a thousand autumns, leaving one unconscious of time. Remembrance Immortal Technique…] Bearing these thoughts in mind, Yue Mingkong suddenly felt exhausted, after which she dismissed all the palace servants and officials with a wave of a hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Remembrance Immortal Technique was an extremely mysterious Technique that appeared along with those images in her mind, yet she completely had no idea where such a Technique came from. As such, Yue Mingkong was thoroughly baffled and was even worried about the visions she had, wondering what exactly led to her regression. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Where did this mysterious Technique come from? Why did it even appear? Judging from everything that has happened, if I actually regressed back to thousands of years before I died, why have so many things deviated from the events in my previous life?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By simply taking Gu Changge&#8217;s actions into consideration, a lot could be deduced. Not to mention that sometimes, things that she thought were predetermined would unexpectedly change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the outcome of the Upper Realm&#8217;s war against Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains didn&#8217;t change by much, its occurrence took place almost a thousand years in advance, which was the same for the Immortal Academy&#8217;s and Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s appearance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, occasionally, Yue Mingkong couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether the images she experienced in her previous life were real.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Were they merely dreams or imaginary visions, or perhaps a subconscious glimpse into the future? Even though she didn&#8217;t actively toy with these thoughts, they would uncontrollably arise in her mind recently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If I were to confess my regression to Changge, what would he think of me? Would he suspect that I approached him solely for revenge from the beginning? But it took so much for him to finally trust me, so how can I ruin our current relationship?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yue Mingkong bore such thoughts in her mind. Regardless of whether her regression was real, her current relationship with Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t be any truer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had agreed that he would come to the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty to discuss their wedding with her after he resolved the matter in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. This was precisely what she had been waiting and longing for in her previous life for three thousand years. Now that it was right before her eyes and within her reach, she grew somewhat hesitant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right when Yue Mingkong was lost in her thoughts, a gentle chuckle came from outside the palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The yearning does worsen after months apart, doesn&#8217;t it? Mingkong, are you perhaps yearning for me as well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge walked slowly towards her, followed by many female officials who carried a trace of hesitation on their faces as they were ordered by Yue Mingkong not to let anyone enter without her permission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, since Gu Changge was Yue Mingkong&#8217;s fiancé, no one in the gigantic Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty dared to stop him. Therefore, the female officials felt conflicted, worried that Yue Mingkong would blame them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Changge, you&#8217;re here?&#8221; Raising her surprised gaze, Yue Mingkong did not expect to see Gu Changge so soon as she estimated that he would take a few more days to arrive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, she then realised that Gu Changge&#8217;s cultivation rivalled that of a Remnant Immortal, and it would only take him an instant to move across the universe. This journey, although vast, was nothing to him now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I’m here,&#8221; Gu Changge replied with a subtle smile, waving his hand to dismiss the female officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, it had been quite a long time since they parted. Although they had kept in touch through letters, the feeling from the reunion was beyond satisfaction. As the saying went, &#8216;absence makes the heart grow fonder,&#8217; and it was not without reason.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, even Gu Changge had so much to tell Yue Mingkong. He had to admit that in the beginning, he treated her so tenderly solely to take advantage of her, but as he grew to learn about her, he finally understood true affection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, deep down, he was no heartless man. Now that he realised how he was blessed with such a passionate woman who was willing to defy the entire world for his sake, there was no way he wouldn&#8217;t falter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thought you would only arrive a few days later. Are you tired from your journey?&#8221; Yue Mingkong stood up from the phoenix throne, revealing a smile on her joyless, apathetic face as she naturally walked over to help Gu Changge fix his folded collars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smilingly answered, &#8220;Would I get tired from coming to see you?&#8221; As he spoke, he casually wrapped his arm around her slender waist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although unbothered by his gesture, Yue Mingkong glanced at him with an adoration-evoking sensation in her eyes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W—Why have you come to see me…&#8221; She deliberately asked the question despite knowing the answer as she wanted to hear it from Gu Changge&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To discuss our marriage date, of course. Wouldn&#8217;t want to keep you waiting,&#8221; Gu Changge stated with a smile as he tucked a strand of hair that was hanging in front of her forehead behind her ears.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wouldn&#8217;t want to keep me waiting…] All of a sudden, Yue Mingkong felt somewhat bitter. Had she gotten to hear that from him in her previous life, she wouldn&#8217;t have had to wait for three thousand years in agony, only to be killed by him during the night of their wedding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are not lying to me again, are you?&#8221; Yue Mingkong stared at him in daze as she muttered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge, as if he didn&#8217;t notice her emphasis on &#8216;again,&#8217; smilingly asked, &#8220;Mingkong, why are saying it like that? When have I ever lied to you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew Yue Mingkong spoke those words out of her emotions from her previous life. Nonetheless, in order to retain the harmony between the two of them, he didn&#8217;t want to expose her secret of regression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, matters that were buried away would eventually fade away, as long as no one dug them back up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was similar to how Yue Mingkong had always known about his methods and how he slaughtered countless young prodigies, as well as how he pinned the blame of the Successor of Demonic Arts onto someone else, yet she never brought it up and pretended to know nothing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, the two of them knew everything about each other, yet they tactfully acted as though they were clueless towards each other.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh? I could make a list out of your lies, you know?&#8221; Yue Mingkong swiftly detected the flaw in her words, but unaffected by it, she shot Gu Changge a glare and questioned, &#8220;Who is Jiang Chuchu, the Saintess of Mortal Palace, to you? You never told me about her. When you went to Demon World, you and Empress Yao Xi were basically inseparable. You never told me about her either. Also—&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Also nothing else, alright? Point taken.&#8221; Gu Changge felt somewhat awkward, after which he let out a soft chuckle and continued, &#8220;If you want to know, I&#8217;ll tell you everything, but I never thought you&#8217;d even care about any of these. Since when have you learned of jealousy?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d care either. After all, present or future, I will be your official wife, and the others will be concubines at most. But whenever you&#8217;re not around, I&#8217;d think of the women that would surround you, and I couldn&#8217;t help but want to slaughter each one of them.&#8221; Yue Mingkong also shook her head, speaking such a sentence in an ever so serene tone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she had always been a domineering woman, she might even appear distant and cold to others, so it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if she were really to murder the other woman trying to woo Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Gu Changge was not the same as his absolutely emotionless self in her previous life, and he tended to welcome any excellent individuals that surrounded him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, why don&#8217;t you stay by my side forever?&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Changge subconsciously chuckled, as if he didn&#8217;t sense the frustration in her words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But you&#8217;ll eventually depart from the Upper Realm. If I were to leave with you, who would tend to the foundations you have established all these years? Or perhaps you wouldn&#8217;t care at all even if your legacies were to crumble down in an instant?&#8221; Yue Mingkong shook her head and rolled her eyes on him as she caught onto his sarcasm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given his current cultivation level, it was only a matter of time until he broke through to Immortal Realm. And now that the Immortal Gate was about to appear, the ancient beings from all Forces would surely aggressively seek it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near future, whenever chaos erupt, Gu Changge would definitely take the opportunity to move on and leave the Upper Realm. Therefore, Yue Mingkong had to come up with a way to allow him to at least leave without feeling any burden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mingkong, how nice of you to stand in my shoes…&#8221; Upon Yue Mingkong&#8217;s words, Gu Changge was taken aback for a moment before laughing as he subconsciously dragged her into his arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, he never expected Yue Mingkong to have planned for this, so he had a rather hard time trying to conceal his feelings right now. Blessed with such a perfect wife, he, as a husband, couldn&#8217;t have asked for more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the next few days, without ever showing himself, Gu Changge stayed in Yue Mingkong&#8217;s stay chamber, appearing natural and leisurely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite knowing about Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival, the cultivators of Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty dared not to interrupt them. Even Emperor Yue and the other ancient beings of the Celestial Dynasty refrained from interrupting them as they appreciated the pleasant view.</span></p>

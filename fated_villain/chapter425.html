          Family Residence was surrounded by the all-devastating might of the

          Cultivators uncontrollably fell to their knees. All these years, it
          was their first time witnessing the terror of a Nirvana Grade Artifact
          and how a trace of its energy penetrated the barriers of Heavenly Tide
          Realm to the outside of this world.</span

          dumbfounded. They never expected that even after Li Xiu revealed his
          true identity, Gu Changge had not cared about it in the slightest, He
          even annihilated the formidable cultivators that just hurried over. To
          their surprise, Gu Changge even carried a Nirvana Grade Artifact,
          sparing his enemies no chance of survival.</span

          and disintegrated. Even one of them, a being in the Sacred King Realm,
          was shrieking in agony before turning into blood mist.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          beings that hurried over were all Ancestors of various forces in
          Heavenly Tide Realm that possessed long-lived legacies, and they were
          by no means weaker than the Shen Family. Yet, they were nothing but
          ants in Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes.</span

          Xian&#8217;er peered at Gu Changge with a perturbed expression as she
          subconsciously asked Gu Xianer.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes, he has always been a horrendous bully.&#8221; Gu
          Xianer&#8217;s eyes were fixated on Gu Changge as she nodded and
          answered without any hesitation.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Prior to that, she had never seen this artifact currently in Gu
          Changge&#8217;s hands. That could only mean that he must have achieved
          a massive breakthrough in his cultivation and encountered some kind of
          great opportunity while he was at it.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Previously, she swore that she would take Gu Changge down right in
          front of him. However, that oath of hers seemed to have grown even
          further from her reach now. As such, she felt frustrated. Now that Gu
          Changge grew even stronger, she would be even more defenceless
          whenever he would bully her!</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All this time, she had been intensively cultivating in an attempt to
          catch up to Gu Changge, but as she did so, she noticed that the
          disparity in strength between them only grew even larger. At this
          point, she couldn&#8217;t even see Gu Changge&#8217;s shadow
          anymore.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Shen Xian&#8217;er glanced at Gu Xianer, convinced that
          Gu Xianer had been telling the truth. It appeared Gu Changge was
          indeed trying to give all he could to make it up to Gu Xianer, which
          certainly changed Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s impression of him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, the members of the Shen Family remained silent in horror
          as they observed from far away. The Ancestor of the Shen Family could
          feel his soul shivering as if he finally experienced fear for the
          first time.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Given his current strength, let alone activating the Nirvana Grade
          Artifact, he wasn&#8217;t even capable of getting near to it. This
          clearly indicated that Gu Changge&#8217;s strength was immeasurably
          horrifying.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unbothered by others&#8217; thoughts, Gu Changge revealed subtle
          scorn on his face as he stepped on Li Xiu&#8217;s head. Watching the
          latter&#8217;s enraged, icy expression, he said, &#8220;I honestly
          love it when others pull off an act of bravado before me. Because
          every one of them always ended up like you. Stomped under my
          feet.&#8221;</span

      <p>

          >&#8220;You&#8217;re good. It is my first time meeting someone like
          you.&#8221; As Li Xiu&#8217;s entire body was agonised by the
          excruciating pain, the Rune of Zhan on his forehead fell apart. There
          was no telling how many of his bones were broken, especially with how
          Gu Changge was stepping on his head. His face was shoved deep into
          mud, disallowing him from raising it up. The humiliation coldened his
          gaze. It was as though his body was about to explode.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Once upon a time, he was the almighty War Immortal that conquered the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. His menacing brutality drove all
          lives to cower in fear. Even after his fall years ago, he remained as
          the irreplaceable War Immortal to this day.</span

          Yao Yue, and the rest, who luckily managed to flee far away, witnessed
          the entire event. In this instant, they felt nothing but absolute
          fright and anxiety.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even the War Immortal himself fell under Gu Changge&#8217;s feet.
          Besides, Gu Changge was insistent on his will to slaughter all his
          enemies.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were greatly affected by such apathy and ferocity, especially
          Saintess Yao Yue who was extremely remorseful. Had she known better,
          she wouldn&#8217;t have made those condescending remarks and things
          wouldn&#8217;t have turned out this way, nor would she have burdened
          her Sect.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s your first time? Perhaps it is your last as
          well.&#8221; Gu Changge revealed a faint grin. As he stomped his feet,
          a spine-chilling sound of a cracking skull was heard.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, he controlled his force so as not to crush Li
          Xiu&#8217;s brain. After all, without the Rune of Zhan, Li Xiu was now
          nothing but a useless man that couldn&#8217;t display an ouch of
          might.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In fact, even without the Solar Heavenly Blade, Gu Changge could have
          effortlessly subdued Li Xiu. Nonetheless, considering that Li Xiu
          might have other unknown hands, he figured that he might as well use
          the Nirvana Grade Artifact to make his job easier. [As expected, once
          I took out a Nirvana Grade Artifact, Li Xiu immediately surrendered
          without hesitation.]</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Gu Changge, I’m warning you. Do not go too far.&#8221; There
          was nothing but shame and coldness in Li Xiu&#8217;s heart. His teeth
          fell out as Gu Changge stomped on him, and he was no longer as
          leisurely as he was before. At this moment, he appeared as hideous as
          a tormented ghost, given his bloodied body and unkempt hair.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the almighty War Immortal, who ruled over countless followers and
          had not lost one war, he was a bloodthirsty demon in the eyes of the
          people of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. Never once had he
          imagined that he would ever live through such humiliation, where he
          was being stepped on right in front of everyone, unable to even lift
          his head.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The reason he wasn&#8217;t willing to reveal his identity was because
          he was worried that his foes from the past would engage him right
          away. In fact, his peril back then wasn&#8217;t coincidental, but it
          was a work of the alliance from the Upper Realm that drove him into an
          ambush in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. This was why he
          endured everything to this very day.</span

          >Unfortunately, right after he revealed himself to be the War
          Immortal, instead of receiving the respect and worship he expected, he
          was abysmally disgraced in the public eye. He had always thought that
          he couldn&#8217;t stoop to others&#8217; level. Essentially, given his
          identity, doing that would only mar his social status. But now…</span

          >&#8220;Oh, what does my intolerableness mean to you?&#8221; Without
          any change in his expression, Gu Changge exerted more force on his
          feet.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, a painful scream could be heard across the region.
          Nonetheless, Li Xiu kept on enduring the torture, thanks to his
          unwavering will. No matter how much he was shamed, he didn&#8217;t
          want the embarrassment to grow any further.</span

          a trace of grey spiritual energy flowed into Li Xiu&#8217;s head to
          prevent his brain from being crushed to bits.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Fascinated, Gu Changge noticed that although Li Xiu was enduring the
          pain, he was actually about to pass out. After all, Li Xiu was now
          merely an ordinary individual whose endurance against pain was very
          limited.</span

          >Hearing that, Gu Xianer couldn&#8217;t help but feel that she was
          derided by Gu Changge and was frustrated by that. [How dare you shove
          me away! Damn it!]</span

          >&#8220;Your older sister said you&#8217;re highly invested in your
          pursuit for the Great Dao. As your senior in the family, I sadly,
          don&#8217;t have anything befitting of a greeting gift. However,
          here&#8217;s a jade tablet I acquired from my travels back when I was
          a child. Within are numerous high-level cultivation techniques of
          great wonders. I can pass this on to you as my greeting gift.&#8221;
          As if Gu Changge just noticed Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s presence, he
          spoke with a faint smile. He then pulled out a crystalline jade tablet
          from his garment. As vibrant mists intertwined around it, it appeared
          extremely ancient and mysterious.</span

          >When Gu Changge handed the jade tablet to Shen Xian&#8217;er, she
          hesitated for some time, not knowing whether to accept it. Since the
          jade tablet once belonged to Gu Changge, its content must not be
          simple. Nevertheless, she couldn&#8217;t make the decision considering
          the relationship between her parents and Gu Changge.</span

          should take it, Xian’er. Hurry, show some gratitude.&#8221;
          Disaffected, Mrs. Shen understood that it was their relationship that
          caused Shen Xian&#8217;er to bear a dilemma against the Gu Family.
          Otherwise, given how talented she was, she would have become
          extraordinary in the Gu Family. At the end of the day, it was them who
          burdened their daughter.</span

          >&#8220;Thank you, Young Master Changge.&#8221; And so, Shen
          Xian&#8217;er accepted the jade tablet. She then raised her head, only
          to see Gu Changge staring at her, as if there was a flower on her
          head. Thus, she awkwardly lowered her gaze.</span

          gently chuckled. &#8220;No need to be so courteous. This is just a
          keepsake of mine. Whenever you feel like returning to the Gu Family
          Residence, you need only to activate this item and someone from the
          Upper Realm shall come to fetch you. Given how much potential you
          hold, you don&#8217;t deserve to be hidden in such a

          >As Gu Changge was speaking, he handed a jade pendant to Shen
          Xian&#8217;er. He thought it&#8217;d be better to keep an eye on her,
          thinking that something might happen to her in the future.</span

          as she nodded. Honestly, she had always been enthusiastic about going
          to the Upper Realm. After all, the Upper Realm was the origin of
          cultivating, an irreplaceable sacred land for cultivation for all
          cultivators.</span

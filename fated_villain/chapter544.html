          different races, who appeared with varying intentions. Naturally, they

          Phoenix Lady glanced at Gu Xianer with a complicated look in her eyes.
          She had seen Gu Changge stand up for Gu Xianer many times now. It was
          the same back at Godly Illusion Tomb, where the Young Mistress of the
          Godly Illusion Clan was almost killed by Gu Changge. The beautiful
          woman would have perished if it wasn&#8217;t for the Death

          her, she didn&#8217;t expect Gu Changge to be so strong and
          cold-blooded. He even almost killed An Xi with his palm on the spot.
          She finally felt her anger dissipate slightly when she saw how
          pathetic the bloodied An Xi looked now, unlike her previous conceited
          self.</span

          dark ceremonial robes seemed to come alive at this moment. As they
          manifested, they released the power of the gods so overwhelming it was
          hard for people to breathe as their skin felt like cracking. &#8220;Is
          this the paper? Let&#8217;s see if it dares to escape now,&#8221; Gu
          Changge uttered indifferently with a blank face. Soon, he raised his
          gaze and glanced at Niu Tian before he reached over and grabbed
          him.</span

          seemed to be confined in place, and even his blood and soul were
          frozen. He was still holding the dark gold page which Hidden Celestial
          characters glowed as a dazzling brilliance permeated and intertwined
          in his hand.</span

          >Right then, it woke up by itself and broke free from Niu Tian when it
          felt the incoming oppression. Tens of millions of Sword Qi beams soon
          burst out like a piercing big, black sun and shot at Gu Changge. The
          looks on everyone at Stone Gathering Square&#8217;s faces dimmed when
          they saw this. Even the Sect Masters felt their hearts race, and they
          unknowingly tried to resist the attack.</span

          buried emerged. One could even see the wronged souls and corpses
          floating in the river. All the beams of Sword Qi evolved together into
          a force that could bury anything to fend off Gu Changge. However, the
          moment Gu Changge push his palm forward, it looked like stars had
          condensed, and the entire universe had evolved in his palm.</span

          the heavens turned into ashes as soon as Gu Changge&#8217;s palm fell.
          All the Sword Qi started to collapse and Principles turned into fine
          powder. The void grew blurry then. This dark gold paper quickly
          noticed that something was wrong. Knowing that it didn&#8217;t stand a
          chance to win against Gu Changge, it swiftly turned into a golden
          divine light and tried to escape.</span

          expression did not change as he continued to press his palm downward.
          Immediately, the voids around stopped still before horrifyingly large
          crack appeared and they collapsed. Even the Sect Masters felt their
          hearts palpitate as it was difficult for them to break free.</span

          >A stunning glow erupted from the dark gold paper as it tried to fight
          against Gu Changge&#8217;s attack. However, under the suppression of
          absolute power, it couldn&#8217;t get away even if it had divine
          consciousness. Instead of escaping, it could only let out a reluctant
          and sorrowful howl in the end when Gu Changge caught it in the palm of
          his hand.

          can&#8217;t use you?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes were indifferent
          as horrifying energy flowed in his palm. With everyone&#8217;s fearful
          eyes watching, he wiped away the divine conscience from the dark gold
          paper.</span

          as their fear became visible. Many of the older generation
          couldn&#8217;t help but feel horrified. They didn&#8217;t think Gu
          Changge would even get rid of the page&#8217;s divine conscience. His

          bad when she saw this. After all, it was a supreme Sword Technique
          they were talking about here. She would be the one suffering a big
          loss after Gu Changge ruined it just like that.</span

          shook his head lightly. However, he had no intention of giving the
          paper to Gu Xianer. He could tell that there was indeed a supreme
          Sword Technique written on it. It wasn&#8217;t that he coveted Gu
          Xianer&#8217;s belongings. He only had his interest piqued, now that
          he hadn&#8217;t found out the origin of this Sword Technique

          bad feeling. His heartbeat only sped up when he saw An Xi covered in
          blood. After taking a look at her, he glanced at everyone at Stone
          Gathering Square. A big number of them were casting interested gazes
          at him. There wasn&#8217;t a trace of respect and fear they should
          have towards a True Daoist. Many Forces that had conflicts with the An

          different emotions on their faces. A lot of them thought that An Xi
          must have learnt her lesson today. After that Elder was killed by Gu
          Changge&#8217;s palm, she even obediently admitted to her mistake.

          faced was Gu Changge. She would have held on to her grudge if it had
          been someone else.</span

          >After listening to An Xi&#8217;s explanation, An Wangshan thought
          that what he had imagined turned out to be true after all. Secretly,
          he fumed at Gu Changge for being such a tyrant. If that Elder
          hadn&#8217;t saved An Xi, An Wangshan might have come here only to see
          An Xi&#8217;s bones and corpse.

          forgiveness if she has done anything to offend you.&#8221; Despite
          that, he still apologised sincerely on the surface and gave Gu Changge
          the utmost respect. He scolded An Xi again without waiting for Gu
          Changge to speak. &#8220;What are you waiting for? Aren&#8217;t you
          apologising to Lady Xianer?&#8221;</span

          of the pickle, or else today&#8217;s matter would not come to an end
          easily. She was determined to even bend over backwards when she forced
          an expression of guilt and self-blame on her face and apologised to Gu
          Xianer. &#8220;What happened earlier was my fault. I hope you will be
          the bigger person and forgive me, Lady Xianer.&#8221;</span

          to do this in front of so many forces in Dark Kun City. She would have
          to carry the shame with her even in the future. [I won&#8217;t be able

          care for her apology. But now that Gu Changge had already stood up for
          her, and she was not the kind of person who held onto grudges, she
          decided she couldn&#8217;t be bothered to make a fuss about this

          Blood Rock looked at Gu Changge all fidgety as they trudged forward.
          They then asked in a respectful tone, &#8220;Lady Xianer, would you
          still like to have this stone cut?&#8221;

          his attack earlier, and they almost fell to their knees. The fear they
          felt was deeper than anyone else&#8217;s. However, the bill for Gu
          Xianer&#8217;s five-million-Spiritual-Stones was put on Gu Changge.
          Would they dare to ask for the sum from him?

          most important agenda today. The mysterious Sword Technique just now
          was also extracted by Gu Xianer after she spent 1.5 million Spiritual
          Stones. There was still a stone worth five million Spiritual Stones
          that had not been cut yet.</span

          the Ghost Blood Rock again. Like everyone else, she was also curious
          about what would be in it. But when she thought of something else, she
          looked at the pale-faced shopkeeper before she glanced at Gu Changge
          solemnly.

          He looked Gu Xianer up and down again. [Did she really put the bill

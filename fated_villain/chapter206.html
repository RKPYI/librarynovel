      <h4>
        Chapter 206: The Heavenly Prince’s Final Use; Hold on Until I Come to
        Save You!
      </h4>
      <p>Translator – Kshn</p>
      <p>After planning all this—</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge remembered the situation that had occurred on Yin Mei’s side.
        In particular, he was very interested in that unlucky bigshot and wanted
        to know his true identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        He immediately put away those two puppets and all the hidden array
        patterns in the hall.
      </p>
      <p>Hum!</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge took a step forward, his figure quickly disappearing into the
        void.
      </p>
      <p>
        A passage formed straight towards the palace complex where the
        Nine-tailed Celestial Fox Family was currently staying.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Inside a magnificent room.]</b></p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei, who was silently cultivating, suddenly noticed the fluctuations
        in the void.
      </p>
      <p>Her eyes flashed open.</p>
      <p>
        Layers of ripples spread as a portal appeared within the vast emptiness,
        accompanied by a breath and Qi that felt extremely familiar to her.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s figure walked out from the void.</p>
      <p><b>“Master.”</b></p>
      <p>Yin Mei looked surprised.</p>
      <p>
        To think that, in the middle of the night, Gu Changge would abruptly
        visit the palace where she was resting without any prior warning… It
        caused her charming face to flush slightly.
      </p>
      <p>How promiscuous.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded. His calm and indifferent expression seemed no
        different from the one he commonly used in front of outsiders.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Yin Mei still did not dare to be disrespectful, nor did she dare
        complain as she had done in the banquet hall during the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It seems that you are not slacking off and practising
          diligently.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled casually, before finding a place to sit down.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“For Master to come here so late at night… are you perhaps looking
          for Chu Fan?”</b
        >
        Yin Mei quickly figured out the cause, since it obviously couldn't be
        because of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smirked and replied,
        <b>“Can't I come to look for you instead?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>He swept Yin Mei into his arms as he spoke.</p>
      <p>
        Such a delicate yet alluring body, like gentle water beneath his touch.
        And behind her, were nine snow-white fluffy fox-tails that swayed
        gently, filling the air with a strange charm.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Master...”</b></p>
      <p>[TL/N: F yeah Seggs Scene 2 Tail Boogaloo is ready for take-off]</p>
      <p>[PN/N: What are you waiting for then? Start writing.]</p>
      <p>
        And although Yin Mei knew that Gu Changge was only saying this to tease
        her, she could not help but be overjoyed nonetheless, wanting to fall
        deeper into his honeycomb words.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any rate, it also showed that Gu Changge was no longer as indifferent
        to her as before.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Chu Fan? Is that the name of your little servant?”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge asked with interest.</p>
      <p>A name like Chu Fan seemed to fit the standard for a protagonist.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Yes, master. I first saw him on the street, about to starve to
          death, so I felt sympathy and adopted him into the clan as a
          servant…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei could naturally tell that Gu Changge was now talking about the
        actual business. As such, she recounted the matter in a serious way,
        detailing to him the origin of Chu Fan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon leaving the birthday banquet, Yin Mei followed the instructions Gu
        Changge had given her, and paid attention to Chu Fan’s movements,
        sorting out his origins at the same time as she expected Gu Changge
        might ask about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Oh, it appears there are some broken routines mixed in with this one…
        and a rescuer and rescued relationship. A bit interesting…’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This Favoured Son of Heaven must be related to Yin Mei.’ Gu Changge
        squinted his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It now became almost excruciatingly clear how this so-called Favoured
        Son of Heaven stood in opposition to him this time around. His motives,
        his weakness.
      </p>
      <p>And the key was still Yin Mei.</p>
      <p>
        To be honest, Gu Changge had come to a realisation that any Favoured Son
        of Heaven would ultimately be connected to someone around him, almost
        like leeches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples: Long Teng of the ‘Long Aotian routine’, Ye Ling of the ‘rise
        of a waste routine’…
      </p>
      <p>Plus the current possessor Chu Fan.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Do I have to pay attention to the people around me when looking for the
        Favoured Son of Heaven in the future?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge frowned slightly. In fact, he still liked to take the
        initiative to pick things up.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he also understood that there might be Favoured Sons of Heaven
        secretly appearing in the dark, just like the confluence of the luck of
        these countless worlds, which had changed at certain moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the trajectories of these Favoured Sons of Heaven would overlap
        with his path and movement.
      </p>
      <p>Resulting in him being reminded by the system.</p>
      <p>
        Now that this premise was known, Gu Changge realised there was a way to
        find this new Favoured Son of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>He could take the initiative to create a favourable situation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Master, is there something wrong with Chu Fan?”</b> At this moment,
        Yin Mei asked curiously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, she knew that she shouldn't pry too much into his matters,
        but she couldn't help but be curious. After all, from Gu Changge’s words
        and actions, she understood that the situation might be related to her.
      </p>
      <p><b>“The current Chu Fan is no longer the one you know.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled faintly, telling Yin Mei to go down and call Chu Fan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of which, this Chu Fan was actually on the same boat as him,
        being in conflict with the new Favoured Son of Heaven and all… It’s just
        that he was not really worthy of Gu Changge’s attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        His only worth was in telling Gu Changge about the thing that was taken
        away from him: his true identity.
      </p>
      <p>Just as he continued pondering.</p>
      <p>
        Chu Fan, whose face was riddled with confusion, nervousness, and
        anticipation, was brought in front of Gu Changge by Yin Mei.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Master, I’ve brought Chu Fan.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei respectfully reported, closing the door at the same time, in
        case the momentum here disturbed the rest of the people.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>An eerie silence took over the hall.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“M-may I ask why the Young Master has summoned this servant at
          night?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Chu Fan stood there, his voice trembling as if he was about to lose his
        balance.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        He seemed sincerely frightened and worried, vividly demonstrating the
        act that was dubbed the ‘humility and caution of a small fry’.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression on his face looked seamless, and if there were outsiders
        here, they wouldn't be able to see the slightest flaw.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I have to say that his control of expressions is very good. He is
        indeed not just a simple character.’
      </p>
      <p>
        But only Chu Fan himself knew that the expression on his face was
        actually not a lie at all. For Yin Mei to suddenly arrive at the
        courtyard where he rested and say that Gu Changge, of all people, had
        summoned him?
      </p>
      <p>It was like a nightmare come to life!</p>
      <p>Hearing the news, he froze directly.</p>
      <p>This happened so suddenly he didn’t even get time to react.</p>
      <p>Chu Fan was left there in a daze as if struck by the thunder.</p>
      <p>
        During the day, he had a distinct, unshakable feeling that Gu Changge
        seemed to have perceived his abnormality. It was a horrifying notion,
        compounded by the fact that he did not know how exactly Gu Changge had
        perceived it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Chu Fan eventually relaxed and comforted himself, saying that it was
        just his imagination going out of control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet unexpectedly, Gu Changge had ended up summoning him not long after,
        and in the middle of the night as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, his back was almost completely wet with cold sweat, his
        scalp was numb, and his feet felt a little soft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did Gu Changge want to see him? What was his purpose? Chu Fan wasn’t
        interested in any of it.
      </p>
      <p>He just wanted to escape.</p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, with his current Cultivation Base and ability, fleeing
        from the Gu Family or even from Yin Mei alone was impossible.
      </p>
      <p>He couldn’t escape even if he wanted to.</p>
      <p>
        In the end, there was nothing he could do. Chu Fan just had to bite the
        bullet and respond to Gu Changge’s summon.
      </p>
      <p>‘What… What did I hear just now?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Yin Mei referred to Gu Changge as Master? In the Main Hall, she didn’t
        refer to him as such.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It seems that Gu Changge has more secrets than I previously imagined.’
      </p>
      <p>
        A chill ran down his spine as he recalled the numerous rumours regarding
        Gu Changge, and he smelled a certain truth about the Inheritor of the
        Forbidden Demonic Arts being uncovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Chu Fan shudder even more. Not to mention that he was just a
        small horse feeder now, but even with his previous identity, this Gu
        Changge was not someone he could confront.
      </p>
      <p>All of Chu Fan's fearful emotions were not faked at all.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge drank the tea unhurriedly, with a slight smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he said,
        <b>“I’m not sure how I should address you, Fellow Daoist.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as he said this, Chu Fan's pupils suddenly shrank, and his
        expression changed drastically. His whole body felt like it had just
        been cut apart into countless pieces, revealing all of his secrets.
      </p>
      <p>Even though he wished it weren’t true.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's words made the matter very simple and straightforward.</p>
      <p>Directly aiming at Chu Fan’s origin.</p>
      <p>It turned Chu Fan's expression incomparably bitter.</p>
      <p>He did not know how the situation had gone so badly.</p>
      <p>‘How did Gu Changge learn about this?’</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Chu Fan suddenly felt some hope; maybe hoping Gu
        Changge could help him get out of his predicament.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, with Gu Changge's absurd identity and power, his words
        obviously contained great significance, as even the Ancient Royal Clans
        of today had no choice but to kneel before him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Brother Gu’s eyes are really something, to have discovered it so
          quickly. But how did Brother Gu come to realise this?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Chu Fan couldn't help but smile bitterly, forcing himself to calm down
        utilising his strong willpower.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the presence of Gu Changge, especially when he was in such a
        powerless situation, to speak without stuttering would already be
        considered enough, let alone actually trying to calm down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, Chu Fan still spoke naturally and fluidly, befitting of his
        prestige as a high-standing nobleman.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“It seems that he is indeed a different person.”</b> Yin Mei looked
        surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        She thought that it was amazing how her timid little servant had
        suddenly and seamlessly morphed into another person in an instant.
      </p>
      <p><b>“It doesn't matter how I’m able to do it.”</b></p>
      <p>
        The faint smile on Gu Changge's face didn't change as he continued on,
        <b
          >“Daoist Brother, aren’t you going to introduce yourself? I don’t
          think you want to stay a horse-feeder for the rest of your life, do
          you?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A person who has been robbed of their home must be extremely unhappy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last thing anyone wanted to do was to go from being a mighty bigshot
        to a powerless horse feeder.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Does Brother Gu have a way to help me?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge’s words, Chu Fan's voice suddenly became louder, and
        he seemed very shocked and excited.
      </p>
      <p>It was hard for him to calm down anymore.</p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge could really help him restore his original identity, then
        he would agree to do whatever Gu Changge asks him to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Daoist Brother still hasn't answered the question I just asked.”</b>
        Gu Changge glanced at him lightly and narrowed his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chu Fan's expression changed, and his back was cold, he realised that it
        was not the time for him to ask Gu Changge for help.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge would definitely not choose to help him easily.</p>
      <p>
        In this world, there was no one who would be willing to do things for
        others without any benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even if there was, Gu Changge, obviously, could not be that person.
      </p>
      <p>Chu Fan also knew this.</p>
      <p>
        So in order to let Gu Changge see his value and let Gu Changge know his
        true identity, Chu Fan began to speak, unreservedly revealing his
        origins.
      </p>
      <p>He was not stupid.</p>
      <p>Now he had nothing except for his original memory.</p>
      <p>
        So in front of Gu Changge, he didn't have the capital to negotiate at
        all. From beginning to end, his fate was Gu Changge’s to decide.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Then I won’t hide it from Brother Gu anymore. I am Ying Shuang, the
          heir of Emperor Ying, who was sealed since ancient times. I have been
          cultivating in seclusion within the Emperor's Palace until now. I have
          often heard rumours about Brother Gu during my training and admire you
          greatly. I’d like to follow Brother Gu after leaving my seclusion,
          willing to serve you with everything I have without fail.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing these words, Yin Mei's eyes widened, and she seemed
        extremely shocked and incredulous.
      </p>
      <p>
        She never expected that the heir of Emperor Ying, ??who once ruled over
        the Primordial Ten Thousand Races, was now reduced to this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this news comes out, it would inevitably cause turbulent waves.
      </p>
      <p>Who could believe that all of this was true?</p>
      <p>
        Even if she saw it with her own eyes, she felt a buzzing in her head at
        this time, finding it hard to believe.
      </p>
      <p><b>“This person turned out to be the Heavenly Prince…”</b></p>
      <p>
        The Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family behind Yin Mei belonged to the
        lineage of the Ancient Royal Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        She heard a lot about the Emperor and even knew that this person, the
        heir of Emperor Ying, was the most talented person of the era.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he had been sealed away by his father, who intended to let him
        break out only in the later generations to compete with Young Supremes
        and become the best throughout all of history.

      <p>She really didn't expect to see the Heavenly Prince like this</p>
      <p>
        He even acted humble in front of Gu Changge, almost to the point of
        flattering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of the Primordial Ten Thousand Races, the status of Heavenly
        Prince was no different from that of a prince of an Imperial Dynasty,
        incomparably honourable and respected.
      </p>
      <p><b>“So you’re the Heavenly Prince…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's thoughts were actually quite similar to Yin Mei's, although
        his considerations were significantly more refined.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘That means, the Heavenly Prince who is now practising in the Emperor's
        Hall right now is actually Yin Mei’s little servant.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This huge change of identity is in line with the routine of a weakling
        suddenly becoming the strongest.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It was almost impossible to take over the Ancient Emperor, so the
        second-best Ancient Prince got chosen instead.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Interesting. After that little servant became the Heavenly Prince in a
        blink of an eye, he must have started having ideas about Yin Mei, the
        Holy Maiden of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family, that he wouldn’t
        dare to before this, ultimately involving me in his plotline.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It looks like these clichés are inevitable. But an ant will always be
        an ant, and nothing more. A carp dreaming of becoming a dragon after a
        mere change in status like this is just ridiculous.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Even the original owner of that body would just be a little bug in
        front of me.’
      </p>
      <p>
        After understanding the cause and effect of the matter, Gu Changge's
        expression suddenly became infinitely cold.
      </p>
      <p>According to him, this was everything Chu Fan possessed.</p>
      <p>
        After asking these questions, he was sure that Chu Fan now had no extra
        means other than memory.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, he would not waste so much time.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Chu Fan, in front of him, also noticed something was
        wrong and his expression changed drastically.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Not good!”</b> He stepped back, having a desperate expression.</p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge’s palm fell, collapsing the void. A large black palm
        print fell, covering everything, and instantly grabbed him.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Where is Daoist Brother going?”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge asked lightly.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, spare me! I can swear that everything will be yours, no
          matter what…”</b
        >
        Chu Fan's face is pale and desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what if he had guessed Gu Changge’s secret, he was no match for him,
        and could not be a threat to his wellbeing at all!
      </p>
      <p><b>Puff!</b></p>
      <p>However, Gu Changge did not let him finish the words.</p>
      <p>
        Chu Fan's body exploded into chunks as this peerless palm fell down.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, amidst the splattered blood, a jet-black Dao Bottle emerged,
        rising up and down, taking root in what remained of the Ancient Prince.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chu Fan's spirit was thus refined and absorbed by Gu Changge, letting
        him read his memories and secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among these Divine Soul Fragments, there were many lineage accumulations
        of his as a Heavenly Prince, as well as treasure Scriptures,
        comprehension of rules, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Gu Changge, it was better than nothing. However, the most important
        thing was Chu Fan's original memory, which roused his interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, with these memories and soul fragments he refined in his
        hand, he could easily create a puppet of Heavenly Prince for him to
        control.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge himself had nothing like a method for exchanging souls.</p>
      <p>
        Chu Fan was just an insignificant little servant so there was no need to
        keep him alive after knowing Gu Changge’s secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the thief who robbed the body of the Heavenly Prince, Gu Changge
        didn't care about it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in his opinion, this kind of person was just someone delivered to
        his door to carry the black pot for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If someone asks about him, say he went crazy and is currently
          missing.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge gave orders to Yin Mei and then left the Great Hall.</p>
      <p><b>“As the master wishes.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei nodded and began to clean up the remaining aura in the Great
        Hall.
      </p>
      <p>She was very familiar with this kind of thing.</p>
      <p>
        The current Heavenly Prince would definitely try his best to find the
        small servant and kill him otherwise, he will live in fear of being
        exposed every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge just happened to help him. The main reason was that he was
        worried about startling the snake by shaking the grass.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be bad if he frightened him and prevented him from showing up.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The many inheritances of Emperor Ying can only be used by those of his
        bloodline, but some of these techniques can still be useful to me.’
      </p>
      <p>
        After returning to his palace, Gu Changge couldn't help but narrow his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, he combined the Divine Soul Fragment of the Heavenly Prince to
        create a mysterious rune, exuding misty brilliance and then refined it
        into the previous Great Sacred Realm puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this mysterious rune, a little aura of Emperor’s Mountain remained,
        making it more perfect than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded with satisfaction. He didn’t expect everyone to
        believe it right away. Some would believe it and some would doubt it,
        but it didn’t matter since no one would suspect him either way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“It didn't take much time.”</b> DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on
        no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>Soon, Gu Changge looked at the moonlight outside the window.</p>
      <p>In his opinion, the timing was just right.</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Gu Changge looked at the palace where the Ancient
        Immortal Wang Family was resting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his eyes, a faint black and white rune flowed as he quickly
        determined the location of the palace where Wang Zijin was.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Gu Changge raised his hand, and the Great Sacred Realm puppet
        immediately appeared from the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tall figure, indifferent and unforgiving gaze, was shrouded in a
        layer of an eerie light, surrounded by runes as if there was not a
        single fluctuation of life.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Go.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said lightly as a palm-sized rune fell into the hands of this
        puppet.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Yes, master!”</b></p>
      <p>
        The next moment, this Great Sacred Realm puppet passed through the void
        in an instant according to his instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrible aura converged, like a black mist, and quickly attacked the
        palace where Wang Zijin was.
      </p>
      <p>‘Wang Zijin, you have to hold on until I come to rescue you.’</p>
      <p>
        Looking in that direction, Gu Changge's expression became intrigued.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rune he gave to the puppet was a seal he bought from the System
        Shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was easy to ensure that the palace will be closed for a period of
        time and that no aura will leak out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't worry at all. This terrifying battle would inevitably
        attract the rest of the powerhouses to rush to the scene. At that time,
        he would just step in to save people, reaping the benefits.
      </p>
      <p>After all, he had already calculated the time.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin had a cultivation base in the Quasi-Sacred Realm. Facing a
        Great Sacred Realm puppet, she would have some trump cards and will not
        be killed directly.

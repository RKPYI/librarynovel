<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It hadn&#8217;t been long since Lu Ming arrived on the Upper Realm either. Hence, he didn&#8217;t know what this &#8216;Neraka&#8217; the middle-aged man was talking about. However, he still kept it in mind and agreed to the man&#8217;s request since he had indeed received benefits from him.</span><span id="more-36148"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for what Neraka really was, Lu Ming planned to inquire about it in his free time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After explaining everything, the middle-aged man transformed into a stream of light and flew back into the rock. Being a remnant soul now, he wouldn&#8217;t easily reveal himself until he met someone trustworthy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He might have been all-powerful millions of years ago, but he had countless enemies as well. That was why he ended up being ambushed and even died of severe injuries with only his remnant soul remaining now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the ordinary cultivator, his remnant soul was like a walking treasure trove, but Lu Ming&#8217;s cultivation, knowledge, and whatnot were relatively shallow. Hence, the middle-aged man chose to stay by his side and wasn&#8217;t worried the young man would do anything suspicious. Moreover, he had ways to control Lu Ming. So he wouldn&#8217;t worry about any accidents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following days, the Lower Realm young prodigies from all over, who came to the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, began a fierce battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many would die in battle every day, making the situation extremely brutal. Moreover, war horns from various halls would blow in the middle of the night, inciting their fighting spirit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One night, large groups of soldiers gathered outside the city centre to behead those who had provoked the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds during this time before beginning their conquest and slaughter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the battles between Lower Realm young prodigies, the war between Halls was far more terrifying, with smoke and blood permeating the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gates of each Hall opened wide, and a large group of cultivators charged towards the other Halls, as if they had accumulated hatred for several lifetimes. Their eyes were bloodshot with malice, and they had no regard for life and death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a tradition and rule within the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. On the last day of each month, large battles would erupt between the various Halls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t interested in the ongoing battles, as he knew they were just a means for Neraka or Pagoda to cultivate their ‘Gu Insects’. Instead, he spent his time in the various battle arenas, occasionally buying passable condemned prisoners at high prices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so would verify to the cultivators that Gu Changge had simply come to pick out servants or followers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to other places in the Upper Realm, the condemned prisoners in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds were indeed stronger and more experienced in battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After realising what Gu Changge was up to, many Forces felt relieved, no longer as anxious as before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[First, pick some condemned prisoners, then plant spies among them. In time, I&#8217;ll naturally infiltrate Neraka.] Gu Changge devised his plan while waiting for Neraka and Pagoda to relax their guard.  After all, this was where Neraka and Pagoda raised their ‘Gu Insects’, and these condemned prisoners and winning young prodigies were to ultimately become the two Forces&#8217; fresh blood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, it might have seemed that he had been picking condemned prisoners for himself, but he was actually secretly planting his own people among the condemned prisoners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Neraka and Pagoda had always been cautious, Gu Changge&#8217;s methods had always been difficult to trace as well, just like the Entanglement Immortal Spell, it was impossible to guard against.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believed Neraka and Pagoda wouldn&#8217;t be able to discover his plan. As long as he followed a certain clue, he would eventually find their headquarters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might seem that Gu Changge didn&#8217;t have many followers, but in reality, he had quite a few True Daoist puppets at his disposal, which was an extremely powerful force that could decimate a Formidable Sect if there was no Immortal Weapon or Hidden power to counterbalance it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After half a month of talented fighters battling in the Great War of Hundred Worlds, some ancient worlds with relatively weak overall strength were basically wiped out. Only the ancient worlds with a higher ranking had more surviving young prodigies and more hope to compete for this Realm’s Fortuity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most special among them was the Blue Flood Ancient World. They might not have been particularly strong, but their surviving young prodigies were among the top, and because the battle this night was held in the Vermillion Bird Hall battle arena, many remembered the maiden in red from the Blue Flood Ancient World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the big shots within the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds were casting benevolent looks at her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this, the other ancient worlds dared not act rashly, and they would avoid those from Blue Flood Ancient World during battle if they could.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s thanks to Junior Sister Xue Yan that we were able to rank in the top thirty in this competition. Her contribution is invaluable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Exactly, if it weren&#8217;t for Junior Sister Xue Yan, we probably wouldn&#8217;t even make it to the top one hundred, let alone the top thirty. This is simply unimaginable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of them gathered and chatted excitedly in the courtyard where those from Blue Flood Ancient World rested. Although they had been disheartened since coming to the Upper Realm, being able to make it this far was an unexpected surprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when they returned to the Lower Realm, they would still receive many rewards, not to mention a chance of staying in the Upper Realm and being recognised by other Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you have any plans after the Great War of Hundred Worlds ends, Junior Sister Xue Yan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many young prodigies gazed curiously towards the maiden in red, who had been quietly drinking away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Me?&#8221; Xue Yan came to her senses at that and furrowed her brows slightly before answering, &#8220;I might try to find a way to stay in the Upper Realm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After experiencing the ancient and unfathomable nature of the Upper Realm, she felt more and more insignificant and powerless. If she were to return to the Blue Flood Ancient World, she probably wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to come back to the Upper Realm in this lifetime, let alone advance by much in her cultivation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing this, everyone couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little envious. In these few days, many powerful Forces in the Upper Realm had extended an olive branch to Xue Yan. To them, it was a dreamlike and incredible opportunity, which was now in Xue Yan&#8217;s reach. After all, she encountered a benefactor. It was a fortuitous encounter they couldn&#8217;t envy or even have the right to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senior Brother Lu Ming is very powerful, so staying in the Upper Realm shouldn&#8217;t be a problem for him,&#8221; they mused as they turned to Lu Ming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Ming&#8217;s performance during the Great War of Hundred Worlds surprised them. He was clearly much stronger than when he was in Blue Flood Ancient World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will definitely stay in the Upper Realm,&#8221; Lu Ming said, clenching his fist. Listening to the discussions around him, he felt a strong sense of confidence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few days, he had secretly investigated the origin of Neraka and was shocked to learn that the middle-aged man he met in the rock had such a powerful background.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neraka was one of the most powerful assassin guilds in the Upper Realm, with a long history spanning many eras. It had made various Forces in the Upper Realm tremble in fear!</span></p>

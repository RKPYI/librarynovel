          >As she said it herself, locking her up here wouldn&#8217;t be of much
          use. Furthermore, she could also provide flawless assurance regarding
          certain matters should she need to be questioned. Since there was
          still half a year until the Upper Realm Army could fully gather and
          invade the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, it would be better to
          allow her to prove herself with her actions.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In fact, Gu Changge&#8217;s request was rather simple. Since the Sky
          Deer Goddess had lived for innumerable years in the Eight Wastelands
          and Ten Domains, she must have countless allies, who shared similar
          cultivation levels as her, and were all True Daoists. Therefore, he
          could let her draw her allies out, which allowed him the opportunity
          to take them out in one fell swoop.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that Gu Changge had reached the First-Order Quasi-Nirvana Realm,
          Sources of ordinary cultivators were pretty much no longer useful to
          him, and he could only rely on True Daoists or beings in the
          Quasi-Nirvana Realm to achieve breakthroughs.</span

      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;How do you want me to prove it?&#8221; The Sky Deer Goddess
          collected her feelings. The glisten in her eyes fell on Gu
          Changge&#8217;s face as she revealed a subtle grin. Her snowy skin was
          delicate, and her features were impeccable; her hair was as radiant as
          a waterfall, charming whomever that was graced by its glimmer.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As she spoke, there were two natures inside of her, one holy another
          demonic. These two distinctive qualities were embodied in her body.
          Yet, instead of conflicting, these two qualities were harmoniously
          resonating with each other.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, she knew Gu Changge had come to a decision.
          Essentially, there was no use in confining her, and the reason he
          unlocked the chains around her hands and legs was to allow her the
          chance to prove that she was trustworthy.</span

          >&#8220;You may choose whether to sleep with me or kill someone for
          me.&#8221; Noticing the calmness and confidence on her face, Gu
          Changge tensed his brows as he casually spoke.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon those words, the subtle grin on the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;s
          face froze as she lost her composure, after which she, too, furrowed
          her brows.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Gu, I thought you&#8217;d be unaffected by
          external stimuli with that stone cold heart of yours, and I assumed
          that your Dao Heart is as clear as a mirror, but to think you&#8217;re
          as cheap as this…&#8221; She shook her head and heaved a sigh,
          revealing disaffection from her misjudgement of him on her snowy
          face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Cut the crap. Sleep or kill?&#8221; Gu Changge squinted his
          eyes, in which a threatening sensation surged as he scanned her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Momentarily dazed, the Sky Deer Goddess then answered,
          &#8220;Kill.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although she was still clueless as to the target of the murder, right
          now, she shouldn&#8217;t choose to sleep with Gu Changge, since that
          would leave an impression that she was no different from being a
          prostitute. Besides, Gu Changge was obviously not the kind of man to
          show mercy towards a prostitute.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >But of course, there was a bigger reason for it. If she were to
          choose to bed Gu Changge, he would only grow more wary and suspicious
          of her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Good.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded, having expected her
          answer.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Regardless of the situation, as the Sky Deer Goddess, she was an
          individual of pride and dignity, so there was no way she would use her
          body to gain benefits, which was also uncertain given the
          circumstances.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that in mind, Gu Changge then took another observant glance at
          her. Since she possessed a unique Physique, she should be aware of the
          consequences if he were made aware of it. Yet, she wasn&#8217;t at all
          anxious or restless, and instead, she was awfully calm, as though she
          saw this coming, or rather, she was prepared for whatever that was to
          come.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This made Gu Changge grew more cautious of her given how
          unpredictable she was. He couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether it
          was a genuine change in behaviour or a pretence to lower his
          guards.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Gu, do you really want me to sleep with you? I
          mean, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;d refuse if you want that…&#8221;
          Sensing Gu Changge&#8217;s scrutinising gaze, the Sky Deer Goddess
          wasn&#8217;t bashful in the slightest as her eyes lit up. Instead, she
          was rather natural about it, fixing the hair behind her ears as she
          flamboyantly showed off her beauty and glamour, emitting irresistible
          beguilement.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of such a strange question before.
          You&#8217;re not into something weird, are you?&#8221; Gu
          Changge&#8217;s scrutinising gaze grew even more cautious as he stared
          at her flawless face before extending his arm and wrapped it around
          her slender waist.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, a waft of captivating fragrance surged while the Sky Deer
          Goddess retained a subtle grin, as if she had expected his
          reaction.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the one thing she did not expect was that he dragged her
          over so suddenly, causing her face and her slender waist to stiffen.
          She had cultivated for countless years. Yet, this was her first time
          being touched by someone of the opposite gender like this. For some
          reason, she felt a tinge of warmth, along with a vast divine aura
          embracing her entire body.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, the Sky Goddess didn&#8217;t struggle. Instead, a
          vibrant gorgeous gleam appeared from her sparkling eyes as she
          silently looked at Gu Changge. With her entire body in his arms, she
          felt a refreshing sensation as faint mists arose from her snowy,
          delicate skin.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Your Physique is indeed problematic. You’ve almost tricked
          me.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The next moment, nonetheless, sounding somewhat disappointed, Gu
          Changge shook his head and unhanded the Sky Deer Goddess before
          blinking to a spot a metre away from her. From their instantaneous
          contact, he investigated her body and detected a gloomy aura, which
          resembled the vast abyss, in her body. The aura, as solid as the Milky
          Way and was as vast as the universe and could erupt anytime.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Gu, are you perhaps chickening out?&#8221; There
          was not a hint of bashfulness on the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;s face,
          unlike other women. In her eyes, the gleam remained as she, once
          again, revealed her subtle grin. She seemed very composed, but upon an
          assiduous observation, one would realise that it wasn&#8217;t her
          composure, but her confidence, along with vague mockery.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;A crafty one, aren&#8217;t you? I&#8217;d have granted your
          wish.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head as he sounded rather
          remorseful. &#8220;What a pity. Such an otherworldly beauty satisfies
          only the eye, but not the body.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;And I thought. Young Master Gu&#8217;s generosity is
          unparalleled, but it turns out you&#8217;re such a coward. I&#8217;ve
          initiated the opportunity yet you&#8217;re too much of a coward to
          take it. How disappointing.&#8221; Similarly, the Sky Deer Goddess
          shook her head and expressed her disaffection.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She believes that Gu Changge understood what kind of Physique she
          possessed. Thus, her speech was no longer as restrained as it was
          before. Initially, she thought her Physique could be a crucial key to
          save the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, but now that Gu Changge
          discovered what it was, that plan would most likely fail.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As a matter of fact, the greatest specialty of the Physique was

          definitely sacrifice herself to bring him down along with her in order
          to save Sky Deer City and the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. In her
          opinion, he should be the biggest threat to the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains. Otherwise, she wouldn&#8217;t have taken such a

          >However, Gu Changge&#8217;s wariness and even disdain, as well as his
          suspicion that she might be plotting against him left her completely
          speechless.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge soon brought up another matter to her. Since the Sky Deer
          Goddess was a veteran True Daoist, she was by no means a weakling, and
          that should be the same for her acquaintances.</span

          Goddess took a deep glance at Gu Changge before growing silent.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Naturally, she knew what Gu Changge was planning. The fact Gu Changge
          was able to attain his current cultivation level must be closely
          related to his secret identity, exposure of which might cause the
          entire Upper Realm to be unwilling to let him live and might even
          choose to turn against him. Though, given his current cultivation
          level, even if the whole Upper Realm banded against him, they would
          find themselves having a hard time taking him down.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, despite knowing that, the Sky Deer Goddess didn&#8217;t
          perceive the information as of any leverage against him. After all, he
          was not the slightest bit concerned about whether she knew of his
          secret. He brought up such a demand obviously indicated his desire to
          absorb the Sources of those ‘acquaintances’.</span

          >&#8220;I don&#8217;t really have many acquaintances. Many of them
          died, and many of them vanished. Those who may satisfy you could prove
          difficult to track down.&#8221; With that, the Sky Deer Goddess
          seriously pondered, and she didn&#8217;t seem to be doing it
          perfunctorily.</span

          >&#8220;Are you saying you can&#8217;t find even one?&#8221; Doubting
          her words, Gu Changge faintly smiled. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
          utilise your position and gather the formidable cultivators of Sky
          Deer City to scour for your acquaintances? That should
          work.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;But we may still not be able to find them upon a thorough
          search.&#8221; Hearing that, the Sky Deer Goddess shook her head and
          continued, &#8220;Young Master Gu, what do you know about the Nine
          Great Mountains?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Nine Great Mountains were made of nine Mystic Mountains of utmost
          mystery within the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. The location of
          this place was unknown and ambiguous. They could not be found by
          ordinary men and they only revealed themselves to those fated.
          Otherwise, cultivators could only dream of locating the Nine Great
          Mountains despite spending their entire lives looking for them.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon the Sky Deer Goddess&#8217;s mentioning of Nine Great Mountains,
          Gu Changge&#8217;s interest was piqued. He wasn&#8217;t worried that
          the Sky Deer Goddess would work with the Nine Great Mountains against
          him since it would be unwise to do so. Essentially, if she wished to
          gain his trust, she should be doing everything to prove her
          value.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Moreover, the Upper Realm&#8217;s eventual invasion would eventually
          lead to Sky Deer City&#8217;s collapse. By then, the Nine Great
          Mountain stepping into this war would no longer be as important, as it
          would have been too late by then.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Sky Deer Goddess should be aware of that, and she, being an
          intelligent woman, should know what to say at this moment.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, according to the ancient records, the Nine Great Mountains
          were peerless in terms of mysteries and extraordinariness. Whenever
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains was invaded by the Upper Realm, a
          Successor or a disciple would come down from the mountains and put an
          end to the war with the Celestial Commandment Scroll in their hand.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In other words, judging by Nine Great Mountains&#8217; perception of
          the Upper Realm, their fear against the latter clearly triumphed over
          their ability to fend them off.</span

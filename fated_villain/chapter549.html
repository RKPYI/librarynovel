          >Shock reverberated within the compound. All the rocks here belonged
          to a sect, and its Successor came after hearing that Gu Xianer had
          found a Spiritual Spring of Life. He was a young man with a bright
          smile and extraordinary aura who seemed to exude a faint purple
          Qi.</span

          >&#8220;Congratulations to Lady Xianer for finding this treasure. All
          your expenses inside the market of the Purple Mist Sacred Sect shall
          be waived.&#8221; His attitude was extremely humble after he arrived
          and he bowed towards Gu Changge with a bright smile.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At those words, everyone became astounded since the cost of cutting
          the stone open was exorbitant, yet it was waived. After all, the rough
          stones displayed at the Divine Rock Conference would never be that
          simple. Even such a rough stone would easily be hundreds of millions
          at least. The Successor of the Purple Mist Sacred Sect was extremely
          brave and generous, but what if she decided to cut open all the stones
          belonging to the Sect? They would then earn nothing.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many Elders and famous fighters inhaled a sharp breath. Had they been
          in his place, they would never have the courage to do so. Gu Xianer
          did not expect such a windfall either, but she knew he had done it
          because of Gu Changge and this was merely a gesture of goodwill and
          courtesy.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;There&#8217;s no need for that. I can afford to pay the price
          for that rock.&#8221; Gu Changge had some memory of the tactful youth
          and he waved a hand with a careless smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yin Mei, who had been waiting behind him, produced a great sum of
          Spiritual Stones from within a storage ring and handed it over to the
          shopkeeper in charge of the place. There weren&#8217;t many people
          accompanying him during the conference; aside from several
          subordinates, there was only Ah Da, Yin Mei and Su Qingge.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many cultivators recognised Yin Mei and were secretly astonished,
          since the Gifted Lady of the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan herself was so loyal
          to him. Several young prodigies were envious as well. They were the
          ones rejoicing internally when they heard that her betrothed, the
          Young Master of the White Tiger Clan, had died at the hand of the
          Successor of Demonic Arts.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You are being too kind, Young Master Changge.&#8221; The
          Successor of the Purple Mist Sacred Sect knew his place and laughed
          bitterly inside his mind whilst maintaining his respectful expression.
          The Purple Mist Sacred Sect might be a strong Force but it was far
          from an Immortal Force, so he wasn&#8217;t about to waste this
          opportunity to flatter him. However, Gu Changge was clearly not about
          to accept this.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing much to find here. Judging by the time,
          the Seven Divine Rocks are about to be taken out.&#8221; Gu Changge
          smiled serenely. He was interested in the Seven Divine Rocks and
          immediately led his entourage towards the central area of the
          market.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >During the journey, the King with Six Crowns, Young Holy King,
          Phoenix Lady, and several others greeted him voluntarily while his old
          acquaintance, the Chosen Monk Jin Chan still avoided him like the
          plague. The monk could never forget how the other man had made a trap
          for both him and those from Buddhist Mountain back at the
          Demon-burying Abyss.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Brother Gu, are you planning to cut open the Seven Divine
          Rocks?&#8221; The King with Six Crowns was already familiar with Gu
          Changge since they had cultivated together back at the Immortal
          Academy and couldn&#8217;t help his curiosity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That depends. It would be hard to make a judgement when I
          haven&#8217;t seen them yet.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled lightly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I did hear that one of the Seven Divine Rocks has been
          emanating strange energy which is said to be strongly linked to Kun
          Mountain. It was carried out from there by the Prime Ancestor of the
          Great West Holy Land on his back…&#8221;
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Young Holy King approached them as he was curious about the stone
          called the Cursed Rock and wanted a look at it. However, many old
          beings of Dark Kun City had kept the Seven Divine Rocks under wraps
          and refused to take them out until the day of the Divine Rock
          Conference.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Young Holy King emanated a regal air which befitted his name and
          his entire body glowed. Even his hair seemed to be made from melted
          gold and shone blindingly with an overwhelming energy, making him
          resemble a moving sun as he walked.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If that unknown stone is as what it&#8217;s claimed to be,
          then we can try cutting it open.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many were shaken by his statement, since every divine rock of Dark
          Kun City was priceless and their value in Spiritual Stones was
          difficult to determine. To many cultivators, their price even exceeded
          any usual Nirvana Grade artifact. That was why only three out of the
          Ten Divine Rocks had been cut open, since many weren&#8217;t certain
          what these rocks contained and were worried they would sustain drastic
          losses.

          >&#8220;Do you know what&#8217;s inside then, Young Master
          Changge?&#8221; A melodious and elegant voice uttered.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many were taken aback, not expecting the extremely mysterious eldest
          princess of the Great Yu Dynasty to approach. She looked extremely
          noble and sophisticated as well as extremely beautiful, with bright
          eyes like stars and neat white teeth. She exuded a light fragrant
          scent as she came towards Gu Changge.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yu Feiya had heard what Gu Changge said, since she had already
          arrived when Gu Xianer discovered the Spiritual Rock of Life. It was
          just that she didn&#8217;t greet him. She had never seen him before,
          so this might be considered their first conversation.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          any memory of her, but it seemed that he didn&#8217;t know her.</span

          >&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge. I&#8217;m Feiya.&#8221; She
          seemed awkward when she realised that Gu Changge didn&#8217;t know her
          but quickly regained her demeanour and greeted him.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yin Mei explained the princess&#8217;s background from behind him,
          which enlightened him somewhat and he smiled. &#8220;No need to be so
          polite, Princess Feiya, I was just curious and don&#8217;t actually
          know what&#8217;s inside that unknown rock.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She smiled gracefully in response and moved her hair away from her
          face. &#8220;I have been tactless. I hope you forgive me, Young Master
          Changge.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had been shocked just now and asked the question instinctively,
          since her target here was that unknown rock. She felt that if the lost
          page from the Great Yu Immortal Scripture was here, then there was a
          high chance it was linked to that rock. However, why would Gu Changge
          say anything if he knew about that?</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The central area of the market was enormous and contained a world of
          its own, with multiple arrays inscribed on the surrounding walls as
          well as palaces and mansions. There were even Dao Artifacts binding
          the place, with rippling bright light enclosing the space while hints
          of their power filled the atmosphere.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There definitely wasn&#8217;t just one present, since the power
          spreading through the atmosphere was enough to make a normal
          cultivator act cautiously. If any of the Dao Artifact awakens, the
          explosion would definitely level the city. Thus, it wasn&#8217;t just
          one Dao Artifact exerting its strength, which showed how much
          importance the different Forces placed on this event.</span

          was mostly important figures who had gathered here which made even the
          leaders of Sects seem like juniors here. Many living fossils were even
          seen studying the unique rocks around the area.</span

          led his companions away, eventually sighing and speaking up in an
          earnest tone. Many who had witnessed the exchange were of a similar

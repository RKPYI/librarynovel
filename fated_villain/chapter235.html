        Chapter 235-1: I learned to oppress others from Gu Changge, The power of
        the Nirvana Green Lotus Body (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "Jiang Yang, what the hell is going on here? Why are all the major
        Sacred Mountains and forbidden areas saying that you stole their divine
        object?"
      </p>
      <p>
        In the hall, the atmosphere was oppressively silent like a volcano that
        was about to erupt.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the Elders and disciples were angry, frightened, uneasy, and
        panicked, as if a great calamity had appeared.
      </p>
      <p>The Holy Master of the Immortal Lun Sect was the first to speak up.</p>
      <p>
        His face was also very gloomy and angry as he was staring closely at
        Jiang Yang, wanting to see through him completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now outside the Immortal Lun Sect, all the major Supreme existences were
        converging, bringing a vast number of cultivators from Sacred Mountains
        and forbidden areas, descending in front of the mountain gate, demanding
        them to hand over the disciple who stole the divine artifact that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The secret revolt was said to have started leading all the way to the
        bloodbath. This had alarmed the entire Heavenly Domain, countless
        cultivators and forces moved to be emboldened.
      </p>
      <p>And the cause of all of this was Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>
        Although the outside world was saying that this scourge had in fact
        already planted the root of the disaster, Jiang Yang's matter was only a
        small trigger. The major Sacred Mountains and forbidden areas wanted to
        take advantage of the opportunity to send chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Immortal Lun Sect was very clear, this matter was actually not
        related to the Immortal Lun Sect at all.
      </p>
      <p>All of it was Jiang Yang‚Äôs fault!</p>
      <p>
        They had the Supreme weapon as their trump card, unless those forbidden
        areas and Sacred Mountains were really stupid, at this time, they
        wouldn‚Äôt dare to fight on their mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now they did not care in the least‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it could only mean that Jiang Yang
        made the major Sacred Mountains and forbidden areas angry to the
        extreme. They already didn‚Äôt care if the Immortal Lun Sect had the
        Supreme weapon!
      </p>
      <p>
        A few days ago, Jiang Yang was covered in blood, wretched from outside
        the mountain gate and escaped back, Holy Master of the Immortal Lun Sect
        still remembered it. Even the Supreme Elder Zhao Yi, also appeared to be
        seriously injured.
      </p>
      <p>What did this mean?</p>
      <p>
        It meant that the two sneaked into those forbidden areas and the Sacred
        Mountains and stole their divine objects, even the Supreme weapon was
        also carried by the Supreme Elder Zhao Yi.
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement was unanimously approved by a group of Elders from the
        Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Yang, you must give us an explanation for this matter, otherwise
        you will be suppressed and sent outside!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Several Elders opened their mouths and snapped, their expressions were
        cold, and they were not ready to suffer this unwarranted implication
        because of Jiang Yang's relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, it's all this guy's fault, he is the one who brought us this
        scourge, if the major Sacred Mountains attack, who can stop it? Now even
        the Ancestor‚Äôs phantom is not manifesting!" Some Elders were angry.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I think Jiang Yang was just lucky to deceive everyone in the first
        place, why don't we take this opportunity to expel him from the sect,
        otherwise it will cause even more terrible calamities!"
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, the hall was filled with the voices of scolding and
        blaming.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this time, the only one still standing beside Jiang Yang was the
        Supreme Elder Zhao Yi, but her majesty was no longer the same as before,
        and several Supreme Sacred Realm Ancestors were present.
      </p>
      <p>Her words were not effective at all.</p>
      <p>Zhao Yi had the intention to help Jiang Yang, but it was useless.</p>
      <p>
        She was also the only person who still believed in Jiang Yang, after
        all, she witnessed Jiang Yang being ambushed and getting attacked by the
        mysterious woman from the Upper Realm that day.
      </p>
      <p>But what was the use of her explanation?</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>Even her position as the Supreme Elder was not stable anymore.</p>
      <p>
        "The major Sacred Mountains have framed me, and you guys actually
        believe it, now even if the Phantom of the Immortal Lun Ancestor does
        not appear, with the Immortal Lun Seal suppressing everything, do you
        still need to care about the major Sacred Mountains and forbidden
        areas?"
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene made Jiang Yang, whose face was already not very good, even
        harder to see.
      </p>
      <p>It was really a family banter.</p>
      <p>Now even the Immortal Lun Sect was messing with him.</p>
      <p>
        The fortune of the entire Immortal Lun Sect gradually shifted and no
        longer fell on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang even felt that in the dark, it was like there was an
        invisible hand that took away his fortune.
      </p>
      <p>This made him feel uneasy.</p>
      <p>
        It was the first time that this feeling was so strong and he had never
        encountered it before.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Jiang Yang was so strong-minded that he was still forcing
        himself to calm down.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who is really counting on me? The mysterious woman that day, what
        exactly is her origin? Why did she already know my identity?"
      </p>
      <p>His heart was gloomy.</p>
      <p>
        "It's useless to talk more, at this time, you still want us to be
        implicated by you? To take the blame for what you have committed?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words of Jiang Yang, the expressions of the rest of the
        Elders in the main hall changed drastically and they looked even more
        furious.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was close to pointing at Jiang Yang and cursing for his
        shamelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Lun Sect had kindly cultivated him, but he had not only
        caused trouble for the Immortal Lun Sect, but at this time, he still
        acted as if he was rightfully prepared to let everyone bear the burden
        along with him?
      </p>
      <p>
        What the hell was this? Even the white-eyed wolves were not like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang smiled, frowned even more tightly and shouted, "Shut up, it's
        just a bunch of fools who can't tell right from wrong."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancestor of the Immortal Lun Sect had a great connection with him,
        and he had even helped him to enlighten the clan back then.
      </p>
      <p>Without him, where would the Immortal Lun Sect be?</p>
      <p>How dare these fools turn around and blame him now?</p>
      <p>"Arrogant!"</p>
      <p>"You are seeking death!"</p>
      <p>
        It was fine if Jiang Yang didn't speak, but as soon as he did, the crowd
        was even more shocked and angry, their faces turned iron blue, not
        expecting him to dare to be so arrogant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day Jiang Yang offended that mysterious Immortal from the Upper
        Realm, it already made many people angry with him, but because of the
        identity of Yaoyao, they did not dare to blame Jiang Yang too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now with his temperament, he really wanted to invite a big disaster for
        the Immortal Lun Sect!
      </p>
      <p>
        "At this time, there is no need to say more, someone, bring Jiang Yang
        and escort him to the mountain gate and hand him over to the people from
        the Sacred Mountains and the forbidden areas." Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are

      </p>
      <p>
        "From today Jiang Yang is expelled from the sect, what he did has
        nothing to do with my Immortal Lun Sect."
      </p>

        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        At this time, the Holy Master of Immortal Lun Sect, whose face was
        already hard to see, waved his big hand and said directly to forcefully
        take Jiang Yang down.
      </p>
      <p>
        As his words fell, strong auras of several Elders immediately surged in
        the middle of the hall and surrounded Jiang Yang in unison.
      </p>
      <p>"Stop‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Zhao Yi's expression changed slightly to make a move to
        stop it, but a Supreme Sacred realm Elder coldly snorted and his big
        hand probed out towards her to be treated as a traitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently that mysterious Immortal from the Upper Realm was suspected of
        falling within the Netherland Heavenly Pond, resulting in a change in
        the situation in the heavenly domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many forces and cultivators were affected by the situation, and were
        eager to move.
      </p>
      <p>The first to bear the brunt was naturally the Immortal Lun Sect.</p>
      <p>
        Now the outside forces all knew that the cause of the secret revolt was
        because of the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        If handing over Jiang Yang could calm the outside world's anger, they
        would be relieved.
      </p>
      <p>"Expel me from the sect?"</p>
      <p>
        A cold flash appeared in Jiang Yang's eyes, he did not expect that the
        Immortal Lun Sect would really dare to do it?
      </p>
      <p>
        The words of the Holy Master of Immortal Lun Sect contained great divine
        power, which instantly spread out from the main hall and echoed outside
        under the sky dome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone heard these words and had different expressions, shocked,
        puzzled, dumbfounded, etc.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang was expelled from the Immortal Lun Sect?</p>
      <p>That Immortal Lun Sect was about to compromise?</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, the secret revolt broke out, and the
        Immortal Lun Sect became the most eye-catching place in the Heavenly
        Domain, and many forces and cultivators gathered outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that this Immortal Lun Sect is still smart and knows what to
        do at this time."
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the mountain gate of the Immortal Lun Sect, a burly,
        double-horned creature, shrouded in thick black fog, couldn't help but
        sneer and said with a powerful divine aura on his body, and he was the
        Lord of a Sacred Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mighty creatures were like a large black cloud, surging, covering
        the sky and blocking the sun, standing on the horizon, wanting to attack
        the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hand over that disciple, or Immortal Lun Sect will be buried here
        today!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lord of the Sacred Mountain opened his mouth and stood on the edge
        of the sky. His voice was like thunder, and it exploded in the sky,
        making countless hearts tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the other direction, there was also the forbidden area, the Lord of
        the Forbidden area had appeared, his aura was surging and it was
        amazing, and he wanted to besiege the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        This secret revolt had swept across the sky, and today it was even more
        eye-catching. Everyone's eyes were gathered here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The words of the Holy Master of Immortal Lun Sect were not showing his
        attitude?
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Yang was expelled from the Immortal Lun Sect?"</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong's expression was deep and calm. Her figure appeared on the
        top of a mountain, standing far away, but she could clearly see
        everything that happened outside the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind her, a group of terrifying creatures were kneeling down, either
        shrouded in dark mist or the runes or shrouded in the laws and rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the rest of the powerhouses of the Heavenly Domain were here, their
        eyes would widen in shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        These creatures were all terrifying existences in the major Sacred
        Mountains and forbidden areas.
      </p>
      <p>Now they were actually kneeling in front of a woman?</p>
      <p>This was so shocking.</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 235-2: I learned to oppress others from Gu Changge, The power of
        the Nirvana Green Lotus Body (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "But that's not enough, unless Jiang Yang uses all means, he won't be
        able to escape‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong said lightly.</p>
      <p>
        She knew the origin of Jiang Yang and the Ancestor of Immortal Lun Sect,
        so she would not despise Jiang Yang. She also understood the power of
        Jiang Yang's Reincarnation Seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was unlikely that she wanted to kill Jiang Yang, but she could use
        her many means to get rid of Jiang Yang's tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, didn't the Immortal Lun Sect have to break their relationship with
        Jiang Yang?
      </p>
      <p>
        This was just as she expected, Immortal Lun Sect could not be an enemy
        of the entire world just because of a disciple!
      </p>
      <p>
        Her way of framing people was completely learned from Gu Changge.
        Although she didn't have the enthusiasm of Gu Changge, it was enough to
        oppress Jiang Yang at this time!
      </p>
      <p>
        After receiving the order of Yue Mingkong, the group of powerhouses who
        were kneeling got up one after another and rushed outside the Immortal
        Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hand over that disciple, otherwise Immortal Lun Sect will be destroyed
        here today!"
      </p>
      <p>A mighty voice sounded outside the Immortal Lun Sect.</p>
      <p>
        Accompanied by the shocking murderous aura, many disciples of the
        Immortal Lun Sect below went pale and extremely frightened, as if they
        had encountered a disaster.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        There was a Quasi-Sacred Realm cultivator, who raised his palm which was
        falling towards the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>The runes were vast and evolved into powerful laws!</p>
      <p>
        It was as if the sky was falling down, covering everything, causing the
        mountain protection formation of the Immortal Lun Sect to make a
        terrifying cracking sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a critical moment, a tyrannical divine aura rose from the Immortal
        Lun Sect into the sky, blocking the palm, and did not let it fall, so as
        not to destroy the mountain protection formation.
      </p>
      <p>How terrifying was the presence of the Sacred Realm?</p>
      <p>
        If it was outside the domain, just a breath could shatter the ancient
        star of life, and it was boundless.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, all the creatures felt a dazzling light, as if it
        contained the power of countless laws, and it exploded with a bang!
      </p>
      <p>In the sky, it seemed like a dazzling sun had burst.</p>
      <p>
        The light was extremely dazzling, and the void was blasted, leaving a
        vast expanse of white.
      </p>
      <p>
        The forces and powerful beings that were secretly watching were now all
        stunned and felt a chill!
      </p>
      <p>"No, the mountain protection formation is cracked‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        In the Immortal Lun Sect, countless disciples were shocked and stunned
        when they saw that scene from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>Afterwards, everyone was terrified and desperate!</p>
      <p>
        Because with the rupture of the mountain protection formation, the
        mighty creatures in the forbidden area of ??the Sacred Mountain outside
        the Immortal Lun Sect were killed.
      </p>
      <p>This was a pure land-like area.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, it was full of murderous intentions and unwilling roars,
        and the God Kings collapsed, turning into robbed soil and broken walls.
      </p>
      <p>The runes were shining like an ocean.</p>

      <p>Everyone was yelling.</p>
      <p>
        For a time, a strong sense of resentment began to appear in the
        buildings on the peaks of the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since you insist on doing this, there is no need for the Immortal Lun
        Sect to exist today!"
      </p>
      <p>
        In the hall, seeing someone shoot at him, Jiang Yang's expression
        suddenly became very cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had already given Immortal Lun Sect the last chance. He had planned
        to drive back the enemies outside before heading to the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p>But at this time, Immortal Lun Sect had become his enemy!</p>
      <p>
        It was the first time such a thing had happened since he reincarnated so
        many times.
      </p>
      <p>As the words fell, Jiang Yang started to make a move!</p>
      <p>
        His methods were amazing, the dazzling brilliance emerged under the palm
        of his hand, like a piece of light rain, accompanied by a great aura.
      </p>
      <p>The Immortal Lun Sect was trembling!</p>
      <p>
        Under the ground, as if there was something that was about to wake up,
        the four directions were rolling in, turning into a surging and amazing
        power of heaven and earth, used by Jiang Yang!
      </p>
      <p>"What?"</p>
      <p>
        "What's going on? How did Jiang Yang's strength suddenly become so
        strong?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "How is this possible‚Ä¶ How could Immortal Lun Seal be used by Jiang
        Yang, this‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        The expressions of the Elders of the Immortal Lun Sect, including the
        Holy Master, changed greatly, and they were shocked by Jiang Yang's
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then their backs froze, their souls trembled, and they felt a deep sense
        of danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this kind of aura, they almost fell to their knees, and their body
        collapsed!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        It was at this moment that a terrifying aura that was about to destroy
        the world appeared from the depths of the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        One side of the incomparably crystal clear big seal was hanging down
        with a terrifying chaotic aura, which circulated the Supreme aura and
        rose there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the help of many tricks, Jiang Yang once again urged Immortal Lun
        Seal, and this time the divine might was far more terrifying than the
        last time!
      </p>
      <p>"This is‚Ä¶ Immortal Lun Seal‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"How can that be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        "Who the hell are you? Why can you easily use this thing, even for the
        Quasi-Sacred Realm, it is difficult to use it like this!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lords of the Sacred Mountain and the forbidden area who appeared on
        the horizon were extremely shocked and something unexpected happened.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        They didn't know Jiang Yang's identity, but with the existence of the
        Upper Realm behind them, they would naturally not dare to ask more if
        they wanted to kill Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn't expect that Jiang Yang would be able to use such means at
        this time.
      </p>
      <p>To be honest, Jiang Yang's move had shocked the world!</p>
      <p>
        At this time, when Jiang Yang heard the words, he simply flew into the
        horizon, looking at the enemies from all directions, his expression was
        indifferent, and he was contemptuous.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just you? You dare to take action against me. All of those who come
        here today will be destroyed here."
      </p>
      <p>"You're worthy to question me, Jiang Yang?"</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he no longer explained, and just took the opportunity to
        let the world understand that he was not a soft persimmon, could anyone
        really bully him in the face?
      </p>
      <p>
        As the words fell, Jiang Yang raised his hand, and the terrifying
        terrain turned into a surging force, rushing into the Immortal Lun Seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the Luck of heaven and earth from the four directions
        accumulated by the Immortal Lun Sect for millions of years!
      </p>
      <p>Now, all of them were for his use!</p>
      <p>
        "Very good, at this time Jiang Yang used this means, then I do not
        believe that he can still have much of any tricks left ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Once all his tricks are exhausted, the chances of killing him will be
        even greater. Fortunately, he was not allowed to return to the Upper
        Realm, within the Heavenly Star Realm, there are not many means that the
        reincarnated body of the Human Ancestor can use."
      </p>
      <p>
        Far away, Yue Mingkong looked at the scene with a calm expression, and
        various thoughts flashed in her mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wasn't surprised at all, and even gave birth to a strange feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her plan and action to calculate Jiang Yang this time wasn‚Äôt too smooth?
      </p>
      <p>
        So much so that she had a feeling that there was someone in the dark who
        was helping her?
      </p>
      <p>Then how else would she explain the previous accident.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang went ahead to the appointment and mistook her for the heir of
        the Human Ancestor Hall, was it really a coincidence? Yue Mingkong did
        not believe Jiang Yang would be that stupid.
      </p>
      <p>And she subconsciously thought of Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Could it be that Gu Changge noticed her whereabouts and secretly
        followed her and headed to the Lower Realm?
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong thought of the mysterious Immortal from the Upper Realm
        from some time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more she thought about it, the more she thought it was very likely.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he descended to the Xuan Domain and unified all the powers there,
        then in the name of recruiting disciples, he was actually searching for
        the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor?
      </p>
      <p>It was just that, in that case, there was a big loophole.</p>
      <p>
        If that mysterious Immortal was Gu Changge, then why didn't he take
        action to solve Jiang Yang after he came to the Immortal Lun Sect, but
        stayed until now?
      </p>
      <p>
        So Yue Mingkong felt that either she was overthinking, or there was
        something else that she hadn't considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wasn‚Äôt that Immortal suspected to have fallen in the Netherland Heavenly
        Pond?
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of news, not seeing it with her own eyes, she actually did not
        believe it.
      </p>
      <p>"Not good!"</p>
      <p>
        "This Jiang Yang is so ruthless, he wants to kill everyone, including
        us!"
      </p>
      <p>"Why is he able to activate the Immortal Lun Seal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        And in the next moment, everyone within the Immortal Lun Sect reacted
        and became terrified, their faces turned pale, desperate, horrified,
        unable to believe and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with the blinding divine light that emerged from the Immortal Lun
        Seal, it appeared incomparably bright.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You all brought this on yourselves." Jiang Yang said with a cold and
        indifferent expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, in his hand, a corner of the supreme formation pattern
        revived, beams of light intertwined, as if it were turning into the only
        color in heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 235-3: I learned to oppress others from Gu Changge, The power of
        the Nirvana Green Lotus Body (3)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Everyone‚Äôs expression changed, frightened to the extreme, at this time,
        there was no other emotion except despair, resentment, regret.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Something big has happened‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The Supreme Weapon of the Immortal Lun
        Sect is revived and it‚Äôs going to exterminate everyone."
      </p>
      <p>
        "This guy is crazy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ He won't even spare the Immortal Lun Sect, this is
        to deceive the Master and destroy the Ancestor!"
      </p>
      <p>
        All living beings and cultivators were fleeing to the distance for fear
        of being affected by this aura, their faces pale and horrified with
        fear, their hearts palpitating.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rumble!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, no matter what kind of existence, as long as they
        dared to block in front, they were blown into pieces, within a hundred
        thousand miles, everything turned into pieces, dissipated in the dust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the most powerful creatures and cultivators watching the battle in
        the distant sky were also terrified and appalled to the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching with their own eyes, the Immortal Lun Seal exploded with
        Supreme divine might, destroying the heavens and earth, trembling and
        shaking the universe, wiping out all incoming enemies!
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, including the place where the Immortal Lun Sect was
        originally located, it also turned into dust under this breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power that had been passed down for more than a million years,
        including all the disciples and Elders, could not even resist under the
        divine power of the Supreme Weapon, and were instantly destroyed in
        smoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's move horrified everyone and sent chills down their backs!
      </p>
      <p>
        How many enemies had he killed? Even the Immortal Lun Sect was not
        spared?
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Yang really escaped after this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Runes flickered in Yue Mingkong's eyes, and the Quasi-Supreme weapon
        behind her erupted with dazzling light, resisting these aftershocks and
        penetrating deeper into the ruins of the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>But Jiang Yang's figure was actually not there.</p>
      <p>
        After overwhelming the surrounding enemies, Jiang Yang had already left.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for where he would go, Yue Mingkong had actually guessed, except that
        Jiang Yang's move of destroying his own walls made her somewhat shocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        She could only say that he was worthy of the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor, his means were really tough and ruthless, treating the
        Immortal Lun Sect was same as treating the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that in this way, Jiang Yang lost his most favorable helper,
        equivalent to breaking his own arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most advantageous help was the loss of the Immortal Lun Sect, she
        did not believe that Jiang Yang had any other stronger trick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the Immortal Lun Sect was destroyed, turned into ashes, millions
        of years of heritage was destroyed in a single day, causing a shock to
        the entire Heavenly Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Including the many Lords of Sacred Mountains, forbidden areas and other
        people who launched the secret revolt that day, were also all destroyed
        in the middle, shocking everyone, and causing countless people to be
        terrified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, those guys were the ones that Yue Mingkong found to use as
        cannon fodder to consume Jiang Yang's move.

        Even if they did not die here, in the end, she would find a way to solve
        them, so as not to leave traces of her existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, the story of a disciple of the Immortal Lun Sect who had
        deceived his Master and destroyed his Ancestor, using the Immortal Lun
        Seal and exterminated the Immortal Lun Sect, spread all over the world,
        causing countless people to be appalled.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for how he activated that Immortal Lun Seal, it had become a mystery
        and suspense that no one knew about!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Supreme weapon left behind by the Immortal Lun Supreme ultimately
        destroyed the sect he left behind.
      </p>
      <p>How ironic was this?</p>
      <p>
        And in the underworld, a kind of great momentum had changed, and the
        fortune that the Immortal Lun Sect had accumulated for millions of years
        was shifting because of this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The change in the Luck of the Heavenly Star Realm was especially clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, who was in the depths of the Netherland Heavenly Pond, also
        felt this change in the underworld most profoundly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, Jiang Yang, the Son of Luck, has broken up with the Immortal Lun
        Sect‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Ding, the Son of Luck destroyed the Immortal Lun Sect‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        With a series of system prompts, he inexplicably obtained a large amount
        of Luck points from Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although these were all things done by Yue Mingkong, Yue Mingkong was
        his person, and her changes were also closely related to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of Luck points alone was more than 20,000, and the Destiny
        value even reached a huge 100,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly, Jiang Yang was worthy of being the Reincarnation of the Son of
        Luck, just the Luck points he carried had reached a level that could be
        called unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the surfacing of Jiang Yang's many tricks, his Luck points were
        still growing and changing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that, now, no matter how much more Jiang Yang's Luck points
        grew, it had fallen to a level that could be called low!
      </p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge's eyes, only the last hint of grass to collapse the camel
        was missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, according to the normal trajectory, the Immortal Lun Sect
        would definitely serve as a springboard for Jiang Yang's development,
        allowing him to pass through this preliminary period peacefully.
      </p>
      <p>Now that Jiang Yang destroyed his springboard with his own hands.</p>
      <p>
        This would be tantamount to destroying the walls of the city itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This girl Yue Mingkong has saved me some effort this time, she's a lot
        smarter than before and knows how to carry a big momentum in order to
        press people‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"By the way, it gave me a lot of time to delay again."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge couldn't help but smile, still seated within the Lotus body
        of that Nirvana Green Lotus, intending to completely refine it away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength of the Nirvana Green Lotus body lay in the power of the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, Gu Changge was devouring this horrible talent with his demonic
        heart, and all the 60 trillion cells in his body were undergoing
        metamorphosis.

        Later, a single cell would be an ancient and vast universe world,
        infinite power could suppress everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of body could accommodate the power of the Human Ancestor of
        all worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, the Human Ancestor would not have calculated for so long, and
        spent so much effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this kind of body, why worry about the power that he could not
        withstand. Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
      </p>
      <p>Now, Gu Changge easily got this good thing without any effort.</p>
      <p>
        Although his own physical strength was strong, it was not yet to the
        point where it couldn‚Äôt be compared with anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this Nirvana Green Lotus, his power could definitely transcend to
        another horrific level.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the blink of an eye, several days passed, the area outside the
        Netherland Heavenly Pond, the mountains and rivers were magnificent,
        ancient trees were in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        An old woman and a young girl, two people, came rushing here, the
        younger one wearing a simple dress, her face was exquisitely flawless,
        with a resolute look.
      </p>
      <p>It was Yaoyao.</p>
      <p>
        Next to her was her grandma, the two of them left the Immortal Lun Sect,
        and then rushed all the way here, because there was no warship, flying
        boat, etc., so their speed was not very fast.
      </p>
      <p>It took many days to get here.</p>
      <p>
        About the life and death of her own Master, Yaoyao wanted to personally
        determine the truth, even if her Master fell, she still wanted to find
        the remains of the Master in order to bury him.
      </p>
      <p>
        With such thoughts, she now looked ahead with her own eyes at the
        majestic mountain range shrouded by a Chaotic mist, her face was also a
        bit white, and could not help but give birth to a kind of palpitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a radius of 10,000 miles, it seemed very quiet, not to mention
        the cultivators, even the ferocious beasts could not be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this deadly silent atmosphere, it could be seen that the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond was definitely a dangerous place, and this journey would
        not be too smooth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master is inside, I should not be afraid, Master also said that I am a
        great person, I want to move forward to find him!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was talking to herself, clenching her little hand and cheering
        herself up to not be afraid at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, you really are here, how can you come to the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond? Brother has searched for you for a long time."
      </p>
      <p>
        "After I returned to the Immortal Lun Sect, you disappeared and didn't
        let anyone give your brother a word, it really made me worry a lot."
      </p>
      <p>
        However, just at this time, Yaoyao, who was considering where to go
        ahead, suddenly heard a familiar voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Granny Yinhua beside her, who was on alert, suddenly became sweaty and
        felt a chill.
      </p>
      <p>Behind a huge mountain rock, accompanied by the sound of footsteps.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's figure appeared, with the once Immortal Lun Sect's Supreme
        Elder Zhao Yi behind him, looking at Yaoyao with surprise, concern and
        other emotions.
      </p>
      <p>It was a surprise to him to find Yaoyao here.</p>
      <p>
        He guessed that this girl would definitely not be able to sit tight and
        would rush to the Netherland Heavenly Pond to look for her Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's surprised expression was not a fake, he did not care about
        the destruction of Immortal Lun Sect, as for things such as power, it
        was completely no match for the Netherland Heavenly Pool.
      </p>
      <p>The existence of Yaoyao, for him, was also like this.</p>

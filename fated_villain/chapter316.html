<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge said nothing but took an inexplicable glance at Jia Nan. He naturally wouldn&#8217;t state his name at this time. After all, he had even concealed his face. So, this princess might not find out his true identity even if she investigated later.</span><span id="more-28407"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, he should be recuperating in Black Tortoise Empire, unable to go anywhere else. Thus, he ignored this question entirely and stated his demand instead. &#8220;How many Eternal Overcast Sources from the Land of Eternal Overcast do you guys have at hand?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eternal Overcast Sources?&#8221; Jia Nan was taken aback. She wasn&#8217;t really bothered that Gu Changge didn&#8217;t talk about himself, nor his background. However, she was honestly a little surprised and unsure why he would ask about the Eternal Overcast Sources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By right, as a human cultivator, even as mysterious and powerful as Gu Changge could get, he should be avoiding something that could devour most matters like the Eternal Overcast Sources at all cost.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Has he actually come to find the Eternal Overcast Sources in hopes of finding a way to crack it? Or what other explanation is there?] As the thought crossed her mind, Jia Nan felt a little impressed by his bravery. After all, the Eternal Overcast Sources was something that not even the Eternal Overcast Kingdom would want anything to do with. Moreover, the birth of an Eternal Overcast Source was very mysterious. Even if they had some stored, there weren&#8217;t many of them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, they were compelled to place it in a certain area to create some crisis, because the Eternal Overcast Source would spread like the wind to a wildfire, unstoppable, once it started.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, the many Eternal Overcast Fog in the Upper Realm actually had nothing to do with the Eternal Overcast Kingdom. In fact, her arrival here was due to the sudden eruption of Yin Energy and expansion of the Eternal Overcast Fog.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We actually have a shortage ourselves, but I can still give you some if you want. As for what will happen after you touch upon the Eternal Overcast Sources, I&#8217;m sure you know well. I don&#8217;t want to see you getting devoured by the Eternal Overcast Source before our exchange is complete,&#8221; Jia Nan emphasised, to which Gu Changge nodded plainly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry about that, Your Highness. I&#8217;m well aware of this.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221; Jia Nan nodded while pulling out a black token from within her sleeve. It looked like a chess piece, but Gu Changge could feel the spatial fluctuations contained within.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a Space Piece. I will use this to inform you if anything comes up, and also, I&#8217;ll transport the Eternal Overcast Source you need through this thing,&#8221; Jia Nan disclosed as she handed the black chess piece, forged by unknown material, to Gu Changge, who scrutinised it after taking it. &#8220;Forged from the bones of a void beast.&#8221; He nodded. “No wonder it has such properties.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a sliver of indescribable emotion laced Jia Nan&#8217;s eyes upon hearing him, but she said nothing more.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wouldn&#8217;t be easy to forge the Reincarnation Platform, and there were still many arrangements to be made. Plus, at Gu Changge&#8217;s current cultivation level, in her opinion, was still unachievable. Thus, Jia Nan bid him farewell and left shortly after, heading back on the black boat with the others from the Kingdom, with no intention of descending onto the outside world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man in purple and gold armour, on the other hand, took a dreaded glance at Gu Changge from afar. The fear and apprehension he had experienced earlier still haunted him, and he couldn&#8217;t get over it for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had no idea what his sister and Gu Changge said for her to choose to turn the boat around and head back to the Eternal Overcast Kingdom, but the trauma Gu Changge left him would surely follow him for some time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Interesting. The existence of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom can indeed be considered a pawn to me.] Gu Changge smiled thoughtfully as he looked at the black Space Piece in his hands after withdrawing his gaze from watching Jia Nan leave. He then chucked the Space Piece into storage and also sealed off the wisp of divine sense attached to it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that her divine sense was attached to the Space Piece, then again, it could also be a sliver of her Divine Soul, but either way, she could not possibly fool him. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm, she had a plethora of means, but Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t be bothered to expose her as this sliver of her Divine Soul might actually come in handy in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, given that this Divine Soul might detect his whereabouts and whatnot, Gu Changge sealed off this Space Piece and the connection it had to her, tantamount to trapping it all in the chess piece.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, perhaps not even Jia Nan was aware that she had pretty much voluntarily handed her weakness over to Gu Changge.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the news Jia Nan would deliver to him, Gu Changge had no intentions of bothering about it to begin with. Once the Eternal Overcast Source was in his hands, he would have the final say in everything, no? Thereafter, in a flash, he travelled to the area he had sensed the Eternal Overcast Source earlier.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over there, vast dark energy surged, extremely thick grey mist rolled, and incredibly ancient runes twinkled, looking like the purest source of the universe, which couldn&#8217;t be dated, formed by hundreds of millions of black light, which could devour everything. The Principles, Great Dao, and space near the area were constantly crumbling, reforming, and finally merging chaotically. Even a Sacred Emperor Realm expert could feel their hearts palpitating when they see such a sight..</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Eternal Overcast Source! And from the looks of it, a pretty sizable one. At least, it is over five times bigger than the last one I devoured. It seems that as it spreads and devours, even space and Principles are being broken down. Guess not even runes made by a Sacred Emperor expert could hold off against this.]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!!* The Grand Flask appeared above Gu Changge&#8217;s head, emitting a horrifying glow that could seemingly devour everything. Even the Eternal Overcast Source was subtly shaking, as though it met its natural predator. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grand Flask tipped over and stored the galaxy-like dark light in it. Meanwhile, Gu Changge sat still, cross-legged. The vast divine light tipped over and enveloped him entirely, making him look like an ancient god. His energy levels were rising non-stop as colourful light burst out from his every cell, like they had awoken as the Mist of Chaos surged and spread. He looked exceptionally obscure, tinged with otherworldliness, mystery and enigma.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black boat travelled quickly within the grey mist, leaving the area. Meanwhile, a barely noticeable tunnel, which was connected to another enigmatic world, appeared, which split apart the spatial barrier.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An average cultivator wouldn&#8217;t have been able to notice such tunnels as this was an Eternal Overcast Tunnel, one that belonged solely to Eternal Overcast creatures.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the boat, the man in purple and gold armour stood fearfully in front of Jia Nan. Despite being in the Sacred King Realm, he was cowering. &#8220;Sister…&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Nan, on the other hand, was sitting on her throne. Her face was delicate, her hair was long and luscious, and her gaze, like a goddess, was noble and aloof. &#8220;You fool.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man&#8217;s countenance turned awful as he became even more apprehensive upon hearing so. &#8220;Please forgive me, Sister. It&#8217;s that human man. He bullied us when I didn&#8217;t do anything to him at all,&#8221; he said with a shaky voice, absolutely fearful of Jia Nan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the Eternal Overcast Kingdom knew of the Eldest Princess&#8217; domineering reputation. In fact, even the old emperor of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom was somewhat fearful of her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to pursue this matter. That human man is our kingdom&#8217;s esteemed guest. Don&#8217;t mess with him if you see him again,&#8221; Jia Nan announced plainly as she looked at her brother with impassiveness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Sister.&#8221; the man in purple and gold armour acknowledged immediately. As aggrieved as he felt, he dared not say another word. After all, it was Gu Changge who started it and gave him a serious injury. Yet, not only did his sister, the Eldest Princess of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom, not avenge him, but she even declared the human man to be their kingdom&#8217;s esteemed guest!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As indignant as he felt, he was even more apprehensive. [Just who the heck is that human man?!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright, please leave.&#8221; Jia Nan waved her hand, motioning her brother to leave after taking a plain glance at him. Of course, she knew what he was thinking, but she couldn&#8217;t care less.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the man in purple and gold armour left, Jia Nan suddenly furrowed her brows, and a hint of surprise flashed across her deadpan face. &#8220;He has discovered?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&#8217;t think Gu Changge would notice the sliver of Divine Soul she had snuck onto the Space Piece so quickly and even seal off the consciousness right away. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Nan never doubted Gu Changge&#8217;s Oath at that time. After all, it was the most serious oath a cultivator could make. No one would dare disregard it.  That said, the man agreed to the exchange too easily. It raised a red flag within her, and she thought she needed to probe and keep an eye on him. Thus, because of the Space Piece&#8217;s unique properties, an average cultivator would never have noticed that she had snuck her Divine Soul into it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original plan was to first use the opportunity to observe Gu Changge for a time, so she didn&#8217;t mind, even if the latter noticed it later. But she honestly couldn&#8217;t believe that he would discover that sliver of her Divine Soul so quickly and even cut off its connection to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why do I have this nagging feeling that this so-called Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being is not good… Alas, one has to expect the worst when negotiating an impossible request…&#8221; Jia Nan sighed with furrowed brows but withdrew from the strange emotion quickly and kept an eye open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven days passed in the blink of an eye, and Jiang Chuchu started feeling relieved when she looked at the thinning Yin Energy from outside the crack. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like Gu Changge has resolved this.&#8221; Even when she had witnessed how Gu Changge took care of the previous Eternal Overcast crisis, she would still feel somewhat worried. After all, compared to the last one, this was multiple times more severe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last time, Gu Changge got tainted with Yin Energy and suffered a significant injury. This time, even if it went smoothly, he probably hadn&#8217;t resolved it easily. Plus, Eternal Overcast creatures in the Sacred Emperor Realm might get involved.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young prodigies were already defenceless against a Sacred Lord Realm creature and could only run away. So imagine how puny they would be to a creature in the Sacred King Realm, when it could obliterate them easily with nothing more than a puff of breath.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge was mighty, it didn&#8217;t mean he was invincible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Jiang Chuchu heaved a sigh of relief, knowing Gu Changge had most probably dealt with this Eternal Overcast crisis successfully when the Eternal Overcast Fog was thinning and the number of Eternal Overcast creatures was decreasing. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something like dealing with Eternal Overcast crisis was supposedly the job of the Mortal One and the Successor of Mortal Palace. But now, it was Gu Changge, the Successor of Demonic Arts, who was dealing with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mixed emotions surged within Jiang Chuchu as this crossed her mind. If it weren&#8217;t for her, Gu Changge probably wouldn&#8217;t intervene in something like this at all.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, as Jiang Chuchu let her thoughts run wild, a celestial light emerged from within the crack and transformed into a vast golden tunnel. Barely any Eternal Overcast Fog could even get close to it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had returned, and his energy didn&#8217;t feel any different from usual. However, Gu Changge was well aware that his powers had elevated after devouring this Eternal Overcast Source.</span></p>

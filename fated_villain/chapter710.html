        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavy fog cloaked the depths of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom. It cast thick shadows which made the place resemble a ghost realm. The world and its Principles were damaged. Here, everything was grey and had no other colour.</span><span id="more-36173"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Six Great Ancestors of the Eternal Overcast, who guarded the three mysterious ancient wells, stood at the highest point of the Eternal Overcast homeland and looked emotionlessly below. They seemed to have existed since the founding of the world, cold and ancient, while cloaked in the grey fog. Their dead gazes were filled with coldness, cruelty, and hollowness. There were even visible signs of decomposition and livor mortis on their limbs, which stretched out from the cloud of fog surrounding them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eternal Overcast Beings felt shaken, holding the desire to submit. They suddenly felt the urge to worship in the direction of the six. In the direction of the depths of the kingdom. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Six Great Ancestors had built the entire Eternal Overcast, with all its Beings. In the past, only one Ancestor had exited seclusion when a tumultuous event occurred. This was the first time since the founding of the Eternal Overcast that all six Ancestors had appeared together. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those ordinary Eternal Overcast Beings did not know what that signified. It was only those with purer bloodlines and strong cultivation that noticed something was off..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a palace within the Eternal Overcast Kingdom, Jia Nan was resolving some issues with a frown when she suddenly sensed the powerful fluctuation from the homeland. She couldn&#8217;t help but stand up and look towards it with worry, shock, and concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Only very few know about the emergence of our Ancestors. Why have all six of them come out together? What alerted them?] She frowned and quickly put down her work before transforming into a divine rainbow and heading towards where they were. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also sent out alerts to the remaining experts of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom, to rush there as well. Besides the Six Great Ancestors, there were also many old experts who were True Daoists. They could hold their own even if they were inferior compared to the Six Great Ancestors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Has something gone wrong on Xiao Jiu&#8217;s end? Did Gu Changge sneak into that place?] She became anxious and concerned that Gu Changge had noticed something, so she quickly went past layers of barriers to head into a barren and uneven land. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into the thick grey fog, she soon found the Six Great Ancestors in their homeland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Has something happened?&#8221; Jia Nan asked respectfully.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nothing much. It may have been Gu Changge snooping around here, quickly retreating after being sensed by us,&#8221; one Ancestor replied without any inflection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t resist after all.&#8221; Jia Nan&#8217;s expression darkened. She had assigned Jia Jiuer to observe Gu Changge&#8217;s movements but he still had secretly sneaked into their homeland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He might not have sensed anything since he was already discovered just after he sneaked inside.&#8221; Another Ancestor didn&#8217;t think that Gu Changge could find anything in such a short time, and they had no proof that what they felt was him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Nan realised then that Gu Changge had been sensed simultaneously by the Six Great Ancestors when he set foot in their homeland. After all, their divinse senses were extremely sensitive after living for countless years. Not to mention, the six Great Ancestors had their homeland and ancient wells. Here, they were nearly Immortals, who possessed unimaginable strength and powers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If that&#8217;s true, then I&#8217;m reassured.&#8221; Jia Nan exhaled in relief and left silently, no longer disturbing the Six Great Ancestors. Since Gu Changge had already known of their existence, he might not be brave enough to act recklessly during the next few days. It might be a powerful threat from a certain viewpoint.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So there are six relics hidden here. Their aura is too rotten though.] Gu Changge rose slowly to his feet inside his palace. A strong wave of energy appeared between his eyes, which the minuscule figure of his Primordial Spirit headed towards and disappeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was surprised by the discovery. He had already known that the Yin Energy of the Eternal Overcast was deteriorating, but did not think that it had birthed six old monsters, who had clung onto life for who knows how long. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their ancient decomposing aura resembled that of a corpse, which had rotted within its coffin for aeons. Of course, the most astounding thing was that their divine sense and Spiritual Energy was overpowering, far exceeding what True Daoists could achieve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did the energy flowing through them develop the Eternal Overcast into its current state? Or has the so-called Origin of the Eternal Overcast shaped all this?] Gu Changge became immersed in his thoughts. He kept having the sense that someone was plotting all of this. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was the Eternal Overcast so focused on constructing the Reincarnation Platform? He hadn&#8217;t even wanted to do it before coming to the Eternal Overcast, only intending to get the Eternal Overcast Sources before leaving. Judging by the current circumstances, he might have no choice but to do so. He wasn&#8217;t worried that the Eternal Overcast Kingdom might suddenly make a move on him since they wouldn&#8217;t dare make any complaint before the successful completion of the Reincarnation Platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was destined to be a troublesome night for the Eternal Overcast. The Six Great Ancestors had appeared within the depths of their homeland, standing tall enough to reach the sky while surrounded by thick smoke. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It made a shocking sight which made many of their people desire to submit. No one besides Jia Nan knew what had happened, which had disturbed the Six Great Ancestors. Still, nearly all the shocked Eternal Overcast Beings prayed in that direction, while feeling anxious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why have all the Great Ancestors collectively appeared?&#8221; Murmured an extremely powerful Eternal Overcast Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Jiuer was similarly shaken by this as well and was unable to stop herself from worshipping in the direction of the homeland. She then looked towards the quiet palace, where Ah Da remained standing. He was like a frightening demonic mountain, emanating a cold aura of hostility and violence. She did not dare approach, not even to verify her guess that the disturbance of the Six Great Ancestors was connected to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following day, black crystals carved with strange patterns and wordings stood in piles on a large square at the centre of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom. They looked well cut and came from somewhere unknown, surrounded by a faint aura of death. Even the Eternal Overcast Beings, who went near it, felt as though their souls were being frozen. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, lay on the other side of the square were piles of white crystals similarly carved with strange patterns and wordings. Unlike the black crystals, they emanate a blooming Life Force, surrounded by wisps of life. The area around the square had been cleaned up, with other Eternal Overcast Beings. aside from Jia Nan and several others. unable to approach or even look at it from afar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are these the materials for constructing the Reincarnation Platform? The Life Rocks and Death Rocks?&#8221; Gu Changge came in while followed by a silent Ah Da and an anxious Jia Jiuer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These are the Life Rocks and Death Rocks which our clan has found after all these years. It should be sufficient to construct the Reincarnation Platform,&#8221; answered Jia Nan, looking meaningfully at Jia Jiuer. Though, the latter merely shook her head and avoided her gaze. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Nan knew then that letting Jia Jiuer pay attention to Gu Changge&#8217;s movements had definitely failed, but she didn&#8217;t have much hope in it from the start.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Life Rocks and Death Rocks are difficult to find and can only be seen in the mythical Hell’s Yellow Spring. I didn&#8217;t expect the Eternal Overcast Kingdom to gather so many of them,&#8221; Gu Changge exclaimed as if he didn&#8217;t know what had happened last night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It concerns the important issue of the Reincarnation Platform, so we put all our efforts into finding them no matter how difficult it was,&#8221; replied Jia Nan with a smile, with a slight implication that building the Reincarnation Platform was so important for the Eternal Overcast that they would give everything to finish it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From another perspective, she was also worried that Gu Changge might do something fishy since even the Six Great Ancestors knew nothing about the Dao of Reincarnation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since all the materials have been gathered, let&#8217;s start. Oh, I wonder if you have prepared what I want, Princess Jia Nan.&#8221; He smiled before looking towards her, speaking in a different tone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course. This contains what you want, and the remaining ones will be presented to you when the Reincarnation Platform is complete.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t sound surprised at all, handing a black clay pot, which had been held by one of her handmaidens to him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew that Gu Changge would never give up until he got what he wanted; even if the Eternal Overcast was deteriorating, causing the Eternal Overcast Sources to become extremely precious. Nevertheless, taking some to appease him for a while was still feasible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess Jia Nan, you are an agreeable person after all.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled lightly, not taken aback at all. He stored the black pot with a wave of his hand without glancing at it, as if unconcerned about how many Eternal Overcast Sources it contained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He is not daring enough to try any tricks unless he doesn&#8217;t want to come out of the Eternal Overcast alive.&#8221; Six Great Ancestors cold gazes remained focused on Gu Changge&#8217;s movements from deep within the Eternal Overcast homeland while their divinse sense stirred.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place was enclosed in black and white over the next few days, with expanses of divine flames melting the Life Rocks and Death Rocks, which were then arranged in a certain manner. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principles collapsed and Time appeared to be faintly distorted while strange energy moved about. A flowing yellow-coloured spring could be seen indistinctly from an unknown dimension, carrying countless innocent souls and corpses. A platform floated on its surface, surrounded by black and white. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yin and Yang reflected each other, while Life and Death came in unison.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This aura… it really is the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being&#8217;s Reincarnation Platform. Only it could manifest that place.&#8221; The Six Great Ancestors became focused. Surprise and delight flashed within their eyes even though their hearts were already dead and could no longer be disturbed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a mysterious faraway space, a figure sitting cross-legged in a silent void surrounded by Dao Energy suddenly opened his eyes as if he had sensed something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This energy… who has lit up their coordinates? Ah, so it&#8217;s that place. It&#8217;s probably time to harvest.] His eyes were bright yet extremely cloudy and ancient, sometimes turning cold and emotionless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an instant, his gaze penetrated time and space. The next moment, the figure, which resembled an ancient deity, laughed coldly as if he had sensed something. [Ignorant ants. You never had a chance of winning this game.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ripples appeared in the void before him as he spoke before a scene materialised. It was also an infinitely old and distant world where great expanses of the universe had collapsed and Principles had broken apart. War cries shook the heavens, and the air suffused with the desire to fight. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, many supreme experts with overpowering auras growled angrily in desperation as they fought an indescribable silhouette from an unknown dimension. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great groups of them fell dead during the battle and disintegrated into bloodmists.</span></p>

          >The Supreme Mountain Elder wore a white robe and looked refined
          despite looking poor. Although he was blind, he had the otherworldly
          aura of an Immortal. He had set up the Nine Great Mountains and
          created the Celestial Seal of the Nine Great Mountains, a
          Fortuity-rich treasure. His abilities as the most accomplished
          cultivator as well as its oldest being were unfathomable and could
          only be described as very powerful.</span

          >The Supreme Mountain Elder had joined the Heavenly Dao Authority War
          with the Ancestor of Wind in order to steal it. Even though he had
          been injured badly afterwards and his abilities were no longer at its
          peak, it had been so long. Even if he wasn&#8217;t that far away from
          the Immortality Realm, he had once surpassed that feat. It was nearly
          impossible to find someone comparable to the Supreme Mountain Elder in
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains; he would be considered
          outstanding and peerless even in the Upper Realm.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >That was why Gu Changge had been so careful by using Luo Feng and the
          Second Mountain Elder as bait, waiting for the Supreme Mountain Elder
          to walk into the trap before killing him. His plans seemed to have
          succeeded since the Supreme Mountain Elder never would have thought
          this trap was set up especially for him by Gu Changge, no matter how
          calculating and experienced he was. The target for the banquet trap
          was the Supreme Mountain Elder; the other clans of the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains were far less important compared to taking
          this one old man down.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You have been so careful, so how could I kill you without
          putting in a little more effort?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled
          lightly.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Are you sure that you can kill me with so few people?&#8221; A
          terrifying aura stirred within the Supreme Mountain Elder like he was
          a giant volcano about to erupt while his expression darkened. He
          wasn&#8217;t sure how Gu Changge had tricked him or the details that
          went into making him come voluntarily, but he would be trapped here
          and his life would be endangered too if he didn&#8217;t escape.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;How are you sure that I can&#8217;t do that?&#8221; Gu Changge
          was still smiling lightly as if the matter did not concern him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s heart dropped after seeing the
          other man&#8217;s expression. Gu Changge was the first man he
          couldn&#8217;t read properly, and the words this youth made him even
          less certain.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Hmm, good for you then. I admit I have fallen into your trap,
          but I want to know how you tricked me without me realising anything
          wrong.&#8221; The Supreme Mountain Elder sounded reluctant and lost as
          he sighed. That was what had puzzled him the most; he couldn&#8217;t
          have fallen for this because of how cautious he was, so that meant Gu
          Changge&#8217;s schemes was far too deep. He couldn&#8217;t even
          understand where he had made a mistake.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Is there one of your pawns here?&#8221; A lightbulb went off
          in his mind as he glanced at Xiao Yang, Gu Wudi and the rest coldly.
          There seemed to be no other possibility.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang and the rest were taken aback, looking around them with
          suspicious and judging expressions. Once the Supreme Mountain Elder
          mentioned that, they couldn&#8217;t help suspecting that there was a
          traitor among them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;How fast. You deserve to be the Supreme Mountain Elder. I sure
          admire you.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t change,
          still smiling as if he wasn&#8217;t surprised by this. Just as he
          finished speaking, a loud popping sound rang out. Bright red blood
          spattered accompanied by a grunt.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang&#8217;s eyes widened, looking at Gu Wudi beside him with a
          pale and disbelieving expression. He clutched at his chest, unable to
          believe that the other man would attack him. The others watched in
          shock, frozen to the spot; they didn&#8217;t expect Gu Wudi, the
          Chosen One of the Nine Great Mountains, to suddenly attempt murder in
          such a callous and merciless way. It was as if he wanted to kill Xiao
          Yang with just one strike.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You—Gu Wudi…&#8221; Xiao Yang&#8217;s face was pale from his
          blood loss. His gaze was filled with hatred and fury but the intense
          pain made him unable to speak properly and his voice shook.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He hadn&#8217;t expected Gu Wudi, who had gone through so much with
          him, to be a pawn placed by Gu Changge at his side nor for this
          ‘friend’ to try and kill him. The feeling of betrayal filled him with
          rage and loathing since he was about to forgive the other man for
          being disrespectful towards his Eldest Senior Sister.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ve restrained myself for far too long. I
          would&#8217;ve killed you way earlier if I wasn&#8217;t worried about
          spoiling Young Master Gu&#8217;s plans.&#8221; Gu Wudi wore a cold
          expression while his words were cruel and filled with intent. The
          claim, accompanied by the bloody weapon he held, was extremely
          chilling. He was in the Sacred Emperor Realm and Xiao Yang would have
          been killed instantly without his protective amulet neutralising the
          strike.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >One of the people who wasn&#8217;t surprised was the Second Mountain
          Elder, still bound by chains; however, his four senses had been sealed
          shut and he couldn&#8217;t warn Xiao Yang even if he knew about this.
          This filled him with regret. He hadn&#8217;t wanted Xiao Yang to risk
          his life to rescue him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Your departure from the Nine Great Mountains was also part of
          Gu Changge&#8217;s plans…&#8221; Blood leaked from Xiao Yang&#8217;s
          mouth as he spoke with a shaking and sceptical voice. That meant that
          everything he had done from the moment he left the Nine Great
          Mountains had been controlled by Gu Changge and he wasn&#8217;t even
          aware of it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s amusing how stupid you are. Do you think I really
          want to establish a friendly relationship with you? It was only
          because of Young Master Gu&#8217;s orders.&#8221; Gu Wudi sneered
          mockingly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I made a mistake. I never expected it to be you…&#8221; The
          Supreme Mountain Elder sighed since he didn&#8217;t expect this as
          well and his expression turned furious before returning to
          normal.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If you know better, don&#8217;t try to fight back. You will
          never be comparable to him.&#8221; Gu Wudi didn&#8217;t seem repentant
          and smirked, finally free. His duties were now complete and he
          didn&#8217;t have to put up pretences anymore.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You’ve worked hard.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded with a
          smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s not much. Working for you is an honour even if it
          puts me in great danger,&#8221; Gu Wudi said respectfully before
          moving behind Gu Changge obediently.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang and the others didn&#8217;t dare do anything despite their
          anger towards him. They were all afraid since it was uncertain if they
          could even survive this; for all they knew, all of them would die
          painfully here.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If so, then let&#8217;s see if you can make me stay.&#8221;
          The Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s expression turned icy as he
          realised that a fight was unavoidable. Since Gu Changge had set up
          such an elaborate trap, he would never allow him to leave so
          easily.</span
        >

          >Astounding and frightening energy exploded into the air like a river
          had overflowed its banks and swept the entire world. Fortunately, the
          space had already been inscribed with many runes and was stabilised by
          arrays or the place would have been reduced to ashes instantly.</span

          >&#8220;Attack!&#8221; The Bone Ancestor and the others struck as
          well, aiming powerful Principles and techniques towards the Supreme
          Mountain Elder in an attempt to retain him. All of them seemed to
          reside in another world since they were surrounded by Dao runes, their
          features indistinct and their aura overwhelming. The energy filling
          the underground prison could have easily shaken the heavens and swept
          away most of the clans in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The terrifying sound shook the world and spread outside, unable to be
          completely absorbed by the many sealing techniques around it. Sky Deer
          City began to shake and everyone in it turned pale and shivered with
          terror, unable to stop themselves from praying towards a single
          direction.</span

          >Gu Changge stood upright, looking handsome and otherworldly in his
          white robes. The Chaos Dao emanating from him faded in and out as he
          watched, not eager to attack just yet. He couldn&#8217;t deny he had
          an intense craving for the Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s Source since
          such a powerful expert was very hard to come across in the Upper
          Realm. Of course, he wasn&#8217;t going to let go of such an
          opportunity.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, the world became blurry and chaotic as Principles wove between
          each other and dropped like a waterfall. Gu Changge&#8217;s Dao
          resonated with everyone during the battle, causing Dao Runes to appear
          which could have projected out of the world with its divine might. The
          man himself remained still, light flickering in his gaze as if he was
          overseeing the Primal Chaos during the birth of the universe.</span

          displayed a superior technique with a roar, causing a Dao Flower to
          bloom behind him which shimmered with wisps of divine light. Several
          figures then emerged from it, all of them astoundingly strong. Some
          did not even belong in this era and were clad in ancient outfits. They
          possessed varying weapons which he borrowed for some reason.</span

          he felt his Life Force quickly running out. His body was slowly
          shrivelling up to become skin and bones, which worried him. [Why is
          Supreme Mountain Elder consuming my Life Force?]</span

          The Supreme Mountain Elder did not elaborate too much, frowning since
          he didn&#8217;t think it was enough. His hand stretched out once again
          to break apart Luo Ying&#8217;s chains and grab her. A bright green
          light emitted from Xiao Yang and Luo Ying, which contained a
          mysterious power that manifested into strange runes. These runes
          eventually fell into the Dao Flower behind the Supreme Mountain
          Elder.</span

          >After getting the energy boost, the figures who had emerged from his
          Dao Flower became more solid and intimidating. Even the Bone Ancestor
          found it hard to deal with, facing the figures head-on and raising his
          hand to shatter the divine glowing Principles.</span
        >

          Protectors?&#8221; Gu Changge raised his eyebrows and stepped out,
          raising a hand to strike a formidable figure charging towards him. The
          force was enough to reduce mountains and rivers to powder and overturn
          countless galaxies, glowing so brightly that no one could open their
          eyes properly.</span

          Chains of Principles seemed to weave about the place, while brilliant
          Dao Runes appeared within Gu Changge&#8217;s palm which was bright
          enough to illuminate the entire Sky Deer City.

          >An enormous explosion occurred, accompanied by frightening energy. It
          was like the sky had cracked open, causing galaxies to rain downwards
          to destroy. Anyone who were not True Daoists could feel their blood
          surging violently, accompanied by a rumbling sound due to the
          vibrations from the battle. Their bones cracked loudly while their
          legs became weak. Their bodies felt ready to explode while they felt
          the urge to kneel. In the next moment, the figure immediately cracked
          and became clouds of powder, unable to face Gu Changge.</span

          disadvantage.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze was cold as he moved
          forward to attack the Supreme Mountain Elder. The place was chaotic
          since terrifying light and Principles exploded everywhere; with one
          single touch being able to kill.</span

          >The battle continued for a long time. It was undeniable that the
          Supreme Mountain Elder was powerful. He caused many of his opponents
          to cough up blood due to their serious injuries. However, he
          hadn&#8217;t returned to his peak yet and slowly lost the advantage
          after being attacked by so many True Daoists, unable to not stop
          himself from coughing blood and flying about.</span

          against the aftershocks; the Supreme Mountain Elder could not protect
          her in time and she immediately exploded. This extremely infuriated
          Xiao Yang and he froze on the spot. However, how could the Supreme
          Mountain Elder protect them when his life was already at stake?</span

          >While battling the Bone Ancestor and the other enemies, the Supreme
          Elder&#8217;s expression suddenly shifted, feeling his head about to
          explode while a chill swept through him. He could already sense a
          terrifying aura surging towards him as if he was facing an impending
          Ice Age, which could freeze even souls.</span

          >An incomparable sword of green light containing murderous intent
          seemed to cross the universe and sky without glowing, aiming for his
          back. It was a frightening object with a bloodthirsty aura, which
          could cause even Immortals to die.</span

          >A gourd appeared in Gu Changge&#8217;s hand, a sword of light sharp
          enough to slay anything emerging from it. This was the power of the
          Immortal-Killing Gourd, which was so much more intense than before
          after having left to hibernate for some time.</span

          >*Puff!* Blood spattered as the Supreme Mountain Elder was impaled by
          the sword, causing his aura to immediately weaken. However, he forced
          himself to draw a shimmering weapon with hints of Immortal Realm power
          despite being in pain, attempting to seriously wound Gu Changge.</span

          >*Boom!* Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze immediately turned icy, raising a
          hand to conjure a Dao Diagram made of black and white, which acted as
          a shield. Principles of Reincarnation moved like tidal waves across
          its surface, containing infinite life. This was the greatest treasure
          of the Supreme Cave Heaven. It was their Supreme Dao Diagram, which
          possessed both attacking and defensive capabilities. However, it shook
          under the impact of the Supreme Mountain Elder&#8217;s desperate
          strike and was nearly penetrated, clearly highlighting how strong the
          Supreme Mountain Elder was.</span

          >Gu Changge&#8217;s look became distant as he restrained the urge to
          wield other abilities. At this point, the outcome could no longer
          change and everything was over now. The others took the chance and
          expelled various forceful Principles which immediately overwhelmed the
          Supreme Mountain Elder and shook the universe with their might.</span

          someone from the younger generation after being unchallenged for so
          many years.&#8221; The Supreme Mountain Elder smiled weakly after
          being hit, coughing up blood while his aura slowly deteriorated. Now
          that this space had been sealed and the void within millions of
          kilometres was secured, he could no longer escape!</span

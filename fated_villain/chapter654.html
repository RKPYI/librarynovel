<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this an order for me to take action?&#8221;</span><span id="more-34819"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a cave within the territory of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, a middle-aged man bearing a resemblance to the current Yu Emperor looked at the letter he was holding, looking excited yet anxious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was Yu Tianzheng, the brother of the current Yu Emperor who had lost the throne back then. He had obeyed Gu Changge&#8217;s orders and hid out here all this time to await an opportunity to act. How could he not be excited now that he had suddenly gotten the letter Gu Changge had sent via a messenger instructing him to make a move?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had been waiting for a very long time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Dynasty does need a new Emperor&#8221; He laughed coldly before transforming into a beam of light and disappeared, planning to instruct the secret pawns he had set up all those years to make a move. The Dynasty was now undergoing a tumultuous period and its people were currently living in fear, so it was the right time to incite a riot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We should tell Master about the return of Young Master Gu. Young Master Gu has already given orders half a year ago that Pagoda and Neraka shall be raided by the Nephrite Breeze Pavillion after his return.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Yu Tianzheng left, two quietly conversing figures as indistinct as grey smoke slowly appeared. They seemed to blend into the world and emitted nearly indiscernible murderous energy as they walked. It was as if they could kill even an Emperor if they so pleased.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safe return of the ancient battleship belonging to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty immediately sent shockwaves in every direction. The Factions within the borders of the Dynasty as well as those who had sent spies to closely observe the situation were all shocked. Many cultivators immediately set off to the capital to verify the truth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone hadn&#8217;t expected the ancient battleship to return unscathed at such a critical time and as such, rumours of the Dynasty trapping and killing the other Forces slowly spread. Almost immediately, undercurrents began to stir as murderous intentions began to surface. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many military forces received the order to go to the capital to stand guard and patrol the area cautiously. It was a time of instability and no one knew if a terrible war would erupt within the capital. Right before the experts of the other Forces arrived though, the vibrations emitted by an awakening of a Dao Artifact swept by and shocked countless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ancient battleship with blood and bones clinging to it headed towards the capital from the sky as its flags fluttered extravagantly. It landed in the centre of the Great Yu Capital and it attracted everyone&#8217;s attention.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The rumours seem to be true. An ancient battleship of Great Yu has returned safely from that world, even when there&#8217;s only one of them left.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What danger does that world contain that so many people have died in there, including True Daoists?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Yu Capital was 0.5 million square kilometres in size and stood as proudly as an ancient mountain, with mist rising from it, colourful smoke swirling about, and bright lights glittering within. There was also a spinning waterfall as well as springs and mountains situated inside the city, which made it look extremely majestic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many cultivators watched the sight from among the pavilions and palaces with varying reactions; some were anxious and afraid, while some had the feeling of betrayal. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;According to the information which reached us, Gu Changge has also gone to that world. Do you think he has also died there?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several young prodigies were hanging out in a pavilion, all of them surrounded by a glow which made them out to be extraordinary. Some looked surprised as they thought of something, then laughed quietly before asking the question. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While mentioning the issue seemed somewhat mocking and might offend Gu Changge if anyone heard and spread it, it was what everyone was thinking. If Gu Changge had really died in that world like the other True Daoists, it might be a stroke of luck for every youth. After all, he had been sitting right above their heads like an enormous mountain. Even ancient monstrosities who had reappeared felt so pressured by him that they couldn&#8217;t breathe and became hopeless. Coexisting with such a person in the same world was a great misfortune since they weren&#8217;t even worthy of standing next to him at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You all are underestimating Young Master Changge. Back in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the True Daoists there didn&#8217;t even dare leave the city because he was there. Him dying in a Lower World? What an enormous joke. You haven&#8217;t seen it yourself so you don&#8217;t know how terrifying he is. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, he will be fine even if everyone else died there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A young woman suddenly shook her head and laughed scornfully at whoever had asked the question. She had been there when the Upper Realm attacked the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, so she had witnessed Gu Changge wielding a Dao Artifact, as he battled the numerous True Daoists of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. She was extremely certain that nothing would happen to Gu Changge since such a person was destined to be the main character in the world, who would lead numerous eras without any sign of deterioration. How could he be harmed at all?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the young prodigies were chatting, the space before the Imperial Palace shimmered briefly before several blurry yet formidable figures stepped out and materialised. Every one of them had bright eyes and exuded overwhelming aura, which suppressed the Principles around them to the point of near destruction. They stood there like gods, strange scenes flickering within their eyes as they awaited the landing of the ancient battleship. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entourage was led by the current Yu Emperor, while many royal advisors stood behind him with sombre expressions as they all watched the slowly descending battleship. They all desired to know what had happened in that world, and the survivors on that ship might give them all answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Father. Greetings, Elders.&#8221; Soon, the ancient battleship landed, and Yu Feiya exited first while leading an army. Her calm and pretty face bore a slightly grave expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Eldest Princess is still alive, so we might know what happened in that world from her.&#8221; Experts from different Forces all directed their gazes on her, especially the terrifying figures standing at the entrance of the palace. The destruction of moons and stars could be seen within the eyes of those figures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Feiya, there&#8217;s no need for such courtesy. Your safe return has made me breathe a sigh of relief. Quickly tell us every detail of what transpired in that world. You have no idea how much I have worried over this during the past few days since I didn&#8217;t know what to say to my Fellow Brothers and Sisters here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that she looked okay, the Yu Emperor relaxed before giving a warm smile. He swept a brief glance behind her; less than one-tenth of the army that had headed to Profound Sword World had returned, showing how brutal the battle had been.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya had already expected such a scene and put on a grave expression once again after remembering Gu Changge&#8217;s instructions. &#8220;Father, the appearance of that world has actually been bait in order to attract every single one of us to go there. I assume members from the other Forces have all died there except for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? Bait?&#8221; Her words immediately elicited a wave of shocked exclamations. Everyone was stunned for a moment before their eyes widened in disbelief. Who would have been daring enough to use such a world as bait to draw everyone in and kill them all? They couldn&#8217;t imagine who would be brave enough to do so, even in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; The Yu Emperor frowned in puzzlement and was about to ask further, but other supreme experts from other Forces got to her first and stared at her intimidatingly. They didn&#8217;t believe her claim since they didn&#8217;t think anyone would dare trick them in that fashion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If all of you don&#8217;t believe me, look at this photographic stone. This is what happened in Profound Sword World.The World’s Will had awakened and tried to sacrifice the entire world to achieve Absolute Detachment and Transcend. Everyone that went there all became fodder and died…&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya looked grave and pulled out the prepared photographic stone as she spoke. Many of the experts merely needed a look at it to know whether the scenes inside that stone were true or false. She had also thought of explanations for everything else, so there could not be any flaw in tricking them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Profound Sword World’s Will had awakened and planned on Transcending?&#8221; Everyone present became serious at once as they realised it was no small issue, especially experienced Masters from other Forces, who had rich experiences and knew how frightening a World’s Will could be.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s really because of that?&#8221; Emperor Yu didn&#8217;t think his daughter would lie and seemed cautious. They picked up the photographic stone she was holding to investigate what had occurred in that world, sucking in a sharp breath, eyes widening as they witnessed the horrifying collapse of Profound Sword World where everything worked together to fight against the World’s Will. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power shown made even True Daoists&#8217; hearts stutter as fear emanated from their core.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That power terrifies even me, despite it only being a recording of the past… It should be true then; that World’s Will had planned on everything from the start. It&#8217;s no surprise that all died there.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone went silent and couldn&#8217;t speak for a while due to shock. They were certain that the World’s Will had already reached the threshold of the Immortal Realm. If it underwent Absolute Detachment and Transcend, it might threaten the Upper Realm. To be frank, they had no chance of surviving such a terrifying being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After descending to that world, no one expected such a trap to be awaiting us…&#8221; Yu Feiya sighed when she noticed that no one was doubting her. She continued recounting the details of events which had taken place. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t told her to do so, but she was trying to help him erase all traces of evidence. Gu Changge had always acted behind the scenes and even the World’s Will had only become a tool for him. In fact, he laid out everything from start to finish, so she didn&#8217;t have to think too much about how to hide the truth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, how did you escape?&#8221; A supreme expert looked confused since even True Daoists had died there. So, how did Yu Feiya and the others escape unscathed? Even tearing a Space Rift to return to the Upper Realm? There were plenty of flaws in her explanation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu had been relieved at the knowledge that this tragedy had no connection with the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, yet that question made him tense. He really did want to know how Yu Feiya and the rest had escaped such a dangerous place. How would a World&#8217;s Will, with strength close to the Immortal Realm, allow them to leave safely?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t change as if she already knew they would ask this very question. She sighed, sounding slightly thankful and traumatised. &#8220;It was all thanks to Young Master Gu. If he hadn&#8217;t given us a hand at the most critical moment, we would have ended up dying in that world as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu?&#8221; Everyone was stunned, with some remembering that Gu Changge had followed the army to that world too. However, there hadn&#8217;t been any news of his death from the Immortal Gu Family. At that thought, many became extremely solemn and wanted to know what had actually happened, as well as where he was right now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s good to hear that Young Master Gu is okay.&#8221; Emperor Yu had been worried that the Immortal Gu Family would blame him after Gu Changge died, so the news calmed his anxiety and made him smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So where is he? Why hasn&#8217;t he returned to the Upper Realm with you?&#8221; A supreme expert from Sky Emperor Mountain asked suspiciously, curious about Gu Changge&#8217;s whereabouts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;s inside the ancient battleship, though he isn&#8217;t in good condition since he sustained some pretty serious injuries,&#8221; Yu Feiya answered according to Gu Changge&#8217;s request before telling them the truth—Gu Changge had fought back against the World&#8217;s Will when that world collapsed. They then wandered aimlessly as they looked for the space coordinates of the Upper Realm. However, his Source had been injured when he fought the World’s Will, which was further aggravated when he forcefully tore open a Space Rift. He had been recuperating in the ancient battleship and so hadn&#8217;t made an appearance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu is injured?&#8221; Everyone looked surprised and disbelieving before understanding the situation. No matter how powerful he was, he could never win against a World’s Will, which was close to reaching the Immortal Realm. It was unimaginable that he could escape safely. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other True Daoists would have died in his position, much less possessed the strength to form a Space Rift to return to the Upper Realm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya&#8217;s explanation allowed everyone&#8217;s doubt to disappear. They had escaped unscathed because of Gu Changge. However, some people were still sceptical and did not trust her words completely, so they planned to board the ship to visit Gu Changge personally after some discussion to check on his current condition. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had already gotten her orders from Gu Changge and wasn&#8217;t taken aback by this request at all, leading everyone to visit him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the palace filled with flickering light and smoke, Gu Changge sat cross-legged on his bed, clad in clothes as white as snow. His dark shiny hair was tied back with a simple hair tie and he looked somewhat pale yet calm as he watched the supreme experts approach him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings,&#8221; he uttered, seemingly unsurprised by this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We heard that you had sustained some serious injuries after the battle with the Profound Sword World’s Will, so we came to visit you. Please don&#8217;t fault us for this,&#8221; replied the supreme expert of Sky Emperor Mountain. He was surrounded by a strong aura, and had glowing eyes filled with flashes of ancient Dao runes, which he used to closely observe Gu Changge&#8217;s condition. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he spoke, he pulled out a shiny box made of purple jade as a gift, which contained the million-year-old King of Herbs. This herb was considered an extremely precious item for healing injuries, even for True Daoists.</span></p>

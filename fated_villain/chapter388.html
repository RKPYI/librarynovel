          in battle were extremely dazed for a while before shooting the man a
          glare filled with dread they never experienced. Gu Changge&#8217;s
          appearance at this crucial moment was completely out of their
          expectation. It was as though the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of
          the oriole behind.</span

          >With that in mind, the crowd&#8217;s faces grew visibly solemn as
          they anxiously glanced at Gu Changge&#8217;s rear, and seeing there
          were no other formidable followers with him, they felt somewhat
          relieved.</span

          witnessing how he effortlessly slaughtered the formidable Master in
          the Peak Sacred Lord Realm outside, they realised that he had already
          become an entity that possessed powers unrivalled by the rest of the
          young prodigies.</span

          leaving all shivering in fear. In fact, even those in the Sacred Lord
          Realm would be killed right away without any chance to defend
          themselves. Therefore, the crowd immediately kept their guards up,
          acknowledging that no simple man could ever achieve such a feat.</span

          Although they never saw her display her powers, she mustn&#8217;t be

          surroundings. She had no idea how Gu Changge found the path to this
          very spot. The location of the true tomb was supposedly known by no
          one, yet, it was as though he had the ability to see through
          everything and the obstacles before him were nothing but illusions,
          which made her even more curious.</span

          yourself?&#8221; Hearing that, a Sect Master with red eyebrows in a
          crimson robe revealed a perturbed face as he discourteously spoke to
          Gu Changge with an icy stare.</span

          alertly, worried that he might draw his hands out of nowhere as they
          paused their assault on Jiang Luoshen, the golden-haired old woman,
          and the rest. In their eyes, Gu Changge&#8217;s threat was
          incomparably greater to that of the golden-haired old woman.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, she dared not to move rashly as she could feel Gu
          Changge&#8217;s aura fixating on her. If she were to advance and
          retrieve the purple crystal, she would surely taste Gu Changge&#8217;s
          wrath.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After having witnessed Gu Changge&#8217;s terror, she could feel
          heart shivering, and she would rather take the four Sect Masters on
          than facing him. In that instant, how Gu Changge managed to find this
          place was no longer of her concern.</span

          pray that Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t recognise him.</span

          likely die if he were to recognise you.&gt; The Artifact Spirit of the
          Celestial Boat of Creation&#8217;s voice was also trembling
          uncontrollably.</span

          Despite hearing that, Gu Changge simply ignored the Sect
          Master&#8217;s question. As he carried a grin, his gaze swept across
          the crowd before landing on Jiang Luoshen, and after watching as she
          turned her face away, he then shifted his gaze towards the Godly
          Illusion Divinity Crystal on the platform. The arrays surrounding the
          Divinity Crystal had been removed, and all he had to do was walk over
          and grab it.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In fact, in order to have Jiang Chen dispel the arrays, he even
          waited for quite a while. Otherwise, he would have shown up
          earlier.</span

          Clan, such an item is indeed able to help someone reach the
          Heavens,&#8221; Gu Changge praised, as though he was appreciating his
          belonging and disregarding the existence of others.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, be it those from the Godly Illusion Clan or the four
          Sect Masters, everyone was clearly furious seeing how Gu Changge,
          blatantly disregarding their presence, was already treating the Godly
          Illusion Divinity as his own. Such insufferable rampancy made their
          blood boil.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Gu Changge, I suggest we share the item equally. I doubt
          you&#8217;ll be able to take four of us at once. You better contain
          your greed or you&#8217;ll accomplish nothing in the end.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          recommended an optimal solution he came up with as a purple light,
          resembling dense Dao Energy that was one with everything, surged in
          his eyes. The Sect Master donned a powerful silk robe and a Dao Sword
          with frightening sharpness that could penetrate the void.</span

          >Upon those words, the eyes of the other three Sect Masters subtly
          flinched. Remaining wordless, they seem to be silently agreeing to the
          idea. Naturally, they didn&#8217;t mind Gu Changge wanting a share of
          the treasure since dividing among four and five people didn&#8217;t
          make much difference. Of course, they were reluctant to fight against
          Gu Changge unless necessary.</span

          here?&#8221; Seeing that, Jiang Luoshen grew even more vexed as the
          four Sect Masters and Gu Changge completely ignored her
          presence.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, this was the burial chamber for the Prime Ancestor of the
          Godly Illusion Clan. At that moment, she was tightly holding a
          gleaming gold paper so she could use it anytime. The gold paper was
          one of her ultimate cards, and she frankly didn&#8217;t want to use it
          unless she was in a life-threatening situation.</span

          >&#8220;Oh, no. You must have misunderstood me. Do you need me to
          repeat it once more?&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head, seemingly
          intending to walk towards the platform. He retained his leisurely
          expression, as though such a matter was trivial to him.</span

          dissatisfaction.</span

          palm, emitting crackles and a burst of light, which left the air
          trembling as though it was about to explode. His aggressive behaviour
          clearly showed that he was ready to attack should the negotiation
          fail. Essentially, at this point, the Godly Illusion Divinity Crystal
          was at the reach of their hands, so there was no way they would give
          up so easily.</span

          leave.&#8221; Although he appeared elegant in his heavenly guise as he
          was speaking, the crowd could detect a terrifying murderous aura
          surging in the air, which left them obviously distressed.</span

          grimace as he didn&#8217;t expect Gu Changge&#8217;s sudden assault,
          after which, to defend himself, he cast an alarming sword energy which
          then clashed with Gu Changge&#8217;s palms attack, only to find
          disbelief all over his face the next second.</span

          crystallised into a vast, magnificent mountain that was as heavy as
          Chaos Qi, which shattered the sword energy. Shortly after, a crack
          could be heard in both of his arms as his skull crumbled along a
          revolting noise. Almost simultaneously, as he was fatally injured, he
          let out a groan, followed by a gush of blood pouring out of his
          mouth.</span

          three Sect Masters were thoroughly dumbfounded by the sight, not
          expecting the battle would end so swiftly. In that instant, they
          realised how immeasurable Gu Changge&#8217;s strength was.</span

          >[Aren&#8217;t they just looking to die? Ah, I guess, at the end of
          the day, his handsomeness trumps over his actions.] While Wang Zijin
          was still zoning out, Gu Changge&#8217;s palms strike had still yet to
          wane in the air as it was still plunging. Then, it would clasp
          together, grasping the Sect Master who previously attacked and
          instantly, followed by spine-chilling cracks of bones.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You… Ah! Gu Changge, unhand me! I no longer want the Godly
          Illusion Divinity Crystal! You can have it!&#8221; The Sect
          Master&#8217;s face was filled with dread and dismay. Even with his
          strength, he stood no chance against Gu Changge. It was as though he
          was facing an Ancestor in the Sacred King Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Immediately, everyone who saw that grew frantic with fear. After all,
          a Sect Master was the leader of a Sect. Someone who had cultivated for
          thousands of years, and even at their youth, they were young prodigies
          that possessed immense might, which was considered as unrivaled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yet, the Sect Master was now in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands, squeezed to
          the death as if he was an ant. Indeed, the sight was truly shocking,
          and the crowd couldn&#8217;t help but shiver, feeling numbness and
          chills all over their heads.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Really? I don&#8217;t mind letting you go, but you
          didn&#8217;t seem to appreciate the chance to live I offered
          earlier.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head, carrying helplessness in
          his tone.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Swiftly, as the Sect Master donned a devastated expression, the
          vibrant palms in the air vehemently clenched.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Thump!* Blood splattered everywhere as the Sect Master&#8217;s body
          disintegrated.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You actually killed Sect Master Qi Yang…&#8221; Instantly, the
          other Sect Masters&#8217; faces drastically changed and turned deathly
          pale. Their voices were shaking, overflowing with uncontrollable
          remorse.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Relax. You&#8217;ll join him soon enough.&#8221; Gu Changge
          turned to them with his ever so serene face, as if he didn&#8217;t
          just do anything significant at all.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;This is bad. We shall combine our attacks, or we won&#8217;t
          be able to beat him!&#8221; The Sect Master in the powerful silk robe
          subconsciously yelled as he took the Dao Sword that resembled a
          sky-piercing sword made out of energy that could obliterate the world.
          With the Dao Sword that harboured heaven’s might of destruction, he
          charged towards Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, blinding lights erupted as thunderous beams
          flickered, about to shatter the void.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the next moment, with an unaffected face, Gu Changge simply
          waved his hand and a bright sword light was cast out of his finger,
          tearing up the void with its extreme penetrative power.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Thump!* The Sect Master let out a shriek of pain and his arms were
          torn off his body, followed by gushes of blood. Even the weapon in his
          arm was blown up into pieces as he was turned into a mist of blood
          right away. Hopeless and fearful, his soul intended to flee through
          the void.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, Gu Changge swept his gaze over and conjured a blinding
          sword and slashed the soul in the void, turning it into ashes, and the
          Sect Master faced the same fate as his late ally.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sword harboured infinite offensive power, and not only did it
          contain Golden Force, but it also carried the might of World
          Principles. It was a combination that could destroy everything in its
          presence. Let alone the Sect Masters who were in the Peak Sacred Lord
          Realm. In fact, even a Sacred Emperor would grow wary were they the
          target of the sword.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the blink of an eye, yet another Sect Master perished without the
          chance to defend himself.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that, even Wang Zijin felt somewhat horrified as she realised
          she could only take on one Sect Master at her full power at a time.
          She was unlike Gu Changge, who could slaughter two of them so
          effortlessly. In other words, Gu Changge must still be hiding more of
          his terrorising, immeasurable strength, and even now, there was no
          telling how much of it he was displaying.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the other hand, the golden-haired old woman and the rest were also
          thoroughly stupefied, never expecting that the four Sect Masters stood
          no chance against Gu Changge. Furthermore, the battle between them was
          a totally one-sided.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Princess, what do we do? Do we still want to claim the
          Divinity Crystal of the Prime Ancestor? I may still be able to secure
          an escape route if we are to retreat now. Given how Gu Changge
          annihilated those Sect Masters, there&#8217;s no way he&#8217;ll let
          us live,&#8221; the golden-haired old woman asked Jiang Luoshen with a
          solemn expression filled with unfading dread.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, Jiang Luoshen was still clutching the golden paper in her
          snowy hand, highly disaffected by those words. Not only did her effort
          come to nothing, but she now had to pettily run away from her enemy.
          Her ego hindered her from accepting the situation she was in.
          Nevertheless, if she insisted on retrieving the Godly Illusion
          Divinity Crystal, she just might get herself killed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Artifact Spirit, perhaps we should retreat as we did last time. Gu
          Changge is too strong, and not even the Sect Masters stand a chance
          against him.] Jiang Chen&#8217;s lips paled as he peered at the man in
          white standing in the air, whose entire body was covered in unending
          heavenly light. Trying his best not to stutter, he finally
          acknowledged how horrifying his nemesis was. Seeing such
          dream-shattering disparity in strength, he was even thinking of giving
          up his quest for revenge after how the Sect Masters were slaughtered
          like dogs.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;Jiang Luoshen will most likely fight Gu Changge soon. I&#8217;ll
          take the chance to trigger the arrays of this region and bring this
          place to ruin. By then, run eastward and do not turn back until you
          reach a secret passage. It will lead you away from here to the outside
          world. This is all I can do at this point. Right after that,
          I&#8217;ll fall into hibernation again, and the rest is solely up to
          you.&gt; The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation&#8217;s
          voice carried unprecedented solemnity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In response, Jiang Chen nodded, and his palms were full of cold
          sweat.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;We won&#8217;t be able to beat him even if we team up.
          Let&#8217;s escape.&#8221; In the meantime, the remaining two Sect
          Masters&#8217; faces blanched as they could not believe their eyes. As
          they realised that they were no match for Gu Changge. Thus,
          uncontrollable fear surged in their hearts.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!* The moment they activated their Secret Technique, their Blood
          Essence started to burn as their body glowed. In that instant, their
          auras reached the peak of their lives, but that was wholly for them to
          run for their lives.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Will you be able to run, though?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s
          voice remained monotonous. As he lifted his arm, the air around him
          instantaneously condensed, as if every chunk of it carried a weight of
          tonnes. Then, an enormous force slammed forward, resembling an
          almighty tsunami with its blaring waves that could turn the world
          inside out.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Blargh…!&#8221; Along with the spine-chilling glistens of
          blood, two Sect Masters were instantly killed and their bodies were
          blown to pieces before turning to ash as they were unable to escape Gu
          Changge&#8217;s mighty palm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon that sight, the golden-haired old woman, who was about to flee
          with Jiang Luoshen, felt a dreadful chill up her spine.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Now, it&#8217;s your turn.&#8221; Gu Changge gently jiggled
          his sleeves, as if he was shaking off the non-existent stains of blood
          on them. He turned to Jiang Luoshen and the rest and spoke with his
          ever so calm tone, as though he had just finished stepping on some
          insignificant bugs.</span

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge stood inside the palace with his lowered gaze. He flipped through the memories related to the former First Palace Lord of Neraka. At the end of the day, his ultimate goal was to obtain as much information on Neraka&#8217;s secrets as possible.</span><span id="more-36155"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was known to the outside world was that Neraka was governed by its Ten Palace Lords, who were each named after the Ten Courts of Hell during ancient legendary times. Furthermore, above the ten Palace Lords, were the Five Ghost Emperors and the highly mysterious Yin Emperor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, the undeniable truth was that the Ten Palace Lords were beings that possessed unbelievably powerful cultivations, and even the average True Daoists wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance against them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty million years ago, the First Palace Lord of Neraka had almost perished, hunted down by numerous True Daoists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From his memories, Gu Changge became aware of how mysterious each of the Palaces were. Even the Palace Lords themselves weren&#8217;t aware of the locations of the other Palaces. The only way information was conveyed between the Palace Lords was through a Communication Altar within each of the Palaces. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, it was certainly beneficial for them to communicate this way as that would protect themselves against harm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Battlefield of Hundred Worlds is indeed a fine place to raise Gu Insects, but for Neraka, it is not enough.&#8221; Gu Changge managed to receive another useful piece of information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless Lower Realms Worlds surrounded the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, and Neraka controlled many ancient worlds among them. Those ancient worlds were left behind by Neraka specifically to escape to. Naturally, huge batches of fresh blood were nurtured from them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This had been the tradition of Neraka, and it was also how they managed to stand at the apex of the Upper Realm as an assassin guild.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge flipped through the memories of the middle-aged man, he discovered the many secrets of Neraka. In some respects, these secrets greatly involved the dark side of certain Immortal Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Judging from his memories, Giant Wave Ancient World should be the hiding place of Neraka. Though, Neraka should be hidden in a world within a world. With the starting entrance being Giant Wave Ancient World.] Now that Gu Changge vaguely grasped where Neraka might be hiding, what he had to do next was a lot easier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By destroying Neraka&#8217;s headquarters first, Pagoda, the only one remaining, would be easier to deal with since Neraka was definitely more mysterious and troublesome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge ordered his men to bring over the woman in green from the boat, intending to interrogate her himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neraka had a special Secret Technique to prevent its people from revealing its secrets The woman in green, as a disciple of Old Lady Meng, was considerably to be of quite a high position in Neraka. Naturally, her soul must be guarded with intricate protective arrays.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, given that the former First Palace Lord couldn&#8217;t stop Gu Changge from glimpsing into his memories, this woman wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance against him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a snap, a painful shriek abruptly ended.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman in green wore a hideous grimace filled with dread as she almost passed out. Given that her memories were read by Gu Changge while she was still conscious, the pain she felt was fathomless. It was as if her soul was being torn apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah Da, bring three True Daoists with you. According to the information from her Knowledge Sea, you should take over the contact points within the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds.&#8221; After a moment of thought, Gu Changge summoned Ah Da and the others before giving them further orders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the woman&#8217;s Knowledge Sea, he managed to obtain vital information. There were many contact points connected to Neraka in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, but they were all sealed following his arrival, except for one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the current Ten Palace Lords were absent, they would only conjure incarnations of themselves should there be any conferences. As such, Gu Changge felt regrettable how it would be hard for him to eliminate them all at once.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Young Master.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving his orders, Ah Da left along with three True Daoist Puppets, who were shrouded in black mists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds fell into a wary state as almost everyone felt an insurmountable amount of restlessness and stress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened in the Vermilion Bird Hall that night was not a secret since Gu Changge had ordered for the seal to be removed the next day, and Neraka&#8217;s only opened contact point was taken over by Ah Da and the three True Draoists puppets on the very same day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, such a conspicuous incident attracted the attention of the Upper Realm Forces. At the same time, information regarding Neraka was quickly spread, causing major turbulence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the contact point, Ah Da found numerous underground palaces, in which teleportation altars linked to Neraka were concealed. These teleportation altars had yet to be destroyed by the high-ups of Neraka, allowing people to effortlessly locate the other side of the altar through Space Coordinates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undoubtedly, the formidable cultivators attempted to fight off the invaders, but facing three True Daoists, their efforts were futile as they were soon turned into ashes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the same day, far away from the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, a daunting fleet of ancient battleships closed in as the soldiers on the ships came in huge numbers, resembling endless billowing storm clouds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the practice grounds Neraka had hidden across the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds were all destroyed. Even the appearance of two True Daoists was to no avail as the combined attacks of Gu Changge&#8217;s True Daoist Puppets quickly brought them down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No cultivators expected that Gu Changge had planned for such a fatal blow, and the sheer calibre of this battle had also shocked the Forces of the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge&#8217;s appearance in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was no secret, no one expected that his target would be Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His action left those Forces that had a grudge against Neraka excited. They could finally hit back against Neraka. In their excitement, they sent their armies for a crusade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, everyone wanted a share in Gu Changge&#8217;s success. After all, Neraka had been accumulating an immeasurable, shocking amount of wealth ever since their inception. Prior to this, Neraka used to be well-hidden and managed to avoid countless confrontations. They had never revealed their own hiding place as they did today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within merely a few days, many elites of Forces gathered outside the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It appears that this is the end of Neraka&#8217;s good days.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They have been based in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds for so long, yet all of their practice grounds have been wiped out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The many people, across numerous towns in the Upper Realm, were extremely dumbfounded after receiving the news. They naturally started to engage in heated discussions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such an event was, as expected, a hot topic in the Upper Realm. All these years, many young prodigies and influential figures had fallen under Neraka&#8217;s hand. Being the dignified dominators of the dark side of the Upper Realm, Neraka and Pagoda even dared to assassinate True Daoists. But now, Gu Changge had discovered where Neraka was and was planning to attack it. This naturally became a hot topic for countless people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, no one knew of any vendetta between Gu Changge and Neraka, which would lead him to make such a decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, news regarding the fact that the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was where Neraka raised its ‘Gu Insects’ broke out and caused a great commotion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, some other Forces must also be behind this as the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was not merely Neraka&#8217;s zone to raise their own ‘Gu Insects’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, at this moment, since everyone had their eyes on Neraka, they had naturally overlooked this fact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in a space filled with darkness and gloomy clouds, palaces, and islands floated in the sky while vast, bottomless Divine Mountains stood firmly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place resembled the ancient, fabled descriptions of Hell, where the realm was endless. The only visible thing was a surge of grey mist that knew no end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place was evidently uninhabited as there were no signs of any living beings&#8217; presence to be found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With fractures and traces of destruction all over the place, the land was severely scarred as if a horrendous war had once taken place here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marks left behind by meteorites&#8217; crash that were hundreds of kilometres wide remained, along with spreading cracks that formed a giant rift. From within, dense murderous auras rushed out, as if capable of trembling the world and affecting the distant dark moon. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The practice grounds and contact points in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds have all been annihilated. I knew that bastard Gu Changge didn&#8217;t have any good intentions. He must be the one secretly supporting Nephrite Breeze Pavilion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere in the depths of the palace, a terrifying figure clad in a battle suit made of Hell&#8217;s Iron stood with a Heavenly Sword in his hand. He looked at the distant sky with his icy glare that was overflowing with immense rage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My poor disciple has been slain as well, and I have only learned of her death just now. I shouldn&#8217;t have allowed her to stay there. I should have gotten her out of the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below the palace, an elderly woman in black softly spoke, yet her tone was incredibly spine-chilling. Her robe was loose, beautified by numerous delicate patterns. Those patterns seemed as though they were coming alive, including blossoming flowers and exuberant springs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that woman was none other than the mysterious Old Lady Meng. Meanwhile, the frightening figure before her was the Third Palace Lord of Neraka, someone of unfathomable power.</span></p>

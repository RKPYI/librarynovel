      <h4>Chapter 145: Cool Pretense; Hard Slap!</h4>
      <p><b>[Shua! Shua! Shua!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Divine rays of light arrived one after another from all around the
        Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless figures gathered in the surrounding mountains in a short
        period, and all of them came to watch the live show after receiving the
        news.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people already started to argue and fight before the actual battle
        even started.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, splendid brilliance intertwined in the sky and the Void,
        and all kinds of breathtaking treasures flew around.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Large swaths of mountains and ancient trees collapsed and dust filled
        the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“What crap is Long Teng? Wash your neck and wait for our Young Master
          Changge to harvest it as a trophy.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a young Heavenly Genius from the outside world who laughed and
        cursed the creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent without fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“You can’t imagine the might of Our Lord, Long Teng! That man with
          the Gu surname will die today!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        There were also creatures from the Ancient Immortal Continent who
        clapped back, and then the two sides started to fight with red eyes
        filled with killing intent. All kinds of blood splattered in every
        direction, and bones and tendons flew in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>The two groups of people split into two camps.</p>
      <p>
        In the east were native creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent, all
        with different shapes, sizes, and colors — there were blonde chicks with
        wings, old dragon-like men with scales on their arms, and giants with
        horns.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of them showed different expressions, but one thing was common about
        them: ‘all of them possessed mighty auras.’
      </p>
      <p>
        They rushed out from deep within the mountains and glared at the young
        talents from the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the west were the existences headed by a group of Young Supremes such
        as Ye Langtian, who was shrouded in golden rings, Wang Wushuang, who was
        shrouded in unparalleled mist, etc…
      </p>
      <p>
        They also glared at the creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent with
        cold eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The surroundings kept on turning brighter and brighter as more and more
        people arrived, and every now and then, they would discuss matters in
        whispers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though they knew that they were likely to be implicated, they still
        rushed here to witness the major event that could shake the Ancient
        Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        More and more people focused their eyes on a distant mountain’s peak,
        where a terrifying figure shrouded by ruins of Dragon Script stood alone
        and radiated a mighty aura that made everyone tremble.
      </p>
      <p>Long Teng!</p>
      <p>
        Behind him stood his followers in silence with indifferent expressions,
        like predators who had gone through thousands of battles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aura of a Pinnacle False God Realm master could be felt by all in
        the surroundings, and he did resemble a young True Dragon without a
        doubt.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone felt oppressed and terrified.</p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian and the others couldn’t help but change their expressions
        and feel the pressure build-up.
      </p>
      <p>It wasn’t easy to stand there!</p>
      <p>He was incomparably powerful!</p>
      <p>
        They couldn’t be Long Teng’s opponent in any way, the gap in their
        cultivation was simply too great.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Still, he doesn’t give the same feeling of unfathomableness as Daoist
        Brother Changge…’
      </p>
      <p>Ye Langtian shook his head.</p>
      <p>
        Not far from him stood Wang Wushuang, whose eyes flashed with golden
        runes as he also noticed the horror of Long Teng’s might.
      </p>
      <p>‘I hope I am not late.’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er, too, arrived in the form of a ray of divine light from the
        distance, after traversing mountain after mountain at breakneck speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, she saw the scene that would hold the battle in front of
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        From time to time, divine rays of light would cross over her section of
        the Ancient Immortal Continent as cultivators and creatures flew in from
        all directions one after another.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was clear that all of them were heading for the battle between Gu
        Changge and Long Teng.
      </p>
      <p>
        After coming over, she sneaked into the crowd with the hope that Gu
        Changge wouldn’t recognize her.
      </p>
      <p>Alas! Gu Xian’er was soon left disappointed.</p>
      <p>
        Even until now, Gu Changge didn’t make an appearance — let alone him,
        even his shadow didn’t appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        She even suspected that, with Gu Changge’s evil character, he might just
        stand this Long Teng up and let him give them all a good monkey show —
        that wasn’t out of the question!
      </p>
      <p>Of course, that was just a guess from her.</p>
      <p>‘Ah! That’s Big Sis Mingkong’s chariot…’</p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Xian’er noticed a white, jade chariot pulled by nine divine
        phoenixes in the sky galloping towards the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chariot floated high up in the sky and released its extraordinary
        splendor for all to see — the shadow of a vague and graceful figure
        could be seen sitting inside the chariot, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er immediately recognized it as Yue Mingkong’s means of
        transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s just that Gu Xian’er loved to run around solo, so she didn’t go to
        find Yue Mingkong after coming to the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also knew about the fact that Yue Mingkong had rushed to save her
        when the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace was hunting her down,
        but someone held her back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different from Gu Changge, she could tell that Yue Mingkong’s kindness
        towards her was sincere, and not hypocritical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless divine lights could be seen appearing high in the sky, and it
        was clear that the upcoming battle had attracted countless eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the older generation of the Ancient Immortal Continent pledged
        to the older generation of the outside world that they wouldn’t
        interfere in the skirmishes of the young’uns, it didn’t mean that some
        of them wouldn’t come out to watch the good show.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all…Long Teng was the hope of the Ancient Immortal True Dragon
        Family.
      </p>
      <p>‘Is she Gu Changge’s fiancee? The woman named Yue Mingkong?’</p>
      <p>
        Right then, Long Teng’s eyes flashed and one could see countless stars
        pulsing inside them if they looked closely, and then he stared at the
        white chariot and the figure inside it with enthusiasm.
      </p>
      <p>
        He acted as if his gaze could penetrate the layers of curtains hiding
        the beauty behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Have you thought about giving up on that man with the Gu
          surname?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, a smile appeared on Long Teng’s indifferent face and he
        looked toward the horizon and spoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the first time everyone heard Long Teng speak, and just one
        sentence from him ripped through the air like thunder as it contained
        terrifying might.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators felt their ears tremble, some forgot how to breathe,
        and some even fell to the ground!
      </p>
      <p>They were horrified.</p>
      <p>
        Afterward, many people showed dramatic changes in their expressions
        after making sense of Long Teng’s words.
      </p>
      <p>
        What kind of identity did Yue Mingkong possess? In the outside world,
        she was the future Empress of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty and held
        immeasurable might and authority.
      </p>
      <p>Yet his Long Teng was brave enough to talk to her like that?</p>
      <p>At that moment, many Young Heavenly Geniuses glared at him.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, some people knew that the hatred between Gu Changge and Long
        Teng was ignited by Yue Mingkong.
      </p>
      <p>
        The so-called ‘beauties bringing along disasters’ were just like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I have seen people courting death, but I have never seen someone as
          eager for death as you.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then, a cold and indifferent voice fell from the jade chariot,
        resembling the voice of nature that seemed to have no emotion at all as
        it spoke to a dead man.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, only Yue Mingkong knew that there was some strangeness in her
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng was indeed a character who was an expert at courting death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, she also came to watch the show, but what she had never
        expected was that Gu Changge would respond so fast and proclaim that he
        would slaughter Long Teng not too long after Long Teng hopped out and
        threatened him.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she remembered correctly, then Long Teng had a drop of True Dragon
        Blood Essence on his body.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a drop of Blood Essence that only appeared after the hardest
        scales of a True Dragon were torn off, and it was an extremely precious
        material with wonderful uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        It just so happened that she knew how to condense that drop of Essence
        Blood, but Gu Changge probably didn’t know.
      </p>
      <p><b>“I like your character!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng wasn’t enraged when he heard her words, and instead, showed
        appreciation.
      </p>
      <p>He loved women like that.</p>
      <p>
        The stronger they were, the higher the rush he would feel when he
        conquered them.
      </p>
      <p><b>“You disgust this Empress.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Although the words sounded indifferent, Yue Mingkong couldn’t help but
        wrinkle her eyebrows inside the chariot.
      </p>
      <p>After that, she made a move.</p>
      <p>
        She didn’t like this Long Teng at all, who disgusted her with his words
        and existence, and decided to attack him before Gu Changge even arrived
        at the place.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Sword lights filled and cold and dazzling silver-white vines made out of
        the sword lights rushed towards Long Teng with the intent to kill him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone was shocked as they never expected Yue Mingkong to attack Long
        Teng without making a sound like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brilliant rays of light bloomed in the Void in the next moment — it was
        Yue Mingkong’s mighty Imperial Art.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had broken through to the False God Realm, and although her
        Cultivation Base was much weaker than that of Long Teng, she didn’t show
        any fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, she wanted to know how strong Long Teng was, so she was
        testing the waters with her attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the group of onlooking cultivators saw a light rain
        flying downwards as the breath of the Great Dao permeated the
        surroundings — the Young Supremes witnessed Yue Mingkong’s might for the
        first time, and couldn’t help but show dignified and fearful
        expressions.
      </p>
      <p>She was powerful!</p>
      <p>
        It seems that Yue Mingkong’s true strength was far from what she showed
        on the surface.
      </p>
      <p><b>“How bold! How dare you attack me?!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s face froze and his smile disappeared when Yue Mingkong said
        he disgusted her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if he was in a good mood, he still couldn’t stomach a beautiful
        woman calling him disgusting right in front of so many onlookers!
      </p>
      <p>Especially when the other party took the initiative to attack him.</p>
      <p>
        One Gu Changge was enough already! Who would have thought even his
        fiancee was like that?!
      </p>
      <p>Right then, Long Teng’s happy mood vanished into thin air.</p>
      <p><b>“You ants have no chance of winning before me!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng said with an indifferent expression and directly chose to hold
        his hands behind his back with a look of contempt.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the face of Yue Mingkong’s attack, he only released vast fluctuations
        from between his eyebrows and made a vast ocean manifest in front of him
        as it rushed out like a tsunami.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was his mighty Innate Ability that turned the Void in front of him
        into a raging sea and blasted away everything!
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, even those in the True God Realm showed a change in their
        expression and dared not think about even taking that attack head-on. It
        was too terrifying, so much so that they reckoned their bodies would
        crumble in the face of the oncoming tsunami!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“No matter how strong Crown Princess Yue Mingkong might be, I don’t
          think she’s Long Teng’s opponent! There’s a gap between them that just
          can’t be closed with Cultivation Base alone.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A Young Supreme with torch-like eyes showed a frown and stared at Long
        Teng’s technique, and asked himself whether he would be able to face and
        resist its onslaught.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        However, in the next moment, everyone was startled, stunned, and
        shocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the indifferent and solemn look on Long Teng’s face froze as he
        watched the pieces of light rain explode like golden lotuses and tear
        apart the sky piece by piece.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Bang! Bang! Bang!]</b></p>
      <p>
        The pieces of light rain burst like lotus flowers, and in the next
        moment, tore through the golden ocean!
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone then saw the shadow of a peerless Empress stand high in the sky
        with a tyrannical and splendid majesty.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I admit that I underestimated you a little bit, but I won’t take
          mercy this time.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that his attack was blocked by Yue Mingkong filled Long Teng’s
        expression with gloom.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter what the result today might be, he had already lost much face.
      </p>
      <p>
        On weekdays, he could easily play even the top-ten Young Masters of the
        Ancient Immortal Continent in the palm of his hands, yet today…
      </p>
      <p>
        Didn’t that dragon-horned chick say Yue Mingkong’s strength was similar
        to her?
      </p>
      <p>What the heck was going on here?</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Where did you get the confidence to provoke Gu Changge with your
          little ability?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, Yue Mingkong rubbed salt in his wounds with such a
        statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the beginning to the end, she stayed in her jade chariot, yet her
        attack just now was so amazing that it shocked even creatures from the
        Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>Even the Young Supremes were shocked to their core!</p>
      <p>
        ‘Even if we reach the next Realm, we won’t be Crown Princess Mingkong’s
        opponents.’
      </p>
      <p>Although they were unwilling, they could only admit this fact.</p>
      <p>
        It’s just that Yue Mingkong’s words made many people look ahead with
        weird expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Didn’t Gu Changge say something along the same lines when the Seventh
        Princess of the Sea King Palace was hunting down Gu Xian’er?
      </p>
      <p>
        Wasn’t the meaning behind Yue Mingkong’s words the same as what he said?
      </p>
      <p>It seemed that she held great confidence in Gu Changge!</p>
      <p><b>“You have succeeded in angering me!”</b></p>
      <p>Long Teng said with a gloomy face.</p>
      <p>
        He believed that he needed to show the ignorant woman some powerful
        means, or else, she would keep on provoking him over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The followers behind him surged with rage, too, and dark clouds moved
        around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, all of them looked in Yue Mingkong’s direction with cold
        eyes and started to work together to suppress Yue Mingkong.
      </p>
      <p><b>“You have succeeded in angering me, too, little ant…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Right then, a faint voice rumbled between Heaven and Earth, and all
        cultivators and creatures, including Long Teng, showed a change in their
        expression as they looked towards the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, everyone felt as if the Lord of Heavens had descended
        upon them!
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        A mighty sound crackled, and brilliant rays of light swept across the
        sky and caused many cultivators to take in a deep breath.
      </p>
      <p>The scene in front of them scared them!</p>
      <p><b>“No…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s reaction, however, was quick and he sensed the changes in
        the Void before everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        His complexion changed and terrifying runes flowed all over his body and
        turned into a dazzling dragon armor as he tried to resist the onslaught!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as the Void in front of him distorted and blurred, a young man
        with a casual expression walked out with light steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brilliant, divine lights loomed around him, and there seemed to be
        endless might of oppression under his feet that seemed to cover the
        Heavens and the Earth!
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        The Void trembled so hard that everyone felt that it was about to be
        shattered by that force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng was kicked in the stomach before he could react, and coughed
        up blood as he flew back — all of his internal organs were shaken from
        their original location.
      </p>
      <p>
        With an unwilling expression, he was kicked to the ground with a bang!
      </p>
      <p>
        Smoke and dust flew around as mountains collapsed and massive fissures
        appeared on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge appeared! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I asked you to wait and die at my hands, and you did exactly that!
          You sure are an obedient one.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        He let out a laugh, but people couldn’t tell whether he was mocking Long
        Teng or just being playful.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, he raised his palm and various runes appeared in it to
        create a densely-packed drop of dazzling sword energy!
      </p>
      <p>
        A terrifying might manifested in the Void and endless power erupted in
        the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The runes converged together to form an expansive sea. Among them, there
        was star-like sword energy that fell like a sinking red sun.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Puff! Puff!]</b></p>
      <p>The large mountain in front of him exploded and turned into dust!</p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s followers spewed blood and flew upside down. Some of them
        couldn’t resist the onslaught and directly exploded into blood-mist in
        the Void.
      </p>
      <p>The bloody mist spread everywhere.</p>
      <p>Everyone who planned to watch a shocking battle was stunned.</p>
      <p>
        Unexpectedly, as soon as Gu Changge appeared, he kicked Long Teng to the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, it confirmed that one sentence in their minds: ‘the cooler
        you pretend to be, the harder you get slapped in the face.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge finally encountered an opportunity to slap someone’s face, so
        how could he not make full use of it?
      </p>
      <p><b>“Tell me, how do you want to die?”</b></p>
      <p>
        He looked down at Long Teng, who was buried under the crumbled mountains
        and asked with a casual tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was as if he was asking his good friend something like, ‘Sup bro,
        have you eaten?’
      </p>
      <p><b>“Master, what should we do with this bunch?”</b></p>
      <p>
        At that time, someone from Gu Changge’s followers asked while pointing
        toward the followers of Long Teng they had captured, including the
        dragon-horned girl whom Yue Mingkong was familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, she had intentionally let her go to cause some trouble for Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, however, the dragon-horned ‘goddess’ had a terrified
        expression, and she was covered in blood with her tongue cut off.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s people had tortured her on the way.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Of course, we gotta gut the gift we prepared for him right in front
          of Long Teng.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said.</p>
      <p>At the same time, he glanced at Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>
        ‘I am gonna deal with this trash first, and then settle the account with
        you later.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong could guess the meaning behind his gaze but kept her calm
        as if she didn’t notice anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        She understood better than anyone else just what Gu Changge could do
        with her.
      </p>
      <p>Of course…she misunderstood Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge merely glanced at her to make sure she wasn’t injured.</p>
      <p>
        However, seeing that there wasn’t anything wrong with her, he asked,
        <b>“Are you alright?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately, Yue Mingkong was flattered by the fact that Gu Changge
        cared about her, but then she realized that it might just be an act Gu
        Changge was putting on for the masses, so she shook her head and said
        with a cold-but-natural tone, <b>“Don’t worry, Changge, I am fine.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>She was a little moved in her heart but recovered within moments.</p>
      <p>
        After all, she couldn’t tell which of Gu Changge’s sentences were true
        and which were false…what’s more? She was telling the truth.
      </p>
      <p>Although Long Teng was strong, she wasn’t weak either.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, the cultivators in the nearby mountains reacted, and as they
        watched the scene in front of them, they could only sigh and say, ‘What
        a good couple!’

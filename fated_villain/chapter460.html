          Furthermore, it should be someone personally trained and raised by the

          he was bleeding out. The rest Lin Wu brought this time also surrounded

          on everyone&#8217;s faces. She was holding a shiny, powerful

          that, he didn&#8217;t dare make a move on her because he feared he
          would indirectly harm Lu Luo. He would constantly be worried as long
          as he hadn&#8217;t gotten confirmation of Lu Luo&#8217;s safety. It

          were furious, but they were even more unwilling to submit and were
          afraid. They thought that the matter had finally come to a peaceful
          end and they could escape back to Sky Deer City, but who would have

          scrutinised her with an odd look in his eyes. For him, it didn&#8217;t
          matter whether she was pretending, or her Dao Heart had been tainted
          by Demonic Energy. It was the same thing to him. With her as his
          hostage, the defences of Sky Deer City and Aether Abyss would be
          nothing to him.

          >Moreover, after she was possessed by the Heart-Possessing Demon, her
          attitude towards the invasion of the Eight Desolation and Ten Domains
          by the Upper Realm obviously changed a lot. The primary reason for the
          change was the tragic scene of a ruined city and corpses seen in the
          Morphing Demonic Domain.</span

          >Subconsciously, Sky Deer Goddess already thought of it as a fact that
          couldn&#8217;t be changed in the future, that it was the manifestation
          of a small part of the future. After all, someone of her cultivation
          level already knew the truth and falsehood of a lot of things. Her
          belief in that being the future was the reason why she changed so much
          after being possessed.</span

          >&#8220;It&#8217;s worth it if sacrificing them would protect Sky Deer
          City and the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains,&#8221; the Goddess
          calmly answered. Her answer brought a smile to Gu Changge&#8217;s
          face, and despite the curious look in his eyes, he didn&#8217;t say
          anything else after that.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, the golden platform stretched and landed at the Gu Family
          Residence. Other than Lin Wu, the rest, Sky Deer Goddess included,
          were all imprisoned in other dungeons under Gu Changge&#8217;s
          order.</span

          >As Gu Changge&#8217;s prisoner of war, Sky Deer Goddess still
          hadn&#8217;t earned Gu Changge&#8217;s trust. He needed more time to
          observe her. However, she was a True Daoist after all. Normal seals
          and restrictions wouldn&#8217;t be all that useful on her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Therefore, the Immortal Gu Family had assigned some experts to watch
          over Gu Changge&#8217;s prisoners so that they would be notified of
          any changes at any time. Finally, Lin Wu and Lu Luo met again in the
          dungeon after being separated for a long time. They both had mixed
          emotions written on their faces.</span

          >&#8220;I hope he didn&#8217;t make things hard for you.&#8221; Lin Wu
          was the first among the two of them to break the silence. He felt
          helpless when he saw how sickly Lu Luo looked. He himself had become a
          prisoner of war.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Lu Luo shook her head, face pale. When she noticed the
          injury on Lin Wu&#8217;s body, she asked worriedly, &#8220;Was it the
          imposter the one who hurt you?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Lin Wu smiled wryly and nodded. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing serious. I
          didn&#8217;t know that person wasn&#8217;t you at the time, and I
          thought I could escape with you. But look at what happened,&#8221; he
          sighed before telling her about the entire story while leaving out Sky
          Deer Goddess&#8217; identity because of how big her involvement in the
          matter was. It was also for this reason that the Goddess didn&#8217;t
          let him reveal her whereabouts.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sky Deer Goddess was of noble and extraordinary status. Once the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains knew that she had fallen into Gu
          Changge&#8217;s hand, there was a high possibility of mass panic. At
          that time, if the other experts knew that the Goddess was going to
          help him, they would definitely change their minds about letting him
          take such risks. It was a pity that an accident had happened with the
          Goddess, and she was the complete opposite of who she was before. It
          was to the point where Lin Wu thought she was a different
          person.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Lu Luo further paled after she listened to Lin Wu&#8217;s detailed
          story. She couldn&#8217;t stop herself from shaking when she heard
          that almost everyone in Sky Deer City, her family included, had given
          up on her. Even though she had already guessed this would happen, she
          was still hit by a wave of sadness.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It seems like everything he mentioned has happened.&#8221; She
          took a glance outside the dungeon to look at Gu Changge, who had been
          there the whole time with a faint smile on his face. She
          couldn&#8217;t help trembling in fear at the sight of him. From the
          beginning to the end, the development of the matter was exactly as Gu
          Changge said to her before. Even the attitude of everyone in Sky Deer
          City towards her and Lin Wu was as he had predicted.</span

          heart as well. He could see no hope in this cold, damp, and dark
          dungeon.</span

          about we hear Gu Changge out?&#8221; One could only imagine how much
          determination she needed when she said those words.</span

          >&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; Lin Wu could hear a buzzing in his
          ears the moment she suggested that. His mind went blank like he had
          been struck by a giant bell. &#8220;Hear him out?&#8221;

          was supposed to regard Gu Changge as her arch-enemy. He couldn&#8217;t
          believe she said they should listen to what Gu Changge had to say.

          he using one of his tricks to make you say those words?&#8221; Lin
          Wu&#8217;s eyes were wide as he asked incredulously. His voice was
          also shaking.</span

          bitter expression on her face. &#8220;We are now in his hands. Do you
          think the people from Sky Deer City will come and rescue
          us?&#8221;</span

          come, but the people imprisoned might even expose the many secrets of
          Sky Deer City. But&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t like he could do anything
          about it. Anyone who came to rescue them now was doomed to lose their
          lives. Likewise, was it worth it to try and save them?</span

          all, his family valued him very much. They had further exhausted their
          resources after Lin Wu showed his powerful Talents. With his
          personality, he couldn&#8217;t do something that would betray his

          Changge is the oldest force in the Upper Realm. Their background is
          unfathomable. As long as we help Gu Changge, he can guarantee that the
          families supporting us will be brought to the Upper Realm

          Lin Wu, she started having a change in mindset. The family that

          forces while they stayed in this hellhole? Furthermore, she knew that

          the outside world feels great hatred towards us. If he hadn&#8217;t
          made us the scapegoat, we wouldn&#8217;t have this many problems now.
          The most important thing now is to clear up what has happened. I am
          confused about something, though. Didn&#8217;t just four Sect Masters
          fight against him? Why did eight died? Why are there another four more
          dead?&#8221;</span

          >After hearing the report, the Godly Illusion Emperor frowned deeply
          and began to think of a solution. There was no point in announcing
          that the clan had nothing to do with it right now, as it would only
          lead to the others being more incited, thinking that they were running
          away from responsibility. Thus, there were more risks than benefits to
          that approach.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The tomb had been left to them by the Clan&#8217;s Prime Ancestors,
          so they would be the prime suspect if something happened to other
          forces in there. Besides, with Gu Changge&#8217;s testimony, the blame
          was now on them and they could never get rid of it. All they could do
          was grit their teeth and bear with it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Luoshen froze at that, feeling puzzled at first. After some
          thought, the whole thing became more suspicious. She had witnessed
          only four Sect Masters dying at Gu Changge&#8217;s hand. How did the
          other four die? She shivered after thinking of one reason.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Father, do you think it&#8217;s Gu Changge who killed four
          more in order to incite hatred between us and their Sects? According
          to the current information, Gu Changge had been the last to leave the
          tomb. He wouldn&#8217;t need that much time even if it was collapsing.
          He must have done something in the time between taking the Prime
          Ancestor’s Divinity Crystal and leaving the tomb. So, it might be him
          who has killed the other four Sect Masters.&#8221; Her voice shook
          slightly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why did he do that? Did he do it just to frame us? How
          evil!&#8221; The Godly Illusion Emperor felt this was the most
          possible explanation and looked increasingly enraged. He hadn&#8217;t
          expected the Godly Illusion Clan would be framed by someone one day
          and the only way to resolve it was to smile and yield to Gu Changge,
          recognising their misfortune. There would be more problems if he
          firmly stood against Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Father, I think he has other motives in killing these four
          Sect Masters. Framing us was just a bonus. I just don&#8217;t know
          what it is.&#8221; She frowned as she thought of another possibility.
          In her opinion, Gu Changge never did anything for no reason. He
          didn&#8217;t have to go to such lengths to frame the Godly Illusion
          Clan.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No matter the reason, it&#8217;s undeniable that these eight
          Sect Masters have died at his hand. Luoshen, you must capture the monk
          and that youth who escaped back then. They cannot end up with Gu
          Changge. They are the key to resolving the whole issue. I may have to
          trouble you, or our Clan will face an even greater threat,&#8221; the
          Godly Illusion Emperor ordered with a dark expression. That was the
          only solution he could think of, pushing the blame on these two.
          Besides, the tomb&#8217;s collapse and re-awakening of the arrays had
          nothing to do with Jiang Luoshen. Meanwhile, these two had escaped at
          the most vital moment, making them look extremely suspicious. It was a
          good opportunity to place the blame on them instead.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I understand, Father.&#8221; Jiang Luoshen gritted her teeth
          briefly, retreating with a pale face.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She began to send members of her Clan to capture Jiang Chen and Monk
          Pu Du to resolve the impending threat. She understood what her father
          was saying &#8211; propagating rumours was a better solution than
          putting them to rest. Any further explanations would invite more
          suspicion. If they admitted they had some responsibility while
          painting themselves as the victim, the result would be different. The
          only condition was not allowing Gu Changge to get involved.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, news spread from the Godly Illusions Clan which shocked
          everyone. The Clan had borne heavy losses and not the enormous gains
          as assumed by the other Sects. Only one out of ten of the members they
          had sent out had returned and they hadn&#8217;t possessed any relics
          from their Prime Ancestor. They didn&#8217;t have anything to do with
          the tomb&#8217;s collapse, the re-awakening of the arrays, and the
          deaths of the Sect Masters. Instead, it had been caused by a
          mysterious man and a monk.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The whole thing had started because Jiang Luoshen had been cheated by
          them. They had reassured her that they could break the various arrays
          within the tomb, which was why she had brought them to the Godly
          Illusion Tomb. They had suddenly stolen the Prime Ancestor’s Divinity
          Crystal just when Jiang Luoshen and Gu Changge had been fighting for
          it. After that, they activated the arrays and caused the tomb to
          collapse. The destructive force erupted in an instant, resulting in
          such a devastating result.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To prove the truth of their words, the Godly Illusion Clan mentioned
          that the mysterious man was actually a Successor of the Divine Source
          Master. His abilities were mysterious and could change the order of
          nature as well as alter arrays and restrictions. Thus, the
          Clan&#8217;s Prime Ancestor’s Divinity Crystal had ended up with them,
          and it wasn&#8217;t known where they were.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the news spread, there was an instant uproar. The different Sects
          trying to seek justice from the Clan were stunned and didn&#8217;t
          know how to react as it was too shocking. The legendary Successor of
          the Divine Source Master had appeared, but then activated the array
          within the tomb, killing everyone within. Even the Prime Ancestor’s
          Divinity Crystal had been stolen by them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The truth of the explanation didn&#8217;t matter as it caused
          immediate shock waves. The identity of that mysterious youth was soon
          exposed by the Clan. His name was Jiang Chen. This resulted in great
          shock as well. Although many doubted the truthfulness of the claim,
          more chose to believe it. Unless the Clan was truly foolish, it would
          never kill the eight Sect Masters, which would attract too much hatred
          onto them. It was also clear they had suffered losses from this. Many
          connected this claim to what Gu Changge had said and felt that the
          Clan wasn&#8217;t lying.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen&#8217;s name spread around and a lot of people started
          looking for him. Both the Prime Ancestor’s Divinity Crystal and the
          Successor of the Divine Source Master were highly coveted. Even some
          independent cultivators started searching for them, and began putting
          out feelers to look for the youth in question. Meanwhile, Jiang Chen
          and Monk Pu Du had immediately found a hiding place after escaping the
          Godly Illusion Tomb. They didn&#8217;t expect that the Clan would
          resort to this and were alarmed by it.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Not only did they cut connections with us but framed us by
          claiming that we stole the Prime Ancestor’s Divinity Crystal after all
          that we have done!&#8221; Jiang Chen&#8217;s teeth almost shattered
          from how hard he was gritting them and his eyes were red with anger.
          He had assumed he would be safe after fleeing the Godly Illusion Tomb,
          not expecting an even greater danger awaited for them. Now, everyone
          believes that he owned a precious treasure, but he didn&#8217;t have
          it. Likewise, he himself didn’t know the teachings of a Divine Source
          Master. Worst, everyone thought he had trapped and killed the eight
          Sect Masters, so now, those Sects would never let him off easy.</span

          same fate like locusts on the same rope.&#8221; Monk Pu Du sighed
          slowly, more tolerable about the whole thing.</span

          unharmed but then broke her promise, and now, she&#8217;s framing us.
          How disgusting is she? I opened a path for her and resolved many of
          the arrays, giving her enough time to flee at the end. Yet, this is
          how she treats me. When I get stronger, I will never let her off
          easy.&#8221; Jiang Chen&#8217;s intense hatred was now targeted at
          someone other than Gu Changge.</span

          >In his opinion, the tomb wouldn&#8217;t have collapsed if the
          Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation hadn&#8217;t
          activated the arrays within the Godly Illusion Tomb, delaying Gu
          Changge&#8217;s plans. Otherwise, would she have escaped alive? But
          now, she was repaying his kindness with evil intentions.</span

          are willing to come with me.&#8221; Monk Pu Du sighed, hands making a
          praying gesture. Naturally, Jiang Chen did not hesitate. His
          black-robed senior was nowhere to be seen and the Artifact Spirit of
          the Celestial Boat of Creation was hibernating, so he could only
          depend on the reliable-looking monk.</span

          Pu Du smiled, a seemingly ancient air exuding from him. He looked like
          an enlightened monk of high standing. Jiang Chen was amazed, feeling
          that the monk was mysterious and possessed a high cultivation
          level.</span

          >After returning to the Immortal Academy, the first thing Gu Changge
          did was to refine the Godly Illusion Divinity Crystal and the various
          Sources he had acquired from the Godly Illusion Tomb. After several
          days, his cultivation level was now closer to the Sacred Emperor
          Realm. He did pay attention to the rumours in the outside world, and
          the fact that the Godly Illusion Clan would choose to push the blame
          onto Jiang Chen and the mysterious monk, which did not surprise him.
          People were extremely selfish after all and the Clan, being one of the
          oldest clans in the Upper Realm, would never want to incite public
          anger because of this. Protecting one&#8217;s interests always came
          naturally to those that were intelligent.</span

          from him would put all their plans and efforts to waste, leading to
          more hatred towards them. Their actions showed some submission towards
          him though, where they seemed to be swallowing down their
          dissatisfaction. Jiang Luoshen knew the Godly Illusion Divinity
          Crystal was in his possession and the Sect Masters had died at his
          hand. Yet, she hadn&#8217;t mentioned anything about it and chose to
          frame someone else. This felt like a gesture of goodwill towards him,
          so he had no reason to continue pressuring them.</span

          the issue regarding Bai Lian&#8217;er before going to the Demon

          sent people to investigate her, while also asking Yin Mei to help him
          observe the branches of the Nephrite Breeze Pavilion. Thus, he already
          had something in mind.</span

          Changge decided to let someone destroy some of its branches, and
          capture important figures within its management. With Bai Hun and
          these important figures within his control, she simply had no choice

          recognised her and were shaken. They did not understand why she was
          there. The hottest topic in the Upper Realm currently was the
          relationships between the Clan and the different Sects. Since she was
          the princess of the Clan, wasn&#8217;t she worried that anything bad
          would happen to her? Besides, she was unaccompanied, standing alone
          and emotionless like an immovable glacier which exuded a freezing
          aura.

          >&#8220;Princess Luoshen, please come with me. My Master is waiting
          for you in the palace.&#8221; Soon, a muscular figure transformed into
          a light beam and sped towards the entrance, greeting her with clasped
          hands. Everyone became more surprised by this, knowing that this
          muscular person was one of Gu Changge&#8217;s followers. He was strong
          and pretty popular within the Immortal Academy.</span

          Didn&#8217;t they fight due to a misunderstanding inside the Godly
          Illusion Tomb? One of the peak Sacred Lord Realm Masters of the Godly
          Illusion Clan had even been killed by Gu Changge!]

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Immortal Academy was astir at her arrival, with many young
          prodigies emerging from their cave mansions in astonishment after
          receiving the news.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had some reputation in the enormous Upper Realm, viewed as a
          goddess by many young prodigies due to her powerful strength,
          terrifying Talents, and otherworldly beauty. The events that had
          transpired in the Godly Illusion Tomb did not diminish any of her
          attractiveness in the slighted. The fact she had come alone from her
          home to meet Gu Changge at the Immortal Academy made them envious.
          They began to guess what had happened between the two of them.</span

          >&#8220;Princess Luoshen, Master is already inside the palace. I shall
          take my leave first.&#8221; The person who had led Jiang Luoshen to
          the palace left. She stared at the palace without any visible emotion,
          yet she was shivering internally while clenching her hands within her
          sleeves. That uncertain feeling of fear rose once again as she felt
          the threat of death hanging over her. She could almost see Gu Changge
          clutching her neck and holding her up again, striking her into a
          bloody mist soon after.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was slightly pale and uneasy, even though her father had given
          her a protective amulet, which would allow her to leave instantly if
          anything went wrong. This decision had taken a lot of her courage to
          make and she wouldn&#8217;t have done this if not for the Clan. Of
          course, this was all her fault and she couldn&#8217;t blame anyone
          else. She had grown too proud and forceful, as she had been fated to
          rule over everyone and become the future Godly Illusion Empress from
          the moment she was born. Thus, with such a personality, how could she
          allow herself to retreat?</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that thought, she took a deep breath and her expression regained
          its coldness. She pushed open the doors and walked in, inhaling the
          light yet refined fragrance of tea as soon as she entered. A handsome
          young man was waving his fan behind the kettle, his hair shimmering
          faintly. He seemed to be careful of the fire due to the looser robes
          he was wearing, clearly attentive yet his demeanour seemed laid-back
          and even idle.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This was the first time she had seen him this way; she froze on the
          spot, swallowing down the words she had been planning to say. Her
          first impression of him inside the Tomb had been cold yet assertive.
          He was a more terrifying person than she was. Not to mention,
          extremely cruel and despicable. She hadn&#8217;t expected him to be
          brewing tea leisurely when she had been so cautious and prepared. This
          was vastly different from the man she saw him as, and the way he
          looked now was reminiscent of an extraordinary deity who had left the
          mortal world behind. She hadn&#8217;t forgotten that she had been
          killed by him before, though.</span

          from her thoughts. For some reason, she involuntarily sat on the stone
          bench beside her.

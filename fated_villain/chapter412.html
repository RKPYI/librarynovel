          &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about this. It might be due to Father&#8217;s
          failure in doing the job well that Empress Yao Xi is unhappy.
          Don&#8217;t worry, sister. Her Majesty might release Father and

          demeanour. She, too, didn&#8217;t say anything. To be honest, she was
          somewhat disappointed in Jun Fan. She didn&#8217;t understand why he
          continued to lie and hide his identity, even at this point. However,
          she didn&#8217;t have the spare energy to dwell on this if he was
          going to continue denying the truth.

          sister, greatly disappointed Song Youwei. She could think of a way to
          help him but that was under the condition he gave her a reasonable
          explanation. After all, why did he feel the need to cover the truth up

          many pleasant surprises is hidden here.&#8221; Intending to find the
          Gates of Death first, Jun Fan began to talk to the two of them about
          it. Now that he had explored many areas, he could avoid some dangerous
          places.</span

          According to what you said, there are indeed some clear differences.”
          Song Youwei nodded and took out a geomantic compass with various
          eye-catching runes flashing on its surface.</span

          contains unimaginable opportunities.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When he was on his way here, an ancient route appeared in his mind.
          It was the key left by the Solar Demon Overlord that was starting to
          work. Like a star chart, the ancient route directed him to go straight
          ahead, to prevent him from falling into life-threatening situations by
          mistake.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The three of them saw many fragments of ancient battleships, flying
          boats, divine swords, and tattered, abandoned weapons stained with
          black blood. It seemed that war had indeed happened here. Hurrying
          along the misty path, they went into the deeper end while breaking
          many arrays.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With Song Youwei&#8217;s resourcefulness, and Junfan&#8217;s key and
          detailed direction, they barely met any obstacles when they went in.
          Only Jun Yao looked at the two of them in surprise as she followed
          behind them. She was tightly holding the protective object Gu Changge
          gave her in her palm.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It didn&#8217;t take long before they saw a desert-like scenery,
          where yellow sand covered every centimeter. The other side was also
          bare mountains crowded with volcanic craters. There was not a lake or
          green hill in sight.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The magma bubbling in the craters was, in fact, blood of a darker
          red. Wisps of black and red flames with traces of divinity and the
          smell of blood constantly wafted in the air. No one knew for sure how
          many years it took for the bloody magma to take form. They
          couldn&#8217;t see the sight further away, but they could feel that
          the Principles here were not suitable for cultivation and survival of
          the beings from the Demon World.</span

          Fan. &#8220;Jun Fan, you seem to have a map of this place. Most of the
          paths we took have been smooth.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I just so happened to receive an incomplete map. That&#8217;s
          why I wanted to invite you here to see if we can break through the
          energy fields,&#8221; Jun Fan explained calmly.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Song Youwei reacted by letting out a small frown, but she nodded in
          acknowledgement without saying anything else.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They soon continued on their journey. There were many beasts here
          that were more ferocious and powerful than ordinary beasts because
          they had been surrounded by the aura of death all year round. It took
          the trio a lot of effort to pass through this place to go deeper.
          After they left this place, a group of experts appeared to follow
          after them with their energies concealed.

          >Jiang Luoshen wore a golden robe on her tall and slender body. As her
          blonde hair fluttered, and the runes gradually disappeared in her
          golden eyes, she began to speak in an fascinated tone, &#8220;Seems
          like it&#8217;s true that Jun Bufan and the others can find the exact
          route. The so-called Gates of Death is here.&#8221;

          >The moment Jun Fan and the others stepped into this place, Jiang
          Luoshen&#8217;s group had rushed over, but they hid at an appropriate
          distance away to avoid alarming or getting noticed by Jun Fan&#8217;s
          party.</span

          >&#8220;Gu Changge, how on earth did you manage to get Jun Yao to be
          so obedient, to the point she’s so willing to let you use her to lead
          the way?&#8221; she couldn&#8217;t help asking Gu Changge who was
          standing beside her impassively. She had always thought of women as
          emotional beings. Even if Jun Yao knew that Jun Fan&#8217;s actions
          were harming the family, it would still be difficult for her to firmly
          decide to betray him.</span

          >Regardless of whether it was strength, cultivation, or ability, the
          more she got to know Gu Changge, the more terrifying she realised he
          was.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Does it matter?&#8221; Gu Changge withdrew his gaze and threw
          a glance at her</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Forget it,&#8221; she coldly huffed. She couldn&#8217;t help
          feeling wronged that someone of her status was now a mere servant that
          he could instruct at will. He would be rather cold and indifferent
          sometimes when she asked him about certain things. Even though she
          knew that this was his true self, and that the gentleness he usually
          showed was just a facade, it often hit her that he might be incapable
          of feeling emotions.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Bang!* A cloud of dark black fog filled the air in the void. Soon
          after, Bai Lian&#8217;er appeared. She couldn&#8217;t help musing when
          she saw Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s appearance. &#8220;So even the Princess
          of Godly Illusion Clan has no choice but to submit to another
          person.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Stay out of my business.&#8221; Jiang Luoshen peered at her
          coldly.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Bai Lian&#8217;er only chuckled in return before her figure turned
          into a fog that disappeared with a bang, leaving behind Jiang Luoshen,
          whose face remained as cold as ice. Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s words
          were like a thorn in her flesh.</span

          useless for you to ask about something that I shouldn&#8217;t tell
          you.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head slightly and uttered these words
          before he turned into a divine rainbow and went to the place where Jun
          Fan and the other two went. That made Jiang Luoshen snort coldly. As
          dismissive as Gu Changge was, his words still made her feel better.
          [At least he still cares about my feelings.]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A thick aura of death permeated the air in the hills and valleys in
          the distance. Many carcasses of huge monsters could be seen lying
          here, piled up to make what looked like a hill. There was neither
          flesh nor blood on them, as only their dried-up bones remained. There
          was also a collapsed palace here. From the outline of the pavilions
          and squares in many places, it seemed like it was once a majestic
          building.</span

          must be the portal we&#8217;re looking for. I can sense its
          aura,&#8221; Jun Fan exclaimed, his words a little excited. As
          expected, he would soon meet his father, and he would be able to ask
          about the many things that happened in the past six thousand
          years.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Song Youwei nodded. There was actually a forest filled with crimson
          mist amidst the ruins. She had never seen the trees that grew here.
          The main thing was that even with her ability, it took her some time
          to break through the obstacles. Not only that, but she also used up an
          extremely precious array-breaking treasure. Now that she was here, she
          was intrigued by this place.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The crimson mist is highly corrosive. It&#8217;s as if it was
          blown here from the Nine Nethers. It&#8217;s inevitable that something
          bad will happen if we are exposed to the mist for an extended period
          of time.&#8221; Song Youwei took out a secret treasure that looked
          like a sphere from her storage ring. After she captured some of the
          crimson mist into it, she found that the mist had a spiritual nature,
          and it was even wriggling about in the device.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing this brought a nasty chill up her spine. However, she could
          still hold it in for the time being by protecting her body with the
          spiritual energy outside her body. Soon, Jun Fan and the others went
          deep into the crimson forest in front of them. At the junction of
          several mountains in front, they saw an incomparably majestic portal
          flowing with radiance. It was as if the Celestial Realm itself was
          erected right there. Behind the portal was a barely visible mountain
          which seemed to be a pathway to another world.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As though they had come to the gates of Hell, Jun Yao felt a chill
          run through her body. &#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221;
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She gasped. The wisps of crimson mist seeping out from the portal
          made her hair stand on end.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s the Gates of Death…&#8221; Song Youwei frowned.
          With her good memory, she recognised the two ancient characters on the
          portal in front of her. They were of a Demonic Language that was near
          extinction from an extremely ancient era.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone began to gather around this portal as they wandered around
          it, all the while keeping their eyes wide. Right then, Jun Fan felt a
          burst of brilliance emerge in his Knowledge Sea. The key was shining
          as it manifested in a corner, and it could be taken out upon his
          calling. He had already confirmed now that this was the Gates of Death
          that the Solar Demon Overlord told him about. Also, only the possessor
          of the key could enter this portal.</span

          >&#8220;Is the treasure you&#8217;re looking for behind this portal,
          Fan’er?&#8221; Jun Yao blurted out nervously. She was still grabbing
          onto the protective item Gu Changge gave her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Fan couldn&#8217;t help letting out a smile as he nodded. He had
          nothing to hide at this point. &#8220;Behind this portal is the secret
          of the madness that happened in the Demon World six thousand years
          ago. As long as I walk in, I will know everything.&#8221; He believed
          that the current situation in the Demon World would be reversed in an
          instant as long as he found the Solar Demon Overlord. Empress Yao
          Xi&#8217;s control over the Nine Domains would soon be dissolved, and
          all the problems could be easily resolved then.</span

          stared at a small line of characters next to the portal. She

          also a line of words in small characters here. It seems that only
          those who have the key can pass through this portal and enter the

          circulating on it. It looked majestic and heavy like an abyss in the
          sky that could crush down at any time. Moreover, each divine script

          ancient warship, looked on with interested eyes. According to her
          understanding of Gu Changge, he wasn&#8217;t someone who would do
          anything unnecessary. She was more convinced that the Solar Demon
          Overlord might have had some kind of accident, such as being brutally
          killed by Gu Changge, than him simply being missing. However, this was
          only her guess. She didn&#8217;t have any evidence for this

          to do with the Fortuity of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.] Gu

          the accumulation of Fortuity. It wasn&#8217;t Fortuity from the whole
          realm, but given its volume, it might as well be. Under such
          circumstances, Zhao Yunze&#8217;s cultivation and might could be said
          to have reached the peak in his entire lifetime. Even though he
          couldn&#8217;t get a Fortuity Chest after killing Zhao Yunze, Gu

          Domains’ Heavenly Way had weakened a lot. The reason many experts were
          unwilling to make a move against Sky Deer City was because of the
          suppression from the Heavenly Way, which made it difficult for them to
          truly unleash their powers. There was always a risk of them being
          defeated here.</span

          that he might be able to control the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains
          after he successfully invaded the city. After all, this was equivalent
          to the World Principles here weakening. Its meaning was evident.</span

          under his feet, leading him back to the Upper Realm Army. Those on the
          walls of Sky Deer City who watched Gu Changge calmly leave were livid.
          However, even though they couldn&#8217;t hide their murderous aura, no
          one dared to tell him to stay. Even the senior True Daoists could only
          remain quiet at this moment. Everyone from the Upper Realm had to
          suffer in silence as they both witnessed the experts from their world

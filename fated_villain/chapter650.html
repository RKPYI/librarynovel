        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark and dense mist surged in this space filled with despair and death. Above their heads was the sky where stars flowed and Chaos Qi was unfathomably vast. It was as if they had come to the end of the universe.</span><span id="more-34815"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many firm dark cages forged from unknown metal were suspended mid-air in the surrounding void as Divine Principles gushed out. From time to time, purple thunderbolts would strike, causing the struggling living beings to groan and ceaselessly tremble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only the Earth Sword Immortals, but even the True Daoists imprisoned here did not need to think about escaping. This space covered an extremely large area. In fact, the surroundings were boundless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling despondent and frightened, everyone looked on at the blurred figure in white in the distance. They had never imagined that it was such a young man that single-handedly caused the ultimate catastrophe of Profound Sword World. This was simply unimaginable. No matter who it was, anyone who knew the truth would shiver and feel cold all over out of fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a dark throne floating in the centre, where Gu Changge sat. His vague and abstruse face had a hint of indifference and the majesty of a god. As his gaze fell, he slowly looked over all the Earth Sword Immortals imprisoned here and finally nodded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few days, the only remaining Earth Sword Immortals in Profound Sword World were captured and held captive here by the World’s Will. Except for a few who managed to slip through because their aura couldn&#8217;t be detected, almost no one was left out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;May I ask when will the final immolation begin, Young Master?&#8221; The black-haired middle-aged man, who was the World’s Will, was burly and tall. He had thick hair and eyes as deep and vast as the night sky. However, he was incomparably respectful and fearful of Gu Changge. After all, his life was in his hands. Gu Changge could get rid of him at any time. He also didn&#8217;t have the guts to show hesitation or refusal regarding Gu Changge&#8217;s orders and arrangements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s give it a moment. There are still some people who haven&#8217;t arrived yet.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head lightly. Although his eyes were calm, the depths of them were filled with indifference, and there weren&#8217;t any emotional fluctuations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand.&#8221; The World’s Will was silent as he nodded. At this moment, he had a feeling that Gu Changge was more of the one who held authority over the Heavenly Dao than he was, seeing his ruthlessness and lack of interest while he regarded everything in the world as mere pawns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Hum!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge&#8217;s sleeves trembled slightly, the void in front of him grew blurry before an image emerged within. Everything that happened in the Profound Sword World was displayed here. Disasters had swept across the land: the sky collapsed, the earth cracked, and seas and rivers dried up. The world was in a devastating condition. Stars entangled with red flames fell from the sky, hitting the ground and forming terrifying deep pits and cracks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many who couldn&#8217;t escape in time were hit by these stars, and they turned into ashes or meat paste, instantly having their bodies and souls wiped out. Hundreds of millions could only howl as they helplessly watched the entire world continue to collapse and shrink. It was as if Profound Sword World was tightly held by invisible giant hands that were slowly crushing it. The dome of the sky began to crack, and large pieces fell. Flames surged and spread to all parts of the earth, leaving everything along the way on fire before they turned into ashes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a disheartening and tragic scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even those with a strong cultivation base were shaking in fear at this juncture and could only keep thinking of ways to escape to the central region. But when the collapsed area reached the central region, this world would not be far from destruction. By then, everyone, without exception, would be dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to those of Profound Sword World who were fleeing for their lives, the Upper Realm Army, who came to this world, were also making their escape. The ancient battleships turned into streams of light that shot across the sky at a speed that allowed them to travel through the universe, avoiding the turbulent void and the falling stars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the world collapsed, World Principles were broken, and the air of destruction was everywhere. The most dangerous area was the closed Space Rift to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was only one way for everyone to escape, and that was to go to the central region of Profound Sword World. Other than that, they might have a glimmer of hope for survival by rescuing the Ancestors trapped somewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black mist drifted over from an unknown place and swallowed many cultivators. Soon, fresh blood spewed from their mouths and noses, and they dried up quickly as if all their vitality and energy were devoured, turned into nourishment for the black mist. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the mist had now covered every corner of Profound Sword World, it was still streaming towards the centermost area at a terrifying speed. There was almost no way to stop its advance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems that our only way now is to rescue the Ancestors first, or they will definitely be trapped in this world with no way to return to the Upper Realm.&#8221; Many figures stood on the ancient battleships as they looked at all that was happening solemnly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn&#8217;t know of Yu Feiya&#8217;s involvement yet and wanted to take advantage of the chaos in this world to help the Ancestors, who were trapped at an unknown location. After all, only with the power of a True Daoist did they have the opportunity to find the coordinates of the Upper Realm and reopen the Space Rift to safely return to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling mind-blown, Yu Feiya seemed to ignore all the conversations around her. She, too, felt a lingering fear as she looked at the terrifying scene below. This was the process of an ancient great world collapsing and going extinct as if a terrifying black hole was expanding and swallowing everything. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything was buried in it. Even the ancient beasts that lived in the deep sea could only let out an unwilling, mournful cry before they were swallowed by the turbulent flow of the broken void. Let alone living beings, even the stars were as small as dust being pressed under this rumbling, majestic power that belonged to the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We can only hope that he keeps his promise and lets us go. No one will be able to leave this place alive otherwise.] Yu Feiya quietly sighed to herself. Even she was not sure whether Gu Changge would let them go. However, obeying his order was indeed the only way they could live. She quickly regained her composure and said to the experts behind her, &#8220;The place where the Imperial Ancestor is imprisoned should be right in front. I hope everyone will join forces to take action.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up ahead was the central region of Profound Sword World, which was also an area that had not collapsed yet. Countless seemed to have lost their minds as they flocked over, trying to find a glimmer of hope to survive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya gathered all the armies of different Forces here according to Gu Changge&#8217;s plan. She couldn&#8217;t help feeling slightly apprehensive as she had a feeling she knew what was going to happen next. If she hadn&#8217;t seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn&#8217;t have believed that the leader of the Upper Realm, also the most powerful person revered by countless young prodigies, was the one who used such a cruel method.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time in a magnificent and tall palace in the central region of Profound Sword World, the Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and the others who were released were also having a discussion with the only remaining experts in this world. In this palace, there was a sword forging site, surrounded by various colourful Sacrificial Stones that exuded misty brilliance. There was a vague path reflected in the dark which seemed to be pointing somewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems that the rest of the Earth Sword Immortals are being imprisoned there. Follow this path and we will be able to find them!&#8221; An Earth Sword Immortal exclaimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal and the rest of the people nodded and breathed a sigh of relief when they heard those words. There was always a way out, after all. They had already made all preparations before deducing that space. And so, after finding the path, the mighty army outside the palace charged in and killed everyone along the way. This was practically the most powerful force that could be assembled in the current Profound Sword World. Everyone was determined to fight with the World’s Will, even if it meant having a duel to the death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I saw Young Master Gu from a distance outside Ancient Arcane Ruins, but I never saw him again. He must have returned to the Upper Realm. We probably won&#8217;t see him again.&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea and Ah Qing were also in the army. She looked at the shattered sky in the distance and couldn&#8217;t help but sigh softly with regret.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three days ago, an Imperial Ancestor of the Southern Light Empire who had lived in seclusion for a long time was also taken away. No one even knew that there was an Imperial Ancestor in the Earth Sword Immortal Realm within the empire before that. Therefore, Southern Light Empire almost mobilised all its forces to rescue their Imperial Ancestor this time. Not even the princess was spared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even though we managed to rescue many Earth Sword Immortals, the situation was too dangerous. That time at Ancient Arcane Ruins might have been the last time we will ever meet.&#8221; Ah Qing had a look of regret on her face as she lamented while shaking her head. She had to hide her emotions to herself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All young women yearned for romance, and she was no exception. It was just that she had never revealed her admiration because she understood that it was impossible for her love to come to fruition. As far as Gu Changge was concerned, his actions back then were nothing more than a simple act of compassion. The two of them were from different worlds. If not for that accident, they would never have come in contact with each other.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Howl!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment ancient horns sounded, everyone felt an upsurge of emotions as their morale was boosted. The army of Profound Sword World assembled and opened up a path according to the deduction. They then followed it to rescue the captured Earth Sword Immortal. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal and the few of them were in front leading the army. This was a terrifying force that shouldn&#8217;t be underestimated. Even the sky was trembling, and the vast army was everywhere, sweeping across everything. There might not be trillions of them, but there were definitely hundreds of millions of soldiers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kill them!&#8221; Coming from a distant place, the endless roar containing an unfathomable murderous aura which seemed to transcend time washed over everything. The mighty army finally came and broke through all the views to see the depth and darkness of this place. A series of densely packed dark cages were suspended in the air and intertwined with World Principles as they trapped all the captured Earth Sword Immortals. Around this space, clusters of dark Goldly Flames were burning. They looked extremely terrifying as they tried to refine the figures in the cages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is this…&#8221; Everyone who came was so shocked and in disbelief they blankly stood still. The Snow Sword Immortal and the others were especially pale. They couldn&#8217;t help shivering when they realised they might have fallen into a trap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re finally here.&#8221; Gu Changge sat on the throne in the dark and deep space, looking at the scene in front of him while a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. And as his voice rang out, there was a dull sound of something cracking from the depths of this space before terrifying chains pierced through everything. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chains that spread out were as thick as mountains. As if it was cast with Purest Immortal Gold, the multi-coloured chains shone a faint immortal glow, and they winded across the world possibly to absorb the World Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, the World’s Will turned frigid and hurriedly cupped his hands. &#8220;Young master, should I make a move as well?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that Gu Changge was starting to extract the World Source by sacrificing this world. All its living beings would be the World Source&#8217;s nourishment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maturing of a World Source was no easy ordeal. Even if he was the World’s Will, who worked hard and found such a chance to break the seal, refine the World Source, and take the final step, he didn&#8217;t want all his hard work to only end up benefiting Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; Gu Changge calmly replied. There wasn&#8217;t a hint of emotion in his eyes. He was only here to obtain the World Source. As for sacrificing this world, it had nothing to do with him. Even karmic hell would only fall on the World&#8217;s Will. By the time Gu Changge had the World Source, wiping out the World&#8217;s Will would only be a trivial matter for him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catastrophe and the reincarnation of heaven and earth were merely following the flow of the universe. After countless years, this world would re-emerge from chaos, and everything would be reborn again. That was what reincarnation was really about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, the World&#8217;s Will turned grim as he looked at everything that oozed despair and destruction. &#8220;In that case, I will begin. I&#8217;ve waited for this day for too long.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then used his Heavenly Dao Authority and created the Great Millstone of World Destruction, causing it to rumble as it heavily fell. Endless black mist spread from here and covered the territory that spanned over tens of thousands of kilometres in an instant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profound Sword World had come to an end at this very moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Millstone of World Destruction was so large that its edges could not be seen. It rumbled all the way down from the sky, slowly pushing away and obliterating all traces and Principles. All living beings were howling as they broke apart and rotted. Everything turned to ruins, and the world was drenched in blood; it was like hell on earth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the hell is this?&#8221; The Upper Realm Army was panicking and in shock. Even the Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts were overwhelmed by this energy. As they began to be submerged in the black mist, they could only let out a pained cry before choosing to blow themselves up to free themselves from the agony.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a horrifying scene of world annihilation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scriptures of sacrifice, which covered all directions, suddenly lit up. Accompanied by streaks of blood soaring to the sky, screams of despair filled the air. Huge groups, who were unable to escape in time, were all turned into energy that seeped into the earth. After the strange sacrificial scriptures were ignited, they turned into lines that spread to all directions of the world. The scene only turned even more shocking when mountains collapsed, the earth split and the sky cracked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, characters that looked as if they were branded with Divine Gold more dazzling than stars flickered in the pitch-black void. This was an ancient sacrificial scripture. In ancient times, Ancestors would recite these words when they offered sacrifices to heaven.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone could hear the sound of chanting in the world. It sounded like it had been through many vicissitudes and eras. There were even colossal and boundless gods and demons sitting cross-legged at the ends of the earth, as they sympathised with all living beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rescuing the Ancestors was just bait to bring us all here! He is taking advantage of the closure between the two worlds to take everyone&#8217;s lives as a sacrifice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the power of the scriptures, he could sacrifice even the most powerful worlds and nourish another world!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How cruel of him to use everyone as nourishment! What exactly does he want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the Upper Realm cultivators on the ancient battleships had a dazed look on their faces that had turned pale from fear. They were in a state of utter shock and desperation. Even the Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts were terrified to the extreme.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You!&#8221; Many experts were furious as they stared at Yu Feiya who had a calm expression. They were filled with anger and hatred from being fooled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m only following orders. I hope you don&#8217;t blame me.&#8221; She stood on the ancient battleship with an extraordinarily unperturbed demeanour while she watched the Great Millstone of World Destruction gradually fall towards this place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took no time for people to suddenly understand her actions. This was simply a trap to get everyone here!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were left to fend for themselves at this point. No one could save them! Not even the Upper Realm could come and rescue them even if they knew what was happening here. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They couldn&#8217;t help turning cold when they realised that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sacrificing of a great world as nourishment had actually happened before during Ancient Epochs. However, only an immortal dictator, who had fallen to the dark side, would do such an outrageous thing because such an act would receive the condemnation of both heaven and earth. The backlash would be even worse, especially in an ancient world like Profound Sword World where the Fortuity was fearsome. Even a True Immortal might find it hard to bear the unimaginable consequences of the karmic hell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one had expected that this expedition to the Lower Realms would turn into a tra, where everyone would end up becoming nourishment.</span></p>

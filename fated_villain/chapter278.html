        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Proofreader: </strong><span style="color: #00ffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color><strong>Silavin
                </strong></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colourful light shone brightly as the space cracked to reveal a terrifying
                crevice. It was obvious how powerful the palm was. </span><span id="more-27918"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in the Heavenly Star Realm, Gu Changge had made use of the Mortal One’s
                opportunity and absorbed the World Purifying Green Lotus. It had recreated every cell in his body to
                seemingly contain the power of an entire world. That meant that right now, 60 trillion cells of his were
                all true ancient worlds, allowing him to possess a power that would terrify anyone that knew about
                it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s palm landed, accompanied by colourful light. It resembled
                the Hand of God as it enclosed Song Fan and his other two friends. In the next moment, a crushing sound
                was heard and blood spilled onto the ground. The smell of blood soon spread. They did not even have the
                time to scream before they died in both body and soul</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They still dared to say such slanderous words before they died. They
                deserved death, especially since the Sky King had pleaded for their lives… they are just not worth it,
                in my opinion. I hope that some people will remember this when they try to approach my sister since
                there is now such a precedent.&#8221; Gu Changge put away his hand and looked meaningfully at the Sky
                King before speaking.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the three young prodigies that had died was an Unranked Disciple. Even
                so, they were like ants compared to him, and crushing them meant nothing. Gu Changge’s voice was not
                loud, as if he was only speaking to the nearby cultivators watching them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area around was extremely mountainous, with tall peaks rising into the
                sky, surrounded by beautiful mist. It looked like the holy place for a divine being. Many young
                prodigies had heard the commotion and rushed to the source, just in time to witness what had transpired.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone watching felt a chill run down their spine at Gu Changge&#8217;s
                words. A terrifying cold wave swept through their limbs and made them fearful. This was Gu Changge’s
                might, extremely dominating even in the Immortal Academy. He had no mercy for his fellow disciples, and
                was decisive when fulfilling his threat of killing them. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They knew that the issue must have been noticed by at least one Elder, yet
                none of them had appeared to stop him. What did that mean? Even the Elders of the Immortal Academy were
                wary of him and did not dare offend him so easily. As for the dead, they would have to rue their luck as
                they had to offend Gu Changge. A suicidal act at this point.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience had seen everything and didn&#8217;t know if the Sky King had
                truly arranged and ordered this. However, the way Gu Changge had refused to give him some courtesy would
                spread amongst the other disciples. The Sky King&#8217;s reputation would be damaged and this might lead
                to future confrontations between the two at the Immortal Academy. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were both Ranked Disciples and the Sky King&#8217;s behaviour was a sign
                of his wariness towards Gu Changge. Sky King Zhi Yang might not be able to maintain his dignity among
                the Ranked Disciples for some time. Even the Chosen Monk Jin Chan had fought head to head with Gu
                Changge before losing.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are too rash. How could you just kill someone here in the
                Academy?&#8221; Gu Xianer had not expected Gu Changge to be so decisive and began to worry for him,
                since this was nowhere else but the Academy. If the powers supporting the disciples or the Elders blame
                him for this, wouldn&#8217;t he be in trouble?</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Quiet. I&#8217;ll deal with you later.&#8221; He glanced at her
                coldly, his tone furious.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I…&#8221; She was angry and felt a little hurt. [I was just being
                concerned about you. What’s wrong with that? Why do you want to deal with me later? Agh. Why am I so
                unlucky?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you very much for your actions in resolving these pathetic scum
                of the Academy, Young Master Changge. Otherwise, I would have to help the Academy get rid of
                them.&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang said, a slight smile on his face as if he didn&#8217;t mind what Gu
                Changge had said to him earlier.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that Gu Changge&#8217;s words had been directed towards him, as the
                latter had already seen through his plot and was warning him to stay away from Gu Xianer. Still, Zhi
                Yang didn&#8217;t care about that, as he knew after seeing a glimpse into the future that he would
                eventually become Gu Changge&#8217;s enemy and oppose him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smiled mildly. &#8220;If that&#8217;s what the Sky King himself
                thinks, then I&#8217;m relieved.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, everything returned to normal.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Zhi Yang was still furious, but he was calculative enough to
                prevent it from showing. He now knew something else about Gu Changge&#8217;s cruelty and aggressiveness.
                Gu Changge&#8217;s refusal to give him courtesy would be spread everywhere, damaging his reputation and
                thus making him more mindful of Gu Changge. He also now knew how trusting Gu Xianer was of Gu Changge,
                showing not a hint of wariness. Thus, he felt deeply worried about the terrible ending in store for
                her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a flash of purple light, he was gone, slipping into the depths of the
                Academy. Bright marble towers and jade buildings rose from the ground, while a Divine Island floated
                into the air above, covered in Chaos Qi.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Elders had personally witnessed the incident and their expressions
                differed. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sky King Zhi Yang might have been number one in the Upper Realm, but
                he&#8217;s also wary of Gu Changge. His actions today seem reasonable and display restraint. This is
                truly representative of the Successor of the Purple Mansion.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyone else would have rushed to attack Gu Changge, risking their
                lives to fight against him.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Speaking of him, Gu Changge&#8217;s so dominant and powerful.
                He&#8217;s ready to defeat all the young prodigies in this lifetime; is there anyone of his generation
                that could stand a chance against him?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Meanwhile, the Chosen Monk Jin Chan had been silent after his defeat.
                His purpose here might really be to find the Unmarred Buddhist Robe, as the rumours
                suggest.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But, no one knows where it really is.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They made no mention of the disciples who had been killed, as they did not
                care about that. The Academy was a place where the law of survival of the fittest prevailed after
                all.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, why were you so stern towards me?&#8221; Gu Xianer looked
                irritatedly at Gu Changge, who was walking silently in front of her. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were at the top of a mountain, where colourful light glimmered amongst
                the mist. She didn&#8217;t understand why he was so angry, since she hadn&#8217;t done anything. She was
                puzzled as to why she was bullied just after coming in as well. Then, the Sky King appeared to help her
                resolve it. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could now see that this was all a plot by him, a staged scene to save the
                damsel in distress. [Was he actually interested in me, or did he just want to plot against Gu Changge
                through me?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, even though Gu Changge had stood up for her, he couldn&#8217;t
                just ignore her and leave her on one side without talking to her as if he was just here to lead her
                inside.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Xianer, are you dumb or are you just acting?&#8221; He finally
                stopped and opened his mouth. His tone was so cold and distant that it stunned her and made her a little
                afraid.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, don&#8217;t think you can just continue to bully me by
                calling me dumb for no reason.&#8221; she retorted bravely.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You must really be dumb then. Where&#8217;s all that wit and
                intelligence you had before?&#8221; He turned his head to look at her. &#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t come
                here today, would you have been grateful towards him? Thanking him for rescuing you?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, what are you talking about? How can that be? Did you think
                I wouldn&#8217;t see through him? That whole farce was arranged by him, although I&#8217;m unsure as to
                what end…&#8221; she immediately argued, feeling that he was underestimating her by assuming she would
                be tricked by such obvious acting.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh? Why did you have mercy on them when you&#8217;ve seen through
                it?&#8221; he asked neutrally. &#8220;This is the Immortal Academy. It is not the place to be merciful
                and kind.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have you, don&#8217;t I?&#8221; she muttered, then immediately
                changed the subject when she saw his expression. &#8220;How did you know I was here? Also, why had the
                Sky King arranged all that? I have never met him before.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was something she could not figure out.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How I know about that is not important. Just remember that he has
                ulterior motives, most possibly to win your heart and then marry into the Immortal Gu Family. Maybe to
                be a live-in son-in-law or something.&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge shook his head, expression finally calm again. He was worried that
                she was too dumb to see through the Sky King&#8217;s little ploy. However, since she had said that, he
                didn&#8217;t want to worry about it any further, though he would have to send someone to look into the
                Sky King. [Trying to be a hero in a play for no reason? Did he just desire her physically or did he have
                some other motive? I can tell that the Sky King is basically like a Fortuitous One. Though, the System
                had not said anything about him…]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmph! Stop talking nonsense, Gu Changge! What live-in son-in-law?
                I&#8217;m not even interested in him! It&#8217;s fine if you don&#8217;t want to answer; I know you were
                angry because of your concern towards me…&#8221; Gu Xianer felt very uncomfortable at how calm and
                neutral his tone was. [What did he mean by saying all that? Did he think that I am the type of person
                who would trust others so easily? Besides, how could I possibly be interested in him? Right now, I only
                feel confusion and disdain towards him. The only thing I’m interested in about him is his goal.]</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Xianer, you think too much about this. He just wants to use you in
                order to reach his goal. I&#8217;ve been thinking about this; he may want to use you in order to fight
                me. Did you really think I attacked them for your sake?&#8221; Gu Changge responded with a dismissive
                laugh.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, you bastard…&#8221; Gu Xianer was surprised at how
                stubborn he still was, and her tone became annoyed. &#8220;When will you change your stubborn, arrogant
                personality?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was definitely worried about her, yet had to make so many excuses for
                himself as if he was scared that other people would realise his true goal. [Why are you so
                frustrating?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see your ego has inflated again since we last met. Do you want to
                get beaten again—&#8221; His demeanour was still calm and undisturbed, but he didn&#8217;t get to finish
                his words as Gu Xianer suddenly approached with sudden bravery. Her expression was enraged as she went
                on her tiptoes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221; Gu Changge felt his mouth being touched briefly, the
                pressure as light as a feather. It was cool, soft, refreshing, and sweet, and he froze at the spot in
                spite of his personality.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This stupid girl…] Gu Changge sighed briefly as he watched her run away,
                blushing, feeling speechless. This was the first time something had surprised him, and her action was
                extremely daring and proactive.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Should I change my attitude towards her? But she might take full advantage
                when I start becoming kind to her…] Thoughts raced through his mind but calmed down again. Quickly, a
                cold expression flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sky King Zhi Yang, how dare you desire something that&#8217;s mine.]</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sh*t! Arghh! Arghh!!! Why did I suddenly become so stupid? What have I
                done?] Gu Xianer, having transformed into a divine rainbow and appeared on another mountain, looked as
                red as a tomato. She felt panicked and anxious about how she was going to face Gu Changge after this.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&#8217;t know what had happened either when she gained the sudden
                courage to do it. She had to be possessed. When she came back to herself, she realised that her mind was
                blank and it was too late.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sigh, that bastard is definitely laughing at me now. It&#8217;s so
                embarrassing that I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to face him from now on.&#8221; She could
                already picture how disgustingly undisturbed after that victory over her. She was angry but had no
                choice now.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fine, I&#8217;ll avoid him for now so he won&#8217;t get his hands on me and
                laugh at me…] She looked conflicted and regretful as she headed to where the Great Elder was. She
                already knew he was here at the Academy and so decided to meet him first.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, the depths of the Immortal Academy were not calm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountains stood everywhere, some entirely dark as night while the others
                shone brightly with red, purple, and green. The place was filled with celestial energy. It was a truly
                strange scene indeed. The celestial energy here was so thick, that it formed a large waterfall. Even the
                ancient trees and mountains had enough strength to reach the sky. It simply looked like an isolated
                paradise.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right at that moment, a Wondrous Stone enclosed in light of various colours
                was shaking. Beams of light flowed down from it continuously. It was more than half the size of a human
                and had patterns of the Great Dao branded all over it as well as carved runes, extremely blinding in its
                brilliance.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great waterfall made of celestial energy had continued for many years,
                and the many rare beasts and auspicious animals lay below silently.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s nearly the time for its birth. We have been waiting too
                long for this!&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes! We have incubated the Wondrous Stone of the Nine Heavens for a
                long time, and it&#8217;s about time for its birth.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a difficult time. We just don&#8217;t know what sort
                of monstrosity would come from this. Will it really be the descendant of the gods?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancient beings, shrouded in Chaos Qi and possessing strong power and
                vitality, were clad in simple robes in an olden style. They stared excitedly at the Stone before them,
                as if looking at an extremely rare celestial treasure.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In such brilliant times, how can our Wondrous Stone not be
                present?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They fixed their gaze on it expectantly, refusing to blink in case they
                missed something.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if sensing their gazes, the stone shot further beams of light out into the
                sky to break the seal above them. The runes on it became alive, flying into the air to hover in the
                void. It gave the atmosphere a poetic feel. It was like the place had become the living place for
                Immortals.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Look, look!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s about to break the seal!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Elders were extremely shocked yet excited. Many figures appeared from
                the mountains outside the area as well, looking over the place. They had all heard about the news of its
                birth and were shocked by it. Its history here with the Academy had started a long time ago, so many of
                them knew the presence of such a stone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since it fell from the Nine Heavens, will it be the descendant of a
                True Immortal?&#8221; The Phoenix Lady, who was tall and had phoenix wings on her back, appeared on a
                mountain peak. Runes flashed within her gaze to form different scenes, and she looked like she was ready
                to pierce the stone with it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; A dignified man in golden armour, driving a
                chariot led by the four heavenly beasts, appeared beside her. Even his gaze was multicoloured, as
                multicoloured Qi flowed within his veins. The energy he exuded was powerful and shocking, like a young
                god.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was Prince Shen of the Sky Emperor Mountain.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Phoenix Lady eyed him and shook her head. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see
                through it. It&#8217;s too mysterious.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The rumours all say that you are the reincarnation of a Celestial
                Phoenix. Is there really something you can&#8217;t see through?&#8221; Prince Shen smiled as he
                asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Phoenix Lady fell silent at his words and chose to ignore him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a loud hum, a golden passage appeared above the sky. A young girl of
                seven or eight, clad in white, came out of it. She looked untarnished and pure, with dark smooth hair
                and mysterious dark eyes like jewels. When the Elders saw her, they immediately became surprised and
                bowed respectfully.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Xing Zu!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that really…&#8221; Many young prodigies looked aghast as they
                recognised her. She looked like a child but was in fact extremely ancient.</span></p>

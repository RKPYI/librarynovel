          Family&#8217;s subservience towards Yin Mei. As such, her will to
          resist, which she garnered so strenuously, consequentially

          she was aware of his terror. She could afford to offend anyone in the
          entire world, but Gu Changge was definitely not one of them.</span

          what it might be, whether he was a match for Gu Changge was simply out
          of the question. In fact, even in this very second, Qin Wuya was
          oblivious to the fact that he was in Gu Changge&#8217;s grasp.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, after a moment of hesitation, she decided to go and warn
          Qin Wuya. All this time, Qin Wuya had been showing his concern for
          her. She was moved by this, but at the same time, she felt guilty.
          After all, Qin Wuya was about to face Gu Changge himself.</span

          death, as long as she refrained from betraying him, he wouldn&#8217;t
          think of her as anything more than a useless pawn.</span

          disheartened, at the end of the day, it was the very family that
          raised her. Therefore, she couldn&#8217;t allow herself to idly watch
          as it fell.</span

          approached from the sky as many formidable cultivators appeared, and

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Old Master Tang and the rest were already awaiting his arrival
          respectfully. Prior to that, they had figured out that Gu Changge was
          the man behind Yin Mei, so they weren&#8217;t exactly stunned to see
          him. In this instant, they were welcoming him with absolute deference
          and awe.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          white jade carriage. Compared to their last encounter, Gu
          Changge&#8217;s cultivation level and aura evidently grew more
          frightening, and &#8216;immeasurable&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t even
          suffice to describe it.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >What was more terrifying was the fact that an aura of invincibility
          was swirling around his body. Although he didn&#8217;t display it on
          purpose, the passersby couldn&#8217;t help but feel nervous. It was as
          though his presence was suffocating them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          to the gushing Celestial Beams and whirling vibrant mists. There was
          even Chaos Energy of unimaginable power subtly surging in his
          palm.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In response, Gu Changge nodded and swept his gaze across the crowd
          before eventually stopping in front of Yin Mei. He then stated,
          &#8220;I was informed about the matter. Since they decided to disobey
          me, have them killed.&#8221;</span

          >To him, the affair between the Tang Family and those under them with
          different surnames was completely miniscule and not worthy of his
          attention. The main purpose of his visit to the Tang Family Manor, it
          was mainly to deal with Qin Wuya, the Fortuitous One.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t at all concerned about the industries
          and connections controlled by those with different surnames, she
          didn&#8217;t question him about it. Given his current position, it was
          only natural that he would refrain from wasting his time on such a
          trivial matter.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, Old Master Tang and the rest of the crowd were stupefied
          with how Gu Changge effortlessly decided the fate of those with
          different surnames. To Gu Changge, it seemed to be as easy as
          squishing a bug to death.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As such, the Tang Family members grew even more dreadful and
          obsequious. Like those with different surnames, their lives were also
          under Gu Changge&#8217;s control.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, even at this point, they couldn&#8217;t fathom how that
          happened. Never had they expected that the mysterious scriptures that
          appeared in the mind of Tang Tian, Tang Wan&#8217;s young brother,
          back when he woke up from unconsciousness, would be so
          problematic.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even now, they still carried the idea that the mysterious scripture
          was of fathomless value, and it could be turned into a family legacy
          that was to be passed on to the future generation. And so, they grew
          to realise how enigmatic and unpredictable Gu Changge&#8217;s methods
          were, given how their fate unknowingly fell into his grasp.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many in the Tang Family suspected that they were either cursed by
          certain Manipulative Secret Techniques or that they were somehow
          poisoned with a pill or insect. Alas, even after an extensive search,
          they couldn&#8217;t find the cause of the problem.</span

          Master Tang led the way and guided Gu Changge to an area filled with
          palaces. The scenery within was tranquil yet stunning, composed of
          drifting celestial fog, spiritual springs, and wafting Celestial
          Energy. Even the bricks used to construct the buildings were special,
          making the palaces appear grand and ancient.</span

          of the Tang Family. Back then, we spent a generous sum to hire an
          ancient cultivator to design and construct the palaces. The style is
          of the Celestial Ancient Era,&#8221; Old Master Tang respectfully
          introduced the palace with a hint of boastfulness on his face.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Tang Wan with inexplicable expressions, as they were not aware of the

          strange as well, given how Tang Wan never disclosed the fact that she

          shivered, harbouring dread as she felt a chill up her spine when Gu
          Changge expressed his plan to have her personally tend to Qin
          Wuya&#8217;s murder.</span

          >Immortal-Burying Water, as its name suggested, was a type of poison
          of unknown origin. Known for its capability of killing an Immortal,
          even one drop of Immortal-Burying Water was absolutely invaluable. No
          ordinary cultivators would dare to touch nor were they worthy of
          touching it.</span

          corrosion. There were rumours claiming that Immortal-Burying Water was
          an item that had been stained by the malice of Immortals. Any
          cultivators who approached it would immediately be inflicted with an
          incurable disease that would liquify their organs. Furthermore,
          Immortal-Burying Water was pretty much extinct in the Upper Realm as
          none ever laid their eyes upon it and they merely heard it from
          rumours. Yet, in this instant, Gu Changge was holding a flask of it in
          his hand. Even a drop of the water in the flask was of unimaginable
          value.</span

          shivering as her hands and feet were freezing. It was as if someone
          recently bashed a pail of cold water on her, instilling immense fear
          within her. As she was forcing herself to calm down, she accepted the
          white jade flask from Gu Changge with her trembling fingers.</span

          a merciful punishment for you,&#8221; Gu Changge noted with a faint
          smile, sounding somewhat remorseful as if he was reluctant to do such
          a thing.</span

          pale as her heart was overflowing with dread. At the same time, she
          felt tremendously regretful and dejected. As she expected, right when
          she came up with the idea to warn Qin Wuya, Gu Changge instantly knew
          about it. Earlier, she even assumed that she would be fortunate enough
          to escape his attention.</span

          his hand to dismiss Tang Wan, as if he had no intentions of troubling
          her any longer.</span

          still shivering as she firmly held the white jade flask. With
          overflowing bitterness and sorrow in her heart, she left the
          palace.</span

          same time, she didn&#8217;t dare to gamble with the fate and lives of
          the members of her family. After all, from the beginning to the end,
          Qin Wuya never stood a chance against Gu Changge as the former&#8217;s
          destiny had already been decided.</span

          you truly intend to have Tang Wan murder Qin Wuya?&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Judging by Gu Changge&#8217;s capabilities, he wouldn&#8217;t have to
          go through so much trouble solely to deal with a person. Yin Mei was
          aware of Qin Wuya&#8217;s identity as well as the grudges he bore
          towards Gu Changge. After all, Qin Wuya shared a deep bond with Sky
          King Zhi Yang and Gu Changge and killed him. Furthermore, Gu Changge
          had caused the demise of Purple Mansion.</span

          murder. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether she manages to poison him.
          After all, Qin Wuya had become a dead man the moment I arrived at the
          Tang Family Manor.&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled indifferently, resting
          his palm on her fox tail, as though he was a cat gently pawing
          it.</span

          Changge did to her, completely charmed by him.</span

          possess a massive amount of Fortuity. Besides, as the Senior who had
          returned from the Nine Realms, he might even be carrying certain
          secrets regarding the Nine Realms.</span

          shattered, the Immortal Palace fell to ruin as Immortals were
          annihilated, the Remnant Immortals headed to Nine Realms and sealed
          the path towards it. They severed their connection to the world. From
          then on, no True Immortals appeared in the Upper Realm ever
          again.</span

          Buddhist Mountain, might bear close connection to the Nine Realms, but
          the epoch of said connection was too far away to be known by anyone.
          As such, cultivators could only read some parts about it in certain
          ancient archives. Therefore, there was even a theory stating that the
          River of Time that existed before the Forbidden Epoch had already
          crumbled.</span

          Nonetheless, due to the existence of the Forbidden Epoch, many had
          grown to be secretive about that epoch, deeming it a taboo. Whenever
          someone mentioned it, fear and anxiety would arise in everyone
          else&#8217;s hearts, hence none dared to mention it. Even those who
          were unaware of the historic incidents could feel the dread coming
          from hearing its name.</span

          single man and woman was quite a questionable one.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Moreover, given that Tang Wan was his Dao Partner in their previous
          lives, Qin Wuya couldn&#8217;t help but think in a naughty way. He was
          certain that Tang Wan noticed his every gesture, and there was no way
          she wouldn&#8217;t be moved by it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I made a table of food. Come to my courtyard.&#8221; With
          brief words, Tang Wan invited him over with a subtle smile. The look
          on her face was not at all suspicious.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Lady Wan, did you perhaps make them yourself?&#8221; Qin Wuya
          was surprised, but it was a pleasant surprise.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Tang Wan smilingly nodded and returned to her courtyard. As they were
          walking, she said, &#8220;Thank you for all you have done for the Tang
          Family recently. I wasn&#8217;t sure how to express my gratitude, so I
          figured that I&#8217;d make you some food as a token of
          gratitude.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In her opinion, Qin Wuya must have had a hand in motivating and
          driving those with different surnames into uniting and
          rebelling.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, earlier, Gu Changge had ordered Yin Mei to drop the
          matter and have them slaughtered for their rebellion. NAturally, Qin
          Wuya had not been informed about that yet.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Thank you, Lady Wan.&#8221; Upon Tang Wan&#8217;s words, Qin
          Wuya was quite touched, thinking that his effort all this time was
          certainly worth it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Anyway, Lady Wan, regarding the matter, I have contacted a
          friend of mine and asked for his assistance to abduct Yin Mei for an
          interrogation to force her to surrender how she managed to control the
          Tang Family.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On their way to Tang Wan&#8217;s courtyard, Qin Wuya suddenly spoke
          about his plans. As he possessed numerous treasures which he obtained
          during his accidental venture in the Nine Realm, it wasn&#8217;t
          difficult for him to recruit some helpers.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You are planning to abduct Yin Mei?&#8221; Tang Wan was dazed
          by Qin Wuya&#8217;s revelation of his plans. Evidently, he was still
          clueless about Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival at the Tang Family
          Manor.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Qin Wuya nodded. With utmost confidence, he
          continued, &#8220;Rest assured, Lady Wan. I have made the most fitting
          arrangements. No one will notice anything strange about it, nor will
          they find any evidence.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Tang Wan refrained from speaking any further. After
          all, tonight, Qin Wuya would be nothing but a dead man, hence putting
          an end to the Tang Family&#8217;s dire situation, and his so-called
          plans would eventually be in vain.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, as the two arrived at Tang Wan&#8217;s courtyard, where
          the stunning moonlight was shed, candles were lit. Atop the stone
          table were dishes of glistening, superb delicacies. Full of flavours,
          the meal was complete with meat and greens, and the dense fragrance of
          the dishes wafted in the air.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As such, all that remained to be done was for Qin Wuya to take his
          seat and dig in.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Lady Wan, you made this all by yourself?&#8221; Qin Wuya asked
          out of astonishment. Though, given Tang Wan&#8217;s tenderness, it
          wasn&#8217;t that surprising that she was capable of making such
          exquisite dishes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon such a sight, Qin Wuya felt a familiar heart-warming
          sensation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have a taste?&#8221; Tang Wan smilingly
          said, telling him to eat up.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Qin Wuya then turned to her and responded with a reciprocal smile.
          &#8220;How about you? Aren&#8217;t you going to indulge in your own
          art?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Tang Wan gently shook her head, answering, &#8220;I tasted them back
          in the Chamber of Sustenance. I&#8217;ll just watch you
          eat.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite saying that, she couldn&#8217;t help but feel nervous as she
          was worried that Qin Wuya might detect anything off about her.
          Nonetheless, Qin Wuya, putting deep trust in her, merely chuckled in
          response. &#8220;In that case, I shall finish all these dishes all by
          myself so as not to fail your kind heart.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Having said that, he began to dig in. In order to make Tang Wan feel
          that he was enjoying himself, he deliberately gorged himself on the
          foods, as if he was afraid that someone else might seize them from
          him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that, Tang Wan subconsciously shook her head and smilingly
          remarked, &#8220;Take your time to eat so you don&#8217;t choke
          yourself. Here&#8217;s some wine as well. Don&#8217;t worry, no one
          else is here to take them away from you.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As she was speaking, she served him a mug full of wine. Right as Qin
          Wuya chugged down the mug of wine, the faint smile on Tang Wan&#8217;s
          face accordingly faded.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;W—What is happening to me?&#8221; In that instant, Qin
          Wuya&#8217;s face dramatically changed out of disbelief.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Crack!* The chopsticks in his hands fell to the ground and broke
          apart.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, he began to throw up mouthfuls of black blood,
          along with bits of his fragmented lungs. An excruciating pain soon
          agonised him. As his face grew colourless, he immediately collapsed
          onto the ground.</span

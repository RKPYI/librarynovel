          signature benign look, &#8220;Oh, that. That was nothing. I was just
          sparing with Qingxuan. She believed she was much stronger than me, but

          you.&#8221; Su Qingge knew exactly where her sister was going with
          this. However, she had no choice but to go along with it. Still, given
          the situation they were currently in, how far-fetched the explanation
          was, and knowing Gu Changge, he would most likely not believe

          each other.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s ambiguous smile deepened after
          hearing the explanation, but he didn&#8217;t ask any more
          questions.</span

          only did he witness the sisters turn against each other, but he even
          discovered Ji Qingxuan and Su Qingge&#8217;s latest trump cards, and
          it left him at somewhat of a loss for how to react. Of course, he had
          no plans to expose the two when Su Qingge was now the true Successor
          of Demonic Arts.</span

          also mean that Su Qingge&#8217;s alias as the Successor of Demonic
          Arts would be exposed, and it wouldn&#8217;t do any good for him. In
          fact, it would bring him a lot of trouble. Hence, what he needed to do
          now was to play dumb.</span

          would just barely believe whatever they had said. The sensation
          weirded them out, for it felt as though Gu Changge had already known
          about the switch but just deliberately kept quiet about it.</span

          sank. There was no one but herself to be blamed for this. She knew
          this was the consequence of her decisions, which she had insisted

          front of Gu Changge, she could only behave like some stranger while
          her sister justifiably enjoyed the coddling that was supposedly
          hers.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          like the changes that happened in Chaos Star Territory and the rare
          treasures she had confiscated. Meanwhile, Su Qingge stood aside like
          an outsider, looking devolved from them.</span

          Forces of the Upper Realm to discuss a plan of attack towards the
          Successor of Demonic Arts with him.

          after escaping my grasp a few times, but who&#8217;d have thought he
          popped up again recently,&#8221; bemoaned Gu Changge as he shook his
          head after taking a sip of his liquor.</span

          sure he&#8217;s no match for you!&#8221; Ji Qingxuan snorted, having
          nothing but admiration for Gu Changge.</span

          casually while shaking his head as though he was talking about
          something insignificant. &#8220;But word has it that he had slipped up
          this time. The Successor of War Immortal Manor survived the fight and
          seemed to also have caught a glimpse of the Successor of Demonic
          Arts&#8217; face.&#8221;</span

          >Of course, he was just bullshitting. How would he know anything that
          went on in War Immortal Manor when the two were not exactly at each
          other&#8217;s throats but weren&#8217;t on any friendly terms either.
          He merely said so to see Su Qingge&#8217;s reaction.</span

          >If she had indeed accidentally revealed her face, then he would have
          to order Bai Lian&#8217;er to do whatever it took to silence the
          Successor of War Immortal Manor. There was no way he would allow such
          an accident to roam freely.</span

          the real Successor of Demonic Arts very quickly, won&#8217;t
          they?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan exclaimed with slight surprise, never
          expecting the Successor of Demonic arts would accidentally reveal his
          face during his assassination attempt. [That means, everyone will soon
          know who the Successor of Demonic Arts is, won&#8217;t they!?]

          Manor, but I never exposed my face at all. How could he have known
          what I look like?] She wondered.

          technique that allows them to replay the scene? But I&#8217;ve been
          extremely careful all this while and even carried a supreme treasure
          that can deceive destiny and fate. So what in the world went wrong?]
          The young woman never doubted Gu Changge&#8217;s words even for a
          second.</span

          of your face. It is indeed on you for failing to kill him. His golden
          cross pupils do have unfathomable and mysterious powers.] The other
          soul residing within her sighed, seemingly somewhat frustrated as

          appearance?]</span

          think it would be this soon. That said, she wasn&#8217;t freaked out.
          Instead, she began devising a plan.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Looks like we can only improvise for now,] answered the soul. [If
          all else fails, seek refuge with the one on Devil Mountain. She will
          take you in.]</span

          >Later, during the middle of the banquet, Gu Changge asked Ji Qingxuan
          with interest as though he had recalled something, &#8220;Have you
          given any more thought to the Ji Family issue I told you
          about?&#8221;</span

          thrill enveloped her face as ill-conceived ambition surged beneath her
          eyes, and she said nearly instantly, &#8220;My sister and I are
          naturally more than happy if you&#8217;re willing to help

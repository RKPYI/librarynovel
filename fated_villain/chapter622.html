        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Proofreader: </strong><span style="color: #00ffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color><strong>Silavin </strong></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long the forest of ancient pagoda trees had existed was unknown. Many of the trees had wilted and their barks cracked apart, as though True Dragons were crawling in the area.</span><span id="more-33867"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From within, a frightening sound erupted, as if thousands of swords were resonating. Blaring and spine-chilling, such a sound could undulate all of time and even cleanse the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin En took merely one step forward, and his divine sense violently trembled, It was almost shattered by the overpowering fluctuations. Blood continuously flowed out of his mouth, as he was heavily injured by the divine will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is this?&#8221; Extremely dazed, he staggered backwards, and only when he regained a steady stance could he reflect upon it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, although he was merely an incarnation and not the real vessel, he was still a competent being of Earth Sword Immortal Realm who stood at the peak of Profound Sword World. Yet, he was unable to withstand the remnant fluctuations of a divine will which had existed over 800,000 years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How terrifying was the strength of the Peerless Sword Immortal in the past? He must have ascended beyond the threshold of Profound Sword World! I cannot even imagine what his strength was like when he was at his peak.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excitement filled Lin En&#8217;s eyes. After taking a deep breath, he then approached the forest once again with an unusually sincere attitude, intending to comprehend the Dao and Qi fluctuations closely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, he saw an Absolute Being sitting amid the strange phenomenon. That being seemed to be surrounded by ceaseless sounds of chanting, as three thousand worlds burned with sword runes while worshipping him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an incredibly sight. Even Lin En, who possessed knowledge of numerous records and ancient texts, was stunned, standing still on the ground as he was unable to calm down his mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The senior from 800,000 years ago had reached the gods with his sword, ascended beyond the stars and descended to the Nine Nethers… I&#8217;ve always thought it was merely a tale. With what I&#8217;ve seen today, the rumours are not lies, they are just hard to be proven as the truth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a hard time containing his excitement, he went back to the spot and sat down. Only by retaining his logical mind and clearing his spirit of external stimulus could he quietly experience the Qi fluctuations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the next moment, he revealed a dismayed expression once again. As if his divine sense was slashed by thousands of Sword Qi. He loudly vomited a mouthful of fresh blood. As the excruciating pain rendered his face pale. He subconsciously took a few steps backwards, feeling greatly concerned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is it resisting me? Is something wrong with what the Peerless Sword Immortal left behind? No, impossible. There is no way what the senior left behind would harm me. Strange. Something is definitely up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspicion and uncertainty flashed across his face, after which he pulled out a tremendously ancient jade tablet from his garment. There were a few clear sword marks on the tablet, and they were subtly resonating with the fluctuations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the same jade tablet the Peerless Sword Immortal had used to record the happenings in Ancient Mulberry City 800,000 years ago, which was also the means of verification left behind by the Peerless Sword Immortal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If the Qi fluctuations in this area is truly left behind by the Peerless Sword Immortal, then this jade tablet will definitely show some reaction. I absorbed the Qi fluctuations within the jade tablet into my body in order to find this place, so why did the Qi fluctuations here attack me?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is there something else other than the Qi fluctuations left behind by him? Did someone come to seize his legacy in this area before me?&#8221; Lin En&#8217;s face grew somewhat dark. He then scanned across the surrounding ancient mulberry trees in an attempt to discover any tracks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, other than the sound of the resonance between swords, a completely incomprehensible and ancient language wafted around the area, and it was that language that damaged his divine sense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wonder what kind of character this Fortuitous One is. His strength is exceptional. He is much stronger than all of those in the younger generation of this world… And he even detected my trap?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge was fascinatedly observing the entire event from the courtyard. He could tell that a formidable cultivator had once cultivated in the ancient mulberry forest. It was clear that the surrounding World Principles in the area had changed before this formidable cultivator’s death, leaving a brand of Qi fluctuations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fortuitous One he was watching tracked down what the cultivator had left behind and arrived at the area, only to trigger the strange phenomenon in the ancient mulberry forest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It is only befitting to say that Fortuitous Ones are treasure-seeking rats. Though, such an opportunity presented before me is no longer significant.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the legacy of that formidable cultivator was certainly profound, Gu Changge was not at all intrigued by it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, his attempt to infiltrate the Fortuitous One&#8217;s conscience with his divine will was seen through by the latter. As such, he was surprised. If someone claimed that the Fortuitous One wasn&#8217;t protected by this World’s Heavenly Dao Will, he would not believe it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nevermind. I&#8217;ll spare his life. Besides, I do want to know where his real vessel is.&#8221; Gu Changge gently shook his head as he withdrew his divine sense. He refrained from peeking any further to prevent startling the Fortuitous One and preventing him from detecting anything odd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, he could sense that the Fortuitous One was protected by Heavenly Dao Will, so it might be possible for him to locate the World Source through him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge managed to wipe out the Qi fluctuations of Sword Dao in the area secretly and successfully prevented Lin En from obtaining the legacy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s gone…&#8221; In the ancient mulberry forest, Lin En was still clueless about Gu Changge withdrawing his divine sense and divine will. He furrowed his brows as he could sense the vast aura in the area had vanished, as if he was under an illusion earlier. However, the injury to his divine sense was by no means imaginary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This place is rather ominous…&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin En continued to circle the ancient mulberry forest, but he was much more cautious than before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, he couldn&#8217;t fathom what made the Qi fluctuations of Sword Dao he triggered disappear into thin air, preventing him from finding it again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reluctant, he continued his search as he conjured a number of sword talismans from the void and sealed up the Qi fluctuations in the area. Alas, even until late night, as he was surrounded by total darkness, and the resonance of swords never sounded again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Impossible! It was right here earlier… Someone must have seized it before me! Whoever who left behind that divine will, they must be insanely powerful.&#8221; Lin En&#8217;s face grew extremely taut at once.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, he was an extraordinary man. He collected his feelings after taking a deep breath. And so, he decided to come again the next day for another search. If his effort was still to no avail, he could only choose to leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ancient Mulberry City was not exactly vast as it was merely a few hundred kilometres wide. Inside the city, various people of different races lived together.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, other than those from City Lord Manor, there were also several other families and clans, though they were only prominent within Ancient Mulberry City, as they were simply nobody in the outside world once they were out of the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wu Family was one of the biggest families in Ancient Mulberry City. At the moment, in the residence of the Wu Family, a group of individuals gathered in the hall, participating in a discussion with solemn faces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very old elder with slightly shut eyes subtly raised his hands to signal the crowd to quiet down. His name was Wu Xing, and he was none other than the Head of the Wu Family whose strength had achieved the Seventh Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you know Lady Ah Qing actually returned from the outside world? The young man who entered the city with her is also from the outside world. We have indeed received news from Southbarren State…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder then opened his eyes, revealing a flash of golden gleam within, as he slowly explained to the crowd in the hall, &#8220;The Old Sword Immortal from Shu Sect has ordered to gather all Sword Immortals of the world in order to take down that young man. It is said that this young man possessed a powerful identity in the outside world. If we manage to take him down, the Old Sword Immortal will be able to control the Otherworldly Sky Demons.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing this, everyone in the hall was stunned. They only knew that Ah Qing had survived a great danger before returning from another world, but they did not know that the young man beside her was from there as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Does this mean Lady Ah Qing has already partnered with the Otherworldly Sky Demons?] They were all in disbelief, given that, judging by the appearance of the young man beside Ah Qing, they wouldn&#8217;t have expected him to be one of the Otherworldly Sky Demons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, they believe that the Otherworldly Sky Demons were a bunch of immensely vicious beings, and it was hard to imagine them being associated with Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Leader, could it be a mistake?&#8221; A family member couldn&#8217;t help but ask, still unable to believe the news.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This cannot be any truer. News has already come from Shu Sect. Various Earth Sword Immortals are heading over, planning to take advantage of the situation. As long as they capture that young man, this calamity caused by the Otherworldly Sky Demons will be solved,&#8221; the head of the Wu family said in a deep voice, his gaze carrying an imposing aura as he scanned everyone present.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But that man&#8217;s strength is unpredictable. His subordinate by his side is even suspected to be at the Ninth Realm, so we cannot act rashly. We simply have to closely monitor their whereabouts before the Earth Sword Immortals arrive at our city.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He spoke with great ambition in his gaze. Although given the Wu Family&#8217;s influence, they would only bring peril upon themselves by getting involved in such a matter, but as he thought of the handsome rewards should the matter succeed, his body slightly shook in irresistible exhilaration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, not only him, but the entire Wu family would get to enjoy unprecedented glory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So what should we do? If he notices us, our entire family will be destroyed. We better not get involved in this matter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An old man carried fear in his gaze. Essentially, a subordinate who is at least of the Ninth Realm could wipe out the entire Ancient Mulberry City with just a single breath, and the Wu family was no different from ants in front of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have already considered the consequences. Besides, we are only keeping an eye on them. When he wishes to leave Ancient Mulberry City, we just only need to inform the Shu Sect and nothing will happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The other families in our city have also been informed of this matter. I believe that they are not morons and will know what to choose. This concerns the entire Profound Sword World. We cannot separate ourselves from this&#8221; The Head of the Wu family waved his big hand, determined not to let go of such a rare opportunity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking advantage of the situation, the entire Wu family would eventually become the saviour of Profound Sword World thanks to the matter, while Wu Xing, as the Head of the family, naturally wouldn&#8217;t let his contributions go unrewarded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Sword Immortal Order? Taking advantage of the situation?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the City Lord Manor, Lin En, donning the look of a steward, touched the jade tablet in his sleeve and feigned a hint of surprise on his handsome face. As the Little Master of the Shu Sect, he had received the news instantly despite being far away from his Sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems that man&#8217;s origin is deeper than what Lady Ah Qing has told us. She must be hiding something from us.] Lin En looked towards the depths of City Lord Manor as his eyes deepened, though he quickly recovered from it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since he was no fool, despite knowing that he could catch his enemy off-guard, he chose to wait and observe. After all, he was merely an incarnation and not his true vessel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, an unexpected visitor appeared outside Ancient Mulberry City. The eyes under her white mask were as clear and glacial as snow, and her hair seemed as though it was enchanted by the chilly breeze, emanating coldness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silavin: Do note that the Heavenly Dao Will is the same as the World’s Will. Not sure why the author changes the term. It’s annoying. But, I kinda like Heavenly Dao Will so, this time, I’ll close one eye. </span></p>

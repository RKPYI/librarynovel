        Chapter 176: A Friendly Force; Exterminating the Entire Clan Without
        Fail!
      </h4>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p>
        The mountain breeze blew as clouds and mist swirled, creating a remote
        and serene atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the gentle wind swayed beneath Gu Xian’er’s skirt, her eyes shone
        with a crystal-clear light, giving her a bright and charming appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If you wish to help me, please suppress his Cultivation Base!
          Suppressing him to the Conferred Lord Realm will be enough!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“I want to defeat Gu Changge fair and square.”</b></p>
      <p>She repeated her words to that old peasant of an ancestor.</p>
      <p>
        As she did so, she had a rather cold and solitary look on her delicate
        face.
      </p>
      <p>From the sides, the Great Elder showed a look of confusion.</p>
      <p>
        Ordinarily, she was a very well-behaved young girl. However, there were
        times when she displayed a hint of Gu Changge’s dark and cheeky nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘She wishes to suppress Gu Changge’s cultivation base to a realm lower
        than hers, and she has the audacity to say that such a match would be
        “fair and square”?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I’m afraid she’s been taking notes from Gu Changge. Where else could
        she have learnt to say such shameless words so naturally?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If Gu Changge were to hear this, she would be in big trouble, for
        sure.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly, if Gu Changge were here right this moment, seeing this same
        scene, he wouldn’t be able to resist the urge to give Gu Xian’er a good
        spanking.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why can’t she just cultivate and improve her realm? Why does she always
        provoke me when there is nothing else to do?” is what he’d probably
        think in this scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the looks of it, it would seem Gu Xian’er was itching for a
        spanking again.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Suppress his cultivation… why not just kill him and take your
          revenge in full?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If that b*****d Gu Changge is threatening you with something, just
          tell your ancestor. Even he wouldn't dare to be rampant in front of
          me.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>When he heard Gu Xian’er speak her request so casually…</p>
      <p>
        Gu Nanshan fell silent for a brief moment before he replied, smacking
        his lips together.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Is Gu Xian’er afraid of him because Gu Changge threatened her during
        her training at the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace?’
      </p>
      <p>‘That must be why. That was why Gu Xian'er said what she said.’</p>
      <p>‘After all… this situation is all too wrong!’</p>
      <p>
        ‘How could such a well-behaved and clever little girl be so frightened
        by Gu Changge?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘What’s more, it seems like she has no desire to take revenge on him for
        digging out her bones.’
      </p>
      <p>‘Did I hear it wrong?’</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Ancestor, you’re overthinking the situation. I presume you weren’t
          properly informed of recent events before coming here, correct?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian’er rolled her eyes a bit when she heard his words.</p>
      <p>In her eyes, this ancestor was becoming more and more unreliable.</p>
      <p>Deep down, even the Great Elder shook his head.</p>
      <p>
        Although this ancestor of the Gu family was quite formidable, he
        wouldn't be able to win against Gu Changge so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, despite the Great Elder’s state of mind, Gu Changge almost
        got him jumping to his feet in anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This old, yellow-toothed peasant of an ancestor would probably have to
        try very hard to resist the urge of slapping Gu Changge to death.’
      </p>
      <p><b>“Oh? Is there something I’m unaware of?”</b> Gu Nanshan asked.</p>
      <p>He was puzzled.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Judging by what I’d seen from Xian’er’s behavior so far, she isn’t
        stupid. So why would she say such a thing?'
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Could it be that those unworthy descendants of the Family are really
        concealing something from me?'
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Ancestor, did you truly not notice anything suspicious regarding
          what happened?”</b
        >
        Gu Xian'er asked, in a rather helpless tone.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Huh?”</b> At this moment, Gu Nashan was dumbfounded.</p>
      <p><b>“Something about it is off…”</b></p>
      <p>The way Gu Xian'er looked so sure of herself made him sceptical.</p>
      <p>
        However, one thing for sure is that it wasn’t the Gu Family’s style to
        dig up bones and hurt others in the same family to such a degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was precisely the reason why he was so furious when he discovered
        these events.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his mind, he began to recall the scenes he’d observed since coming
        out of the ancestral grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from a number of “strange” clan members, the rest were quite
        normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current head of the Gu family, Gu Changge's father, looked quite
        ashamed of the incident, guilty even.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, in Gu Nashan’s fury, he left without asking for further
        details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to Gu Xian’er’s urging, he began to understand the situation a
        bit better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, Gu Changge had a reason for digging out Gu Xian’er’s Dao
        Bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Gu Changge had been acclaimed as a True Immortal, but
        not on the grounds of Gu Xian'er's Dao Bones.
      </p>
      <p>‘So far, Gu Changge’s hidden talent seems to be the Void Talent…’</p>
      <p>
        ‘However, when comparing the power of the Dao Bones and the Void Talent,
        there is simply no reason to dig up the bones.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Nanshan’s eyes narrowed. With Gu Xian’er’s words, he too had begun to
        find the matter suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, how could he – an ancestor – act as if he knew nothing in front
        of Gu Xian’er?
      </p>
      <p>
        He coughed and spoke solemnly,
        <b
          >“I didn't expect you to have noticed it too. Originally, I was unsure
          of how to explain this matter to you, but it seems you’ve figured it
          out on your own…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>That said, he was still very confused regarding this matter.</p>
      <p>
        However, it did not prevent him from maintaining the dignified
        appearance of a wise and respectable ancestor in front of Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>When Gu Xian'er heard his words, she couldn’t help but nod.</p>
      <p>It was exactly as she had thought.</p>
      <p>She didn't doubt Gu Nanshan's words.</p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>“Then why did you say such words just now?”</b> She asked with a
        frown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if no one had told her the truth, she would have investigated it
        herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of that, she had other things to do. She wanted to find her
        parents and grandfather who were missing in some other dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Ahem, I thought you might find this difficult to accept, which is
          why I said as much. I take it that you’ve already understood Gu
          Changge’s good intentions by now, correct?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing her words, Gu Nashan’s face took on a serious expression as
        he cleared his throat once more.
      </p>
      <p>In truth, he had no idea what Gu Changge’s true intentions were.</p>
      <p>
        Though these were merely casual remarks, he believed it was a good idea
        for Gu Changge to resolve the issues he and Gu Xian’er had with one
        another.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't intend to cause a split in the family, much less a fight
        between members of the same family.
      </p>
      <p>By saying this, he had come up with a fine excuse for Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Since Gu Xian'er was fine and didn’t hate Gu Changge as much as he
        expected, it would be best if the problems between the two could be
        resolved.
      </p>
      <p>However, he felt this would be a bit of a disservice to Gu Xian'er.</p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge had good intentions?”</b> Gu Xian'er asked, stunned.</p>
      <p>
        Her expression showed just how complicated her thoughts had now become.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past period of time, she had come to realize that many things
        were simple to understand once she thought about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that Gu Changge’s intention was to make her hate him all along,
        using himself as bait to encourage her. But why would he strengthen her
        to the point of being able to beat, or even kill him?
      </p>
      <p>What was his purpose in sharpening her?</p>
      <p>It couldn't be explained by just guilt anymore.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er felt that she was coming closer and closer to Gu Changge’s
        biggest secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge was here, he would have laughed at the conversation
        between Gu Nanshan and Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>The old ancestor was a friendly force!</p>
      <p>By mistake, his remarks had done a great service for Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge hadn’t even sent him his regards yet, and yet Gu Nashan
        already did him quite the favour.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Yes, Gu Changge had good intentions.</b>“</p>
      <p>
        At that moment, Gu Nanshan couldn't help but reveal a knowing smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the side, the Great Elder was dumbfounded, wondering if he’d
        previously misjudged Gu Changge. ‘Was he truly such a good man?’
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he couldn’t figure out how the word “good man” could have the
        slightest association with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>To have the word “good” be related to him is simply impossible.</p>
      <p>
        ‘On the other hand, Gu Changge’s demonic nature is inherent. Only on
        certain occasions does he behave normally.’
      </p>
      <p>‘It would seem he’s not completely evil…’</p>
      <p>The Great Elder couldn't help but doubt his prior opinions.</p>
      <p>
        Thus, the two of them led Gu Xian’er out of there, as they all turned
        into divine rainbows.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Continent would soon be in chaos. With all the
        Daoist Sects headed there, it would be very dangerous for Gu Xian'er to
        be left alone and unprotected.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no need to continue with the adventure, as it was already
        over.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter what, Gu Xian'er still carried the blood of the Immortal Gu
        Family, and she was also the Direct Disciple of the Great Elder of the
        Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace.
      </p>
      <p>How could they possibly ignore her at such a time?</p>
      <p>———</p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Continent was anything but peaceful during this
        period.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the great lineages and major sects had sent their strongest men
        to suppress the Ancient Immortal Races in order to let their authority
        be known.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, the Ancient Immortal Races were furious, and they hated the
        Tiangou Clan more than anything else for being the culprits behind all
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for the Tiangou Clan crossing the line, how else could such
        a thing have happened?
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, many groups also hated Gu Changge to the core, believing him
        to be the root cause of all this.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their minds, Gu Changge was the embodiment of evil, using all sorts
        of despicable means to exploit their interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he killed Long Teng, the leader of the younger generation of the
        Ancient Immortal Races. Then, he provoked them and turned the outside
        world against them, causing a slaughter.
      </p>
      <p>All the while he reaped the benefits.</p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, he even schemed against the whole of the Ancient
        Immortal Races, leading to the arrival of the outside Daoist Sects to
        settle the score.
      </p>
      <p>The cause and effect of what happened were clear as day.</p>
      <p>These things would not be possible without Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Many creatures were terrified to the core of their being of this
        frightening young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet many of them also hated Gu Changge to the bone, so much so that they
        wanted to cut him into a thousand cubes and tear him to pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, for most of the Ancient Immortal Races’ older generation, they
        knew that this was less so about the agreement than it is their desire.
        The outside world merely wanted an excuse…
      </p>
      <p>
        And it just so happens that Gu Changge was happy to provide such an
        excuse for them.
      </p>
      <p>———</p>
      <p><b>[In the skies above the Ancient Immortal Continent]</b></p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        At the same time, an ancient purple-bronze warship appeared and pressed
        through, like a floating island that cast a ghastly demonic shadow
        below.
      </p>
      <p>A group of the Primordial Demon Sect’s elites had already arrived.</p>
      <p>
        A middle-aged man shrouded in golden armour stood with his hands behind
        his back, his radiance dazzling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Young Master Changge was attacked with the Tiangou Clan’s Sacred
          Artifact.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“How can this enmity be resolved?”</b></p>
      <p>He indifferently asked as he overlooked the city from afar.</p>
      <p>
        The ancient city ahead resembled a giant feathered man crouching on the
        ground, giving off a lofty and majestic look.
      </p>
      <p>From afar, it would appear as though the walls weren’t that tall.</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

        However, it occupied a large area, and there were strong auras emanating
        from the city.
      </p>
      <p>‘It seems the Tiangou Clan’s strongest men have begun to gather.’</p>
      <p>
        Having heard the words of the middle-aged man in golden armour, a
        bloodcurdling voice rang out from one of the similarly styled warships
        behind them.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Until the day we die, we will hunt down their clan!”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“No matter what happens, the whole clan shall be exterminated!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        These mighty voices seemed to drown out the sky with their cries for
        blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it echoed and was heard from below, the mass of nearby outside
        cultivators and natives began to drastically change, terrified.
      </p>
      <p>
        This went especially for the many cultivators of the outside world,
        their very souls trembling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Primordial Demon Sects’ powerful and domineering ways were not
        something that one could hope to face for only a day or two.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now… this same group had come from the outside world, stopping right
        outside the Tiangou Clan's territory.
      </p>
      <p>Their purpose was obvious to everyone!</p>

      <p>
        <b>“After beating the young ones comes a group of the older ones…”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        As they watched the scene, many cultivators turned pale and attempted to
        steer clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if the Tiangou Clan were in a position to negotiate, it would be
        useless in front of the Primordial Demon Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one in the entire Upper Realm would dare mess with Gu Changge and his
        background.
      </p>
      <p>
        One had to be extremely careful not to be overheard, if they said even a
        single unflattering word behind his back.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“We have always been the ones to oppress others; no one has ever
          dared to oppress us!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“The Tiangou Clan shall be punished!”</b></p>
      <p>
        As he said these words, the middle-aged man in golden armor gave a cold
        smile as he kicked a pale, handsome man of the Tiangou Clan – whose
        cultivation had been restricted – beside him.
      </p>
      <p>That man was the current heir of the Tiangou Clan, Yu Xuan.</p>
      <p>
        He was also Yu Jing's childhood friend, and the two had grown up
        together, sharing a close relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Yu Jing’s death at the hands of Gu Changge made him furious and
        resentful.
      </p>
      <p>And unfortunately, he couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
      <p>
        But now, after he’d heard the words of the middle-aged man in the golden
        armour, that pent up rage and frustration exploded.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“How dare you all; do you have any idea who I am? Are you trying to
          start a war with my Tiangou Clan?!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Yu Xuan shouted. Currently, he was humiliated beyond measure.</p>
      <p>
        He had been out on an expedition, seeking an opportunity for a
        breakthrough so that he may take revenge on Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        But on his way back to the clan, the elites of the Primordial Demon Sect
        ambushed him. One of his guardians, a being in the Half-Step Sacred
        Realm, died as soon as the “battle” had begun.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was then suppressed and thrown onto the ancient purple-bronze
        warship, as he was made to forcefully accompany the powerful members of
        the Primordial Demon Sect to the outskirts of his clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“There’s no need to be in such a hurry. The show won’t begin until
          the Young Master arrives.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Soon, the Young Master shall send you to accompany your childhood
          friend, alongside the rest of your clansmen.”</b
        >
        The middle-aged man in golden armour sneered.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“You bastards won’t get away with this!”</b> Yu Xuan shouted, his
        face pale with anger and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged man had already predicted what would happen to the
        Tiangou Clan next.
      </p>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p><b>[Baiheng Mountain Range]</b></p>
      <p>Rich, immortal light filled the area.</p>
      <p>
        If a cultivator were to arrive at this very moment, they would be
        shocked to see the land be converted into an immortal paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aura of the Immortal Dao wafted through both heaven and earth, pure
        and dazzling enough to give people the impression that they themselves
        were about to ascend.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Within the stone chamber]</b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong’s body was pure and radiant, her eyes carrying a profound
        calm and depth, serving only to make her more extraordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, she was busy refining the Immortal Dao runes that flowed from
        within the chamber.
      </p>
      <p>Her physique had undergone large changes.</p>
      <p>
        Prior to the opening of the gate, she’d only obtained minor benefits by
        remaining within close proximity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now that Gu Changge had opened it, the Immortal Dao Runes began to
        fall like rain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was merely guarding it from the outside, she had benefited
        immensely.
      </p>
      <p><b>Rumble!</b></p>
      <p>
        At that moment, in the midst of that stone gate, the rain of light grew
        hazier, denser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the vast and mysterious realm, a turbulent sound rang out,
        resembling the sound of a chaotic thunderstorm crackling and descending
        upon the world.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom! Boom! Boom! </b></p>
      <p>
        When Yue Mingkong took a glance, she saw a figure with a Black Dao
        Bottle atop his head. He was charred black and in a state of distress,
        rushing outside. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
      </p>
      <p>Behind him closely followed a vast sea of thunder.</p>
      <p>
        A sea of thunder covered the area, as all sorts of strange and
        terrifying creatures began to emerge, striking out multi-colored
        thunderbolts with the raise of their hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        These thunderbolts held might as great and frightening as the mountains,
        even mixed with a hint of divine power!
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had just broken through to the Sacred Realm. To say she was
        shocked is an understatement.
      </p>
      <p>‘Is this his true cultivation base?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Let alone his peers, even the older generation has few who could stand
        to be his opponent…’

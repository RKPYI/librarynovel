      <h4>
        Chapter 249-1: The way to save Gu Changge, I would rather die on that
        day (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the Peach Tree swayed, and the sky was filled with radiance.
        Like flowers blooming they covered the sky and the earth, accompanied by
        the sound of the Dao.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone at the entrance of the Peach Village was shocked.</p>
      <p>Even a few old guys with an ancient origin look confused.</p>
      <p>They all heard what Taoyao said just now, so they were shocked.</p>
      <p>She took the initiative to speak to a young man.</p>
      <p>Before that, they had never seen Taoyao with such an attitude.</p>
      <p>"What's so strange about this guy Gu Changge?"</p>
      <p>"What‚Äôs with Master Taoyao?"</p>
      <p>
        "It seems that our prejudice against Gu Changge is a bit deep. Even Lord
        Taoyao is like this, which means that there should be no problem with
        him‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        A few old guys said, who were still a little doubtful about what Gu
        Xian'er explained just now and couldn‚Äôt believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, they couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief and relax.
      </p>
      <p>They were still very convinced of Taoyao's vision.</p>
      <p>
        Even if she complimented Gu Changge, then it would be fine, it meant
        that there was nothing wrong with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few people thought about it carefully, and even had a lot of goodwill
        towards Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, judging from Gu Xian'er's words, Gu Changge did a lot for her
        secretly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not surprising that Gu Xian'er would have such an attitude
        towards Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, their gazes toward Gu Changge softened a lot.</p>
      <p>
        And soon, a vast white mist rose around, turning more intense, obscuring
        everything in front of the entrance of Peach Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        The petals were crystal clear, splendid, and bright, accompanied by the
        fragrance, and it looked like a fairyland.
      </p>
      <p>
        One after another, the divine chains of law and order were hanging down
        as if it was composed of Dao of light, mysterious and vast.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, except for Gu Changge, everyone including Gu Xian'er couldn't
        see what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>Not even the sound of it was heard.</p>
      <p>"Sister Taoyao, what happened today?"</p>
      <p>"Why would do this to Gu Changge, who you met for the first time?"</p>
      <p>
        Looking at this scene, Gu Xian'er frowned slightly and was a little
        puzzled.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, although Yaoyao had some connection with Sister Taoyao,
        but it had nothing to do with Gu Changge, why was she talking to Gu
        Changge like this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Did there exist some difficulty between Gu Changge and Master Taoyao? To
        make Sister Taoyao feel good about Gu Changge?
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of Gu Xian'er's familiarity with Sister Taoyao, she knew if it
        was not a very familiar person, she would not have such an attitude.
      </p>
      <p>Not to mention that today was the first time she saw Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>What exactly was the hidden secret?</p>
      <p>
        Or did Sister Taoyao also notice Gu Changge's innate demonic nature, so
        she started to investigate?
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, many thoughts flashed through Gu Xian'er's mind, and she was
        looking forward to it, hoping that Sister Taoyao could find a way to
        help Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she could really get rid of the innate demonic nature, that would be
        even better.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge's eyes were filled with a strange color,
        looking at the graceful figure emerging from the Peach Tree, and all
        kinds of thoughts flashed in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        He felt a wave of probing, like chains and order, but didn‚Äôt resist.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        That was a supreme power, which is different from the laws and order,
        and involved the origin of the Dao.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beings at different levels possessed powers that were simply impossible
        to resist.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge felt that the Great Dao treasure bottle in the
        depths of his spiritual sea seemed to be disturbed by this power, and
        made a slight trembling sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        This exploratory force would soon disappear into nothingness, and it
        wouldn‚Äôt have any effect on him.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p>His heart went silent for a long time.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, with the beating of his heart, a trace of demonic energy
        permeated again.
      </p>
      <p>"It turned out to be the demonic heart."</p>
      <p>"How come‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"So‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how it is."</p>
      <p>
        The figure in the Peach Tree made a very surprising sound, trembled a
        little, and was stunned. Then it turned silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her gaze that looked at Gu Changge was also withdrawn gently as if there
        was no turbulent aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's expression was calm, his eyes still looking at the Peach
        Tree in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The existence of the demonic heart was naturally exposed by him on
        purpose. Now that he had firmly held the position of the young master of
        the Gu family, no one could shake it. In addition, his identity as the
        true heir of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace had no influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, he was not worried that the existence of the demonic heart
        would cause him any trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the congenital demon heart was just talent, not a forbidden
        demonic art, it wouldn‚Äôt lead to a situation where the whole world would
        become his enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        At most, it would make people feel that he was ominous and they would
        avoid him like a snake. LùíÇaTest novùíÜls on (n)ùíêvelbi/ùíè(.)coùíé
      </p>
      <p>"Have you seen it, senior?"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge spoke with a calm expression, asking knowingly.
      </p>
      <p>"I saw."</p>
      <p>
        Taoyao's figure was very vague, and through the vast divine light, he
        could faintly see her magnificent and unparalleled appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she heard these words, she replied with a very natural expression,
        which could be regarded as an explanation, "Xian'er is half my
        apprentice after all, so I naturally have to pay attention to her
        affairs."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm afraid that she will be deceived by you since she is young and
        ignorant. What? I discovered your secret of the demonic heart. Are you
        unhappy?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Her voice was very soft and sweet, making people think that she would
        never be angry.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There's nothing to be unhappy about, Senior possesses great ability,
        and the juniors admire her a lot."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge said with a very calm face, but there was a
        disdainful sneer in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for his intention then how could the demonic energy leak
        from the demonic heart? What could Taoyao find in front of him?
      </p>
      <p>
        She underestimated his ability so much that she thought that she would
        be able to find out if she just checked it out,
      </p>
      <p>
        Was it true that the Great Dao treasure bottle could only swallow the
        source? However, on the surface, he still had to look like he dared not
        speak.
      </p>
      <p>"That‚Äôs not true."</p>
      <p>
        But when she heard Gu Changge's words, Taoyao suddenly burst into
        laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her voice was still soft like the sounds of nature, but it had a more
        demonic nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the villagers of Peach Village heard this, they would widen their
        eyes and be dumbfounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was this still the senior Taoyao they had always been familiar with?
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, it was as solemn as a god, revealing an aloof and awe-inspiring
        divine majesty.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        How could she appear so demonic? But this was indeed Taoyao's true
        temperament.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of Yaoyao, she could feel every bit of how she and Gu Changge
        got along during this time and knew that although Gu Changge seemed
        unreliable.
      </p>
      <p>But as a Master, he was still quite responsible.</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Taoyao still had a good impression of Gu Changge, otherwise,
        she would not talk to him like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, she already found out what she wanted to know just now. What Gu
        Xian'er said just now was not just aimless.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was indeed a problem with Gu Changge. Those with a congenital
        demon heart were born with ominous fates and those who possessed a demon
        heart since ancient times would not end well.
      </p>
      <p>The existence of the demonic heart was very rare.</p>
      <p>Since time immemorial, only a few people had appeared.</p>
      <p>
        With such talent, the weak were buried in the flood of history, washed
        away by the rolling river of time, and didn‚Äôt even make a single
        fluctuation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strong people only left a name, so future generations knew of their
        tragic life.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a demonic heart, even if their name was the world's greatest young
        taboo, since the ancient times there were only a few words left behind,
        and there was no good end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was born with this talent, she could only say that he was
        unlucky except for the initial shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise she didn't know what to say. However, since Gu Changge was
        able to suppress his demonic nature, it meant that his own willpower was
        still very strong.
      </p>
      <p>This point made Taoyao have a little appreciation.</p>
      <p>"Why is Senior laughing?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this laughter, Gu Changge's expression flashed with a strange
        color, and then he asked with a self-effacing expression.
      </p>
      <p>Was it called Taoyao, or Peach Demon?</p>
      <p>
        This kind of demonic nature was a bit surprising to him. But on the
        other hand, still, as he guessed, Peach Demon had no malice for Yaoyao
        or himself.
      </p>
      <p>Now it was even fusing her body with various Dao laws.</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Yaoyao herself was in a deep sleep. For her to wake
        up, Gu Changge estimated that it would take quite a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        What he had done before was not useless, judging from the way Taoyao was
        treating him, it had played a big role.
      </p>
      <p>
        "After so many years, apart from Xian'er, I met another interesting
        person and just found it funny."
      </p>
      <p>Taoyao's voice gradually calmed down and she replied.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge gave an unimpressed oh, then looked at the young lady who was
        being surrounded by countless immortal spirit and dao rhymes and in a
        coma state, and opened his mouth to ask, "What does Senior intend to do
        to young lady?"
      </p>
      <p>Although he knew that Taoyao would not harm Yaoyao.</p>
      <p>
        But at this time, as her Master, one must definitely show some worry and
        vigilance.
      </p>
      <p>Taoyao was not much surprised by Gu Changge's question.</p>
      <p>
        She replied, "To help her wash away some of the Great Dao injuries."
      </p>
      <p>
        "So she will sleep for a while. But you can rest assured that I won't
        hurt her."
      </p>
      <p>"To me, her existence is like a relative or a sister."</p>
      <p>"I hope so."</p>
      <p>At these words, Gu Changge nodded his head noncommittally.</p>
      <p>"Surprisingly, you still don't believe me?"</p>
      <p>
        When Taoyao saw his appearance, she could not help but laugh again, "I
        will return Yoyao to you unharmed, but if you dare to bully her, I will
        not spare you."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was not impressed and said, "Bullying the weak, the later
        generation will not be able to do it."
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, you are sarcastic?"</p>
      <p>Taoyao's voice became intriguing and demonic.</p>
      <p>"Since Senior can hear it, that's good."</p>
      <p>Hearing this question, Gu Changge finally gave her a serious look.</p>
      <p>
        "Interesting. It's been a long time since I've met someone who isn't
        afraid of me like you. If this had happened earlier, the days wouldn't
        have been so boring and dull‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 249-2: The way to save Gu Changge, I would rather die on that
        day (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Taoyao was stunned for a moment. And then, she couldn't help but laugh,
        not caring about Gu Changge's sneer. She suddenly let out a sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this moment, a figure emerged before Gu Changge's eyes in a
        trance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was not a person, but a goblin. It hugged her knees and sat in the
        endless wilderness, with a dead Peach Tree behind her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was born very beautiful. The long hair was like a bright mirror that
        could reflect all the light.
      </p>
      <p>
        She looked far away from the sea of clouds, her pupils reflecting the
        clear sky and mountains, but her expression was lonely, as if she was
        waiting for someone.
      </p>
      <p>"Is it a memory? Or is it a sight she deliberately let me see?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge slightly froze at this time, unable to distinguish whether
        this scene was what he himself saw, or whether Taoyao had deliberately
        let him see it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, what he could be sure of was that the existence of Taoyao was
        essentially different from the mysterious Peach Tree that he had seen on
        the screen prompted by the system.
      </p>
      <p>Taoyao and Yaoyao. It was more like sisters.</p>
      <p>
        The only way to become that Peach Tree floating in the sea of chaotic
        true lightning was for the two of them to fuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at that time, would the two of them still remain their previous
        self?
      </p>
      <p>
        This question, perhaps the Peach Tree was already very clear about this,
        so she had that kind of kin-like emotions towards Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, Gu Changge did not need to consider the subsequent things.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The matter of innate demonic nature, I can't help you now, but take
        this thing and go find an old guy, he once owed me a favor, if he's not
        dead, he might be able to help you."
      </p>
      <p>And at this time, Taoyao spoke again.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, a crystal and radiant peach leaf fell from the air,
        with the dao runes coalescing on it, looking extremely divine.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It is also a gift of thanks for you taking care of Yaoyao for so long."
      </p>
      <p>
        And as soon as these words were said, her figure gradually disappeared
        from the Peach Tree.
      </p>
      <p>And then even the traces were no longer visible.</p>
      <p>
        As if everything was just an illusion. Even the white fog also
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>All of the scenes around the Peach Village gradually became clear.</p>
      <p>
        The only person sleeping peacefully under the Peach Tree was Yaoyao, the
        wisps of Dao rhyme and immortal energy was fusing in her, and no one
        disturbed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge received this peach leaf, his eyes could not help but narrow.
      </p>
      <p>Taoyao's words let him know a lot of information. An old man?</p>
      <p>It seems to be a character who shared an era with Taoyao.</p>
      <p>
        The only thing was that his demonic nature had long been resolved and
        could be controlled at any time, so it was actually the same whether he
        looked for someone or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the value of this peach leaf was far beyond his imagination, it was
        equivalent to a favor from an old guy who shared an era with Taoyao.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Gu Changge couldn't help but smile a little.</p>
      <p>All the purposes of this trip had almost been completed.</p>
      <p>
        The attitude of Taoyao and the old guys in Peach Village towards him
        determined how much Luck Gu Changge could get from Gu Xian'er.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, the feud of digging bones could almost finally come to an
        end.
      </p>
      <p>"What did Sister Taoyao tell you?"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, seeing Gu Changge's expression, she seemed a little dazed,
        and Gu Xian'er couldn't help being a little curious.
      </p>

      <p>"Nothing."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at her, took the peach leaf, and didn't say much.
      </p>
      <p>"It's fine if you don't tell me, I'll ask Sister Taoyao myself."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er snorted and knew that Gu Changge would not easily tell her.
        Soon, she ran to the Peach Tree and asked secretly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Taoyao did not continue to show up, after hearing Gu Xian'er
        asking these questions, she still told her everything.
      </p>
      <p>Without hiding anything.</p>
      <p>"Gu Changge was born with this‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Hearing this, Gu Xian'er suddenly widened her beautiful eyes.</p>
      <p>
        She was extremely surprised. When Taoyao mentioned that Gu Changge had
        an innate demon heart, she couldn't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>She had been looking for this all the time.</p>
      <p>
        But she never imagined that it would be a congenital demon heart. Since
        ancient times, only a few people were born with such a demon heart,
        which represented ominous and bad luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        No wonder Gu Changge's lineage would try their best to conceal these
        things. If they let the rest of the clan know, was it worth it?
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, Gu Changge's identity was still the young master of the
        Gu family, representing the future of the Gu family.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she had already thought of the various troubles caused
        by Gu Changge's innate demonic heart being known to the clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if Gu Changge now possessed terrifying power, it would be very
        difficult to face these troubles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er suddenly felt a little regret and guilt, why was she so
        reckless, and she planned to bring Gu Changge to Peach Village, which
        exposed the secret of his innate demonic heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the masters of Peach Village and Sister Taoyao should not take
        the initiative to expose this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Gu Xian'er couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sister Taoyao, is there any way to solve the problem of the demonic
        heart?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Xian'er remembered the most important thing. Taoyao was
        a little stunned when she heard this.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, she really had no choice right now, otherwise she wouldn't
        give the peach leaf to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the demonic heart was at the position of the cultivator's heart,
        not a simple part. Even though a cultivator could be reborn from a drop
        of blood after reaching a certain level.
      </p>
      <p>But that was the case where the blood essence had not dried up.</p>
      <p>
        In a situation like Gu Changge's, the demonic nature was deeply
        ingrained, and even if it was removed, it would have no effect.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing that Taoyao was silent.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was a little anxious. She knew Taoyao's character very well.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sister Taoyao, you know what to do, right? It's fine, even if it's
        difficult, I'm willing to try."
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge has done a lot for me, and I want to help him too."</p>
      <p>"Xian'er, you insist on such words‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Taoyao was also a little confused at this time, seeing Gu Xian'er's
        persistent expression, she couldn't help sighing, and said slowly, "Gu
        Changge has a congenital demon heart and needs to suppress his demonic
        nature to stay awake, just like he dug your Dao bone before. Like the
        matter of your Dao bone, although he was dominated by demon, it was
        actually what he did subconsciously‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"So, the Dao bone can help him suppress it, right?"</p>
      <p>
        When Taoyao said this, Gu Xian'er also understood because she had
        thought about it before.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was because Gu Changge returned the Dao bone to her that he could not
        suppress his demonic nature in the nirvana pool that day.
      </p>
      <p>She knew that Gu Changge must also understand this.</p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        But he still insisted on returning her Dao bone to her to repay her.
      </p>
      <p>And completely disregarded the dire situation that would follow.</p>
      <p>Taoyao said, "That is part of the reason."</p>
      <p>
        "Is it useful to give him the Dao bone now and let him fuse again?" Gu
        Xian'er asked.
      </p>
      <p>Taoyao was silent for a while, and then said,</p>
      <p>
        "Such chances are very few. The existence of demonic nature is not
        fixable and immutable. Even at this moment, it is growing."
      </p>
      <p>"Xian'er, you can think about it, are you sure?"</p>
      <p>After hearing this, Gu Xian'er already knew what to do.</p>
      <p>
        No wonder Sister Taoyao wanted to tell her these words, now it was up to
        her to choose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, she suddenly looked at Gu Changge not far away, and
        her expression was a little angry. But there was more tenderness in her
        eyes, and she couldn't help shouting,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, you are obviously such a smart person, why were you so
        stupid at that time?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was discussing some things with the Village Chief of Peach
        Village and others. After suddenly hearing Gu Xian'er's words.
      </p>
      <p>
        He turned around inexplicably and looked at her, "Are you feeling Itchy
        again? Isn't the lesson from the past few days not enough?"
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, Gu Changge noticed Gu Xian'er's expression and movements, and
        cursed this idiot in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a hum, spatial fluctuations spread. His figure disappeared out of
        thin air and appeared in front of her instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then she grabbed Gu Xian'er's two wrists tightly and stopped her from
        moving. This girl actually took out a divine weapon and planned to dig
        her Dao bone by herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge never intended to ask for her Dao bone from beginning to end.
      </p>
      <p>
        His face suddenly became very indifferent, like a piece of ice for ten
        thousand years, showing a cold atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Xian'er, what are you doing, you idiot?"</p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, let me go, you are an idiot, I am obviously trying to save
        you."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er glared at him, but she couldn't beat Gu Changge's strength
        and couldn't break free.
      </p>
      <p>
        "As long as I dig the Dao bone for you, It can suppress your demonic
        nature, and things like the Nirvana Pool last time will not happen in
        the future."
      </p>
      <p>
        "For me, Dao bone may be able to be born again, and it will be alright‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Shut up."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, Gu Changge looked gloomy and ugly, and quickly
        covered her mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Listen, you have to keep the Dao bone for me. When I want it in the
        future, I will come to you to get it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you dare to make up your own mind, dig it out, Gu Xian'er, I'll let
        you know what it means to be dead."
      </p>
      <p>"Woooooooo‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Xian'er was not reconciled at all, and was still
        staring at him like a kitten with fried fur.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that Gu Changge tightly covered her mouth and she couldn't
        make any sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was so angry that her lungs would explode. In the end, Gu Changge
        didn't appreciate it at all, and he still looked so terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>"I'm not going to ask you to save me with your Dao bone."</p>
      <p>At this time, seeing Gu Xian'er's expression, Gu Changge sighed.</p>
      <p>His tone gradually softened.</p>
      <p>
        "Why are you so ignorant?" ùëÖread latest chùíÇpters at n/ùíêv(e)lbiùíè(.)co/m
      </p>
      <p>
        "If that day comes, I'd rather die than let you get hurt like this."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Xian'er's eyes suddenly widened. Then her head went
        blank with a buzz.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone was stunned.</p>

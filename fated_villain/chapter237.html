      <h4>
        Chapter 237-1: The unparalleled Demon revives, I have been waiting for
        you for a long time, Human Ancestor (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        This terrifying scene shocked not only Yue Mingkong, but also Jiang
        Yang.
      </p>
      <p>"What is this?"</p>
      <p>"What the hell is hidden in the Netherland Heavenly Pond‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>At this time, Yue Mingkong's face became very solemn.</p>
      <p>
        She was a person from the Upper Realm. As the future Empress of the
        Peerless Immortal Dynasty, she would rule the territory of hundreds of
        millions of miles in the future. The identity of her fianc√© was even
        more precious.
      </p>
      <p>But at this time, she still felt palpitations, tremors, and chills.</p>
      <p>
        This definitely shouldn't be something that would appear in the Lower
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in the Upper Realm, it was an existence that would make countless
        ancient Dao sects tremble.
      </p>
      <p>But in it, she felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity.</p>
      <p>
        "How is it possible, when did Netherland Heavenly Pond give birth to
        this kind of thing‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression also changed drastically, and he couldn't
        believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could there be such an existence where he arranged so many tricks.
        That kind of aura was maddening, chilling, trembling, even making the
        soul freeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was even beyond his cognition as someone who had reincarnated so
        many times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression was extremely gloomy. Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at
        nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the entire Heavenly Pond had changed from the Immortal aura just now
        to a demonic aura, making people unable to see the scene in it.
      </p>
      <p>He was a little worried about his Nirvana green lotus.</p>
      <p><i>Was there an accident?</i></p>
      <p><i>And what the hell is that?</i></p>
      <p>
        He saw that in the monstrous gray fog, covering the sky and the sun, it
        was surging, as if there was an incomparably ancient, invisible, and
        indescribable terrifying true demon reviving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone broke into his territory, woke up from eternal sleep, opened his
        mouth and swallowed, and the whole world had turned into darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, not only Netherland Heavenly Pond, but even in the
        farther territory of Heavenly Domain, there were scenes that terrified
        and horrified countless cultivators and creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless powerful existences were terrified under this aura, they got
        goosebumps, and even their souls were frozen.
      </p>
      <p>In the distant sky, all demons revived and swallowed the sky.</p>
      <p>The world turned black in an instant!</p>
      <p>The light was gone, the sun and the moon lost their light!</p>
      <p>It's as if the world was going to an end.</p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that the Immortal fell into the hands of this unknown
        creature‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Zhao Yi's voice trembled, and her soul trembled to the extreme.</p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        As an existence in the Quasi-Supreme Realm, she was once the goddess of
        heaven, but now she was like an ant, with fear emerging from the soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with the weapon given by Jiang Yang in hand, it was difficult for
        her to feel the slightest sense of security.
      </p>
      <p>"Attack!"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, a headless horseman rushed out from the cliff with the
        bloody light, he suddenly attacked Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>"Follow my lord's orders!"</p>
      <p>
        In the deep valley on the other side, a bloody figure swept in, as if a
        sea of ??corpses and blood rushed towards Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>"Aren't these the two creatures I suppressed back then?"</p>
      <p>"Why are they out of my control?"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this scene, Jiang Yang's expression changed drastically again.
      </p>
      <p>As soon as they appeared, it was shocking and unbelievable.</p>
      <p>
        He was too familiar with these two creatures. Before he arranged them,
        they were caught and suppressed by him, and they all had the strength of
        the Great Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>In the entire Heavenly Star Realm, it was an unmatched power.</p>
      <p>But now, they wanted to kill him?</p>
      <p>Obviously, many of the surrounding patterns were under his control?</p>
      <p>This made Jiang Yang's head a little stunned, what happened?</p>
      <p>
        But he had been through all kinds of major events for a long time, and
        he responded quickly, greeting Zhao Yi to block the changing Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        That little cauldron, no matter how bad it was, it was a Great Sacred
        weapon. It should not be a problem to compete with the current Yaoyao a
        little bit, motivated by her power in the Quasi-Supreme Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><b>Boom!</b></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        And he himself, wrapped in the stream of laws and rules here, activated
        the Immortal Lun Seal, floated on the top of his head and went to the
        depths of Heavenly Pond to find out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two Great Sacred Realm creatures attacked, and the terrain here sent
        off a huge earthquake. There were many strands of avenues, radiating
        light, to drown everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang borrowed these methods to resist the attack of the two great
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        But some time ago, he just shattered the Reincarnation Seal and killed
        all the enemies in the Immortal Lun Sect. If he used the Reincarnation
        Seal now, it was very likely that one Reincarnation Seal would be
        shattered directly, and all of his hard work would be wasted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Jiang Yang could only endure, and did not dare to act rashly.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side, the war between Yaoyao and Zhao Yi broke out.
        Although Yaoyao's state was strange at this moment, her power had not
        surpassed that of the Great Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi mobilized the Great Sacred weapon, which was still tolerable in
        a short period of time, but her complexion was also extremely pale, and
        she couldn't last for long.
      </p>
      <p>"The Netherland Heavenly Pond has changed, so don't go in yet."</p>
      <p>"We'll talk about it when the situation becomes clear."</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong appeared high in the sky, the mist around her filled the
        air, her breath was full of powerful aura, and the radiance was bright.
      </p>
      <p>A powerful forbidden weapon was floating between her sleeves.</p>
      <p>
        She instructed the confidants and the Golden Armored warriors behind
        her, waving her hands to let them retreat.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        And the sudden appearance of the monstrous gray fog made her heart
        palpitate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially the pair of eyes that were so indifferent that they did not
        contain the slightest emotion, as if they regarded all living beings as
        ants, which could be easily erased.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong frowned.</p>
      <p>
        She didn't know if it was her own illusion. She felt that the unknowable
        existence seemed to be warning her not to approach it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made her even more confused, coupled with the lingering familiarity
        just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        This obviously did not look like an indescribable god of human beings.
        Could it be an existence she was familiar with?
      </p>
      <p>
        But for a while, Yue Mingkong didn't know if she was thinking too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><b>Boom!</b></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, the gray fog covering the sky became more turbulent, and
        the aura in it seemed to engulf the entire sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        A big hand suddenly descended from it, and it looked like it was
        shrouded in a vast gray fog, like a world-annihilating millstone,
        intertwined with the laws of the Great Dao, and fell down easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi, who was fighting against Yaoyao, changed abruptly, and before
        she could react, the palm covered her, like a piece of heaven and earth
        turned upside down!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><b>Boom!</b></strong>
      </p>
      <p>The void burst!</p>
      <p>
        The Great Sacred weapon she sacrificed that suddenly attacked, clear
        cracks appeared on it, and the runes were dim.
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Yang, save me‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Her expression was horrified, full of despair and pale.</p>
      <p>
        <strong><b>Puff!!</b></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, she was directly covered and smashed down by this
        palm, and before she could touch her, her body exploded instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang, who was rushing to the depths, frowned, showing
        dissatisfaction, but thinking of something.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a wave of his sleeves, a cloud of clear light emerged, instantly
        wrapping Zhao Yi's remnant soul and saving her.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, if Zhao Yi died here, he would inevitably be distracted
        and exhausted. After all, she was a Quasi-Supreme Realm cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        And after smashing Zhao Yi's body, the big hand had not stopped, it was
        still looking towards Yaoyao below, as if to grab him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's current state was very strange, her expression was icy, like an
        aloof goddess.
      </p>
      <p>
        She could feel her presence, but she couldn't fully control the power.
      </p>
      <p>
        And her temperament, affected by this power, became extremely
        indifferent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if this palm fell, his expression did not change, and she even
        planned to fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with a bang, her small body was sent flying into the Heavenly
        Pond, and fell into it with a thud.
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        The silver haired granny was incomparably worried and wanted to go
        forward to save her, but was incomparably afraid of the terrifying deity
        in the sky and did not dare to move.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 237-2: The unparalleled Demon revives, I have been waiting for
        you for a long time, Human Ancestor (2)
      </h4>
      <p>But to her surprise, the terrifying deity did not care about her.</p>
      <p>
        This made the silver haired granny breathe a sigh of relief, and could
        not help but smile bitterly. Being treated as an existence that was even
        inferior to ants she did not know whether to be grateful or what.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, the Netherland Heavenly Pond once again returned to dead
        silence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the gray fog still shrouded in the high sky, there was no
        longer any presence, but the terrifying aura of this place was spreading
        towards the entire Heavenly Domain.
      </p>
      <p>A more terrifying power seemed to be born in the deepest depths.</p>
      <p>This made Yue Mingkong's expression even more gloomy.</p>
      <p>
        She led the people to appear at the outermost part of the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond, not daring to approach at will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, she felt that there had been a pair of cold eyes in the gray
        fog, staring at her, as if warning her not to make any rash moves.
      </p>
      <p>"What's happening?"</p>
      <p>
        "What's going on? Why is the heaven and earth shattering and the
        entrance has disappeared!"
      </p>
      <p>
        And at that moment, the sudden change in the Netherland Heavenly Pond
        caused all the cultivators outside to be stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless people's faces turned white, and they noticed it from afar,
        and they could not sense the slightest breath of life.
      </p>
      <p>This made them incomparably frightened.</p>
      <p>The gray fog was so huge that it obscured everything.</p>
      <p>
        The sky and earth were cracking and collapsing as it then peeled down.
        Fire rushed to the sky, melting everything, like a meteorite sweeping
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole sky was like a mirror in pieces, the wind blew, the four sides
        were dark and there was nothingness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them was a sea of nothingness, boiling with chaotic turbulence,
        rumored to be living in its many ancient ferocious beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even a cultivator at the Quasi-Supreme Realm must also be careful when
        crossing, there were terrifying laws to suppress, and they would die
        miserably.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene that happened at the Netherland Heavenly Pond shocked many of
        the most powerful cultivators from all sides of the Heavenly Domain.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone's eyes were wide open, and they were horrified.</p>
      <p>
        The heavens and earth ruptured, all kinds of laws filled the air, and
        the divine light of laws seemed like a blazing flame, scorching
        everything.
      </p>
      <p>"Is there some kind of heavenly demon born in it?"</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Many powerful beings, with white faces, looked away from there, feeling
        that this day was a catastrophe for the whole Heavenly Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        if ordinary cultivators got into contact with the wind that blew from
        there, they would probably die instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, if there were all kinds of disasters from outside the
        realm, then the whole Heavenly Star Realm would have to suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of these, countless cultivators and living beings began to
        despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this time, in the deepest part of the Netherland Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with a thick chaotic mist, a Green Lotus that entwined with
        Chaotic aura took root there, dropping down a thick worldly aura.

      <p>
        Jiang Yang, who had sacrificed the Immortal Lun Seal and resisted
        everything with its Supreme divine might, had finally arrived here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The figure hidden in the monstrous gray mist high in the sky did not
        strike at him, which made him slightly relieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although he was a little puzzled at this time, he could no longer care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only by fusing the Nirvana Green Lotus and borrowing the power of the
        Dao fruit would he be able to resist that bizarre existence.
      </p>
      <p>What happened today was really beyond his imagination.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang even felt a great confidence that at that time if Gu Changge
        dared to come towards the Netherland Heavenly Pond, there would only be
        a dead end, but he did not expect that he would meet such a bizarre
        existence here.
      </p>
      <p>He couldn't see his real body.</p>
      <p>
        It was even a bit like a Dao law body, but that kind of vast divine
        might was definitely the general Dao body that could not be compared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang suspected that it was an Ancient God or a True Demon that
        slept here when he didn't know.
      </p>
      <p>
        But all in all, as long as this Nirvana Green Lotus was still there,
        everything was okay.
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Yang, what do we do now?"</p>
      <p>
        When one reached the Quasr-Supreme Realm, as long as the true spirit was
        complete, it was no problem to be reborn with a drop of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi was saved by Jiang Yang at the critical moment, and now that she
        had reshaped her body and appeared beside him, she couldn't help but
        worry and ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Help me to protect the law, no matter what it costs, block this place,
        no one is allowed to come here."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression became very heavy, permeated with cold hard
        majesty, not to be questioned.

      <p>This was also the main purpose for which he saved Zhao Yi.</p>
      <p>Once someone broke in, things would probably be lost.</p>
      <p>
        Although Jiang Yang was confident in his own arrangement back then and
        there were layers of array patterns guarding the outside, but now, he
        was also worried about problems.
      </p>
      <p>Since the anomaly had appeared‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Zhao Yi's expression also gripped up and said,
        "Understood."
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this time, Jiang Yang frowned and thought carefully before
        deciding to give her the Immortal Lun Seal, telling her how to activate
        it and awaken the artifact spirit in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        With her Quasi-Supreme Realm strength, she could barely push it a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The special thing about the Immortal Lun Seal was that the artifact
        spirit in it was not born on its own, but was refined with the True Soul
        of the living spirit when it was first refined.
      </p>
      <p>This was also one of Jiang Yang's considerations for his trick.</p>
      <p>
        With the Immortal Lun Seal in hand, Zhao Yi would feel a little more
        secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, Jiang Yang looked calm again, walking towards the Lotus body
        of the Nirvana Green Lotus, layers of Chaotic mist surging down, all
        scenes were incomparably blurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fusion process seemed to him to be incomparably easy, he just had to
        spend a little more time.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as the Nirvana Green Lotus Body was fully fused and a trace of
        the power of all the worlds returning to one erupted, he would be able
        to have great strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mysterious woman who had been chasing him outside could also be
        easily suppressed and killed.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, just at the moment when Jiang Yang's figure stepped into it.
      </p>
      <p>"What‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        His eyes widened abruptly, his face changed drastically, his entire
        scalp was almost lifted off, and he was cold from head to tail.
      </p>
      <p>His soul started trembling.</p>
      <p>"How is this possible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's words trembled for the first time, unlike before, he
        couldn‚Äôt remain calm, as if everything was under his control.
      </p>
      <p>
        He simply could not believe that the figure that had already fallen
        would appear here.
      </p>
      <p>
        And looking at his appearance, he seemed to have been waiting for him?
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Jiang Yang's whole head buzzed, like being blasted by a
        bell, emitting a sound that was hard to set.
      </p>
      <p>
        He opened his mouth with difficulty, and his voice was hardly calm,
        "You‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ How come you are here?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was sitting above the Nirvana Green Lotus, his figure was
        covered by a layer of blurred fog, the monstrous demonic aura,
        constantly penetrating and intertwining, filling every inch of the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked at Jiang Yang, with a gaze raked with interest, "Why can't I
        be here?"
      </p>
      <p>"I've been waiting for you for a long time, Human Ancestor."</p>

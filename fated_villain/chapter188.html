      <h4>
        Chapter 188: Yue Mingkongs Plan for the Ancestor; Erasing Gu Changges
        Hidden Trouble!
      </h4>
      <p>
        The origin of the All-Devouring Sky has always been a mystery to the
        Upper Realm. No one knows how it was born, nor do they know its true
        location.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the creatures that emerge from the All-Devouring Sky carried a
        terrifying gluttonous Qi.
      </p>
      <p>
        This strange and terrifying Qi corrodes the cultivator's soul and
        spiritual sea regardless of their power.
      </p>
      <p>
        It stuck to both the Cultivation Base and Primordial Spirit of a person,
        making it extremely difficult to get rid of, like a maggot attached to a
        bone.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as Yue Mingkong knew, the All-Devouring Sky of her previous life
        had swallowed many Lower Realms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scale of it was simply terrifying, causing the entire Upper Realm to
        fall in chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was precisely because of this that the Daoist Sects and factions were
        disturbed. They sent their best of best, their supremes, forming a True
        Immortal Library, exhausting each of their own resources to cultivate a
        True Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, there were no True Immortals in the Upper Realm.</p>
      <p>
        If there was, it would be an ancestor from the ancient families, someone
        who has been slumbered for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong had actually heard of the Human Ancestor from Gu Changge in
        the previous life.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was said to be travelling across Samsara. Some people say that he is
        a predecessor who descended from the heavens, while some say he was one
        of the very first cultivators of the human race.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group of cultivators, who were said to be the pioneers of the human
        race and achieved feats that had lasted throughout the ages.
      </p>
      <p>The Human Ancestor was the most prestigious one among them.</p>
      <p>
        Each time the All-Devouring Sky appears, he would cease to travel the
        Samsara, and would reincarnate ‚Äì turning the tide and stopping chaos in
        its tracks.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was also that one time when the Human Ancestor slew a Demonic Arts
        Inheritor who overwhelmed nearly half of the Upper Realm!
      </p>
      <p>He had prevented countless disasters.</p>
      <p>
        Such a great accomplishment deserved the praise of future generations
        for hundreds of millions of years!
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the countless years, the Human Ancestor has become a godlike
        existence in the upper realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Ancient Freaks of the Great Immortal and Supreme Daoist Sects
        would be in awe at the mere mention of his name!
      </p>
      <p>
        The younger generation knew very little about this, some didn‚Äôt know at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        But once the Human Ancestor‚Äôs reincarnation awakens, his terrifying
        cultivation speeds will be sure to send his peers down a desperate
        spiral.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his unattainable speed, he would reach the highest peak in record
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Young Supremes from the various races and sects, no matter how
        dazzling, will be lacklustre in front of the Human Ancestor‚Äôs
        reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        His tyrannical reincarnation was by no means comparable to the geniuses
        of the same era. In each era, this fact remained unquestioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people speculate that the Human Ancestor cultivates using a special
        method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering his ties to Samsara, his travels across the world, his
        unmatched comprehension, and his heavenly might‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of it all, the Human Ancestor grew detached and became an
        unspeakable existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Daoist lineage he had left behind, the Human Ancestral Hall, has
        become one of the most secluded forces in the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their cultivators were few in numbers, but whenever one of them
        appeared, they caused a great sensation in the outside world. They were
        treated as an honoured guest, with none daring to show even a hint of
        disrespect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, the transcendent status of theirs did not mean their heritage
        was greater than those of Immortal Families and Great Immortal Sects.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in the eyes of a cultivator from the Upper Realms, the Human
        Ancestral Hall was no different from a shrine. Every once in a while,
        people would come by to pay their respects.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòAccording to the memory of my previous life, the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor in this life should come from that side of the Lower
        Realm.‚Äù‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong's eyes grew deeper.</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòOnce his reincarnation is awakened, it is bound to display the same
        level of strength that he had before.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòAt that time, Gu Changge's identity as the Forbidden Demonic Arts‚Äô
        Inheritor will undoubtedly be exposed.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        What happened in this life had exceeded her expectations in many
        respects, and many things even happened ahead of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even she didn‚Äôt know when the Human Ancestor‚Äôs reincarnation would
        appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, one thing was certain, he had the means to detect the Forbidden
        Demonic Arts‚Äô Inheritor, something that had already happened in her
        previous life.
      </p>
      <p>However, Gu Changge was too powerful by then.</p>
      <p>
        Going by the previous timeline, it was likely that the Human Ancestor
        will be reborn early. Currently, Gu Changge‚Äôs powers were still in their
        infancy, a far cry from the terror they were in the previous life.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Zain: If the current Gu Changge is still in its infancy, just how
        powerful was he in the last timeline? *Kshn: Spoilers!!! He was the
        Demon King!*]
      </p>
      <p>
        In the face of the Human Ancestor, Gu Changge will be at a great
        disadvantage. There was also a possibility that the entire world might
        turn against him.
      </p>
      <p>This would prove to be a hidden crisis for Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúThe Human Ancestor‚Ä¶‚Äù</b> Yue Mingkong whispered softly, her eyes
        containing a shockingly cold and murderous intent.
      </p>
      <p>Various thoughts flashed in her mind.</p>
      <p>
        She recalled his various characteristics, trying to determine where he
        would show up. ALL new ùíÑhapters ùíên nùíêv(ùíÜ)lbin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if he was a figure worshipped by countless cultivators, even if he
        wielded an unimaginable heritage, so long as he stood against Gu
        Changge, he was her enemy!
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it was in the past or the present, she wouldn‚Äôt allow others to
        hurt Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        [TL/N: Didn‚Äôt you bait Long Teng into fighting against Gu Changge, which
        then led to the entire Ancient Immortal Continent turning on him???]

        Even if she wanted revenge before, she wanted it to be done by her own
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòAfter a brief period of time, the Ancestral Hall‚Äôs descendants will
        come out of seclusion in search of the Human Ancestor‚Äôs reincarnation.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong made a decision in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        The descendants of the Ancestral Hall were a complete mystery. Even in
        her previous life, not one of them had shown their faces. In fact, no
        one could even tell their genders.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the one thing that the mysterious Ancestral Hall was famous for
        is their inheritance, the Dao Fruit!
      </p>
      <p>[Kshn: I‚Äôm fed up with these Dao thingies.]</p>
      <p>[PR: Shut up and do your work. ]</p>
      <p>
        In other words, the descendants of the Ancestral Hall can borrow the
        lives of their predecessors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it was in this manner that the descendants of Ancestral Hall are
        tasked with assisting the Human Ancestor‚Äôs reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        [TL/N: Basically, they transfer power‚Ä¶ ancestor power ‚Üí descendant power
        ‚Üí Human Ancestor‚Äôs reincarnation‚Äôs power (that is a mouthful)]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Kshn: Doesn‚Äôt that mean the Human Ancestor is the same as Changge?
        Sucking out others' power after cultivating them?]
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòThe Human Ancestor is said to have a Pure Lotus Nirvana Body; devoid of
        any worldly pollution, which seems to be transformed by the Pure Wordly
        Lotus. Thus, this generation's Human Ancestor must first go against the
        heavens to reshape his bones and tendons. This means that the Pure
        Worldly Lotus should be very important to him.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòAs long as I snatch the Pure Worldly Lotus, his return should be
        greatly delayed.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        Several thoughts flashed in Yue Mingkong‚Äôs mind, carefully making her
        plans. Last time, she suffered a tremendous loss at Ye Ling‚Äôs hands,
        which led to his escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was more cautious now. Though her identity as a regressor meant she
        had the foresight, it didn‚Äôt necessarily mean that she could plan and
        control everything.
      </p>
      <p>After all, she was not Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòBefore Gu Changge came into contact with the Human Ancestor, he took
        the opportunity to grow stronger. I can only help him by steering him in
        that direction‚Ä¶‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong's phoenix-like eyes displayed an eerie calm as these
        thoughts came and went.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was confident, she wasn‚Äôt blinded by it to think that her
        ability was sufficient to resolve this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it were not for how the Human Ancestor was destined to stand against
        Gu Changge, she would‚Äôve never taken the initiative to provoke him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was an ancient monster who dwelled in the Samsara. Whether he had
        more methods than Gu Changge or less was unclear. It made her shudder
        just by thinking about it. At most, all she can do was plot against him
        and ensure he doesn‚Äôt fully awaken.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the killing the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor? From her
        point of view, it was a hopeless endeavour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, Yue Mingkong didn‚Äôt intend on telling this to Gu Changge.
        Otherwise, she runs the risk of increasing the likelihood of Gu Changge
        meeting up with the Human Ancestor. This can be regarded as another
        layer of protection for Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúMy subjects, heed my order. From this day forward, the Supreme
          Immortal Dynasty will be forming the Supreme Guards. Any and all
          strong cultivators across the four seas and eight directions may come
          to test their mettle... .‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Following Yue Mingkong's command, her jade-like hand picked up a flowing
        brush, as she began to write an Imperial Verdict.
      </p>
      <p>
        With her current identity and status, along with the power of the
        Supreme Immortal Dynasty, news of this Verdict would undoubtedly attract
        countless creatures and cultivators once it spreads through the realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Supreme Guards; this was the secret weapon of destruction that Gu
        Changge had her built in her previous life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, it could also be called the First Immortal Dynasty's greatest
        and most destructive weapon. Wherever it went, blood would splatter and
        heads would roll, and there was no land it could not conquer.
      </p>
      <p>No one dared to face its might!</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong still remembered the secret technique Gu Changge taught her
        in her previous life.
      </p>
      <p>How to train and control the Supreme Guards.</p>
      <p>
        This hidden method was simply terrifying, and its effects were magnified
        by creating an army such as this.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this technique, the army can effectively share the damage between
        each member. And in critical moments, even share their vitality with one
        another.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, Yue Mingkong simply found it unbelievable. She believed
        that Gu Changge was omnipotent‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòBut now that I think about it, this
        secret method is obviously pure evil.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>The Great Art of Heavenly Creation.</p>
      <p>
        Using soldiers as the source of heavenly creation, it could indeed form
        an invincible legion, with indomitable divine powers that were
        unparalleled in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if this kind of forbidden art is overused, it may cause great
        and irreversible damage to both the body and soul, slowly turning
        soldiers into mindless puppets who can only kill and slaughter.
      </p>
      <p>And that‚Äôs precisely what Gu Changge wanted.</p>
      <p>
        He intends to establish the world's first True Immortal dynasty. On the
        surface, the True Immortal dynasty of the previous life seemed to have
        been controlled by Yue Mingkong.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality, Gu Changge was the true emperor behind the scenes, plotting
        and scheming her ascension to the throne. He had total control over the
        situation and never once faltered in his actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòIn this life, I will establish the Supreme Guard first. Then, I shall
        reform the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, turning it into the First Immortal
        Dynasty.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòAbove the Heavens and Earth, only I will reign Supreme!‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, divine light appeared in Yue Mingkong's eyes, her
        perfect and fairy-like face radiating with imperial majesty.
      </p>
      <p>While Yue Mingkong was making her plans‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî</p>
      <p><b>[Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace, Supreme Peak]</b></p>
      <p>Light surged as an endless sea of runes poured.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge sat cross-legged next to a sealed jade jar containing wisps
        of Fairy Spirit that dripped with an extremely magnificent glow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Between his mouth and nose, he exhaled a chain of Laws and Rules, like a
        tiny river of stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was currently devouring, refining these wisps to improve his
        own strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, his apparent cultivation level using the
        Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex has reached the late stage level of the
        False God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Demonic Cultivation Base, however, had already reached the late
        stage of the Sacred Realm, rapidly approaching its peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past few days, he went out on a hunt, using his Forbidden Demonic
        Arts, he devoured many Young Supremes with special physiques.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei had provided him with plenty of resources; however, his progress
        was still slow.
      </p>
      <p>Fortunately, Gu Changge wasn‚Äôt in a hurry.</p>
      <p>
        Relatively speaking, his cultivation speed wasn‚Äôt slow at all. Many of
        the older generation had to enter seclusion for tens if not hundreds of
        years before they reached the Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hum! </b></p>
      <p>
        Above his head, the Black Dao Bottle levitated. Rainbow-coloured
        immortal light and Chaotic Qi gushed, falling onto his body.
      </p>
      <p>
        As still as a mountain, he sat like an ancient god who radiated majesty
        and overwhelming power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was using a secret incantation unique to the Immortal
        Devouring Demonic Arts to refine quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòGu Nanshan really ran to the Sea King Palace to settle the bill. After
        hitting a wall in my cultivation so many times, I should find a chance
        to vent my anger as well.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòThe Sea King Palace matter can be regarded as a warning to the rest of
        the races.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge opened his eyes and a different colour flashed past
        them.
      </p>
      <p>Everything was proceeding in the direction he wished.</p>
      <p>Neither Gu Xian'er nor Gu Nanshan disappointed him.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Nanshan's temperament was precisely what he displayed. It was simply
        impossible for him to bear with the blatant provocation of the Sea King
        Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòIn terms of cultivation speed, Gu Xian'er's ancestors were among the
        top in the entire Gu family. Even if Gu Nanshan isn‚Äôt the best, he isn‚Äôt
        weak either.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, Gu Changge had sent a follower of his to the Gu Family to
        inquire about Gu Nanshan and learn about his many experiences.
      </p>
      <p>Only by doing this could he make better use of this powerhouse.</p>
      <p>
        If he succeeds, he need only wait in the shadows to pick up the
        benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Gu Family has plenty of ancestor figures, but that
        didn‚Äôt mean they woke up often.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Nashan‚Äôs decision to leave seclusion so that he could go out and
        relax is uncommon.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Gu Changge‚Äôs point of view, Gu Nashan was very strong, and the
        Ancient Immortal Gu Family was at its peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        They wouldn‚Äôt suffer to the point of losing in a fight against the Sea
        King Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt that even his father, who stood at the top of the Upper
        Realm, would have difficulty defeating an ancestor such as Gu Nanshan.
      </p>
      <p>[Zain: Daddy of Daddy Changge, heh.]</p>
      <p>The disparity in cultivation time was simply too big.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's announcement, where he exposed the past‚Äôs secrets to the
        people of the world, would definitely have an effect on Gu Nashan and
        the other family members‚Äô opinions of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Gu Nashan stood up for Gu Xian‚Äôer, the Ancient Immortal Gu Family‚Äôs
        stance became clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Gu Family remains immortal, overlooking the life
        and death of the Upper Realm. Any Daoist force that dared to offend them
        would disappear and their heritages would be extinguished.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tyrannical horror of the Ancient Immortal Gu family was clear to
        see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, in Gu Changge's view, the Sea King Palace was nothing more
        than EXP for Gu Xian'er, not to mention the several terrifying masters
        standing behind her.
      </p>
      <p>
        So even if Gu Changge didn‚Äôt stand up for her, Gu Xian'er would‚Äôve been
        fine.
      </p>
      <p>He just took advantage of it.</p>
      <p>
        Naturally, Gu Changge can‚Äôt go too far. That girl was a little silly,
        but she was still his little sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        [TL/N: Remember that though they refer to each other as brother and
        sister, they are cousins.]
      </p>
      <p>[Zain: So it should be fine for them to bang, right?]</p>
      <p>
        Pushing her around was enough, but if other people dare to do so, then
        Gu Changge will be sure to exterminate their entire clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, teasing Gu Xian‚Äôer was the few pleasures he could enjoy in
        life.
      </p>
      <p>[TL/N: Might I recommend touching grass?]</p>
      <p>[Zain: Readers should take this recommendation :kekw:]</p>
      <p>[PR/N: This Pair of Idiots are very annoying.]</p>
      <p>What‚Äôs the point of having a little sister, if not for teasing?</p>
      <p>
        Not only that, but Gu Xian‚Äôer had always brought him a bountiful harvest
        of Destiny Points and Fortune Value. Estimating how much she has left
        would be difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace has been dealt with, Gu
        Changge was considering whether he should set off for the Gu Family with
        Gu Xian‚Äôer in tow, drawing out the bigwigs behind her.
      </p>
      <p>
        If used properly, that'll be another terrifying boost to his powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mysterious masters of the Peach Village and the Peach Tree itself.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was really looking forward to meeting them.</p>

      <h4>
        Chapter 150: Not Prepared To Be An Unsung Hero; Mind If I Join Too?
      </h4>
      <p>
        In the depths of the Ancient Immortal Continent, amidst a vast, endless,
        and pristine range towered a group of majestic mountains that stood
        overlooked the rest. These mountains were enveloped in an endless mist
        and surrounded by an immortal brilliance whose divine light rose to the
        skies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Powerful waves of Qi and blood were visible in the sky, causing the
        mountains to rumble and shake like an earthquake.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a bleak scene, and many people of the clan could not help but
        wail in anguish.
      </p>
      <p>“The Young Master of the True Dragon Clan has been killed!”</p>
      <p>“And none were even able to retrieve the corpse!”</p>
      <p>
        A group of draconic creatures knelt before an Ancient Palace, their
        faces white pale and bloodless, as their very souls seemed to tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was an event so terrifying that it shook the entirety of the True
        Dragon Clan.
      </p>
      <p>Long Teng was the only hope of their generation.</p>
      <p>
        A number of the clan elders even thought that Long Teng possessed the
        True Dragon’s Talent and would be able to rule the heavens in the
        future, sweeping away everything and becoming invincible across the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>But now, Long Teng has been killed!</p>
      <p>
        The entire True Dragon Clan was outraged, and many still were shocked,
        unable to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could a man as powerful as Long Teng be killed by one of his peers?
      </p>
      <p>And yet, this was the truth of the matter.</p>
      <p>
        It would have been fine if the person who killed Long Teng had been of a
        more ordinary status, but the opponent was the Young Master of an
        outside Ancient Immortal Family as well as the Heir of the Heavenly Dao
        Immortal Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        With such status, the True Dragon Clan had no way of dealing with him.
      </p>
      <p>If they really dared cross that bottom line…</p>
      <p>
        They would not only be up against one or two Daoist sects, but also many
        other forces from the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>The entire Ancient Immortal Continent would be turned upside down!</p>
      <p>
        “We must endure this incident no matter what! Our clan has no complaints
        about being defeated by someone of their own generation!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the palace, a terrifying old man with dragon horns wore a face
        full of grief as he spoke with a tyrannical voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        “However, now that Long Teng is dead, we must retrieve his corpse. This
        is already the biggest compromise we can make!”
      </p>
      <p>
        If the body could not be retrieved after death in battle, it would be a
        disgrace for a clan such as the True Dragon Clan who proclaimed
        themselves royalty.
      </p>
      <p>It would also be difficult for Long Teng’s spirit to rest in peace.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the blood of a True Dragon in Long Teng’s body was something
        they cannot afford to lose since it was something that they could use to
        develop another heir!
      </p>
      <p>
        “Third Elder, what if the Young Master of the Gu Family does not agree?”
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle of the palace, someone couldn’t help but ask, worried that
        Gu Changge wouldn’t return Long Teng’s corpse.
      </p>
      <p>“He will return it, and if he doesn’t…”</p>
      <p>
        “In that case, I will use the Dragon Emperor’s decree to unite the rest
        of the races and carry out a great purge of the younger generation from
        the outside world!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The grief on the Third Elder’s face had disappeared as he spoke coldly.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn’t believe Gu Changge would be able to withstand such oppression
        by then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the Dragon Emperor’s Decree was issued, the entirety of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent’s hereditary clans would have to obey their orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid crossing that bottom line, all the Young Creatures in the
        Ancient Immortal Continent would have to unite.
      </p>
      <p>
        That way, even if they angered the outside world, they would have no
        reason to take action.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the two sides had agreed beforehand that the older generation
        would not be allowed to intervene!
      </p>
      <p>
        From his point of view, no matter Gu Changge’s strength, even he would
        have to back off when confronted with the combined might of the Ancient
        Immortal Races.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, to return Long Teng’s corpse was not an unreasonable request.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>At the same time…</p>
      <p>
        In the midst of the vast mountains and ruins, a stream of light pierced
        through heaven and earth, sweeping into the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators and creatures who saw this scene turned pale and
        retreated in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        They dreaded coming across this group, for the young man at its head was
        someone that they were all quite familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was the one who killed the rising star of the Ancient Immortal Clans,
        Long Teng.
      </p>
      <p>
        This event caused an uproar in the Ancient Immortal Continent, stirring
        up the clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, there are few Young Creatures or even Young Supreme
        today who would not turn pale at the sight of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>“He is a true Young Asura, his strength is boundless.”</p>
      <p>“In the future, if you see him, avoid him at all cost.”</p>
      <p>
        On a mountain peak, a Young Supreme was solemnly teaching this lesson to
        his junior brothers and sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So what brother? He killed a young man from the Ancient Immortal Clan
        and shocked many creatures, and yet we are to avoid him?”
      </p>
      <p>
        A rather naive and innocent young girl looked at the distant figure of
        the immortal-like young man as she could not help but blush slightly in
        amazement.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Don’t think he’s a good guy just because he looks handsome, you should
        know that many Young Supremes have died in his hands!”
      </p>
      <p>The senior brother spoke with hatred towards him.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge’s followers could be seen rushing to places
        where the divine light rose to the sky all over the Ancient Immortal
        Continent.
      </p>
      <p>However, he did not appear in person.</p>
      <p>
        When his followers appeared alone, none dared to seize them, stopping in
        their tracks.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was one person who could not accept such an injustice, trying to
        seize a Divine Artifact anyway, only to be blown to bits on the spot.
      </p>
      <p>The incident sent a chill down the backs of many Young Supremes.</p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Immortal Continent was full of opportunities, but if Gu
        Changge happened to come across them, they would have no choice but to
        retreat.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, they could only pray that Gu Changge wouldn’t bump into them
        whenever they came across something good.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, with his strength, Gu Changge can do just about whatever he
        wants nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting aside the Young Supremes for a moment, even the opportunities of
        the disciples of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace were snatched by him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such blatant robbery made many Young Supremes too afraid to even speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now, Gu Changge was busy hunting someone, not knowing that he had
        already been targeted by the True Dragon Clan deep in the Ancient
        Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        But of course, even if he did know, he wouldn’t care. In fact, he
        would’ve even laughed a little at such a timely coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>After all, he was also after the Ancient Immortal Races.</p>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, among them, the True Dragon Clan was his main
        target.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge knew very well that the future emergence of the Fairy Spirit
        would come as a complete surprise to the older generation, spreading to
        many forces outside of the Daoist Sects.
      </p>
      <p>By then, it would all come crashing down.</p>
      <p>
        Naturally, the Ancient Immortal Races would not be spared, and with the
        True Dragon Clan having the most profound heritage…
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The figure in the shadows had been spying on me since the beginning,
        having chased me for many days, yet it has not shown itself even once.’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge slightly narrowed his brows.</p>
      <p>
        The only witness to the incident where he handed over Long Teng’s corpse
        to Yue Mingkong was this person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Long Teng had the blood of a True Dragon within his body, his
        corpse would be a hidden danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge wondered if the rest of the True Dragon Clan members knew
        about it[1].
      </p>
      <p>
        [1. Quick recap: True Dragon Clan isn’t made up of True Dragons, they’re
        just a far-flung bloodline who use the name because it sounds cool.]
      </p>
      <p>
        If they knew, then they would definitely find a way to retrieve Long
        Teng’s corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, a drop of True Dragon blood was equivalent to the blood of an
        Ancestor. Such a thing was precious and bears quite the significance to
        the Ancient Immortal Clans, who valued their bloodlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, there was a high likelihood that he would become the target of
        the True Dragon Clan for quite a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the True Dragon Clan believes that he has Long Teng’s corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Little did they know that he had already handed over the corpse to Yue
        Mingkong.
      </p>
      <p>And the only witness was the man he was chasing today.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge already had plans set in motion, so it was only natural he
        would not allow its reveal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, he had killed Long Teng, so if the True Dragon Clan knew that
        he didn’t have Long Teng’s corpse, they would simply go after Yue
        Mingkong and implicate her in this matter.
      </p>
      <p>So what did this mean? Did he screw over Yue Mingkong?</p>
      <p>This thought never even crossed his mind.</p>
      <p>
        Although Yue Mingkong had occasionally cheated and plotted against him
        in secret, Yue Mingkong did love him deeply.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge wasn’t heartless and could naturally feel it.</p>
      <p>
        Why else would be so indulgent to the point of spoiling Yue Mingkong?
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, Gu Changge was planning to solve the potential danger, ensuring
        that Yue Mingkong would not be implicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘But of course, I can’t do this for free, I need to make sure Yue
        Mingkong finds out.’
      </p>
      <p>As Gu Changge thought of this, he couldn’t help but smile.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t prepared to be an “unsung hero”.</p>
      <p>
        What would be the point of doing good deeds if no one knew about them?
      </p>
      <p>
        He wanted Yue Mingkong to immediately know how he took the initiative to
        protect his woman, to make her feel special.
      </p>
      <p>“Well, how come you’re not running away?”</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s thoughts abruptly returned to reality as he noticed the
        aura that stopped ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than a relatively isolated city in the middle, there was nothing
        but mountains nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city wasn’t that large. At best, it could accommodate a population
        of a few hundred thousand.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the majority of the population was natives of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent, with very few cultivators from the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>The aura that Gu Changge had felt was probably hidden in the city.</p>
      <p>
        Without the slightest hesitation, he rushed off with his followers
        behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘After so many days of running away, are they planning to come for me?
        Or are they waiting for me in that city ahead with a trap set in
        advance?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Or are they planning to blend in with the others and conceal their aura
        so that they can escape?’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge narrowed his brows.</p>
      <p>
        For him to have chased this person for so long, it was clear that the
        opponent was powerful and unlikely to be of the younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>Regardless, he was not concerned in the slightest.</p>
      <p>
        The fact that Long Teng’s Corpse was not in his hands now was something
        that could not be revealed for the time being.
      </p>
      <p>“Seal off the city ahead of us.”</p>
      <p>“Capture or kill anyone suspicious.”</p>
      <p>Gu Changge instructed the group of followers behind him.</p>
      <p>
        After that, he took the lead as he turned into a divine rainbow and
        left.
      </p>
      <p>“Yes, Master!”</p>
      <p>
        Before long, a group of powerful creatures and cultivators all headed
        for the Ancient City ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surging divine beams of various colours appeared from all eight
        directions, with the intention of sealing off the various parts of the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>At the same time, in the middle of the city…</p>
      <p>
        A middle-aged woman with golden wings was currently strolling through
        the streets, fleeing no more.
      </p>
      <p>She pondered with a frown, her face gloomy…</p>
      <p>
        “I shouldn’t be this anxious about Long Teng’s death and the True Dragon
        Clan’s rage. After all, none of this is my concern… but who the hell has
        been chasing me these past few days?”
      </p>
      <p>She muttered to herself, feeling constantly uneasy.</p>
      <p>
        It was such a horrible feeling that no one would believe it even if she
        told them.
      </p>
      <p>So she kept running, not daring to stop.</p>
      <p>
        She didn’t leave right after witnessing the battle between Long Teng and
        Gu Changge. Instead, she observed from the shadows for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had a feeling that this was not going to be as simple as it seemed,
        and that she might be able to use it to curry favour with the True
        Dragon Clan, improving her position.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Ancient Immortal Continent, the True Dragon Clan was the absolute
        hegemon, the royal family that ruled over everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘At any rate, I think it it’s that Gu Changge… the Young Asura from the
        outside world, he appeared to have noticed me back then.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘But why me? Could it be because I saw him handing over Long Teng’s
        corpse to his fiancée?’
      </p>
      <p>
        As she thought of this, the middle-aged woman showed a sharp look in her
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘What exactly is hidden inside Long Teng’s corpse? And why did it lead
        him to kill Long Teng?’
      </p>
      <p>‘Or was it for some other reason?’</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, the unease in her heart grew even stronger. Gét latest

      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged golden-winged woman’s face suddenly changed as she
        sensed several powerful auras coming from the sky, knowing it was they
        who had been chasing her.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were a few of her junior clansmen within this city, so she
        intended to take this opportunity to inform them to come to her aid.
      </p>
      <p>She never imagined that she would be chased by a youngster.</p>
      <p>
        However, her opponent’s strength was so formidable that it made even her
        heart palpitate. Even as a being in the Heavenly God Realm, she felt
        fear and was unsure if she could take him down.
      </p>
      <p>“Third Aunt, what brings you here?”</p>
      <p>
        At that moment, in front of a pavilion, appeared several Young
        Creatures. They were both males and females, some of whom recognized the
        golden-winged woman. When they did, they couldn’t help but shout in
        surprise.
      </p>
      <p>“Xue’er, Yu’er, what are you all doing here?”</p>
      <p>
        With a frown on her brow, the middle-aged woman with golden wings
        hurriedly walked towards the pavilion, the vague uneasiness in her heart
        intensified.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, she glanced outside the city and breathed a sigh of
        relief when she saw that no one had landed there.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, a few young creatures led her to the pavilion.</p>
      <p>
        “Third Aunt, I heard that you went to watch the battle this time, did
        Lord Long Teng really fall?”
      </p>
      <p>
        On the way, several young creatures, wearing sorrowful and disbelieving
        expressions, asked her.
      </p>
      <p>
        The leader of the younger generation, Long Teng, had fallen in that
        battle, leaving them devastated and unwilling to accept it.
      </p>
      <p>Many people still couldn’t believe it.</p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, the middle-aged woman with the golden wings frowned
        and asked, “Why are you asking this? Besides, why are there so many
        people gathered here?”
      </p>
      <p>
        She had noticed that there were many Young Creatures in the pavilion,
        all of them belonging to the younger generation of the Ancient Immortal
        Races.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We were discussing how to avenge Lord Long Teng and find a way to kill
        that evil man named Gu Changge.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to these words, a young woman came forward, with beautiful
        features and a pair of wings behind her.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mere mention of Gu Changge was charged with so much hatred and
        murderous it was as though she intended to cut him into a thousand
        pieces.
      </p>
      <p>She was one of Long Teng’s admirers.</p>
      <p>
        However, when Long Teng was defeated in battle and subsequently killed,
        his reputation was shattered, causing a great stir among the various
        Clans of the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was particularly devastating for those who had always admired Long
        Teng.
      </p>
      <p>For them, Long Teng was a myth of invincibility.</p>
      <p>Even now, many people still refuse to believe this truth.</p>
      <p>
        Most of them have never even met Gu Changge, but this did not affect
        their hatred for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among all the Young Supremes who had come to the Ancient Immortal
        Continent from outside, they only kept track of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged woman with the golden wings slightly sighed at these
        words, although she also wanted to take down Gu Changge and offer her
        assistance to the True Dragon Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at present, under the watchful eyes of many people, she did not
        dare to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, she felt that she wouldn’t be able to do it with her own
        strength alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Stop talking about this matter, just keep your words to yourselves, Gu
        Changge’s strength is quite formidable, and it’s not something that can
        be solved by just negotiating.”
      </p>
      <p>She shook her head and splashed cold water on the youngsters.</p>
      <p>
        “Impossible, Gu Changge must have used some sort of trickery. He could
        never have been strong enough to defeat Lord Long Teng otherwise!”
      </p>
      <p>
        These young creatures didn’t believe it, their faces a suffocating red.
      </p>
      <p>
        “In my opinion, Gu Changge is nothing but a despicable villain. If he
        had fought Lord Long Teng properly, he would have been the one to die!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The woman who had spoken earlier also expressed her hatred, without a
        trace of resignation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing those words from the middle-aged woman with the golden wings was
        like an explosion that had been ignited at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the Young Creatures in the pavilion shouted with resentment and
        righteous anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        They said that Long Teng was too powerful to be defeated and that his
        opponent was a despicable villain who had won through dishonest means.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to these remarks, the middle-aged woman with the golden
        wings slightly changed her face and felt a sense of hopelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was present at the scene and naturally knew that these rumours were
        just made up by the Ancient Immortal Races to discredit Gu Changge and
        elevate Long Teng.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at this moment, she could not afford to throw cold water on
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would not be a bad thing for them to unite and fight against the
        outside cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, she also needed Gu Changge to act as a scapegoat for the
        younger generation of the Ancient Immortal Clans to vent their anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, she looked at the angry and hateful faces of the young
        beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then she nodded and said, “What you have heard is correct. I was there,
        and Lord Long Teng did die in a very humiliating way… His opponent was
        despicable, full of all kinds of dirty tricks that were not on the
        table, but Lord Long Teng did not care for them…”
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged woman with golden wings suddenly felt a chill, as if she
        was being stared at by some terrifying being.
      </p>
      <p>At the entrance of the pavilion…</p>
      <p>
        A young man dressed in a crescent-white feather coat, with his hands
        behind his back, walked in leisurely as he casually smiled, “Sounds
        interesting, mind if I join you?”
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged woman with the golden wings looked at him, her pupils
        shrunk as a terrible chill spread from her back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her entire body felt as cold as if she had fallen into an ice cellar.

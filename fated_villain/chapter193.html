        <h4>Chapter 193: The Villain’s Plotline isn’t Going as Predicted; Can’t Live Past a Few Chapters!</h4>
        <p> Wang Zijin felt that there was nothing wrong with her gut feeling. </p>
        <p> Her current life had truly been smooth-sailing from the start, not even encountering a single setback thus
            far. </p>
        <p> Since her birth, she showed a strong talent and possessed a Cultivation Base that directly reached the
            so-called Sacred Realm of this world. </p>
        <p> However, thanks to her vast knowledge of the various male and female-oriented cliche writing routines in her
            previous life… </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin ended up choosing the seemingly most foolish and unwise, but also most stable routine which is
            abolishing her own Cultivation Base, in order to raise the ceiling of her future achievements. </p>
        <p> Later facts proved that her choice was indeed not wrong. </p>
        <p> Every step of her foundation was now extremely solid. </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin felt that she would definitely grow into a True Immortal in the future. And even the other
            descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall, Jiang Chuchu, who was claimed to be the Reincarnation of an Ancient
            Immortal, might not be her match in an actual fight. </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin was very confident. </p>
        <p> An unwavering arrogance that stemmed from strong personal strength and powerful trump cards. </p>
        <p> Her plan to leave the Human Ancestral Hall and wander into the wide world was based on the foundation of her
            immense talent, so strong that ordinary Young Supremes would not be able to catch up to her in their entire
            lifetimes, even if she did not work hard to cultivate. </p>
        <p> The so-called Young Supremes were nothing but existences that could be suppressed in the palm of her hand.
        </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin didn't give a shit about them at all. </p>
        <p> The magnificent world that she had longed for in her previous life, bizarre and beautiful, was now slowly
            unfolding before her eyes. </p>
        <p> There was no way she could care about anything else but the moment in front of her. </p>
        <p> This was the first time she had intended to go out after more than 20 years to experience this vast fantasy
            world. </p>
        <p> Prior to this, she had always been practising, be it her family or the Human Ancestral Hall, with no chance
            to go out and take a look at the world. Now that she had finally grasped such an opportunity in front of
            her, she would naturally not let it go. </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin remembered her only wish in her previous life. </p>
        <p> ‘I want to see the world. I want to go outside and see the things I have missed.' </p>
        <p> ‘The world is so big. So wide and filled with life.’ </p>
        <p> ‘I want to be a part of it too.' </p>
        <p> And this world was countless times more exciting than her previous life. Full of competing Young Supremes,
            gorgeous sights and scenery, charming women and dashing men </p>
        <p> There were thousands of scenes and more than enough to see. </p>
        <p> <b>“Ugh. Other female transmigrators always have some kind of cool icy Young Master, or some Domineering
                Devil King chasing them... But here? All brain-dead shrimp suitors who have no right to be
                arrogant.”</b> </p>
        <p> Within the carriage, Wang Zijin's dainty hand supported her delicate and flawless chin, staring at the
            magnificent sight outside, mumbling away in annoyance. </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin felt that the world she now travelled through was absolutely not like those female-oriented
            novels she had known in her previous life. </p>
        <p> Fortunately, she had also read a lot of male-oriented novels and so she felt that it was very simple to deal
            with all these kinds of broken routines. </p>
        <p> And compared to the various intrigues and dramatic plotlines in the female-oriented novels, this world that
            pursued only power and the Dao was much simpler. </p>
        <p> Power determined everything. Any conspiracy and tricks would be wiped out under absolute power. </p>
        <p> <b>“Miss, you said that you are going to find a Ruyi Staff</b>[1]<b> to marry. Is it true or not?”</b> </p>
        <p> [1: A reference to the Ruyi Staff that the Monkey King wields in Journey to the West. It means a man who
            would agree to her every request and demand. Basically a ‘yes man’. Or a simp.] </p>
        <p> Xiu'er suddenly blurted out loud. </p>
        <p> The expression on her little face was tangled into a knot. </p>
        <p> In her opinion, her own Young Miss was so beautiful and talented that it was no exaggeration to describe her
            as the brightest moon in the Nine Heavens. </p>
        <p> ‘Is there really a man in this world who deserves the Young Miss?’ </p>
        <p> Hearing this, Wang Zijin rolled her eyes quietly, her mood growing worse as she replied,<b> “Xiu'er, why are
                you so stupid? Of course, those words were lies!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Your Lady, I, will become a peerless True Immortal in the future. Using only one hand to fight against
                three thousand emperors, and two hands to push around the realm. A supreme existence! How can I be
                constrained by a useless man like them?”</b> </p>
        <p> Having said that, Wang Zijin also knew that she was completely different from other women, whether it be in
            terms of strength, background, status, or her knowledge of another world. </p>
        <p> So she truly felt that she might end up dying alone at this rate. </p>
        <p> The thought of passing through the men one by one, opening up a blooming male harem like in the
            female-oriented novels of the previous life, and flirting with all kinds of stunning and gorgeous males did
            seem quite the good scenario to Wang Zijin at that time. </p>
        <p> However, when she really did cross over, she discovered that this kind of thing was actually a nauseatingly
            horrid idea. </p>
        <p> Her standards were just too high. </p>
        <p> The gruesome scene of one day cheapening herself to marry some big pig foot[2] raised goosebumps all
            throughout Wang Zijin’s body. </p>
        <p> [2: Big pig foot is a Chinese saying referring to a loathsome, unfaithful, insensitive or chauvinistic man.]
        </p>
        <p> For her talent that was so great that even a reincarnated Ancient Emperor would not faze her, it would truly
            be the most wasteful possibility. </p>
        <p> <b>“Soloing three thousand emperors with one hand, and pushing the entire realm with two! Miss, your
                ambition is so big!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Yet I know that Young Miss has this ability.”</b> </p>
        <p> Xiu'er nodded. </p>
        <p> Ruyi Staff Husband? Although this kind of remark was one often spoken by her, Wang Zijin always had a
            nonchalant, ridiculing tone when talking about it. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on
            n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m</p>
        <p> <b>“Indeed. But I can consider finding a Ruyi Staff to marry that Jiang Chuchu”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Tch, her cold and indifferent face irks me. It’s as if the world owes her something. That damn
                pretentious noble facade.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“A person like her deserves to get beaten up by a man, lest she feels as if all the men in the world are
                just so-so, only having eyes for the Human Ancestor.”</b> </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin shook his head for a while as she spoke of Jiang Chuchu. </p>
        <p> Although the Saintess could be considered her only talking partner throughout the years of training, Wang
            Zijin’s opinion of her was not very good. She felt that Jiang Chuchu had a ‘holier-than-thou’ attitude and
            was too self-righteous. </p>
        <p> In the words of her previous world... Jian Chuchu was basically a Virgin Mary. </p>
        <p> Now, a normal Virgin Mary could be their own self, benevolent, but with the ability to uphold their own
            personal morality and ideals. </p>
        <p> But a Crazy Virgin Mary like her who only had the two words ‘world-peace’ in mind... was just plain scary.
        </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin would not say anything harsh to the Crazy Virgin, Jiang Chuchu’s face, but she naturally tried to
            avoid this kind of monstrous personality whenever possible. </p>
        <p> If she truly spiralled down the path of ‘benevolence-for-all’, then she might as well stop breathing, since
            such a person was no good and would just waste resources and disgust other people. </p>
        <p> <b>“Saintess Chuchu… I think she is a good person, but her personality is too cold. She always wants to
                uphold justice no matter what”</b> </p>
        <p> Xiu'er spoke with a bit of distress. </p>
        <p> <b>“That’s right, she is innately a good person, so we should try our best to find a suitable Ruyi Staff
                Husband for her to marry.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Lest she falls into the fire-pit trap of the Human Ancestral Hall and burns herself into a crisp before
                that.”</b> </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin giggled and replied with an expression of approval. </p>
        <p> Her total amount of contact with men was a big fat zero, be it in her previous life or now. However, in
            terms of theory, Wang Zijin was not behind anyone. </p>
        <p> She could talk about these topics for days on end. </p>
        <p> <b>“Miss, you secretly left the Ancestral Hall this time and don't even plan on searching for the
                Reincarnation of the Human Ancestor. Won’t this matter make the Elders in the Human Ancestral Hall
                angry?”</b> Xiu'er remembered another matter and started getting anxious. </p>
        <p> <b>“So what if they get angry. Do you think I’ll go back to look at their faces?”</b> Wang Zijin looked
            unhappy. </p>
        <p> <b>“It's their business to find the Reincarnation of the Human Ancestor. I don't want to get mixed up in it.
                Am I their slave or something?”</b> </p>
        <p> In the beginning, when she was taken to the Human Ancestral Hall to practise she had no clue that there was
            such a task waiting for her. </p>
        <p> Human Ancestral Hall? It sounded nice but was more like a glorified Slave Training Hall. </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin didn't see any reason why she should find and serve the Reincarnation of the Human Ancestor for
            the Human Ancestral Hall. </p>
        <p> ‘It’d be fine if us descendants were male, but seeing as both of us are female... doesn’t this feel a bit
            like we’re just here to help make a harem for the Human Ancestor?’ </p>
        <p> Thinking of this, Wang Zijin became nauseous, wishing to erase all traces of the Human Ancestral Hall from
            her body. </p>
        <p> Perhaps for the rest of the female population, being part of this ‘Human Ancestor harem’ would make them
            feel extremely honoured, to the point of throwing themselves at him for a chance to get in. </p>
        <p> But as for her? No dice. She wanted to stay away and avoid it altogether. </p>
        <p> <b>“Miss, look! That’s the Inner Domain’s Immeasurable Heaven! I heard that Young Master Wushuang is
                currently there, so why don't you go and see him?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Perhaps we’ll meet lots of outstanding Young Geniuses!”</b> </p>
        <p> [Quick Recap: Young Genius are people whose talent is above average but not so much that they can be called
            Young Supreme.] </p>
        <p> After passing through the starfields and teleportation array, Xiu'er opened the curtain and looked at the
            vast world outside, suddenly exclaiming in excitement. </p>
        <p> They had received some knowledge of the outside world along their journey. </p>
        <p> The Upper Realm, which was known to be infinite, could be roughly divided into the Heavenly, Inner, Middle,
            and Outer Domain. </p>
        <p> Yet the big events that happen in each area still managed to spread everywhere with an incredible speed.
        </p>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> During this period of time, the events in the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace have caused even the many remote
            places in the Upper Realm to be shaken. </p>
        <p> The Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts appeared, and the Immortal Road for the Ancient Immortal
            Continent had revealed itself. </p>
        <p> Each one caused a big wave, and even the two master and servant far away in Heavenly Domain had heard of it.
        </p>
        <p> <b>“Wushuang? My cheap little brother?”</b> </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin was slightly startled, stuck in remembrance. </p>
        <p> ‘Younger brother…’ </p>
        <p> Before today, she had never seen this little brother of hers at all and he was no different from a stranger
            to her. </p>
        <p> She had only learned about Wang Wushuang from the family. </p>
        <p> But at any rate, he was her little brother in this life. Since she was passing by, there was no reason not
            to go and have a look. </p>
        <p> In this life, he was her family. </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin thought for a while before nodding, <b>“Then, let’s go see him.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Well, the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace is the oldest Daoist Sect in Immeasurable Heaven. This period of
                time can be called the gathering winds and clouds for many young geniuses and Young Supremes. Maybe you
                will find someone who catches your eye.”</b> </p>
        <p> Upon hearing her agreement, Xiu'er immediately giggled happily. </p>
        <p> In reality, she herself was the one who wished to witness a group of Young Supremes. </p>
        <p> <b>“Hm. Wasn't there a rumour saying that the current Heir of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace is the
                strongest person of the younger generation? I don't know if that's fake or not.”</b> </p>
        <p> She was still muttering under her breath. </p>
        <p> Perhaps this was her true purpose in following the Young Lady outside... </p>
        <p> <b>“The best person in the younger generation? Isn’t that because the outside world doesn’t know me, your
                Young Miss? Otherwise, who would dare to call themself the best in the younger generation when I'm still
                kicking.”</b> </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin smiled as if he didn't care about these rumours at all. </p>
        <p> She was born a Sacred Realm Cultivator, so she had confidence in being the best. </p>
        <p> Although she was now re-doing her cultivation from the start, she already reached the Early Stage of the
            Quasi Sacred Realm. It was a kind of cultivation speed that would shock the entire world. </p>
        <p> Everyone would become stunned if this news were to leak out. </p>
        <p> As far as the information goes, the Young Supremes did not have anyone whose cultivation was higher than the
            False God Realm. Hence, the difference between her and them was as clear as a sunny day. </p>
        <p> There was no need to worry at all. </p>
        <p> <b>“Miss, aren't you curious though? It is said that Young Master Gu Changge is a Young Asura with a True
                Immortal talent! His power in the Immeasurable Heaven is simply unmatched!”</b>[3] </p>
        <p> [3: It is not a talent like Void and Samsara Talent. She is saying, by Changge’s talent, he is bound to
            reach True Immortal Realm in his life.] </p>
        <p> <b>“He is the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, the Heir of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace,
                and also has the support of an Immortal Sect like the Primordial Demon Sect.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“I can't believe that a single person alone possesses so many extravagant titles!”</b> </p>
        <p> Contrary to Wang Zijin's cool reaction, Xiu'er had a look of yearning and admiration plastered onto her face
            and seemed very excited and expectant. </p>
        <p> It was completely opposite to her previous attitude towards the Young Master of the Primordial Zhao clan.
        </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin's attitude, on the other hand, was very indifferent, and she even sneered, <b>“Xiu'er, what do
                you know?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“True Immortal talent? And who decided that? The Heavens above or his own father? I, for one, don't
                believe it”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“I'll tell you now, the Young Supremes who have such a reputation generally die very quickly, and they
                are cannon fodder who can't live for many chapters.” </b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Besides, his name is ‘Gu Changge'?There's no way he can be the protagonist with that kind of name. In
                the male-oriented novel routines, you want a surname like ‘Fan' or ‘Hao', otherwise, you'll never be the
                protagonist. </b> </p>
        <p> <b>“This guy you're so excited about is just some stereotypical cannon fodder, so don't get too worked up
                over him.”</b> </p>
        <p> When Xiu'er heard the Young Miss say this, she was immediately dumbfounded. She didn't understand what many
            of those words meant, but she still understood what the Miss was trying to imply. </p>
        <p> ‘Gu Changge, who is so powerful and possesses a terrifying momentum within Immeasurable Heaven, is nothing
            more than that in Miss's view…’ </p>
        <p> ‘Just a small character?’ </p>
        <p> <b>“You don't understand that these are all simple routines. Hell, maybe there is someone surnamed Fan right
                now who is off to offend Gu Changge and is about to slap his face strongly.”</b> </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin shook his head helplessly. </p>
        <p> In her previous world, she had looked at various male-oriented online novels in her spare time, and knew
            that only inexperienced and naive authors would name the protagonist like so. </p>
        <p> ‘This guy was obviously a cannon fodder character who is bound to get face-slapped.’ </p>
        <p> Yet Xiu'er did not look dissuaded at all. </p>
        <p> <b>“Hmph, Miss, you are not allowed to say that. Young Master Changge was the one whose Origin had damaged
                and almost died in the Ancient Immortal Continent trying to fight against the Forbidden Demonic Arts’
                Inheritor.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“He even rescued his Junior Sister who was in conflict with him from the clutches of the Forbidden
                Demonic Arts’ Inheritor. Rumours say that Young Master Changge is a man whose divinity is like Immortal
                Jade, transcendent and free from vulgarity.”</b> </p>
        <p> Xiu'er was full of enthusiasm, acting just like Gu Changge's little fangirl. </p>
        <p> <b>“Tsk! At this point, why don't you go to be his maid instead of mine?”</b> Wang Zijin quickly told her to
            shut up upon seeing her almost boot-licking appearance, which made her feel speechless. </p>
        <p> Compared with the rumoured Young Asura, she was actually more interested in the mysterious Forbidden Demonic
            Arts’ Inheritor. </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> Soon, the carriage squeezed through the two space barriers with a violent shudder. </p>
        <p> Chaos, turbulence, and destruction., It was as if huge meteors had smashed down, sending out terrifying
            waves. </p>
        <p> However, these horrible fluctuations were swept away by a mere flick of the old coachman's sleeves, as a
            layer of ripples spread, and the wind lightly blew. A scene that appeared extremely skilful, yet natural.
        </p>
        <p> <b>“Miss, we are approaching Immeasurable Heaven. Shall we leave directly, or go to the Heavenly Dao Ancient
                City first?”</b> the old coachman asked indifferently. </p>
        <p> <b>“Grandpa Snake, let's go to the Heavenly Dao Ancient City.”</b> Wang Zijin responded with a smile. </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> The next moment, the carriage suddenly broke through the space once more, and instantly drove thousands of
            miles forwards, to the place where the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace was. </p>
        <p> The place had been quite lively these past few days. </p>
        <p> Many Daoist Sects and Immortal Clans had sent their disciples and powerhouses there. </p>
        <p> Especially when they knew that Gu Changge's appearance in the Ancient Immortal Continent was heralding the
            start of his plan to force the True Dragon Clan into surrendering in one fell swoop, a sensation that would
            shock many people. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was truly peerless in terms of bravery and courage. </p>
        <p> A member of the younger generation, but still daring to attack the entire True Dragon Clan. So bold, the
            older generation powerhouses were stunned by his actions. </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin, Xiu'er, and the old coachman quickly arrived at the Ancient City. However, in order to conceal
            their existence from the people's eyes and ears, the two servants and one master decided to use a clever
            tactic. </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin roughened her voice and tone deliberately, trying to mask her gender and identity, though her
            voice still carried hints of softness and a more delicate touch than most. </p>
        <p> <b>“Miss”</b> Xiuer was about to speak. </p>
        <p> <b>Pak!</b> </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin knocked hard on her forehead and then glared at her, <b>“Didn't I tell you to call me Young
                Master when we're outside?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“It hurts, Young Master.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Digging out his little sister's Dao Bones in his youth, before ripping it out and returning them in his
                maturity. What kind of routine is this?”</b> </p>
        <p> Wang Zijin squeezed her delicate and flawless chin, listening to some news that happened in Heavenly Dao
            Ancient City recently. She couldn't help but look taken aback. </p>
        <p> The main reason she had come here was in order to see her cheap little brother. </p>
        <p> But now, she suddenly felt that things were a little weird, Gu Changge villain's cannon fodder plotline did
            not seem to be running as she predicted. </p>
        <p> ‘Just how many chapters will he live for?’ </p>
        <p> The three disguised people hastily joined the crowd of rowdy cultivators and immediately vanished from
            sight. </p>

        </p>
        <p> Array patterns shine, brilliant and majestic. </p>
        <p> The situation was tense, and the atmosphere turned extremely solemn. </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> The ancient warships of the Primordial Demon Sect traversed the sky, like ancient monsters, absolutely
            terrifying. </p>
        <p> Their devilish spirit was overwhelming, with domineering killing intent. </p>
        <p> <b>“The one surnamed Gu, you can only dream if you wish for us dragons to surrender. Since ancient times, my
                True Dragon Clan has been running rampant in the world. I would dare to fight even an Immortal! You are
                merely some snot-nosed brat, yet you dare to speak wildly in front of me?”</b> </p>
        <p> In the sky above Dragon Island, the void blurred, and a middle-aged man with a stalwart figure appeared, his
            face contortions with anger. </p>
        <p> He wore the golden dragon crown of the True Dragon Clan on his head, and he possessed the unique dragon
            horns of the dragon race. </p>
        <p> A supreme existence! </p>
        <p> The patriarch of the True Dragon Clan! </p>
        <p> <b>“The Dragon Clan’s Patriarch is mistaken, this Gu is just a junior, I would not dare persecute you.”</b>
        </p>
        <p> <b>“Yet, on the other hand, the True Dragon Clan had issued the True Dragon Order that day and sent the
                Tiangou Clan to attack and kill this Gu. Now the Tiangou Clan has surrendered, how should this hatred be
                counted now?”</b> </p>
        <p> At this moment, Gu Changge was standing there in the sky, his presence harmonising with Yin and Yang as he
            observed the many powerful dragons below him. </p>
        <p> <b>“Bloody lies! If you want a fight, we of the younger generation will fight. Dare you try and occupy the
                moral high ground, making our Clan look bad! This crime is punishable by a thousand deaths!”</b> </p>
        <p> A strong dragon within the clan was furious when he heard the words, his eyes filled with anger and hatred.
        </p>
        <p> [Kshn: I mean, I know they’re Dragon clan, but you can’t just say it’s a dragon in the True Dragon Clan
            author-san.] </p>
        <p> They had never encountered such humiliation before! And it was all due to Gu Changge's oppression! </p>
        <p> <b>“Ah, do not misunderstand me. This junior is not trying to preach morality, but is just trying to get
                justice for himself.”</b> Gu Changge smiled and shook his head lightly. </p>
        <p> <b>“And since the Dragons would rather die than surrender, then don't blame this Gu's men for being
                ruthless.”</b> </p>
        <p> As he spoke, his expression frozen into an icy indifference, and a round, bright black sun suddenly rose up
            from behind him. </p>
        <p> A fluctuation that seemed to reflect the Nine Heavens. The burning black sun looked as if thousands of raven
            ink clouds were boiling in the sky, field by the strongest runes. </p>
        <p> It was the replica of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation's Dao Weapon, the Ancient Wheel of Samsara, which
            was obtained by Gu Changge when he killed Ye Ling that day. </p>
        <p> Of course, if it was the real Ancient Wheel of Samsara, he could have probably caused the revolution of the
            Six Paths of Reincarnation, holding life and death in his palm using the vast and infinite power of the
            gods. </p>
        <p> But even if it was an imitation, it was still quite tyrannical, exerting a might far beyond the ordinary
            Sacred-grade Artifacts. </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> At this moment, amid the roar of many runes, golden light swept across the world. </p>
        <p> This was the perfect moment to show off to the world his fake identity as the Heir of the Ancient Deity of
            Reincarnation. </p>
        <p> Moreover, the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation had an impressive significance in the Ancient Immortal
            Continent. </p>
        <p> Having this identity attributed to himself could save Gu Changge a lot of trouble. </p>
        <p> <b>“Wait, is that... ?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“An imitation of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation’s Dao Weapon from back then!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“It turned out to be this thing... I didn't expect Gu Changge to have such an identity!”</b> </p>
        <p> The moment the black sun rose, many Daoist Sects’ cultivators nearby were all shocked, their eyes widening.
        </p>
        <p> ‘How unexpected…’ </p>
        <p> If Gu Changge had not shown it off in person, they would never have imagined that he was the Heir of the
            Immortal Period's Ancient Deity of Reincarnation. </p>
        <p> <b>“How is it possible that Gu Changge actually owns this thing?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“What is the relationship between him and the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation?”</b> </p>
        <p> Many Ancient Immortal Races, who were watching, were roaring in their hearts. The Ancient Wheel of Samsara
            had set off turbulent waves. </p>
        <p> Their ancestors had more or less interacted with the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation at one point in time or
            another, and had received favours, help and so on. </p>
        <p> So for Gu Changge to own this thing, it must mean that he was the Heir of the Ancient Deity of
            Reincarnation. </p>
        <p> And if Gu Changge did not have Samsara Talent and its mystical techniques, then he would not be able to make
            this Dao Weapon’s imitation at all. </p>
        <p> In this situation, Gu Changge and the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation were absolutely inseparable. </p>
        <p> No matter how strong the True Dragon Clan was, it was nothing more than a stubborn resistance. It was
            impossible to stop the forces behind Gu Changge, let alone the Great Elder standing beside him! </p>
        <p> At this moment, many senior members of the Ancient Immortal Races started thinking about something. In
            today's turbulent situation, it was not impossible to follow Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> <b>“Damn it! This guy actually was the Heir…..”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“This is not good! In that case, it’s better if we surrender!”</b> </p>
        <p> On Dragon Island, the faces of many dragon people changed drastically and turned pale. </p>
        <p> There was not much hope left for them in this situation now. </p>
        <p> They were no longer the True Dragon Clan of the past, glorious period. </p>
        <p> <b>“Junior, my True Dragon Clan is proud and eternal, and I would rather die than surrender. You can't make
                me surrender!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> In the depths of Dragon Island, there was a heaven-shaking sound, and the auras of several Quasi-Supreme
            Realms were awakening, extremely tyrannical. </p>
        <p> Moreover, this was by no means comparable to an ordinary Quasi-Supreme. The strongest existence was, at
            least, in the Seventh or Eighth Stage of the Quasi-Supreme Realm. </p>
        <p> <b>“Great Elder, please.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge smiled slightly and spoke to the Great Elder beside him. </p>
        <p> The Great Elder had a complicated expression, as he glanced at him, and sighed helplessly. </p>
        <p> <b>Hum!</b> </p>
        <p> He stuck out a palm. </p>
        <p> His strongest technique swept across the sky and the earth, and the sky and the earth had to be sunk. </p>
        <p> Almost in an instant, the Quasi-Supreme Realm being was also presenting his powerful technique. </p>
        <p> Countless dragons chanting and praying sounded from the heavens and the earth, brilliant scriptures filled
            the sky, it was the laws of the Quasi-Supreme Realm cultivator. </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> The void trembled, and the divine multi-coloured lights soared to the sky! </p>
        <p> An Ancestral Weapon was awakening, its divine might shook the heaven itself… </p>
        <p> <b>Puff!</b> </p>
        <p> The next moment, he coughed up blood. He lost in an instant by the Great Elder’s technique and flew upside
            down. Even the Ancestor Void Shadow’s phantom was defeated by him previously, how can a mere Quasi-Supreme
            resist his blow? </p>
        <p> <b>Whoosh!</b> </p>
        <p> <b>Whoosh!</b> </p>
        <p> <b>Whoosh!</b> </p>
        <p> At this time, there were three more earth-shattering auras coming from different directions. </p>
        <p> There was a vast army, oozing killing Intent, like a torrent. </p>
        <p> This scene crushed the last bit of hope of the True Dragon Clan, making them desperate. </p>
        <p> The Black Heavenly Eagle, Ancient Serpent, Divine Crocodile and many other mighty Clans came over in a vast,
            heaven-blinding manner. </p>
        <p> But obviously, they were not here to help them! </p>
        <p> “The True Dragon Clan is finished today…” </p>
        <p> In the distance, all the Daoist Sects and Immortal Clans’ cultivators who looked at this scene, thought this
            way with horrible expressions on their faces. </p>
        <p> <b>“Miss! Look at that, he is definitely Young Master Changge! His style is really different from ordinary
                people!”</b> In the mountains further away, Xiu'er took Wang Zijin's hand, looking excited like a little
            fan. When she saw the person she admired the most. </p>

          to get things done both openly and secretly. He almost perished on the
          shore of the Boundary Marker Sea when he fought against Lin Qingyang
          of the Blood Dragon War God Clan from the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. Fortunately, at that moment, Gu Changge had a thought. To
          test his thought out, he formed a Dharma Body made from the Power of
          Faith and came to save Ye Han at the most critical moment. For that
          reason, Ye Han&#8217;s respect and reverence for Gu Changge were
          unquestionable and even fanatical.</span

          His skin had a greenish-grey tint, and there were wisps of light
          lingering around him. Stalking over from the ancient battleship, he
          was shrouded in a curtain of grey mist.</span

          Wastelands and Ten Domains were gloomy and livid. The faces of those
          who once had a clansmen die tragically in the hands of Ye Han were
          especially sour. They didn&#8217;t expect Ye Han would be so
          arrogant.</span

          themselves. Any signs of retreat or weakness from you now will only
          result in a greater blow to your morale. And that is what the Upper

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          and Ten Domains. The young prodigies looked at each other with
          inquisitive eyes before they fell silent in unison. They were not
          stupid. The reason for their enthusiasm before was that they
          hadn&#8217;t witnessed the cruelty of this battle with their own eyes.
          After seeing how powerful and terrifying Gu Changge was, they
          naturally felt fear towards his follower as well.</span

          didn&#8217;t know what to expect if they were to rashly approach Ye

          death between the two, where only the winner could survive in the end.
          All of them wanted someone to feel Ye Han out, and they would only
          decide whether to act after they were sure. Of course, the biggest
          reason for their hesitation was that their clans didn&#8217;t allow
          them to make a move so quickly, lest they were targeted and had lost
          their lives for no reason.</span

          >In that instant, the young prodigies from the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains fell into a strange silence. The Elders obviously did not
          expect such a situation, and they could only look on with a dazed look
          on their faces before sorrow and anger took over.</span

          Wastelands and Ten Domains when they saw this. Despite that, they
          maintained their indifference and refrained from speaking. However, it
          was also because of this that everyone in the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains felt uneasy by the oppression and astonishment.</span

          asked again. He was filled with sadness, and even more so,
          helplessness. He understood why they would make such a decision. No
          one would take their life as a joke. Of course, the most powerful
          young prodigies would choose not to act right now. If their presence
          became known to the Upper Realm, those from the Upper Realm would find
          a way to target them and kill them here before they could grow.

          &#8220;Senior, I volunteerâ€¦&#8221; A young prodigy gritted his teeth
          and shuffled out of the crowd. He was pale from the nerves of having
          to bear such heavy pressure.

          >He looked like he was a follower of one of the young prodigies, and
          yet, it was due to the fact that his Master was reluctant to volunteer
          that the follower was appointed instead. The rest of the people
          couldn&#8217;t help pitying him when they saw how reluctant he

          that the young man didn&#8217;t have a choice. This only intensified
          the sadness in his heart. He would never have expected the young
          prodigies to only step out after being forced to.</span

          might be the only one to die if he volunteered to join the fight, but
          if he refused to be a part of the battle, his family might get dragged
          into this. He didn&#8217;t even need to think twice to know what was
          the better decision to make.</span

          out of his chest as his fear grew evident on his face. Seeing this, Gu
          Changge lightly shook his head and commented in a seemingly resigned,
          or mocking tone, &#8220;Only one person is going to fight? Is this all
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains can afford? I&#8217;m

          when they heard that. However, despite the surging hatred towards Gu
          Changge for saying that, they couldn&#8217;t refute. All they could do
          was clench their fists and bite their teeth while hating on themselves
          for being powerless, and Gu Changge for being cruel. He was the one

          strength. However, none of the people who heard him answered. They
          could already tell from the match earlier that Ye Han was freakishly
          strong that he wasn&#8217;t someone people of the same age could

          wouldn&#8217;t even have made it to the top 100 in my world. If you
          can&#8217;t even win against him, what makes you think anyone else can

          and energetic. Although they knew that they would definitely meet
          their end if they stepped forward now, they couldn&#8217;t help the

          wasn&#8217;t surprised, Gu Changge smiled lightly. His figure seemed

          resentment. Even though they were a bunch of hot-blooded youngsters
          who were tempted to volunteer, the people around them wouldn&#8217;t

          there was news some time ago that he strayed into a ruin and died in
          it. People felt a little regretful that an amazingly talented young

          Ten Domains. He opened his Spiritual Sea before he was seven years old
          and was called a fool by his Master because of it. He grew up
          dissatisfied with this, and so he changed his name to Chu Buyu. Since
          then, he had shown perseverance and diligence far beyond ordinary
          people as he forced himself to catch up with his peers. Supposedly,
          Chu Buyu&#8217;s foundation was solid, and there were only a handful
          of his peers who were on his level.

          the most powerful divine abilities. Fragments of Principles were sent
          flying across the air before they turned into godly weapons like

          extremely strong. He showed no signs of losing even after fifty
          attacks. Such an astonishing scene suddenly gave everyone in the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains hope. Many young prodigies who had a
          reputation like Chu Buyu also beamed. They finally contemplated
          joining the fight.</span

          hundreds of times. Chu Buyu&#8217;s face gradually tensed up in
          fatigue, and bloodstains began to appear on his body. He was starting
          to sustain injuries, some of which were so deep that his bones could
          be seen. His face was ashen as his bones creaked while he kept
          retreating and dodging. He was no longer at his previous peak. On the
          other hand, Ye Han looked like he had lost his mind from fighting. His
          eyes were full of bloodthirst and ferocity, and the fight seemed to be
          the only thing he had his eyes on.</span

          divine power boiled, and blood flowed through his scalp as his
          vitality peaked. Suddenly, he thrusted forward, his hands turned into
          immortal blades that noisily tore Chu Buyu&#8217;s body apart.</span

          opponent!&#8221; Ye Han sneered while he looked at Chu Buyu who was
          struggling in his hands, the life gradually slipping away in his eyes.
          With a burst of strength, Ye Han tore him up and made him bloodmist as
          he did with his previous opponent.</span

          Wastelands and Ten Domains felt their hearts drop. [Even Chu Buyu
          couldn&#8217;t defeat Ye Han, and was killed after launching three
          hundred attacks? Ye Han might be injured as well, butâ€¦ that was Chu

          >&#8220;Who&#8217;s next?&#8221; Ye Han was now addicted to the taste
          of blood he drew. His eyes were scarlet with bloodthirst and ferocious
          intentions as they swept across the many young prodigies in front of
          him again. Horror-stricken, everyone peered at him in silence. They
          could roughly guess Ye Han&#8217;s strength now, and they wanted to
          step out to have a fight with him to avenge their fellow clansmen and
          wash away the shame.</span

          voice suddenly rang out. &#8220;Come back. It must be boring to fight
          them one by one.&#8221;</span

          of respect. &#8220;Yes, Young Master.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t mind it
          anyway. After his brief stay here, he turned into a divine rainbow and
          went back to the ancient battleship behind him.</span

          and kill the talents from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains to
          their heart&#8217;s content. From the battle just now, they grew
          confident after seeing how the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains
          wasn&#8217;t as strong as the Upper Realm was.</span

          unwilling to submit, they did not dare to break the rules. After all,
          Ye Han had won two fights in a row, which meant that he could leave at
          any time. Of course, in everyone else&#8217;s eyes, Gu Changge was
          partial to him. The next opponent from the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains who would join the next round must be confident about dealing
          with Ye Han, now that they had a rough idea of what he was capable
          of.</span

          under Aether Abyss dissipated, revealing a dried-up riverbed and a
          wide mountain range. They might have collapsed and turned into ruins a
          long time ago, but the scenery was still boundless. There were many
          rifts, and many powerful beasts living in them, feeding on the corpses
          of the Masters who perished here.</span

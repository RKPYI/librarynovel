<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu spoke first, intending to choose one of his daughters to form a marriage contract with Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. In his opinion, the man was young yet mature and down-to-earth, with great potential. The way he had dealt with things under the radar all these years without showing off his abilities proved how extraordinary he was. He wasn&#8217;t impetuous or focused on wealth and status. Besides, Gu Changge&#8217;s suggestion had made him more partial to the idea. </span><span id="more-33846"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had many children; other than his eldest daughter Yu Feiya, there were several other princesses who were brilliantly talented and gorgeous. If he offered one of them for marriage, he could gain support from his advisor Tuo Ba Yun Tian as well. It would be beneficial in multiple ways.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, we have to hear the opinion of the person involved.&#8221; Emperor Yu laughed and glanced at Tuo Ba Xiao Yao with admiration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re right, your Majesty. But, I don&#8217;t think he would dare decline your generous offer.&#8221; Gu Changge stood to one side, clad in pure white which made him seem otherworldly and ethereal. He sipped his wine as he looked at them occasionally with a refined smile, which caused many prodigal damsels to eye him secretly with faint blushes. He didn&#8217;t seem to belong to this world and looked like he was merely watching something inconsequential as an outsider.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many young prodigies aimed envious glances at Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. If he could really marry a princess and ride the coattails of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, he wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about his future. Even the Tuo Ba Family would enjoy endless riches and improve their status. Why did he deserve this? As far as many were concerned, if Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t suddenly said something, Emperor Yu would not have been the first to make the move in offering marriage. Thus, they were extremely jealous, wondering why couldn&#8217;t something like this happen to them?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Ling Qiong and Tuo Ba Qing Yu, who had heard from Tuo Ba Xiao Yao that Gu Changge would harm him, couldn&#8217;t understand this. If Gu Changge really wanted to harm him, why would he want Emperor Yu to offer marriage? After marrying into the royal family, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao would be more favoured and highly regarded by Emperor Yu, which would be extremely advantageous for him. It would be harder for Gu Changge to get rid of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as everyone was deep in thought, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao finally spoke up. He calmed down and looked up at Emperor Yu, considering his words before finally declining the Emperor politely. &#8220;I am grateful to your Majesty for your kind offer, but my heart already belongs to someone. If you offer me marriage, I might disappoint that princess. Thank you for your generosity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that this was Gu Changge&#8217;s insidious plot and had no other choice but to risk the Emperor&#8217;s anger by declining the offer. He would not agree to this no matter the reason, since the Emperor would offer the hand of his other daughters and not Yu Feiya. There wasn&#8217;t a place in his heart for anyone but her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The palace fell silent for a moment. When everyone realised what he had said, their eyes widened and they wondered if they had misheard him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did Tuo Ba Xiao Yao decline the Emperor&#8217;s marriage offer? Where did he get the courage?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They couldn&#8217;t believe this and wondered if he was really dumb or merely faking it. Who would dare publicly deny the Emperor? How could he be so discourteous towards the Emperor? Didn&#8217;t he know what benefits the marriage would bring him?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the crowd was still in disbelief, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s older and younger sisters turned pale with worry. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only person not surprised by this was the Eldest Princess Yu Feiya. She stood silently behind Emperor Yu, only raising her head to glance at him when Tuo Ba Xiao Yao declined the offer. In several aspects, she knew him much better than his parents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xiao Yao, you…&#8221; Tuo Ba Yun Tian, who had been delighted and was drinking with several friends, widened his eyes in shock. His wine cup fell to the floor with a clang as his voice shook. He hadn&#8217;t expected Tuo Ba Xiao Yao to refuse the offer at all, since there was no reason to do so. Besides, he would become a relative of the royal family, which would make his reputation much better than before. His view darkened briefly as he couldn&#8217;t catch his breath, nearly fainting on the spot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu was momentarily stunned as well, clearly not expecting Tuo Ba Xiao Yao to refuse him right in front of his subjects, and important guests. His smile quickly disappeared and he sternly demanded, &#8220;Do you think so little of my daughters?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He now exuded a terrifying aura, unlike the warm smile he had been sporting before. Many began to shiver and quickly got up from their seats, prostrating themselves and pleading with him to calm his anger. It was clear that the Emperor was enraged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s expression flickered before returning to normal, speaking in a neutral tone. &#8220;Your Majesty misunderstood me. I don&#8217;t think less of the princesses, merely that my heart already belongs to someone and cannot accept anyone else. All of them are extraordinarily beautiful and I would have been overwhelmed with joy if not for that reason. All of this is the truth and I will never lie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had already decided that he would clarify things, even if he had to offend the Emperor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This man is still obsessed with my sister.&#8221; Yu Ming quickly discerned Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s intention and couldn&#8217;t help but sneer while Yu Lie, who was beside him, remained silent. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the future Successor of Great Yu, for Ye Lie, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s refusal of the Emperor&#8217;s offer made him feel that the royal family&#8217;s status was being challenged. This made him even more disdainful towards the man who he already disliked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haa. I don&#8217;t think you have that courage. Which of my daughters isn&#8217;t extraordinarily beautiful? Since you already have someone, I will not force you into this.&#8221; Emperor Yu snorted coldly, no longer furious despite being annoyed. While it had embarrassed him, he wasn&#8217;t about to punish Tuo Ba Xiao Yao that heavily. At most, he would just make it more difficult for the man and his family to gain his favour and regard in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ministers were deathly silent, refusing to speak. While Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s explanation was reasonable, it sounded foolish to them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of this was caused by my recklessness, which has infuriated your Majesty. If I knew he already has someone, I wouldn&#8217;t have suggested offering marriage.&#8221; Gu Changge sighed lightly, sounding somewhat helpless and apologetic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu&#8217;s anger dissipated and he waved a hand. &#8220;Young Master Changge, what kind of statement is that? How can I blame you for this? You were merely being kind to suggest this…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following words—’but Tuo Ba Xiao Yao did not appreciate it’—were unspoken, but many knew what the Emperor meant and shot pitying yet gloating looks at Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had been jealous of him yet he had instantly denied the juicy offer scornfully. Not only had he enraged Emperor Yu and would be sidelined in the future, but he might also end up unintentionally offending Gu Changge. The reputation of Tuo Ba Family might not recover thereafter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Yun Tian looked morose and downtrodden as he sighed internally. He couldn&#8217;t publicly reprimand Tuo Ba Xiao Yao; he should be happy because of Tuo Ba Yun Tian&#8217;s hidden abilities, but now, he couldn&#8217;t raise his spirits at all.</span></p>

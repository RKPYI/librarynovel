          Overlord&#8217;s Dao Oath, as she wasn&#8217;t that stupid. She had no
          solid proof in her hands that the Demon Overlords had died at Gu
          Changge&#8217;s hand. Furthermore, it would be hard to explain as
          well, so it was better to continue keeping it a secret. Besides, the
          consequences of offending him were already made abundantly clear. </span

          Demon Overlord left in the Demon World. This would be advantageous for
          Empress Yao Xi since she could use her status in order to intimidate
          those beneath her and put down riots. However, it would be suspicious
          in the long run.</span

          watching him leave. It was previously unimaginable that she would be
          so afraid of someone so much younger than her, and now she
          didn&#8217;t dare to disobey him. She transformed into a divine
          rainbow and headed for the Gates of Life. She was also worried that
          going with him to the location of the World Source would arouse his
          suspicion. [This is for the best.]</span

          void in front of him started to collapse due to the enormous surge of
          energy from within. Wisps of divine mist expelled from within the
          void, forming strange beasts as well as beings who had set foot in the
          place. However, these were all scenes from a long time ago that no
          longer existed in the current time period.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          feeling his cells quivering with excitement.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Each cell contained the urge to consume any extremely powerful
          Source, which never happened with the Sources belonging to
          Quasi-Nirvana or Nirvana Realm beings. This meant that the World
          Source was truly extraordinary and one of the most astounding powers
          in this world which could give rise to strange energies. The power was
          extreme and all-encompassing, emitting the rumbling sounds of turning
          worlds which made the void vibrate. The vibration caused the nearby
          hills to collapse.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord and the others had shown great
          improvements in their cultivation after meditating here for thousands
          of years. When the World Source matures, the Demon World might mutate
          and start evolving into a higher plane world. Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t
          going to wait until then, as it was the fate of the Demon World and
          had nothing to do with him. The only thing he cared about was the
          benefits the World Source had for him. Naturally, improving
          cultivation level was the most direct benefit to him.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[If any ancient beings watch me, they will think I am just wasting a
          good thing.] Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t help but smile. The World
          Source was making loud vibrating noises now, with wisps of Celestial
          Energy coming out of it towards the outside world. The Mirror World
          didn&#8217;t seem able to continue holding it. Thus,.Gu Changge
          didn&#8217;t hesitate to quickly move forward.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The void formed an open door which led down to the crevice below. His
          body glowed brightly, including his hair strands, which shone with a
          golden light. An intense five-coloured light shone downwards to
          counter the energy emitted by the World Source. Even the likes of the
          Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord wouldn&#8217;t have dared enter while
          withstanding this much pressure, choosing to act only when the Source
          had matured and its power reduced to the lowest level. It wasn&#8217;t
          a problem for Gu Changge though. He could move as soon as he found the
          hole in the space, which connected directly to the deepest part of the
          crevice.</span

          >Soon, the land exploded with unimaginable energy. Ancient worlds
          seemed to rotate below while emitting a rumbling sound, accompanied by
          Chaos Qi being expelled. It was even followed by the movement of the
          moons and stars. The void cracks had appeared but they were hard to
          maintain and collapsed immediately.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >The tips of his fingers glowed, projecting Dao runes one after the
          other to break through the World Energy surrounding it. Soon the
          hovering giant ball of light surrounded by Chaos Qi was revealed,
          resembling a large star. Dao energy permeated the air around it, while
          great Principles that formed chains were wrapped around it.

          light to enclose the ball of light. Soon, the place was drowned in
          darkness like the night sky had fallen.

          itself using its instincts. However, Dao Runes transformed into chains
          which bound the World Source to the area, preventing it from
          escaping.</span

          images due to her cultivation level. They weren&#8217;t actual real
          phenomena, but just images of strange scenes happening somewhere else
          which had been projected in the sky. That was what the Demon World

          Demon World?] Her first reaction was that this had something to do
          with Gu Changge. He had already disappeared for half a month, during
          which she had followed his advice and dutifully managed her country as
          well as her memorandums without interfering in anything else. However,
          she couldn&#8217;t help her shock, getting the faint feeling that this
          had something to do with the secret of the Demon World.</span

          month. Fear spread throughout the Demon World during that time, since
          many were worried that a terrible catastrophe was about to befall the
          Demon World. As the people began to discover that these weren&#8217;t
          real but merely projections, many began getting used to the event and
          instead became curious about what had caused it.</span

          emerge to rule over everything. This surprised them and had caused
          their souls to tremble. Even Bai Lian&#8217;er, at the Peak Sacred

          consuming the World Source, his cultivation level had drastically
          improved to Peak Sacred Emperor Realm, which was just a step away from
          the Quasi-Nirvana Realm. The process was somewhat difficult and

          six thousand years ago. Her daughter had been so innocent and a little
          cunning in the past. Yet, now, she had the cold and regal look of

          a worthy experience, showing that she could support the Demon World

          here and there in a flash. Stop playing around with me.&#8221; She was
          delighted by his words but returned to being an Empress. Her words
          were cold and authoritative,</span

          the wind, watching Gu Changge and the others enter the teleportation

          briefly, an indescribable emotion in her voice. Her heart felt
          somewhat dejected and empty.</span

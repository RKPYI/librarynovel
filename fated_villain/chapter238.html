      <h4>
        Chapter 238-1: I know who you are, An incomparably desperate Human
        Ancestor (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Within the vast and boundless lotus body that was filled with chaotic
        aura as if arriving into a new world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge sat cross-legged here, with his eyes filled with interest,
        overlooking Jiang Yang who stepped into this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        His star-like light robe was fluttering and there was an incomparably
        terrifying power brewing within.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mountains and seas were whistling, the sun and the moon turned dark,
        and the sky collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, each of his cells seemed to have transformed into an
        ancient and vast universe, making a heart-pounding rumbling sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the Nirvana Green Lotus had been completely refined by him with the
        tolerance of the demonic heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the origins were no longer chaotic and mixed, and they even
        looked strangely natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how monstrous the surrounding demonic energy was, he was
        imposing.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wisp of light emerged as if even if the sky collapsed and everything
        was destroyed, he would be Immortal. It was like the power of his flesh
        could resist the collapse of the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        And these were the physical changes that Nirvana Green Lotus brought
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were strands of chaotic mist outside, which were intertwined,
        isolating all of the aura fluctuations of this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Jiang Yang even more horrified, his back was cold, and his
        scalp was almost numb.
      </p>
      <p>
        He even handed over the Immortal Lun Seal to Zhao Yi outside, which was
        his biggest reliance before, which meant that his only method now was
        the Reincarnation Seal.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was waiting here, waiting for him to come for his death.</p>
      <p>
        This made Jiang Yang's heart sink continuously, sinking into a trough.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the first time he had encountered such a situation since his
        previous reincarnations so many times, and it was also the most
        dangerous situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Didn't Gu Changge fall into the Netherland Heavenly Pond? With his
        calculations, he was killed by a pit, and even his bones could not be
        found.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who would have thought that he would appear here unharmed, and occupying
        the Nirvana Green Lotus that originally belonged to him?
      </p>
      <p>And it seemed that he had been here for an unknown time.</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the phantom that everyone in the outside world saw at the time
        was intentionally made by Gu Changge, so that everyone could see it.
        Thus he deceived everyone including him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang was not stupid, he was someone who had lived so many lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had experienced a lot of things, he immediately realized that
        something was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was calculated by Gu Changge, to be precise, he was calculated by
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a pity that he lived so long, but he was kept in the dark without
        knowing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Jiang Yang forced himself to calm down, knowing that at this time,
        he couldn't be in a mess.
      </p>
      <p>"I've been waiting for you for a long time, Human Ancestor."</p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, as Gu Changge spoke with interest, Jiang Yang's
        pupils could not help but shrink again.
      </p>
      <p>
        His skull seemed to be lifted, cold water poured in directly, and the
        more terrifying chillness swept through his limbs, almost making him
        shiver all over, standing still.
      </p>
      <p>"You know who I am‚Ä¶ how is it possible‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"When did this happen?"</p>
      <p>His voice trembled faintly, and his face changed drastically.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge even revealed his identity and said that he had been waiting
        for him for a long time!
      </p>
      <p>
        With a bang, his head went blank, which meant‚Ä¶ Gu Changge knew his true
        identity a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that he had been pretending not to know, and there was no
        showdown to inform him?

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>Before that, what Gu Changge did was clear at a glance.</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Jiang Yang didn't even realize that his hands trembled
        uncontrollably.
      </p>
      <p>Why couldn't he see any abnormality before this at all?</p>
      <p>
        He just treated Gu Changge as an ordinary person from the Upper Realm,
        at most a little trick, and thought that he was nothing to worry about.
      </p>
      <p>Who knew that he was the one who hid the deepest.</p>
      <p>"When? Does it matter?"</p>
      <p>"What's wrong? You're so surprised, I thought you already knew?"</p>
      <p>"Human Ancestor, your performance disappointed me too much."</p>
      <p>
        "At this time, shouldn't you be as self-confident and arrogant as
        before?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge spoke again, looking at Jiang Yang, who was
        astonished, with a smile, his words were still so indifferent.
      </p>
      <p>He slowly got up.</p>
      <p>The terrifying power swept in like a tide.</p>
      <p>
        The monstrous gray fog outside the dome of the sky made a sound like a
        mountain and a tsunami. It was so terrifying that the world trembled.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stars outside the realm sent out ocean-like fluctuations, turning
        them all into ashes!
      </p>
      <p>It was because of Gu Changge's breathing!</p>
      <p>
        "What the hell happened? Why do I feel that Jiang Yang's breath is
        changing and weakening?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong stared at the terrifying gray fog in the sky with fear, and
        was unwilling.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her perception, Jiang Yang disappeared in the deepest part, and his
        target was definitely the Nirvana Green Lotus.
      </p>
      <p>But with this terrifying figure, she couldn't stop it.</p>
      <p>
        "Is there something wrong with Jiang Yang? It seems that he is not very
        relaxed. The weakening of his aura may be an accident‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Yang is so confident that he has set up a lot of tricks here, but
        now it is beyond his control."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why does it look more and more like Changge's actions‚Ä¶ This strangely
        familiar feeling‚Ä¶ Did he really secretly follow me?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong frowned, she could only think like this, with a wave of her
        jade hand, she instructed the men behind her to watch out, to avoid some
        stinky fish and shrimps slipping in at this time. F0lloww new ùíÑhapters

      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, when he heard Gu Changge's words, Jiang Yang's face was
        faintly ugly. Compared with the contempt at the beginning, the mockery
        now made him even more angry.
      </p>
      <p>But he couldn't do anything about it.</p>
      <p>
        When he was in Immortal Lun Sect, he thought that Gu Changge dared to do
        this because he didn't know his identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But who would have thought that Gu Changge actually knew it at that
        time, but he just pretended not to know and played with him in the palm
        of his hand.
      </p>
      <p>"Who the hell are you?"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Jiang Yang's voice had calmed down, and his mood was very
        strong, after all, his biggest trump card, the Reincarnation Seal, was
        still there.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't believe that Gu Changge had a way to kill him.</p>
      <p>At most, all his efforts in this life would be in vain.</p>
      <p>But he could still reincarnate.</p>
      <p>
        "It doesn't matter who I am, what matters is that you're going to die
        today."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Before I die, I can give you a chance to say a few more last words."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled lightly, knowing what Jiang Yang was actually
        thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't mind letting Jiang Yang despair before this. After all, in a
        desperate situation, the chance of success of plundering his Luck would
        be greater.

          });
        </script>

      <p>
        Since ancient times, villains have died because of too many words,
        right?
      </p>
      <p>That was because their methods were not meticulous enough!</p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge's eyes, Human Ancestor's Luck was passing quickly,
        especially when his protector and Yaoyao fought, it had already reached
        the lowest point.
      </p>
      <p>
        After breaking up with Yaoyao, who was supposed to be on his side and
        helping him expand his territory, it was enough to break Jiang Yang's
        last reliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Heavenly Star Realm, many of the back-hands he arranged had now
        vanished under Gu Changge's calculations, and they had all disappeared
        into nothing.
      </p>
      <p>How much Luck was left with Jiang Yang?</p>
      <p>
        He was so stupid that he even destroyed his own city wall, Immortal Lun
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>He was still too arrogant and stupid.</p>
      <p>
        He just felt sorry for the reincarnations that he had lived for so many
        lifetimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge still did not take action against Jiang Yang in
        front of Yaoyao and many people outside, after all, if he did this then
        his persona as a Master, would collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time came, he would appear with the excuse of being trapped in
        the middle, the timing was just right, and he would pinpoint it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Yue Mingkong was still outside the Netherland Heavenly Pond
        watching everything here.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge warned her with his Innate Divine God, so that she would
        not barge in and ruin his plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main thing was, Gu Changge thought that with her means, she might
        even suffer a big loss from the Human Ancestor inside the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        What she had to do was done, now Gu Changge just needed to close the
        net.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Last words? You are still the first person who dares to say this to
        me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Since you already know my identity as a Human Ancestor, it should
        be clear that you can't kill me."
      </p>
      <p>
        "No matter how many times you kill me, I will reincarnate and return
        again."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's expression, becoming incomparably calm, and he said
        indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing that the many tactics of this life were useless, he also gave up
        resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this was counted as a stain among many reincarnations, he did
        not expect to suffer a big loss on Gu Changge and fall here.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now it did not matter, he was already planning to shatter the
        Reincarnation Seal and disappear into reincarnation again.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time arrived, his past life memories would wake up, when he
        remembered all this, he would let Gu Changge understand, what was called
        regret.
      </p>
      <p>His methods as a Human Ancestor was not for him to speculate.</p>
      <p>"It's already this time, and you are still pretending."</p>
      <p>
        "Didi you forget what I said to you before, young men should less
        pretend? Especially in front of me."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge could not help but let out a snort at his words, and was not
        surprised at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        He turned his big hand towards the front, runes flickered, laws and
        rules fell down, immediately emitting a mountainous sound, transforming
        into an incomparably solid, sky-covering giant hand, slapping down
        towards Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Puff!</strong></p>
      <p>
        "Damn it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" Jiang Yang frowned and wanted to dodge backwards, however it
        was simply too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        The horrible force smashed down, and he immediately coughed out a
        mouthful of blood, his internal organs ruptured, and half of his body
        exploded.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge held back, so as not to let him die so easily.</p>
      <p>
        The so-called Son of Luck, always with innate and inexplicable
        confidence, and the Human Ancestor's confidence, was that he could not
        kill him?
      </p>
      <p>It was simply ridiculous.</p>
      <p>
        "It's useless even if you kill me now, I will still return when I should
        return, no one can stop this."
      </p>
      <p>"You can stop me for a lifetime, but not forever."</p>
      <p>Jiang Yang's eyes were incomparably gloomy, cloaked, and wretched.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he was covered in blood, lying on the ground unable to
        stand up, but still had a proud bone that could not be humiliated.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You can reincarnate many times and return, don‚Äôt you feel very old?"
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 238-2: I know who you are, An incomparably desperate Human
        Ancestor (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled lightly and said something that Jiang Yang could not
        understand, but it was clear that it was not a word of praise. He wanted
        to speak again amidst his ugly face, even if he could not resist at this
        moment, his mouth would not yield.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rumble!</strong></p>
      <p>However, Gu Changge did not allow him to speak.</p>
      <p>
        This time it was even simpler, he directly grabbed Jiang Yang in the
        palm of his hand, just like grabbing a small mole that wanted to jump.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just kill me, even if you annihilate my True Spirit, it won't be of any
        use."
      </p>
      <p>
        "My immortality lies in the fact that there are people in all the
        Heavenly Realms extolling my name!"
      </p>
      <p>"You are still too young to kill me with your tactics!"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang thought that Gu Changge was annoyed and wanted to directly
        crush him to death, so thinking this, he could not help but reveal a
        faint mockery on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, this was the only confidence he could find in front of Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>So what if he was being calculated?</p>
      <p>Even if he had to die in this life, so what?</p>
      <p>He had a long history of pride and would not yield!</p>
      <p>"Now you are like a fool."</p>
      <p>"Don't you want to know who I am?"</p>
      <p>
        "When you're dying, you still think you have a chance? Just how stupid
        are you?"
      </p>
      <p>The smile on Gu Changge's face did not change, it was still faint.</p>
      <p>
        As his words fell, Jiang Yang frowned, and his mocking words also
        staggered. He felt that something was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>He suddenly felt, what did he think wrong?</p>
      <p>At this time, Gu Changge was still so confident?</p>
      <p>Could it be that he had a way‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ to kill him?</p>
      <p>Jiang Yang did not believe it.</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, his face changed violently and dramatically, his
        eyes were about to pop out as his face turned gloomy quickly and
        tragically with a strong sense of horror and disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dense dark light diffused out, accompanied by palpitating Dao laws,
        dropping down, forming a waterfall-like astonishing sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the Great Dao treasure bottle that was floating up and down,
        being dragged in the palm of Gu Changge's hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the dark light flickered, it seemed as if heaven and earth could be
        swallowed up!
      </p>
      <p>"Great Dao treasure bottle‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"How is it possible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"You're actually an inheritor of demonic art?"</p>
      <p>Jiang Yang couldn't help but tremble.</p>
      <p>
        His voice carried an undisguised tremble and terror, feeling fear for
        the first time in his life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did he go to such length in search for the inheritor of demonic art
        in every life, to purify the peace for the world and return a peaceful
        environment for the living beings to cultivate?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the Great Dao treasure bottle was the nemesis of his
        reincarnation method, and also the only nemesis!
      </p>
      <p>
        So he couldn't let the inheritor of demonic art to grow up and threaten
        him in the future.
      </p>
      <p>For the sake of the world's life? That was all bullshit!</p>
      <p>
        He just wanted to kill the existence that threatened him in advance in
        the cradle!
      </p>
      <p>"Now you know who I am‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled lightly as always, and with a buzz, the Great Dao
        treasure bottle sank, dropping down from the sky and enveloping Jiang
        Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terrible aura surged up, like a dark divine light that covered the
        universe.

        "How is it possible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ You are actually an inheritor of demonic art‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang's face became incomparably pale, full of horror.</p>
      <p>
        There was no longer the confidence that he had just now, feeling that he
        could still return from reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        He felt the threat of death for the first time, and he was never
        expecting Gu Changge's true identity to be the Inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that the terrifying figure that appeared outside should also
        be the Universal Transformation of the demonic body that Gu Changge
        performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        He now figured out why Gu Changge had calculated him from the very
        beginning and wanted to kill him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How is it possible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The inheritor of demonic art of this world, how
        could it be that powerful‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's voice trembled slightly, still finding it hard to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of the inheritor of demonic art he had encountered were as powerful
        as Gu Changge, so powerful that even he could not resist.
      </p>
      <p>"No, it's you who is too weak."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's voice was still light, and as his foot fell, instantly
        trampling Jiang Yang underfoot.
      </p>
      <p>"No‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Impossible, you can‚Äôt be the inheritor of demonic art‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang was incomparably unwilling and in those eyes, there was a
        fierce explosion of multicolored divine light.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in his current state, let alone contending, it even took effort
        to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the terrifying suppression, there were many mysterious rays of
        light falling out from the Reincarnation Seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with the suppression of the Great Dao treasure bottle, the light of
        the Reincarnation Seal began to dim, and even cracks appeared, as if it
        were about to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is the real Great Dao treasure bottle, and it‚Äôs not just a replica
        condensed from the cultivation method‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"I understand."</p>
      <p>"I see."</p>
      <p>"So that‚Äôs how it is."</p>
      <p>"I know who you are‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang was paying attention to the treasure bottle that shrouded
        him, and suddenly smiled miserably, as if he just noticed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, his expression was not as unwilling and unbelievable as
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything seemed to be taken for granted, so he was calm and able to
        accept it all.
      </p>
      <p>"Sure enough, you never died."</p>
      <p>He smiled miserably, desperate.</p>
      <p>"Why would I die?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>
      <p>He didn't care what Jiang Yang said, and still smiled faintly.</p>
      <p>
        Although he was at a loss, he also knew that the existence of the Great
        Dao treasure bottle was related to his origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, many memories were likely to be sealed by him in the past.
      </p>
      <p>Even he didn't know when or what would emerge.</p>
      <p>
        What the Human Ancestor said was obvious that the Great Dao treasure
        bottle he possessed was a real existence, cast with endless divinity and
        immortal rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge was naturally too lazy to explain anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that the descendants of the Human Ancestor hall in this life
        have also fallen into your hands‚Ä¶" Jiang Yang was still smiling
        miserably, very desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thought of all the things he experienced after he was led out of
        Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The secret aura of the Human Ancestor Hall that he sensed at that time
        was obviously something that Gu Changge had secretly done.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, do you want to say that to her?"</p>
      <p>Hearing this, Gu Changge smiled lightly and waved his sleeves.</p>
      <p>
        The space in front of him suddenly cracked, and Jiang Chuchu's figure
        fell out of the Inner Universe that had already evolved from the Inner
        World.
      </p>
      <p>She was cultivating on a bluestone.</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, she felt uncomfortable in her heart, and it
        was difficult for her to be at peace. She felt that the reincarnation of
        Human Ancestor was likely to have an accident.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>But she wasn't sure either.</p>
      <p>
        Every day was like a torment, and many complicated emotions flashed in
        her heart, making her sigh, not knowing what the future would be like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Gu Changge suddenly released her from the Inner Universe, Jiang
        Chuchu's expression was still a little puzzled.
      </p>
      <p>
        With eyes as clear as lotus, she looked at Gu Changge beside her,
        looking like she was asking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could it be that Gu Changge was really merciful and was going to let her
        out?
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu was about to speak and asked why.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had already spoken, and naturally wrapped her arms around her
        waist, smiling faintly, "Meet the Ancestor you want to see the most,
        this will be your first and last meeting with him."
      </p>
      <p>"Don't say I didn't give you this chance."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu's expression was suffocated, a little
        unbelievable, as if she wanted to confirm again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then she looked at Jiang Yang, who was suppressed by Gu Changge, covered
        in blood and couldn't make out his face. She couldn't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This person who was stepped on by Gu Changge and was embarrassed to the
        extreme, could be the reincarnation of Human Ancestor?
      </p>
      <p>"He‚Ä¶ he is the Human Ancestor‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's voice trembled uncontrollably, unable to calm down at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the teachings of Human Ancestral Hall, what a mighty existence Human
        Ancestor was, and all kinds of great achievements were praised by all
        beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The painting hanging in the Human Ancestor Hall was still imprinted in
        the eyes of all the disciples of the Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        That stalwart figure with his back to all beings, as if no one in this
        world was worthy for him to turn his back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was it this kind of person, who was now being stepped on by this big
        demon, and who couldn't even lift his head?
      </p>
      <p>
        But she was a descendant of Human Ancestor Hall, practicing the
        exercises of Human Ancestor Hall, and the person in front of her was the
        reincarnation of Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>The origin couldn't be wrong.</p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu felt that her world was about to collapse.</p>
      <p>
        She thought that although Gu Changge could gain the upper hand, Human
        Ancestor would not be too weak. After all, he had a lot of arrangements,
        and he had reincarnated many times.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of strength and means, how could Gu Changge be his opponent?
      </p>
      <p>However, things were just the opposite of what she had guessed.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was so powerful that not even the Human Ancestor was his
        opponent, so he was crushed by force.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How is it possible‚Ä¶" Jiang Chuchu murmured, her face was frosty, as if
        struck by lightning.
      </p>
      <p>She thought about saving the Human Ancestor.</p>
      <p>
        But even the Human Ancestor was not Gu Changge's opponent, so what could
        she do?
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was also desperate. Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on
        no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why isn't it possible? He's just a rooster, and I haven't stepped on it
        yet."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Your Human Ancestor Hall, the people you believe in, are now under your
        nose?"
      </p>
      <p>"But‚Ä¶ do you dare to save him?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge looked at her and smiled casually.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's face was pale and her body was trembling. If it wasn't
        for being surrounded by Gu Changge, she would probably have collapsed to
        the ground.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Jiang Yang naturally saw Jiang Chuchu.</p>
      <p>This was the real descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall!</p>
      <p>
        Speaking of which, this should be the woman who protected him in this
        life, but now, judging from her appearance, it seemed that she had
        already been suppressed by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>She was not even perfect.</p>
      <p>This made Jiang Yang desperate, aggrieved, and resentful‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>"You‚Ä¶" Before he died, he was going to scream and faint.</p>
      <p>
        It was at this moment that Gu Changge's eyes narrowed slightly, feeling
        that the time was almost up.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There will be no afterlife, nor will you have a chance." He smiled
        softly.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, the Great Dao treasure bottle trembled and began to
        fall. The terrifying black light drowned down, instantly swallowing
        Jiang Yang's body.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eternal Overcast was a mysterious place with a barrier to block everything out. Even True Daoists did not dare set foot inside recklessly in fear of being polluted by the Yin Energy of the Eternal Overcast.</span><span id="more-36170"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of Eternal Overcast Beings stood on guard respectfully while awaiting Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This way, sir. Her Majesty has already ordered us to drive the carriage here. She is now awaiting you at the palace,&#8221; the old carriage driver said respectfully. He resembled a human but his aura was as frightening as the ocean. It was unquestionable that he had Eternal Overcast Royal blood flowing through him, just like Jia Ming who had welcomed him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded slightly and glanced at the crowd full of Eternal Overcast Beings before slowly getting into the carriage. It was the first time he was here, yet he did not feel any discomfort even though the Yin Energy here was extremely thick. Any normal cultivator would be tainted by it and fall, turning into Eternal Overcast Creatures, and losing themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old man driving the carriage glanced at Gu Changge without any change in expression, though he felt impressed internally. He might be in charge of driving the carriage but he possessed powers that should never be underestimated. Gu Changge, a human, wasn&#8217;t affected by the energy of the place at all and looked to be at peace. He was no different from any Eternal Overcast Being. That wasn&#8217;t just because of his terrifying strength, but more because he wasn&#8217;t afraid of the Yin Energy here. The black jade carriage soon rose into the sky, transforming into a black beam of light and heading for the depths of the Eternal Overcast. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything was covered in heavy fog and a dark grey sun hung overhead, emitting a deathly light. The mottled land was covered in many frightening rifts, which expelled chilling grey fog that blocked out the sun and the sky. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire place was like a deathly burial ground where multiple bodies and broken artifacts were buried. Wisps of grey smoke floated in from an unknown location to move across the barren land. Gu Changge could not see any signs of life here, not even beasts, and the entire place was deathly silent. It was as if a terrifying war had erupted here, resulting in the loss of countless lives and making the place an ancient battleground.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When did you start having memories?&#8221; Gu Changge asked with interest as he glanced at Jia Ming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well…&#8221; Jia Ming looked somewhat conflicted but did not dare refuse to answer Gu Changge. &#8220;Sir, the beginning of our memories was when we emerged from the deepest parts of our homeland. Anything before that is just pure blank.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was connected to a secret of the Eternal Overcast. The birth of Eternal Overcast Beings. They not only needed nutrition from their homeland but they also needed an extremely long period of time to transform. They had been confused on occasion too as to who they were; had they transformed from someone&#8217;s corpse to become a new race, or had the original person lost their memory after being buried here and thus gained a second chance at life?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was undeniable, though, that the deepest parts of the Eternal Overcast contained the origin of their birth, their development as well as their greatest secret. That secret might only be known to the mysterious Master of the Eternal Overcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The origin of Eternal Overcast Beings. They are linked to birth after death. Might this be related to reincarnation?] Gu Changge pondered upon Jia Ming&#8217;s reply. The core of the Eternal Overcast was an extremely cold Yin Energy, which could consume everything around it, including Principles, and even space itself. This didn&#8217;t seem like something that would have appeared in the Upper Realm. Rather, it seemed more like something which had been brought here by an unknown being from a strange mysterious place to fulfil a purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central area of the Eternal Overcast was filled with a cluster of grand palaces, with many buildings which made the place look bustling. There were many people walking around compared to the deserted barren areas on the outskirts. While it couldn&#8217;t be considered boisterous, it could be considered lively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black jade carriage flew quickly across the sky and over the cluster of buildings into the centre where the Eternal Overcast Palace was situated. The royal capital looked ancient and deserted, exuding an aura of being corroded by time. Grey smoke swirled around the place, making it seem downtrodden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can we really believe he will build the Reincarnation Platform?&#8221; Several figures surrounded by grey smoke stood within a mansion in the Eternal Overcast Palace. Their features were indiscernible. However, their eyes looked tired and somehow gave off a rotten aura. They seemed to be communicating or murmuring to each other, their gazes penetrating the mansion to look outside the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Great Ancestor, Gu Changge killed the real Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being and took on his inherited abilities. Out of everyone in the Upper Realm, only he has the solution. We have to believe him since we have no other choice,&#8221; replied Jia Nan, the Eldest Princess of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family, as she stood below these figures with her hands by her sides.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He killed the real Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being? How cruel and decisive. Isn&#8217;t he afraid of getting some kind of great divine retribution?&#8221; One being cloaked in grey smoke shook his head and gaze thoughtful. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He clearly did not believe this, since the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was remarkable and had come to the Eternal Overcast before with a prediction &#8211; somewhere in the future when grey fog covered the land, and the Eternal Overcast appeared once again. It marked the herald of a being that would be a Master in the art of Reincarnation, who could even move through the River of Time to manipulate time. If the one Gu Changge killed had been truly his chosen Successor, how did he do it? How did the Successor die so easily?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s not something we can be certain of. A great power has always secretly existed; just because we shouldn&#8217;t go against it doesn&#8217;t mean he cannot do so.&#8221; Another Ancestor cloaked in grey smoke shook his head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As long as we build the Reincarnation Platform, and have the opportunity to bask in its aura, we might have the chance to be able to free ourselves from our bottlenecks and achieve Absolute Detachment, becoming Immortals. The well water within our homeland is already running dry.&#8221; Another Ancestor sighed. They all had formidable aura which seemed to suppress the area around them despite just standing in the mansion; it was undeniable that they would cause shockwaves if they left this world and went to the Upper Realm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Principles of the Eternal Overcast were completely different to those in the Upper Realm and their powers surpassed those of ordinary Remnant Immortals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The well water is running dry?&#8221; Jia Nan&#8217;s eyes widened in disbelief. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The birth and development of all the Eternal Overcast Beings all depended on the well water deep inside their homeland; to be specific, it came from three mysterious ancient wells there. These three wells had cultivated the enormous Eternal Overcast Kingdom and were also the source of the Eternal Overcast Sources as well as the Eternal Overcast itself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now she had heard about the news of the wells drying out, she knew what this meant. It meant that the Eternal Overcast was facing an eventual collapse. If so, what were all of them to do?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s why all of the Ancestors have exited seclusion.] Jia Nan became slightly gloomy. The Eternal Overcast wasn&#8217;t as calm as everyone thought and might go extinct at any time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If the Reincarnation Platform can&#8217;t be forged successfully, then our clan has to think of another alternative.&#8221; The Eldest Princess suddenly felt that her responsibilities had increased and said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Go welcome Gu Changge first. I&#8217;ll inform you if anything happens. You can go arrange the ancestral worship and we will open up the ancestral well when all the materials have been collected.&#8221; The Ancestors drew their eyes away from outside the city and the place became quiet again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancestral worship was also connected to the Reincarnation Platform. If it were successfully forged, then the success rate of receiving its aura would increase drastically. It wasn&#8217;t just about their own opportunity to become Immortal, this was also about the survival of the Eternal Overcast. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had already left a prediction about seeing part of the future Eternal Overcast, which was why he had told them that he would forge a Reincarnation Platform for them to stabilise the Reincarnation Principles here. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a pity that the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had disappeared without a trace, and they didn&#8217;t know where to look for him. They had to send Jia Nan to find the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being and uncover his whereabouts. Without any news of him, they could only place their hope on his Successor. However, the current Successor wasn&#8217;t legitimate and had acquired everything after killing the real Successor, so they didn&#8217;t know what to say to that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, as the black jade carriage landed in the Eternal Overcast Kingdom, the Royal Family headed by Jia Luo went forward to greet him. Jia Nan had already sent orders and arranged everything after receiving Gu Changge&#8217;s message; it was clear that the royal family was now led by her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge. How have you been since our farewell at the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty?&#8221; Jia Luo looked respectful as he smiled and signalled for Gu Changge to enter the palace. Even in the Eternal Overcast Royal Palace, they had already heard about his stories. He was already at the highest peak in terms of his status and strength, thus warranting everyone&#8217;s admiration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jia Luo, it&#8217;s been a long time.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and returned his greeting, then followed Jia Luo back into the palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My sister has already arranged a welcoming feast so that you can refresh yourself.&#8221; Jia Luo signalled inside the palace where a feast was already served. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spiritual fruits and wine glistened as a group of singing girls slowly danced, their voices melodious. Many courtiers were already gathered there as well and were secretly studying him, while several women from the royal family directed looks of interest at him. They did so while their imaginations ran wild. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every prodigal damsel in the Upper Realm that knew him treated him with curiosity or admiration no matter where they came from. It was no different for the Eternal Overcast Royal Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, Gu Changge settled onto his seat with a calm look and started sampling the fine wine and dishes before him with a natural expression. The spiritual fruit in the Eternal Overcast was tainted by the Yin Energy compared to the outside world. It was deadly poisonous to a normal cultivator since it could corrode their cultivation and soul. However, it did not have any effect on Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Has my sister not arrived yet?&#8221; Jia Luo asked a serving girl beside him while pouring wine for Gu Changge. Jia Nan was highly favoured by several Ancestors and had borne full responsibility for Gu Changge’s reption.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Majesty. Prince Jia Luo, has gone to the ancestral palace and should be on her way back,&#8221; replied the serving girl, not daring to hide anything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The ancestral palace?&#8221; Jia Luo raised his eyebrows. The ancestral palace was where their Great Ancestors cultivated in isolation and without their permission, no one was allowed to disturb them. Jia Nan being called over suddenly meant that the Great Ancestors had something to assign to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that thought, Jia Luo shot a thoughtful but inconspicuous look at Gu Changge. He knew about the forging of the Reincarnation Platform and understood that Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t the real Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being. It was merely that Gu Changge possessed the inheritance from the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being and the Royal Family needed his help. Thus, both parties had come to an agreement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The sights of the Eternal Overcast I have seen during my journey differ greatly from what I imagined.&#8221; Jia Luo&#8217;s thoughts were interrupted by Gu Changge as the latter quietly chuckled. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His expression shifted slightly before he regained his demeanour and he smiled. &#8220;We have always been this way since ancient times and have never changed. It&#8217;s just that outsiders have rarely come here and know very little of this place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge put down his glass and smiled lightly. &#8220;I must have worried too much then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had already observed the current Eternal Overcast on his way here. Frankly, while the concentration of Yin Energy was high, it didn&#8217;t reach his expectations. In a certain aspect, he felt that the current Eternal Overcast was slowly deteriorating and wouldn&#8217;t be a real threat to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had wanted the Eldest Princess get Eternal Overcast Sources for him, but she had denied him multiple times and sent him a little only after a long delay. He had already suspected since then that a drastic change had happened in the Eternal Overcast. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Nan had given him an explanation that infighting had happened in the Eternal Overcast Royal Family and she had to calm things down and return things to normal. Thus, she couldn&#8217;t spare much time to get him Eternal Overcast Sources. From today&#8217;s circumstances, it wasn&#8217;t that she didn&#8217;t have the time but that the Eternal Overcast Sources had become rarer and more difficult to find. Thus, using it to bargain with Gu Changge was out of the question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If so, the so-called ancestral worship issue will become very interesting.] Gu Changge smiled meaningfully and glanced outside the palace to a certain spot. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had already sensed several penetrating gazes eyeing him in an investigative and observing way, but he had feigned ignorance since he hadn&#8217;t wanted to alert the owners. After all, he had other plans. It seemed like there were some formidable figures concealed within the Eternal Overcast.</span></p>

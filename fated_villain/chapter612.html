        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Ah Qing&#8217;s original world, the Sword Dao had already developed to its peak. Everyone would be accompanied by a Sword Spirit from birth and for that reason, they had also classified the Sword Spirits into Heaven and Earth, Spiritual, Divine, and other different gradings. Those with powerful abilities could yield plentiful results with less effort, making their potential immeasurable. </span><span id="more-33857"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it had been many years since a Divine Grade Sword Spirit appeared while Spiritual Grade Sword Spirits were the targets which many Forces fought over. Ah Qing herself had a Spiritual Grade Sword Spirit, which had been due to her father being a strong Earth Sword Immortal. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that world, Earth Sword Immortals were already at the highest level among mortals. They were just a step away from reaching the next realm, which required them to overcome a Heavenly Tribulation. However, a breakthrough was extremely difficult. An ancient Sword Immortal from the Shu Sect, who had reached the peak of the Earth Sword Immortal Realm, had failed to overcome his Heavenly Tribulation, causing his cultivation to be eliminated and his soul to fall to pieces. From then on, it had been unheard of for anyone to reach that realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Earth Sword Immortal Realm?&#8221; Gu Changge inclined his head slightly as he took in everything Ah Qing had mentioned with some thought. Every world differed in their Principles and environment, but the level at which the void was broken was the strongest force which that world could withstand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the lifespan issue she mentioned, Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t concerned about that. Some worlds lacked life-extending means, so an Upper Realm supreme expert wouldn&#8217;t live past a few hundred thousand years in that world. As he saw it, this so-called Earth Sword Immortal Realm wasn&#8217;t at the level of a True Daoist but between the Sacred Emperor Realm and the Quasi-Nirvana Realm. Though, he couldn&#8217;t be sure until he saw it for himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, saviour. I will find a way to repay your kindness.&#8221; After eating and drinking her fill, her strength had been restored to a great degree. Thus, she thanked him and got up with satisfaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was still pondering over what she had said and waved his hand while smiling. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing much. You don&#8217;t have to be so polite.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It would be better if everyone in this world is as kind as you.&#8221; Ah Qing&#8217;s gaze landed on his face, her voice sounding earnest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s far too early to say that.&#8221; He smiled slightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hint of doubt appeared on Ah Qing&#8217;s stern yet pretty face as she felt a strange implication within his words. However, he did not explain anything and smiled instead. &#8220;It&#8217;s late. Return and get some rest. You seem to have learned the way of the sword since little, so I&#8217;ll get someone to take you to make you a new sword that suits you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um—&#8221; Ah Qing was taken aback but quickly waved her hand. &#8220;You&#8217;ve already treated me well enough. I can&#8217;t keep troubling you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She might really need a suitable sword right now, but inconveniencing him over and over made her feel guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I told you that it&#8217;s nothing much.&#8221; Gu Changge was still smiling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can&#8217;t do that. I no longer know how to repay your kindness.&#8221; She stood her ground, since she had principles of her own and knew she owed him plenty already.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge seemed to sigh. &#8220;Fine, then. Rest early, Miss Ah Qing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could tell that this girl had a stubborn and unyielding character, and would never change her decisions easily. Besides, he was planning to go to her former world and would need her for several things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing glanced at him as if hesitating to say something, but she eventually remained silent and bid him farewell. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her parents had always warned her that everything good came at a price. Gu Changge was someone she had just met a few days ago. However, he was providing her with such amazing treatment. She couldn&#8217;t figure out what his purpose was. Plus, his every move did not betray any of his hidden motives, as if he had merely been acting out of kindness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Ah Qing had left, Gu Changge&#8217;s smile faded immediately before curiosity flashed within his gaze. From the information he gained, he knew that her father was a Earth Sword Immortal who had disappeared when fighting the so-called ‘Otherworldly Sky Demons’, which had been soldiers from the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. She had crossed the Space Rift to find her father before getting captured by the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. She even had a powerful position and reputation back in her world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the following days, news of an enormous ancient world being discovered in the territory of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was somehow leaked, which shocked many surrounding Forces. Many Immortal and Formidable Forces paid attention and started sending people to look into it, with some people even asking the Yu Emperor about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yu Emperor was immensely outraged and sent an order to investigate who leaked the news. He had suspected Gu Changge before, but there was no proof that Gu Changge knew about it. However, the oldest son of the Tuo Ba Family, who was also Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s older brother, had been among those guarding the entrance of the Space Rift. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This incident made the Yu Emperor paranoid, plus he knew of Tuo Ba Xiao Yao leaving his home for the border to see his brother. Thus, he couldn&#8217;t help but suspect that the leak had something to do with Tuo Ba Xiao Yao since the timing fit the criteria.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the secret already got exposed, so the Yu Emperor could no longer take that ancient world for his own. Without any other choice, he gave a lot of known information to the numerous messengers sent by various Forces. Every one of these Forces were salivating at the prospect of rich resources from this ancient world, which had never been uncovered. They quickly sent their men toward the entrance of the Space Rift while discussing with the Yu Emperor about how they could invade that ancient world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the presence of the barriers of space and the different World Principles, no one could wield their full strength there. However, the Forces from the Upper Realm were already experienced in this and refused to delay their progress, which would give the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty an advantage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal Forces quickly sent their best disciples there, since the limitations they experienced after entering that world would be less compared to those from the older generation. Besides, the disciples sent were Successors of their respective Force, and thus possessed numerous treasures. The Force didn&#8217;t have to worry about them being endangered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yu Emperor was reluctant to let the other Forces get there before the Dynasty, so he chose many candidates from among his descendants to journey there together. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Lie, the future Successor of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty shouldn&#8217;t risk being endangered, so the Yu Emperor didn&#8217;t allow him to participate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The betrothal between the Eldest Princess Yu Feiya and Prince Jia Luo of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom hadn&#8217;t been decided yet, and the latter had left for home under orders with plans to return soon. Thus, the Yu Emperor allowed Yu Feiya to lead the entourage to that ancient world after some discussion. He took this very seriously since that world was extremely important and might contain divine objects such as a World Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ancient battleships carrying hordes of armies zoomed across the sky toward the distant border of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty while crushing past stars. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing looked anxious at such a sight. She already knew about the events over the past few days, where her own world had already been exposed to the numerous Forces of the Upper Realm. It had only been the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty sending its army, but now, the other Forces were sticking their noses in this too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more terrifying catastrophe was about to befall her home, and none of its inhabitants could fight back against it. The inevitable result was defeat and their territory being divided among the Forces of the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saviour, is the Force behind you also interested in this?&#8221; Ah Qing was suddenly puzzled and couldn&#8217;t help asking Gu Changge about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not interested, so my Force naturally isn&#8217;t,&#8221; Gu Changge answered leisurely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing nodded in understanding. This depended on Gu Changge&#8217;s attitude; he could send a formidable army like the other Forces had if he wished to, but he didn&#8217;t seem intrigued by this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s your next step?&#8221; He asked with a hint of a smile on his lips.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I may have to return. My mother will be very worried for my safety and besides, I have to join my comrades in stopping this disaster,&#8221; she replied after some thought. She knew that her contribution meant little in this catastrophe but she still wanted to do something. Plus, she had left home for several months and her mother would be extremely anxious due to her leaving without a farewell. The knowledge that her father wasn&#8217;t dead was already satisfactory enough.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can ever repay such an immense favour from you.&#8221; Ah Qing glanced at him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He merely smiled in response. &#8220;Do you think you can resolve this disaster?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can do that?&#8221; Ah Qing was stunned. She could never achieve this with her abilities. [Is there another option?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The border of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was an open range filled with stars. Many stars  and land massed floated in the immense space, and there were many cities situated right in the centre, which were so numerous it was hard to discern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the armies arrived from every direction, the place became the focus of every Force. Several lone cultivators were also attracted by the rumours and attempted to take advantage of the situation. Besides the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, many surrounding Forces had also sent their men, who had set up camp around the sea of stars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Without the order from His Majesty, we cannot recklessly go past the entrance since many experts are guarding it. Even I cannot approach it carelessly. We have to wait for everyone from the other Forces to be present, so you can hide among them and follow us there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of the cities, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was currently conversing with a young man with rough features which slightly resembled his own. That was his oldest brother Tuo Ba Fei Yun, who was responsible for guarding the Space Rift.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough time left for me. I need to go inside and find a way to rescue Qing Yu,&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao answered in a low voice while looking impatient. He had been here for several days and was certain that the world behind that entrance was the one where he had lived and cultivated during his past life. However, there were only less than five days left for him to hand over the Sword of World Domination as Gu Changge ordered.</span></p>

          misunderstanding,&#8221; said Xiao Ruoyin as she shook her head. She

          a pale face, but he didn&#8217;t say anything to stop her. He
          understood that there was a gap between him and Xiao Ruoyin, one which
          would never be fixed from now on. The current Xiao Ruoyin was no

          the current Xiao Ruoyin only hadn&#8217;t thought things through
          because of how hard it was for her to accept the cruel reality. It was
          certain that she would realise how dangerous it was to stay by Gu

          her residence in Skyward Schloss. With how messy her thoughts and
          emotions were now, she needed a little time to regain her
          composure.</span

          Master Gu must be tougher than he looks for him to reach where he is

          Divine Source Master would be Jiang Chen. Things had gotten
          complicated and tricky. The most important thing for her now was to
          act out her previous identity in front of Gu Changge. This time, she
          vowed to succeed, but Jiang Chen obviously had a lingering grudge
          towards Gu Changge. She hadn&#8217;t figured out how she could explain
          this to Gu Changge.</span

          >At the same time, Gu Changge was preparing for the Divine Rock
          Conference in three days. After this conference, the Ji Family would
          join hands with other Forces to invade Kun Mountain. It was also an
          extremely rare event for the entire Upper Realm. Gu Changge himself
          was not really interested in this conference. But now, he was
          interested in a few especially miraculous Divine Rocks, which
          supposedly would be at the conference.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >One Divine Rock even breathed like a living being in the middle of
          the night, actively absorbing the starlight and devouring the
          brilliance of the sky. Some people who saw it flying among the clouds
          called it an Immortal Foetus. The other rock was rumoured to be a
          star-crossed Foetal Rock, which caused the destruction of the Great
          West Holy Land. Back then, the Prime Ancestors of the Great West Holy
          Land risked his life to come out of Kun Mountain. After leaving the
          stone in the Sect for a few days while he was away, the Great West
          Holy Land had an unfortunate incident. Overnight, the huge Sect got
          annihilated.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many said that it was related to the unknown Foetal Rock. Over the
          years, the Foetal Rock had been sealed in the depths of Dark Kun City
          and was restrained by True Daoists. But some time ago, there was a
          strange fluctuation in that Foetal Rock, and it was said to have
          happened at the same time there was abnormal activity detected in Kun
          Mountain. Therefore, people wondered if the Foetal Rock was hugely
          related to the fact that Ji Shengchu, the Prime Ancestor of the Ji
          Family, was trapped in Kun Mountain.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >These Sacred Rocks would be brought out during the Sacred Rock
          Conference this time. All Immortal and Formidable Forces had recruited
          many Source Masters to cut out these Sacred Rocks during the
          conference despite the high risks.</span

          >[All the major Forces will be joining. There may be surprises waiting
          to happen at this Divine Rock Conference.] Gu Changge had some
          guesses. He didn&#8217;t think that Xiao Ruoyin could persuade Jiang
          Chen to lend him his strength. Though, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t even
          need Jiang Chen in the first place. On the contrary, he predicts that
          a rift would appear between Xiao Ruoyin and Jiang Chen because of this
          matter. Although he didn&#8217;t really care for this bit of Fortuity
          and Fatum now, it could serve useful in one way or another.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To Gu Changge, Jiang Chen was just a chess piece that he
          wouldn&#8217;t use just yet. The reason he had his Demonic Puppet
          plant the Demonic Seeds on Jiang Chen was to wait for the time the
          Demonic Seeds grew.</span

          >Gu Changge&#8217;s main target at the Divine Rock Conference this
          time was Jiang Chen&#8217;s friend, Niu Tian. He was someone with
          Hidden Celestial Bloodline. According to his investigations these
          days, the Lady from the Hidden An Clan was currently in Dark Kun City.
          Clearly, they had come to join in the fun and participate in this
          Divine Rock Conference.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There was no news from An Yan just yet, but Gu Changge thought that
          she should be able to obtain that drop of True Blood from the Hidden
          Celestial. He had no use for someone so useless they couldn&#8217;t
          even get the job done. Such a person was of no value to him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Right then, Yin Mei came from outside the palace and reported back to
          Gu Changge. &#8220;Young Master, as you said, the Hidden An Clan has
          been looking high and low for a Source Master. They seem very
          interested in the Immortal Foetus.&#8221;

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Interested in the Immortal Foetus?] Gu Changge nodded thoughtfully.
          If his predictions were correct, the Hidden An Clan would get to Jiang
          Chen in the end. [Jiang Chen and Niu Tian may just have a reunion
          between old friends.]

          Tian, he was their common enemy. It was natural for them to share the
          same hatred at a time like this. Nevertheless, knowing this, he added
          casually, &#8220;I want you to help me keep an eye on that Xianer. See
          what she is up to these days.&#8221;</span

          that. She seemed to be holding back her laughter. &#8220;Lady Xianer
          has noticed my men, and she warned me to not follow her. She also said
          that she would settle accounts with you someday.&#8221;</span

          been with Gu Changge ever since he was still a Direct Disciple in
          Skyward Schloss. It had been a long time since then. Later, she helped
          him set the Young Master of the White Tiger Clan up to his death. He
          also deceived those in the Celestial Ancient Continent into killing
          the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being…</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yin Mei actually knew Gu Changge&#8217;s personality very well. He
          looked gentle and refined on the surface, but in reality, he was cold
          and ruthless, and he had the cruellest of ways to do things. Only a
          handful of people could enter his heart. She knew that she was a
          disposable chess piece to him right from the beginning, but she felt
          the envy that any woman would feel after knowing that Gu Xianer was
          the only one Gu Changge pampered and cared for in this huge Upper
          Realm.</span

          Merchant Alliance&#8230; She is gambling stones.&#8221; An odd
          expression appeared on Yin Mei&#8217;s face. &#8220;Also, Lady Xianer
          seems to have some kind of superb Source Technique.&#8221;</span

          lose.&#8221; Gu Changge raised his eyebrows in surprise. Speaking of
          which, most of the power over the Alliance of Thousand Merchants was
          in Yin Mei&#8217;s hands. So even if Gu Xianer lost all her money, the
          money would go around and about, and would eventually still go into Gu

          However, she had always been used to being by herself. Even if she
          possessed a Source Technique, she probably rarely used it in front of
          others. If she really bore the Legacy of a Divine Source Master, Gu

          faltering elderly men were holding stone knives with trembling hands
          as he stood in front of a greenish-grey stone as tall as half a
          person. His voice shook, and his face was flush. He was obviously
          excited to the extreme, and it was difficult for him to hide his
          excitement.</span

          >The vast and boundless Demon World had been divided into nine Domains
          a long time ago, and each Domain was ruled by at least one of the six
          Demon Overlords. However, it achieved a rare unification for the first
          time after the 6000 year chaos ended. Now that the Nine Great Domains
          were ruled by Empress Yao Xi, times were peaceful, and war rarely
          happened. Apart from the remaining five Demon Overlords back then,
          there was almost no force in the Demon World today that could resist
          Empress Yao Xi.</span

          up till this day. Now, they controlled a sizable army and defied
          orders from central authorities, and tried to overthrow the
          Empress&#8217; regime. Because of that, many wars had broken out in
          various places.</span

          its vast landscape filled with green, majestic sacred mountains, the
          Solar Domain was a magnificent sight to behold. After it had been
          merged into the Meridian Domain of the Demon World, all Clans in the
          Demon World would come and go, hence the large population here. The
          population here also had powerful Hidden Masters.

          practising humanitarianism and passing down various cultivation
          methods so that many Demonic Beings had the opportunity to get rid of

          World gatekept their methods of cultivation to themselves. They had
          never spread them to the outside world. This also led to the birth of
          many Demonic Beings with spiritual wisdom but without Heirs. They
          could only live in ignorance because of that. Even though they lived
          long lives, their low cultivation level meant that they could only be
          captured by cultivators of other Races, and either became slaves or
          materials for refining medicine. Either way, the only thing that
          awaited them was a miserable end.</span

          major Clans of the Demon World, as she was, in a way, taking their
          interests out of their hands. The major Clanswere naturally unwilling
          to hand over their cultivation techniques, but they had no choice but
          to compromise under her iron-grip rule.

          the Holy Land of the Demon World. It was where countless beings in the
          Demon World placed their hopes on. Countless Demonic Beings wanted to

          Beings who had studied in Black and White Academy had become loyalists

          incomparably majestic and ancient gate. The desolate and historical
          gate looked as if it was the first gate that had been there since the
          beginning of the world. On the surface of the gate were more than a
          million wisps of Chaos Energy, which hung and brightly intertwined,
          morphing into characters that formed the name of the academy. They
          constantly reflected the sky.</span

          of the universe and consuming the rays of the sun and moon, as they
          cultivated. At this moment, there were a few tall young men and women
          from the Demon Race in front of the gate. Shrouded in divine

          someone before. She had even planned to have all the civil and
          military officials prepare the Starsnatcher Temple to properly welcome
          the important guest. All of them couldn&#8217;t even begin to imagine

          came to them outside the gate. Donning blue from head to toe, he was a
          handsome man with a tall and straight figure who exuded confidence
          enough to be indifferent. There were many young beings of which were
          beautiful women following behind him, and he seemed to be the leader

          they warily shut their mouths tightly. The man in blue, too, glanced
          back at them in shock when he overheard their conversation. Seeing
          that the conversation had come to an end, he let out a small smile
          before he walked through the gate.</span

          things she learned in detail. &#8220;My lord, I have only heard that
          the identity of the person from the Upper Realm is mysterious and
          terrifying. Her Majesty did not disclose anything about him, but she
          had all the officials go to Starsnatcher Temple today to prepare to

          walked into the academy, he led everyone back to his Cave Mansion. He
          planned to ask someone else about it again. The Demon World today was
          not as peaceful as it appeared to be on the surface. There were too

          was Song Youwei, and she was a beautiful lady with a gentle and
          generous temperament. Although born noble and loved by thousands of
          people, she wasn&#8217;t the least bit arrogant. Not only that, she
          was patient and gentle with others. She is the most perfect goddess in

          before the Empress would entrust her with important tasks. Even some
          Elders of Black and White Academy thought highly of Song Youwei and

          outstanding Talent and a strong cultivation level, he had defeated
          many disciples of the older generation in just half a year since
          joining the academy. There were plenty of rumours about him, like how

          avoid suspicion, he changed his name to Jun Fan in this life. For some
          reason, Empress Yao Xi suddenly started a nationwide search for
          someone named Jun Bufan some time ago. Upon learning about this, the

          because of this trivial matter at such a crucial time. Because of
          that, Jun Bufan changed his name to Jun Fan and started to hide from
          the Empress&#8217; search. It just so happened that his father was the
          person in charge of overseeing this matter. To the Quelling Chaos
          King, it was a mere coincidence that Jun Fan had the same name as the
          Jun Bufan from 6000 years ago. He had chosen Jun Bufan&#8217;s name on
          a whim in hopes that his son would be as brilliant as that talent from
          six thousand years ago, but he had never thought that the Empress

          years.</span

          learn from. He also relied on the experience of his cultivation in his
          previous life and the many inheritances he received in this life to

          exchanged letters with Gu Changge, and they often stayed in contact.
          This made Jun Fan somewhat upset. After all, Yao Xi was once his
          fiancée, even if she had poisoned him to death. However, he had never
          heard about her having any other man by her side for the past 6000

          Changge&#8217;s high status, every news about him that went around in
          the Upper Realm was naturally going to reach the ears of the Demon
          World residents. In terms of ability and background, Gu Changge could
          no longer be treated as just a Junior. &#8220;Anyway, know your

          with a dignified appearance and strong cultivation. He then made
          Qingzhu understand that it wasn&#8217;t worth it, following the
          violent and ruthless Empress Yao Xi. Not only did she have to work
          tirelessly, but she also didn&#8217;t even have freedom. And in the

          &#8220;Young Master Changge, you went on a fatiguing journey of
          hundreds of millions of kilometres to come to the Demon World. It is

          status and ability to sit at the same table as the Empress. However,

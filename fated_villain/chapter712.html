        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Crack!* Delicate yet evident cracks prominently appeared on the Reincarnation Platform. The cracks then grew bigger, quickly spreading throughout the entire platform, after which golden lights erupted followed by a blaring explosion that blew the platform apart.</span><span id="more-36175"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221; The people of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom were instantly stunned as their gleeful faces immediately disappeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shattered?&#8221; Jia Nan widened her eyes in dismay as she peered at the cracks, doubting her own eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Impossible! Why would the Reincarnation Platform shatter and turn to dust out of nowhere?] In that instant, her heart bore nothing but disbelief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Six Great Ancestors, who were observing everything from the homeland, lost their cool. They were deeply affected by this. If it weren&#8217;t for the restrictions, they would have shown themselves and personally looked into the destruction of the Reincarnation Platform. [Was this merely an accident? Or did Gu Changge rig it on purpose?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If he indeed pulled off some tricks…&#8221; One of the Ancestors was visibly sullen, his face extremely taut, while the other five Ancestors were similarly morose, glared at Gu Changge with hostility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What was the problem? Why did it suddenly break? Ah, it seems the Life Rocks and Death Rocks were all for nothing. I&#8217;ll have to do this once more.&#8221; Feigning ignorance, Gu Changge shook his head and vented his sympathy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at his expression, the crowd had no idea that he spoke those words intentionally. [Did he not cause the destruction of the Reincarnation Platform?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have to trouble you once more, Young Master Gu.&#8221; Despite her desire to question Gu Changge about the shattering of the Reincarnation Platform, Jia Nan took a deep breath to collect herself and spoke in a calm tone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, she still suspected that Gu Changge might have deliberately broken the platform. [But why would he do that for no good reason?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All good, though the Life Rocks and Death Rocks have been wasted.&#8221; Gu Changge gently shook his head, seemingly sympathetic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Nan looked at him deeply and wordlessly nodded. Since the Six Great Ancestors remained silent, she dared not to make any decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining Eternal Overcast Beings didn&#8217;t dare to say anything, yet judging from their eyes, they were obviously concerned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the next few days, this place was shrouded in stunning black and white colours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes were serenity as though he entered a state of eternal tranquillity. Once again, he condensed the Life Rocks and Death Rocks according to the instructed structure and reconstructed a new Reincarnation Platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, he had indeed rigged the previous Reincarnation Platform, causing it to fall apart, in order to test out the attitudes of the Six Great Ancestors. [They are surprisingly patient.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Gu Changge could tell that the Reincarnation Platform was of absolute importance to the Six Great Ancestors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This seems to be a mere coordinate that is unable to communicate the mysteries of Reincarnation. Do they perhaps intend to draw someone here?] Gu Changge was genuinely taken aback. The secrets of Eternal Overcast must be deeper than what he could tell right now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In that case, I shall drop the courtesy!] Having thought things through, he glanced at the depth of the Eternal Overcast homeland and revealed a subtle grin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right away, the Power of Reincarnation intertwined around the hall. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter—the four seasons densely passed along with the evolution of all lives. Compared to the first attempt to forge the Reincarnation Platform, the aura this time was significantly more intense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surrounding people felt as if they were being absorbed into Reincarnation. Eventually, the entire Eternal Overcast was affected by the aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blinding lights beamed towards the clouds, thoroughly illuminating the dark sky. Even the depths of the homeland, which was covered in grey mists, was affected by the aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, everyone could clearly see six ambiguous yet frightening figures standing afar. The six figures possessed daunting, unrelenting auras that could subdue all Principles of the world as if they had existed since the beginning of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Six Great Ancestors! They have reawakened as expected!&#8221; Seeing that, countless Eternal Overcast Beings immediately knelt down towards their direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Six Great Ancestors never expected that Gu Changge would reveal them with the Reincarnation Platform. Though, in that instant, as they no longer had anything to hide, they silently stood still, gazing upon all living beings with cold, suffocating, intimidating eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the founding Ancestors of the Eternal Overcast, their existence led to the birth of Eternal Overcast Being, followed by the creation of all other things. Without a doubt, they were the unrivalled supreme divine beings to all Eternal Overcast Beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, under the reflection of the aura of the Reincarnation Platform, the surrounding void and Principles became blurry. It was as if they couldn&#8217;t contain the aura of the Six Great Ancestors&#8217; appearance, and seemed to be breaking apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young man, did you expose us on purpose?&#8221; One of the Ancestors walked out from the Eternal Overcast homeland. With his entire body shrouded in grey mists, he gazed upon Gu Changge. His voice was cold and emotionless as if it was an enormous bell that reverberated the entire universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, they never had the intention to reveal themselves. Even after that night when they caught Gu Changge sneaking into the depths of the homeland, they did not pursue him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, however, with how Gu Changge exposed them right before all Eternal Overcast Beings, they felt deeply humiliated. Thus, in that instant, if they remained quiet for any longer, Gu Changge would surely belittle them, thoroughly embarrassing themselves in front of their worshippers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, a terrifying, suppressing aura erupted, as if the sky was collapsing. The surrounding World Principles and void fell apart as energy and illumination were waning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is bad… The Great Ancestors are enraged…&#8221; Terrified, the Eternal Overcast Beings shivered in restlessness and got on their knees, while an overwhelming aura vigorously subdued them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Great Ancestors are truly enraged! The situation is getting out of control!&#8221; The faces of Jia Nan and the rest grew taut. They felt suffocated as if someone was forcibly grabbing their hearts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since ancient times, the depths of the Eternal Overcast had been desolate. Rarely had their Great Ancestor showed themselves, let alone one got angered. Thus, to all Eternal Overcast Beings, this was a tall tale—the first that to be recorded in ancient archives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Losing your temper already?&#8221; Nonetheless, facing the wrath of an Ancestor of the Eternal Overcast, Gu Changge retained his casual, composed look. He slowly lifted his palm off the Reincarnation Platform, as if nothing shocking was happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, he indeed deliberately exposed the Six Great Ancestors right in front of the Eternal Overcast Beings. Since they loved spying on everything in the dark, he decided not to let them have their way. Moreover, he wanted to make it clear to them that he was now the one in control.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gu Changge first came to Eternal Overcast, he was not aware of the heritage of the place nor the intentions of the Six Great Ancestors, so he refrained from startling them. Nonetheless, now that he understood the importance of the Reincarnation Platform to the Eternal Overcast and the true strength of the Six Great Ancestors, he no longer had anything to worry about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nevermind. As long as you forge the Reincarnation Platform, we swear on our Dao Heart that we shall not trouble you.&#8221; Then, another one of the Six Great Ancestors seemed to have seen through Gu Changge&#8217;s intention and spoke with a calm voice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the Ancestor who stepped out from the depths of the homeland earlier halted his steps. After all, before the Reincarnation Platform was successfully forged, it was in their best interest not to have any conflicts with Gu Changge. Their gestures were only to intimidate Gu Changge in order to prevent him from playing any more tricks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they really wanted to take action, there would have been more than one Ancestor stepping out of the depths of the homeland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the other Great Ancestors remained as icy as a Devil Mountain, wordlessly standing at the brink of the homeland, all while emitting indescribable intimidation that left all suffocating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Trouble me? Are you even capable of doing that, though?&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Changge faintly grinned, his expression completely unbothered and casual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, not only were Jia Nan and the rest stunned, but even the nearby Eternal Overcast Beings were totally stupefied, feeling extremely anxious and dismayed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Close to being gods, the Six Great Ancestors were unrivalled beings that created Eternal Overcast. No one dared to defy them. In the eyes of the Eternal Overcast Beings, Gu Changge&#8217;s actions were insane and inconceivable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young man, are you provoking us?&#8221; With that, the Great Ancestor that stepped out from the Eternal Overcast homeland revealed a chilly expression. He never expected Gu Changge to mock and provoke them right in front of all Eternal Overcast Beings, as if he had not the slightest respect for them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, frightening grey mists violently surged from the depths of the homeland as if they were a raging tsunami. Engulfing the sky with its uncontrollable, relentless current, it was about to consume everything in existence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, Gu Changge&#8217;s words angered them. In their whole undying lives, this is the first time being provoked by a person, and a young one at that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Terrifying auras gushed into existence while the land and void were collapsing, as if the depths of Eternal Overcast fell into eternal silence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, all Eternal Overcast Beings trembled intensely, feeling the urge to kneel down as fear seeped into their souls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I shall teach you of reverence today!&#8221; With a glacial glare, the Great Ancestor drew his giant palm covered in grey hair towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the other Great Ancestor who spoke earlier, too, drew his hands. One after another, Divine Chains that were as massive as mountains appeared behind his body, penetrating the sky and shattering all Daos, as if they were sharp arrows that were to be shot through Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of going for the fatal blow, the Great Ancestors merely wanted to intimidate Gu Changge and make him realise that they were the true dominators of this world. After all, they still needed Gu Changge to forge the Reincarnation Platform, so they couldn&#8217;t afford to kill him now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the depths of the silent, desolate Eternal Overcast homeland, all of the Six Great Ancestors revealed themselves. Two of them then declared their intention to teach Gu Changge a lesson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a sight left all Eternal Overcast Beings shaking violently. After all, the Six Great Ancestors were unequalled beings who created and nurtured everyone of the Eternal Overcast. They were undying beings who coexisted with time itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Took the words right out of my mouth. Given that the Eternal Overcast is at the brink of total withering, I believe you old things won&#8217;t live for much longer.&#8221; Unaffected by the intimidation, Gu Changge retained his subtle smile and straightforwardly exposed the truth which the Six Great Ancestors had been hiding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, those words were not spoken baselessly. The last few days, he had figured out the source of the Yin Energy within Eternal Overcast, which turned out to be the mysterious homeland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Six Great Ancestors must have exited seclusion because of a matter that threatened their life, which was why they were so attentive to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge spoke, the figure of an ancient world occurred behind him, harbouring unlimited power that then burst and deflected all the attacks coming his way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What!?&#8221; Upon Gu Changge&#8217;s statement, the Eternal Overcast Beings were dumbfounded, widening their eyes in incredulity. [The Six Great Ancestors won&#8217;t live for long?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young man, mind your words. We are invincible beings that coexist with the River of Time itself, and we are as durable as the world. How can we possibly die?&#8221; The faces of the other Great Ancestors that remained still within the homeland grew cold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn&#8217;t know how Gu Changge reached such a conclusion, but they would never allow the secrets of the depth of the homeland to be exposed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as the water of the ancient wells continued to flow, they would never die. Even if they received fatal injuries, their Life Force waned, or their bodies were disintegrated, they needed only to consume the water from the wells and they would be restored to their intact state. Such was the secret to their undying state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems like I am right. The Source Relic of Eternal Overcast is indeed hidden in that homeland, and it also created you,&#8221; Gu Changge said with a knowing grin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, he no longer had to hide his true intentions. Ever since he arrived at the Eternal Overcast, he never had the intention to help its people forge the Reincarnation Platform. Since the origins of the Eternal Overcast has been found, there was no longer a need for him to go the extra mile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you implying?&#8221; The Ancestor that stepped out of the homeland furrowed his brows, feeling a surge of distress in his heart, as if he and his peers had underestimated Gu Changge&#8217;s audacity and intention.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You old relics seriously pique my interest. Now, even I am curious what else is hidden underneath that homeland of yours,&#8221; Gu Changge blandly noted, withdrawing the smile on his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, he stepped forward. His terrorising aura swept down, engulfing the entire Eternal Overcast, which left the surrounding stars shattering. Unable to bear such an aura, even the formidable cultivators of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom coughed up blood before their bodies blew up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Does he plan on attacking the Great Ancestors?&#8221; Seeing that, Jia Nan was frantic with shock and disbelief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she was still young, she was highly knowledgeable about the Six Great Ancestors and she understood that they were truly undying beings that coexisted with time itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge&#8217;s strength was immeasurable, he might ultimately die despite his capability to rival the Six Great Ancestors. Such was the unchangeable truth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young man, what are you doing?&#8221; The faces of the Six Great Ancestors drastically changed. They never expected that Gu Changge would actually attack them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge stepped out, he simultaneously drew his hand, intending to disperse the grey mists in front of him. As a result, the depths of the Eternal Overcast homeland was instantaneously destroyed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, without concealing his own aura, Gu Changge swept his palm forward and everything shook before falling apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the surrounding Dao and Principles were broken, as the land fractured. The grey mists instantly vanished, leaving all Eternal Overcast Beings to shiver in absolute dread.</span></p>

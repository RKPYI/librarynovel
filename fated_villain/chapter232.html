      <h4>
        Chapter 232-1: The fish finally took the bait, The Immortal from the
        Upper Realm is suspected to have fallen into the Netherland Heavenly
        Pond (1)
      </h4>
      <p>Hearing this, Gu Changge looked surprised.</p>
      <p>
        "Letting you go is not impossible. But now‚Äôs not the time, though it
        won't be long‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" He said casually, with disapproval in his words.
      </p>
      <p>
        However it was hearing these words that made the chill on Jiang Chuchu's
        back even more dense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Didn‚Äôt that mean that the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor was
        probably found by Gu Changge? Was that why he was so confident that this
        matter would be resolved soon?
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Jiang Chuchu‚Äôs worry grew dense.</p>
      <p>
        In any case, as the Holy Maiden of the Human Ancestor Hall, she was born
        in opposition to Gu Changge and could not possibly join forces with him.
      </p>
      <p>Although Gu Changge's words made her Dao heart waver just now.</p>
      <p>
        "You are underestimating the means of the Human Ancestor, Gu Changge,
        even if you have the upper hand now, but with the emergence of the Human
        Ancestor's many tricks, everything would be reduced to nothing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chu Chu looked at him and said calmly, "As for letting me go? I do
        not believe that you will be so kind, in the end you will certainly find
        a way to kill me, so that your true identity would not get exposed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words, Gu Changge faintly froze, as if he did not expect her to
        say this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he sighed and said, "Why do you believe in me so much? So what if I
        let you leave here? Since you don't believe me, then I will let you
        leave now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ But at most, I can only let you leave for a while."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you are obedient, then I can consider letting you out a little more
        in the future."
      </p>
      <p>He looked like he was seriously thinking.</p>
      <p>"What you said is true?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu smiled a little surprised, she was just trying it out, but
        she didn't expect Gu Changge to really agree.
      </p>
      <p>
        This suddenly caused an inexplicable emotion to arise in her heart‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
        Like guilt, and confusion, it was very complicated.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, Jiang Chuchu suddenly felt the scene blur before her
        eyes, she had left Gu Chang Ge's Inner World and appeared in an ancient
        and tall pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside, the sky was dark and the moon was hidden and the stars were
        visible.
      </p>
      <p>"The aura here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not in the Upper Realm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's expression changed slightly, and she immediately noticed
        the abnormality of the rules of heaven and earth here.
      </p>
      <p>This made her heart sink down.</p>
      <p>
        Since Gu Changge had already come to the Lower Realm, that meant that
        her speculation had probably become a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The location of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor had already been
        found by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"Well? I didn't lie to you, did I?"</p>
      <p>
        "If you call me Master this time, maybe I will let you stay in the
        outside world a little longer‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge looked at her with a somewhat intriguing expression.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Since Gu Changge dared to let herself out, he must have the certainty
        and strength to not be afraid of her sudden escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        So thinking about this, Jiang Chuchu's expression was extraordinarily
        calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, it seems that you have already left the Upper Realm and
        found the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor?"
      </p>
      <p>She opened her mouth to speak.</p>
      <p>
        While sweeping over the magnificent buildings in front of her, it was
        evident that the location where she was now seemed to be in an ancient
        city.
      </p>
      <p>As for which realm it was.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu had no way of knowing, Gu Changge had trapped her in the
        Inner World for so long that she didn't even know how Gu Changge
        actually came here, how many means had been set up, etc.
      </p>
      <p>This made Jiang Chuchu's heart more and more uneasy.</p>
      <p>
        As the Holy Maiden of the Human Ancestor Hall, she saw the reincarnation
        of the Human Ancestor in crisis at this time, but she could hardly do
        anything to stop it from happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of emotion was like a thorn in her heart, which made her feel
        painful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the dark, it was as if a voice was telling her to stop all this, to
        stop Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I really don't know how the Human Ancestor Hall brainwashed you, to
        offend me for the Human Ancestor, is it worth it?" Vissit nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm
        for ùíèew ùíèovels
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at her with a calm expression, smiled casually, and
        stood on this pavilion with his hands on his back.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a crimson fluttering overcoat, and aura like the abyssal sea that
        was so deep that made her heart palpitate.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, his hand slowly pointed across the frontier in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed to be meaningful.</p>
      <p>
        "See? This world, all of it is already under my control, tell me, how
        else can the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor escape?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The tone of his voice was confident and he was overlooking it with
        contempt.
      </p>
      <p>He didn‚Äôt even care about the Human Ancestor.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words of Gu Changge, Jiang Chuchu's face also paled
        slightly.
      </p>
      <p>But she secretly gritted her teeth.</p>
      <p>
        The faint fluctuations of ancient runes swept through her palms, turning
        into a strange aura and slowly dissipated in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing she could do now was to use the secret method of the
        Human Ancestor Hall, so that the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor
        could sense her presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        She believed that as long as the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor had
        awakened some of his previous memories, he would be able to discern his
        current dangerous situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        More or less, it could be a little helpful to the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, today I let you out to get some air, the time is almost up,
        otherwise, if you secretly did something to spoil my plan, then that
        would not be good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge at this time, also seemed like he hadn‚Äôt noticed Jiang
        Chuchu‚Äôs action as well, and was still speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that the smile at the corner of his mouth looked a little
        deeper.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed that this fish was finally hooked.</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        As soon as Jiang Chuchu heard that her face turned a little pale, her
        secret movements almost stalled.
      </p>
      <p>But he also didn‚Äôt wait for her to speak.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge directly waved his hand, and with a buzz, cracks appeared in
        the void in front of her once again and Jiang Chuchu's figure
        disappeared, returning to the Inner World once again.
      </p>
      <p>She knew it was useless to resist.</p>
      <p>So she didn't choose to resist either.</p>
      <p>
        She already did not know how terrifying Gu Changge's true strength was,
        Jiang Chuchu's perception had always been strong, so she could feel that
        palpitating powerless feeling of despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now her only hope was that the secret fluctuations she just transmitted
        could be detected by the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the same Human Ancestor Hall‚Äôs inheritance, even if they were far
        apart, they should have sensed it.
      </p>
      <p>"It wasted so much of my words, but it seems to be very effective."</p>
      <p>
        After throwing Jiang Chuchu back in the Inner World, Gu Changge couldn't
        help but reveal an intriguing look.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, his cultivation had already broken through
        to the peak of the Sacred Realm, and earlier, he had already exchanged
        his Luck points for a total of 60 pieces of transcendental bones,
        including the entire spine of the Great Dragon, Skull Cap bones, Limbs
        and Hand bones, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under all kinds of means and abilities, the Great Sacred realm
        cultivator might not even be his opponent.
      </p>
      <p>Not to mention that he had many powerful cards.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was smart and naturally would not make unnecessary
        resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Gu Changge had already heard the system's prompting
        voice when he shook her Dao heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang, the Son of Luck, had his Luck points reduced as a result.
      </p>
      <p>But then Jiang Chuchu's reaction was a bit surprising to him.</p>
      <p>
        "It seems that the reverence for the Human Ancestor is too deeply
        rooted, this is only the reincarnated body‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's expression was tinged with a different color.</p>
      <p>
        This also confirmed his suspicion that the Human Ancestor Hall's methods
        were indeed not rightful.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now the evidence is also available, and the timing is almost right,
        even if this Jiang Yang is more cautious, he has to fall for it at this
        time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled.</p>
      <p>
        The first plan was to let Jiang Chuchu show up, so as to trick Jiang
        Yang over, but if he said it directly, Jiang Chuchu would definitely not
        agree.
      </p>
      <p>So he thought of such a method.</p>
      <p>
        The next thing, Gu Changge would go to the Netherland Heavenly Pond
        according to the information he had received earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        He knew that there was an arrangement by the Human Ancestor there, but
        didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than the Immortal Lun Holy Sect, the Netherland Heavenly Pond was
        definitely the place Jiang Yang wanted to go the most.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time came, if he encountered danger, he would definitely have
        to flee to that place.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge could just go there first and lay down his means.</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong definitely couldn't kill Jiang Yang, but it should be no
        problem to seriously injure Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to make Jiang Yang's Luck points fall to the lowest value, Gu
        Changge still had to find a way to make the Daughter of Luck, Yaoyao,
        and Jiang Yang really break up.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, when he left the Immortal Lun Sect and gave those words to
        Yaoyao, he was already setting up a plan.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 232-2: The fish finally took the bait, The Immortal from the
        Upper Realm is suspected to have fallen into the Netherland Heavenly
        Pond (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        On the other hand, after Jiang Chuchu secretly performed the secret
        technique of the Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>Millions of miles away, in the middle of the Immortal Lun Sect.</p>
      <p>Inside the cave, the strange fluctuations in the void were sensed.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang, who was sitting with his eyes closed, snapped open his eyes,
        in which there was a flash of brilliant light.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked at the letter set down on the stone table, and the corners of
        his mouth could not help but reveal a bashful smile.
      </p>
      <p>"Surprisingly, it is the aura of this secret art‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        "Is it finally here? Wouldn't it have been better to reveal the aura
        earlier, instead of waiting until now."
      </p>
      <p>
        About the secret technique of the Human Ancestor Hall, he naturally
        couldn't be any more clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because no one other than the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall knew this
        secret technique, and within the Heavenly Star Realm, this kind of aura
        was like the best proof of the identity of the Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>So this time he did not suspect again.</p>
      <p>
        As for why the other party did not reveal his breath last time, Jiang
        Yang thought about it and felt that it should be because he was too
        cautious.
      </p>
      <p>This made him somewhat satisfied.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang then gave a simple order as he called on the Supreme Elder
        Zhao Yi, looking relaxed he headed outside the Immortal Lun Sect to rush
        to the agreed location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the Human Ancestor Hall intervened in the Heavenly Star Realm, then
        the next steps would be much easier.
      </p>
      <p>Everything was back under his control.</p>
      <p>
        As for Gu Changge, who had been away from the Immortal Lun Sect for
        several days, he no longer paid any attention. In a place like the
        Netherland Heavenly Pond, as long as he went there, he wouldn‚Äôt be able
        to come back.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        "Grandma, what exactly is the Netherland Heavenly Pond? Master left four
        days ago, and there‚Äôs still no news of his return."
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, at the Immortal Lun Sect's mountain gate there, a
        small figure, with black jewel-like flawless clear eyes, revealed
        uneasiness.
      </p>
      <p>It was Yaoyao.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she was looking outside with a look of expectation and
        worry, wanting to watch the Master come back from the sky.
      </p>
      <p>But for several days in a row, no one was seen.</p>
      <p>
        Although she thought that the Master was so powerful, the possibility of
        an accident was unlikely, but who could have predicted it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, that day when the Master left, the words that he said were
        clearly like his last words to arrange things after his death.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Netherland Heavenly Pond‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ That seems to be a very dangerous place,
        more frightening than some life forbidden areas‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ However, don't worry,
        your Master has even destroyed the Sacred Mountains at will, that little
        danger of the Netherland Heavenly Pond is as simple as walking on flat
        ground for him."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the silver haired granny said comfortingly, but in her
        heart she was actually as worried as Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>Since, even the Immortal was cautious.</p>
      <p>
        So the danger of the Netherland Heavenly Pond needed no further
        explanation.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        And now Gu Changge was not around, and now she and Yaoyao both knew in
        their hearts that Jiang Yang was taken over by someone, it was just that
        they had not yet torn their faces off.
      </p>
      <p>
        From time to time, Jiang Yang appeared beside the two of them to show
        concern.
      </p>
      <p>This made them even more uneasy.</p>
      <p>
        The kind of mysterious power in Yaoyao's body was not under her control.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Jiang Yang really intended to be detrimental to them, the two of them
        would not be able to resist at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Grandma, do you think that Jiang Yang deliberately told Master, just to
        cause Master to be buried there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao said with a worried face, afraid of Gu Changge's accident, if the
        Master was really gone, then what would she do in the future?
      </p>
      <p>
        Would she have to do what her Master explained, go to Jiang Yang, and
        pretend not to know anything about him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If my Master encounters any accident, Yaoyao will not let Jiang Yang
        go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        She said softly, and there was a flash of Peach blossom light in the
        middle of her eyebrow.
      </p>
      <p>And several days passed in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
      <p>Netherland Heavenly Pond, as its name suggested.</p>
      <p>
        This was a vast and boundless clear Heavenly Pond, located on the top of
        a Divine Mountain, covering a radius of nearly 8,000 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, the light and shadow were gorgeous, with layers upon layers
        of mists lingering, making it appear ethereal and sacred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going down this divine mountain, one could see all kinds of laws, veins
        and divine patterns, as if they were natural, and densely distributed in
        all directions of the mountain.
      </p>
      <p>It was towering and ancient, giving people a terrifying pressure.</p>
      <p>
        In a deeper place, there was also a pervading Chaotic aura, like a land
        of open sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was rumored that there was an invincible creature from the beginning
        of time, who had since ascended from here to the Upper Realm. Later
        generations even said that this creature had become an Immortal and was
        so powerful that it was unknowable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under all kinds of rumors, Netherland Heavenly Pond was considered
        extremely mysterious.
      </p>
      <p>
        What was more, some people even said that the Netherland Heavenly Realm
        contained unparalleled Immortal power, which could make people
        transcend.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the history of the Heavenly Star Realm, almost every year,
        cultivators with very little lifespans rushed to this place to
        transcend, intending to prolong their lifespan and live another life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, all the cultivators who came, no matter what their
        cultivation level was, all of them ended up bleeding outside the
        Heavenly Pond, and they couldn't get one step closer at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people even said that there were ancient beings living in it, one
        word could break the sky, and a single sentence could break the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In the past few days, there have always been earth-shattering movements
        in the Heavenly Pond‚Ä¶ and it was also accompanied by dazzling green
        clouds. What happened?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that there is an Immortal in this Heavenly Pond? It's a
        pity that with our cultivation base, we can't even get close." ùí©ewW
        ùíèovels updùíÇtes on nov/ùíÜl/b(i)ùíè(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        On the mountain far away from the Heavenly Pond, there were many
        cultivators and creatures from the Heavenly Realm gathering here.
      </p>
      <p>They looked at this place in shock.</p>
      <p>
        The thick chaotic air rolled, accompanied by the dazzling green clouds,
        the brilliance of the sky shone all over the place, and faintly,
        everyone also heard the wonderful sound when the world opened up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although they were far apart, many people had made breakthroughs under
        this voice, and their cultivation had improved in a large arc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators who missed these Dao sounds had their guts turning
        green with remorse.

      <p>
        So in the past few days, the area around the Netherland Heavenly Pond
        has become very lively.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        There were chariots, warships, and flying boats rolling all over the
        sky, making shocking sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many powerful cultivators had arrived, but those without strength could
        only be on the outermost side, and they couldn't even get close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some extremely powerful forces came with divine artifacts, but in the
        end, they were only close to the outermost part of the Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, some fluctuations came, which caused everyone's blood to
        tumble, almost vomited blood, and suffered serious injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There is a change here. It is said that even the Immortal who is in the
        Immortal Lun Sect is here. A few days ago, someone saw a golden divine
        light from the void coming through here, just like the Dao of heaven and
        earth‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "That posture was too scary. A road appeared directly, tore everything
        apart, and extended into the depths of the Heavenly Pond. The figure
        above seemed to be the mysterious Immortal from the Upper Realm."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Really? It seems that what appeared in the Netherland Heavenly Pond
        this time is not simple. Even the Immortal was disturbed‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Yeah, it can‚Äôt be wrong."</p>
      <p>
        "At that time, there seemed to be an earth-shattering battle that broke
        out. The sound was so terrifying, and even if it was so far away it
        still made my legs feel weak."
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators were talking about the big things that happened here
        these days.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, the matter of the Immortal attracted countless people's
        attention.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        However, just as all the cultivators were discussing, from the depths of
        Heavenly Pond something suddenly rushed to the sky with blood.
      </p>
      <p>There seemed to be an accident there.</p>
      <p>
        There were terrifying roars and slaughtering sounds, which spread
        outside.
      </p>
      <p>Faintly, everyone saw the place shrouded in fog.</p>
      <p>
        A figure shrouded in Immortality was fighting with a vague invincible
        existence, with a terrifying momentum, and when he raised his hand,
        there were all kinds of laws and rules, as if it could overturn
        everything in the radius of ten thousand miles!
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, everyone's eyes widened when they saw the shocking scene.
      </p>
      <p>Even their scalp went numb!</p>
      <p>
        The blood almost solidified, and their soul trembled to the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>Then the blood light broke through the sky!</p>
      <p>The figure of the Immortal exploded from it, and tore apart.</p>
      <p>There was a monstrous bloody aura coming from that place.</p>
      <p>"This‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"Even the Immortal has fallen into it‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"How can that be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        "This Heavenly Pond is too dangerous, even the Immortal is dead, we have
        to leave, we can't stay here any longer‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        In response, everyone's spirits were trembling, and they were terrified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon the news of the mysterious Immortal rushing to the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond and his suspected fall caused a sensation in the entire
        Heavenly Domain, causing an earthquake-like terrifying wave.

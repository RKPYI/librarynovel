          forces in the Upper Realm. Many experts brought forbidden weapons and
          many old monsters who have not appeared in tens of millions of years
          had turned up. All of them wanted to hunt down the Demoness. Though
          many did not participate in the Demon Slaying Event, all of them were
          still keeping close tabs on the event. As soon as they knew the
          Demoness had appeared and stepped into the Divine City, they appeared
          in the sky and watched from above. From the above, they witnessed the
          pillars of light that reached the sky, followed by thick mist that
          enveloped heavens and earth. </span

          time. After all, not even the scene before the creation of the world
          could be seen clearly. Even those with the strongest Foreseeing Eyes
          hardly saw anything, all they could feel was the faint majestic
          fluctuations that came from the ground below. It was as if powerful
          war drums were sounded in all directions. It was the sound of war and
          roars. The world seemed to have inverted, the universe turned upside
          down as the sun and the moon lost their light, Even big stars in the
          sky trembled and fell, one by one.

          emitted bright rays of light in all directions. They then turned into
          various godly weapons. Those were the weapons from the numerous great
          experts.

          suns. They were so numerous, they seemed to form a rumbling river,
          which could easily shatter stars with just one hit. Despite this, they
          all crackled and exploded.

          though the many from the Immortal Sects and Ancient Royal Family tried
          to disperse the fog, it was all in vain. It was still extremely
          difficult for them to have a clear view of the scene. Thus, they could
          only wait for the result of the battle. The more they waited, the more
          uneasy they felt.

          the sky and a scene appeared in the distance. Blood rained down from
          the sky as everyone screamed. A blood-red lotus took root in the void
          and bloomed brilliantly, as gigantic stars fell, one by one.

          apart. Many were distraught and cried out of fear. It was a sign that
          those experts that went had fallen. This scene was reflected in all
          directions, all through the Upper Realm. As many snapped back to
          reality, their faces became extremely pale and their hearts trembled
          with fear. It was obvious the Demon Slaying Event didn’t go well.

          figures, with dishevelled hair and petrified faces covered in blood,
          continuously rushed out of the Divine City to open a Space Tunnel in
          an attempt to escape.

          >Many supreme beings from powerful forces had died tragically in this
          battle. Their bodies and souls were destroyed, along with their
          artifacts. The once glorious ancient Divine City with clouds that
          soared into the sky and a silver waterfall that hung upside down, was
          reduced to a cemetery in just one day.

          marks left behind by the battle could still be seen in some areas. If
          a weak cultivator got too close to this scene, they would be killed by
          the mere remnant energy from the battle. Even the blood from the
          corpses of these powerful cultivators carried unimaginable divine
          power.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, many onlookers had also realised that the battleground was
          cleared of any life. Thus, they speculated that the Demoness most
          likely had already left the place. Just from this aftermath, one could
          only imagine the cruelty and horror of the battle. The Demoness had
          disappeared and no one knew of her whereabouts.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          old monsters who came to take the Demoness’s flesh and blood, had also
          died as a result of their greed. The scene could be described as
          tragic, with not even a single living being in sight.</span

          Thus, to know what happened during the battle, one could only rely on

          problem was the eye of the formation. The Demoness had tried to rush
          out of the formation. It had resulted in a manpower shortage at the
          eye of the formation, which made it difficult for everyone to maintain
          it. Otherwise, such a tragic scene wouldn’t have occurred. This means
          that it was all just a big mistake in how they assigned people.

          many were discussing about what had happened. Their hearts were filled
          with trepidation as they had a feeling that the Demoness was still
          alive. Furthermore, it was difficult to follow her trail and no one
          knew her whereabouts. If she suddenly appeared right now, it would
          cause another devastating disaster.

          were made up of both men and women, who were young and filled with
          vigour. They were all dressed uniformly, it was obvious that they were
          all from a certain sect. They had heard about what happened in the
          Divine City and felt shocked and emotional. This incident was too far
          from them. After all, with their level of cultivation, they weren’t
          even qualified to watch the battle as onlookers. Furthermore, experts
          and old monsters who were in unfathomable cultivation levels, who had
          lived for tens of millions of years, still tragically died.

          and admiration naturally filled their faces but they also couldn’t
          help but sigh and express regret through their words. Although Gu
          Changge was very strong, he was still a youth. Compared to those old
          monsters, he was far too inexperienced.

          generation admire him even more. To participate in the event, one not
          only needed strength but also unprecedented courage. This time, in the
          entire Divine City, how many had managed to escape?

          said to have fought against the Demoness even though their Life Force
          was being absorbed. If that was the case, what were their chances of
          winning the battle?

          dangerously low. However, the Immortal Gu Family had not released any
          news that his Soul Lamp had been extinguished. Thus, he still had a
          chance. Of course, some suspected that the Immortal Gu Family had
          hidden the news as they couldn’t accept the fact that Gu Changge was
          gone. After all, Gu Changge’s ability could be said to be so
          overwhelming that he would illuminate an entire golden age. From the
          past till the present, who was on par with him?

          opinions. Furthermore, there were countless forces in the Upper Realm
          that paid close attention to this matter. If Gu Changge didn’t die, he
          would definitely stand at the peak. If the Celestial Gate opened
          allowing for the Immortal Path to be crossed, he would definitely be
          an Immortal.</span

          improved rapidly. However, as the Successor of the Demonic Arts, she
          carried the hatred from the past misdeeds of the Organisation of
          Demonic Arts, such as the murders of many young prodigies, including
          the Successors of the White Tiger Clan and Sky Emperor Mountain. All
          of these murders were pinned on her. Thus, she had to be careful to
          avoid those who wanted to kill her for revenge.</span

          >Despite this, it puzzled Su Qingge that everyone now paid less
          attention to the Successors of the Demonic Arts than before. This was
          because what she did was merely a drop in the ocean, as compared to
          the work of the organisation at its prime. Over time, Successors of
          Demon Arts appeared at different corners of the world, but everyone
          thought that they were powerless and paid less attention to them.

          meticulous in the way he does things. It is indeed very difficult for
          anyone in this world to hurt him.] Su Qingge sighed, as she couldn’t
          help but recall what happened at the Immortal Academy. Back then, she
          almost exposed her identity, but Gu Changge still spoke to her in a
          kind and worried manner. She didn’t know how he would think and treat
          her if he found out that she was the Successor of Demonic Arts.

          large waves erupted and the black seawater, which was as heavy as

          died at the hands of that Demoness, I would’ve felt a little
          regretful.” The elegant young man who wore a blue robe, with an
          upright figure and ink-like hair said.

          covered in confidence and calmness. As he blinked, there were wisps of
          divine light in his pupils and his aura was so strong that it could be
          felt. His arms were put behind his back as he stood on the ancient
          warship. As he spoke, he shook his head and gazed at the banks of the
          Boundary Marker Sea. As long as they crossed this, they would reach
          the frontier of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.

          this time is caused by the Demoness. The Demoness might have seized
          this opportunity to talk terms with him. After all, according to the
          rumours of what happened, the Demoness seems to be sane.” An old man
          appeared behind the elegant young man and reported with
          congratulations.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“The probability of that happening is not big, but since there is
          this possibility, there are naturally other possibilities as well.
          Maybe Gu Changge has actually been killed by the Demoness? Just that
          the Immortal Gu Family is unable to accept this fact.” The elegant
          young man shook his head slightly and said. When he mentioned Gu
          Changge, he squinted his eyes to hide his deep hatred for him.
          Although he hoped that Gu Changge had died at the hands of the
          Demoness, he also hoped that Gu Changge died in his hands instead. He
          vividly remembered what happened back then, how the Vermilion Bird
          Empire was wiped out.</span

          to rely on others. He was just a prince of a small ancient country. In
          other words, just a nobody. Now, he was the Young Sect Master of
          Supreme Cave Heaven. At just three hundred plus years old, he reached
          the Sacred Emperor Realm and held immense power. Even a veteran Sacred
          Emperor Realm expert wouldn’t be his match.

          in the Upper Realm who can steal your limelight.”

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The elegant young man was Chu Hao. After he heard this, the old man
          behind him couldn’t help but smile as he congratulated Chu Hao. This
          time, Supreme Cave Heaven was being reborn again, with the purpose of
          defeating the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and searching for the
          Supreme Dao Diagram, which was lost back then. Another important thing
          was to make Chu Hao famous. To be a Sacred Emperor Realm expert at
          such a young age, his talent could be said to be one in a century.

          Crowns, the Phoenix Lady, the Saintess of Mortal Palace and the
          Successor of Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, could hardly guarantee that
          they could breakthrough this realm at just a few hundred years old.
          Therefore, Chu Hao was extremely proud of his own ability. However,
          the monster, Gu Changge, who was hundreds of years younger than him,
          had a cultivation level that was comparable to his. In comparison to
          Gu Changge, others would feel that Chu Hao was not even worth
          mentioning. If it was someone else, perhaps Chu Hao would have just
          laughed it off, without much care. However, it just had to be his
          biggest enemy, Gu Changge.

          >At that moment, there was a weird sound, like some kind of instrument
          that whizzed between the sky and the earth, mixed with a terrifying
          aura. The sea within a radius of a hundred thousand kilometres set off
          terrifying ripples which reached the sky. However, this voice could
          only be heard clearly by those who had a high cultivation level. Those
          who had a slightly lower cultivation could only shudder in their
          hearts, as if an aura had swept across to take away their souls.

          maintain his expression. As he stared straight at the distant
          territory. He saw a red beacon, which swept forward from the distant
          sea with an astonishing momentum. It gathered between the heavens and
          the earth, and seemed as though it would rush out of the territory.

          >Chu Hao used his Heaven Peering Eye to see the object that lay there.
          It was a small black flask. The image of it was very blurry and
          difficult to see. Wisps of black light flowed around it, like it was a
          jet-black sun. The nearby light was entirely swallowed and absorbed by
          it. Those red lights were the Life Forces that had been floating about
          in the Boundary Marker Sea for countless years. Although they were
          rare, they were actually scattered everywhere.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Who exactly is this person who dares to collect Life Forces from
          here?” Chu Hao’s eyebrows furrowed tightly as a chill hit him. He
          could feel that the flask was extremely evil as it swallowed the red
          lights. He didn’t dare to take another look.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, his focus shifted to the bottom of the black flask. A
          majestic black figure stood tall and held onto a spear, as if it was
          waiting for the black flask that was high in the sky. However, Chu Hao
          felt the terror from that black figure. He didn’t dare to take another
          look and quickly withdrew his gaze.

          >“What’s important now is to find the Supreme Dao Diagram.” Chu Hao
          reminded everyone. After all, the origin of Supreme Cave Heaven was
          related to the Supreme Dao Diagram. However, for some reason, it was
          lost in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.

          inside a Bronze Palace that could nourish one&#8217;s soul, red balls
          of light and rays of light intertwined together. They turned into a
          majestic aura that could nourish one&#8217;s soul and heal one&#8217;s
          body. Currently, they were gathered in a pool. In the pool was a
          Divine Spring, which also produces Immortal Mist, creating a unique
          aura as though this was the Celestial Realm.

          emerged from within the pool as her strands of black hair stuck
          together. Her skin was delicate and fair, and her face was the size of
          a palm. Her facial features were exquisite, with no flaws.

          glanced at the figure at the palace doors gently and dazedly, afraid
          that he would leave her line of sight. In fact, this was the reason
          she couldn’t help but come out of the pool to chase after him.

          into the pool with only her eyes exposed, as if she was afraid that Gu
          Changge would leave her when she didn’t look. Her sight remained the
          same as before, no matter what she saw, it remained blurry. She could
          only feel how comfortable she was in the pool as whatever pain and
          injuries she had, all faded away rapidly.

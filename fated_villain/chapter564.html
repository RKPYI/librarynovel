          seem an issue to their Family on the surface, but in reality, it was
          actually a major matter concerning the security of the entire Upper

          >As a Human Ancestor, Ji Shengchu possessed astounding abilities.
          Despite being trapped in Kun Mountain for countless epochs, he managed
          to persevere without succumbing to death. If he could successfully
          escape Kun Mountain, he was undoubtedly capable of resolving the
          Eternal Overcast issue.</span

          >Moreover, Ji Shengchu once lent his aid to numerous Forces. Given his
          past contributions, no one could possibly decline Gu Changge’s
          invitation to gather the younger generation together and strategize
          the rescue of Ji Shengchu. After all, it was an effort to ensure the
          safety of the Upper Realm.</span

          and quickly went off to make the necessary arrangements. Many
          prodigies from different Forces were currently gathered in Dark Kun
          City. She was quite confident that no one would dare to ignore Gu
          Changge’s invitation, even the Young War Immortal and his companions
          who had just been attacked by assassins.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge was actually deeply perplexed as to why Gu Changge would
          give the order to have the Young War Immortal assassinated. As the
          Successor of Demonic Arts, that should have been her responsibility to
          prevent her true identity from being revealed.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Based on Gu Changge&#8217;s character, it was unlikely for him to
          engage in pointless actions. Therefore, it could be inferred that the
          assassination of the Young War Immortal was carried out with a
          specific intention. However, despite pondering over it, Su Qingge was
          unable to figure out the reason behind it.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Could it be related to the peculiar behavior the Young War Immortal
          exhibited during the Divine Rock Conference?] Since Su Qingge was
          currently living the identity of Ji Qingxuan, she was unsure of how to
          approach the matter.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Young Master, I happened to overhear the conversation between you
          and Yin Mei…” Su Qingge spoke cautiously, carefully selecting her
          words. In truth, she did not eavesdrop but rather deduced the
          information through astute analysis and was certain it was Gu Changge
          who dispatched an assassin to eliminate the Young War Immortal.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Oh, which part did you hear?” Gu Changge deliberately asked with
          feigned curiosity, despite already knowing the answer.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I heard that you ordered for the Young War Immortal to be
          assassinated. Rest assured though, I won’t breathe a word of it to
          anyone,” Su Qingge quickly promised, seemingly eager to alleviate any
          doubts or misgivings Gu Changge may have had.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What about it?” Gu Changge smiled faintly. “Are you wondering why I
          wish to end his life?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Confusion appeared on Su Qingge’s lovely face as she nodded and said,
          “Yes.”</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The smile on Gu Changge’s smile faded as he calmly stated, “I wish to
          eliminate him because he possesses knowledge that he shouldn’t.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Knowledge that he shouldn’t have known?” Su Qingge shuddered
          involuntarily. A chill ran down her spine as she gazed into his serene
          face, sensing that there was more to his statement.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[The Young War Immortal possesses knowledge that he shouldn’t have
          known? Is he talking about my true identity as the Successor of
          Demonic Arts? Could it possibly be something else?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the prominent figure among the younger generation in the Upper
          Realm, Gu Changge chose to cover up her identity as the Successor of
          Demonic Arts rather than taking her life upon discovering her true
          identity. Su Qingge was an intelligent individual. She could not
          fathom any other explanation except for this possibility.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If Gu Changge was already aware of her true identity, then it was
          likely that he also knew that she had swapped identities with Ji
          Qingxuan and chose to feign ignorance. As Su Qingge pondered over
          these possibilities, her thoughts became jumbled and her emotions were
          in turmoil.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“So, you knew everything already, Young Master…” After a moment of
          silence, Su Qingge regained her composure and spoke with a slight
          tremble in her voice. The shocking truths she had discovered during
          her meeting with Gu Changge today had left her reeling, causing her to
          question the purpose of her pretense all this while.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What do you mean?” Gu Changge asked with a faint smile.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I recall you once said that if you knew the real identity of the
          Successor of Demonic Arts, you would definitely not allow them to
          remain in the world,” Su Qingge’s eyes were tinged with red, and her
          voice was quivering.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She recalled a moment where she had almost revealed her true identity
          as the Successor of Demonic Arts back at the Immortal Academy. Despite
          facing doubt and suspicion from the Elders, Gu Changge had chosen to
          believe in her without any reason. From then on, she decided to keep
          her identity hidden forever, even in death, as she couldn’t bear to
          see the disappointment on Gu Changge&#8217;s face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To her surprise, Gu Changge not only uncovered the truth but also
          took it upon himself to conceal any evidence that could expose her
          true identity. This act of compassion had gone beyond mere
          kindness.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing those words, Gu Changge shook his head. He could sense
          that Su Qingge was about to come clean with him. Given her sharp
          intellect, he knew she could easily piece together the puzzle of his
          recent assassination attempt on the Young War Immortal. There was no
          longer any point for her to continue hiding the truth of her
          identity.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“So, you still remember what I said…” Gu Changge remained stoic but
          emotion swirled in the depth of his eyes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge dropped her gaze. Her voice was filled with guilt and
          anguish as she apologised, “I’m sorry that I’ve disappointed you.”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At this point, she wasn’t sure if Gu Changge was angry or
          disappointed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Are you hoping that I’ll put an end to you now?” Gu Changge asked
          calmly.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When Su Qingge heard this, her heart was filled with bitterness. At
          the same time, she also felt a sense of relief, as her suspicions had
          proven to be true. Gu Changge had been merely pretending all
          along.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge took a deep breath and composed herself before responding,
          “If you had intended to kill me, you wouldn&#8217;t have kept me in
          your presence for this long.”</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          there are many seeking to end your life? Do you believe that I am any
          different from them?” Gu Changge inquired with great interest. “I
          refrained from killing you previously because you were Ji Qingxuan.
          However, you are Su Qingge now, the Successor of Demonic Arts.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge shook her head, her eyes slightly reddened. She lowered her
          head and spoke with unwavering conviction, “Young Master, you are
          unlike any other. While others may seek to end my life, I know that
          you would not.”</span

          Young Master desire to end my life, I will not object. Meeting my
          demise in your hands may be the most fitting ending for me.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her words were sincere, as years of concealing her true identity had

          Phoenix Lady, the Sky Demon Sovereign, the Young Holy King, and Chosen

          well that they had no valid reasons to turn it down.</span

          Mountain! What a cunning man!” The expressions of Young War Immortal,
          An Xi and others turned sour when they received the invitation letter.
          They had hoped for a moment of peace after surviving the recent
          attack, but it seemed like Gu Changge had other plans in store.</span

          injury, Gu Changge even went above and beyond by arranging for a
          Divine Medicine to be delivered as a gesture of care and concern to
          the Young War Immortal. His gesture was undoubtedly a harsh blow to
          their dignity, causing them great humiliation.</span

          assassination attempt! To think that he would attempt to feign
          kindness by sending me medicine! How utterly despicable.” The Young
          War Immortal’s face darkened despite his usual composure. He clenched
          his fists tightly in anger. His anger caused his injury to worsen and
          trickled from the corner of his mouth.</span

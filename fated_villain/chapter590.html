        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were plenty of cultivators and people gathered outside the walls of the Great Yu Capital. They were all making a huge commotion. Some intentionally rushed out from the Great Yu Capital after receiving the news, and the majority of them were young people. They raised their heads and looked far into the horizon. They were very curious to find out who deserved such great attention from the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span><span id="more-32773"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all the princes and princesses were waiting here. There was even an Imperial Ancestor, who was a True Daoist, along with the rest of the imperial members. Each of these people were able to bring about huge changes to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. A stomp of their feet could cause a huge earthquake. Yet, they have all gathered here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky was surrounded with bright clouds, making it look just like the Celestial Realm. Each of those powerful experts were all waiting respectfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s eldest princess, Yu Feiya and her younger brother, Yu Ming were also in the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Ming looked far away and let out a smile as he whispered to his elder sister, &#8220;Elder sister, this might just be your chance! Gu Changge is suddenly visiting our Great Yu, you have to grab hold of this opportunity, tightly! Previously at Dark Kun City, I heard that you visited him but got shut outside the door. For him to visit our Great Yu this time, there must be important matters to discuss.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty had received news that Gu Changge and the Mortal Palace&#8217;s Saintess would travel to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty to investigate the Eternal Overcast Scourge. As such, they were waiting here early so that they didn&#8217;t show any disrespect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was rational as Gu Changge&#8217;s current status was already comparable with the Head of the Immortal Gu Family. If Emperor Yu wasn&#8217;t busy with important matters, he would be waiting here personally too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing his elder sister ignoring him, Yu Ming didn&#8217;t feel down as he continued to speak, &#8220;I know that elder sister is prideful, but have you ever thought that in a few more years, the father will definitely set up an engagement for you? By then, which young prodigy will be worthy of you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Yu Ming&#8217;s heart, his elder sister was already reaching the suitable age. According to the practice of the imperial family, it was just a matter of time before an engagement happened. In regards to this, the imperial family had always been emotionless. His elder sister was talented and had an unimaginable future. But Emperor Yu was at his prime. Since Yu Feiya and the others were ultimately of age, they would be unable to escape the fate of being a princess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As compared to the other young prodigies, Yu Ming was leaning most towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya remained silent and didn&#8217;t respond to her younger brother&#8217;s nonsense. When she visited Gu Changge previously, it was to ask about the Heavenly Tome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when Gu Changge didn&#8217;t meet with her, she couldn&#8217;t do much and simply returned to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty without heading to Kun Mountain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Yu Ming mentioned didn&#8217;t seem realistic to her. Firstly, she didn&#8217;t hold a good impression of Gu Changge, nor was there any bad impression. They weren&#8217;t familiar with each other, that was all. Secondly, Gu Changge already had an engagement. It was to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yue Mingkong of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, which had a foundation that was beyond the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the eldest princess of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, if her objectives towards Gu Changge were too obvious, it might just offend the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty. In the worst scenario, it might just create a rift between the two Dynasties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yu Ming, don&#8217;t speak of such things. It is fine to be acquainted, but don&#8217;t think of anything else. Gu Changge already has an engagement, how can the prized pearl of the Great Yu possibly be a mistress for him?&#8221; The Imperial Ancestor couldn&#8217;t help opening his eyes and spoke indifferently after hearing Yu Ming&#8217;s statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Ming knew that this Imperial Ancestor doted on his elder sister and wasn&#8217;t going to tolerate any grievances towards her.  Furthermore, marriage was a significant matter. Thus, he just let out a dry laugh and didn&#8217;t continue this topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the members of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty were speaking softly, multiple streams of light flowed out from the remote skies. Flying boats that had celestial mist surrounding them appeared, and instantly travelled across thousands of kilometres, crossing skies in mere moments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flying boats were decorated with the flag of the Mortal Palace, emitting a quaint aura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty didn&#8217;t dare to be snub as they quickly went over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These are the Mortal Palace&#8217;s flying boats? Could it be that the experts from the Mortal Palace are here to observe the Hunting Event?” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That shouldn&#8217;t be. According to history, Mortal Palace has always been detached from worldly affairs. They are definitely not interested in such events.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the Great Yu Capital, many of the youths were extremely shocked and in disbelief. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after, when they saw the figure emerging from the flying boat, they were all enlightened. It was closely followed with an instant uproar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Forces from all over the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty were in extreme delight and excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge was going to be observing the Hunting Event, they felt that if their disciples were to perform exceptionally, they might be favoured by Gu Changge. As a result, they would be able to rise up and obtain a huge progression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No wonder the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty put so much importance into this. I never expected for Young Master Changge to personally visit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It might be possible that he is going to observe the Hunting Event. This is a great opportunity for us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elders of the various Forces were whispering to each other while having excited eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To many of the young prodigies, Gu Changge was definitely the leader of the generation. His cultivation overwhelmed everyone of the same generation, such that no one could even catch up. Now that he was personally in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, it was truly an emotional moment for these young prodigies that admired him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many of the female prodigies, their eyes were filled with colours. They were staring at the phenomenal figure on the flying boat without blinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most, being able to see Gu Changge in person was more exciting than seeing an Immortal Scripture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their status, it was impossible to even see him, let alone be so close to him in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon enough, the news of Gu Changge appearing had spread out and it sparked a huge discussion. However, he merely appeared for a moment before he was fetched away by the Imperial Family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing the latter news, many of the cultivators could only let out sighs as they felt regretful that they couldn&#8217;t see Gu Changge in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that Gu Changge arrived with Mortal Palace, many of the people already guessed his objective was related to the Eternal Overcast. They had guessed so because someone actually saw the Mortal Palace&#8217;s Saintess in the flying boat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is Gu Changge at Great Yu Celestial Dynasty? Logically, it shouldn&#8217;t happen yet!&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had also received the news and his entire expression had turned gloomy. He was pacing around the general&#8217;s manor and looked to be in extreme discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his original memory, Gu Changge shouldn&#8217;t be at the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty at this moment. Instead, it should be a Prince from the Eternal Overcast Kingdom who should be here and attempting to arrange an engagement with the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Prince had not appeared, and it was Gu Changge that arrived first. This made Tuo Ba Xiao Yao rather uneasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the son of the great general, he naturally had to participate in the Hunting Event. Therefore, there was a high chance he would meet with Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was unsure if Gu Changge would be able to see that he possessed the Sword of World Domination. He might have already refined the Sword of World Domination into the Primordial Foetal Sword of World Domination, which could isolate being detected and conceal its aura, but he was still worried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Third brother, the Emperor Yu is setting up a banquet and has invited his ministers to meet with Young Master Changge. Father received the orders and asked me to inform you. All of the ministers are to bring their family along. Make your preparations, the chariot is waiting outside the manor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was finding it hard to sit peacefully, a slender and alluring woman walked over. She had a graceful figure, beautiful face with sharp features, while giving off an aura that was a fusion of glamour and heroic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she spoke to Tuo Bao Xiao Yao, it seemed as though she was afraid he wouldn&#8217;t go and specially gave him a few more glances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This person was none other than Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s elder sister, Tuo Bao Ling Qiong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was currently a Thousand Dao Academy lecturer and had exceptional talent, while also having plenty of pursuers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Emperor Yu invited the ministers? I have to go too?&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was startled from the news and was immediately feeling uneasy. He was extremely reluctant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Ling Qiong nodded and said, &#8220;Elder brother is not in the Imperial Capital. If you don&#8217;t go, there will be no other male members of the General Manor apart from father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao felt silent. If he didn&#8217;t go, his father would be punished by Emperor Yu and would be humiliated in front of the ministers. To oppose the decree at this moment was to show disrespect to Emperor Yu and Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this massive Upper Realm, no one dared to treat Gu Changge this way, let alone within the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t like such events, but there is no other way. I have also pushed away affairs in the academy for this event.&#8221; Tuo Ba Ling Qiong sighed as she didn&#8217;t like such events too. However, the visitor was Gu Changge and Emperor Yu treated him with utmost importance. In fact, had Emperor Yu not had important affairs, he would have personally received Gu Changge at the city walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As ministers, how could they refuse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand.&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao nodded and consoled himself in his heart. As long as he was careful, Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t be able to discover the Sword of World Domination on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is truly my Great Yu&#8217;s honour to have Young Master Changge travel such a long distance to visit us.&#8221; In the skies above, with multiple divine rainbows flashing by. There was a group with imposing auras, riding on what seemed like clouds. In this group, the Imperial Ancestor of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was smiling as he conversed with Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest were standing at the back not qualified to stand next to the duo. They were Yu Feiya, Yu Ming, and those from the younger generation. They were all standing far back, showing postures of Juniors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge might be about the same age as them, but he was already conversing and dealing with their Elders. It was something unacceptable for many of the prideful princes, but they were helpless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senior is too courteous. I am just here to investigate the Eternal Overcast Scourge. This matter involves the lives of everyone and as the Mortal One, how can I stand aside and ignore this?&#8221; Gu Changge was wearing white clothes and was smiling as he replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His body was seemingly covered with a surge of hazy radiance. His terrifying and massive aura made the imperial members behind felt a sense of panic, with palpitating suffocation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge is shouldering all lives and has a magnanimous Dao Heart, this old one is truly impressed. As for the Eternal Overcast Scourge, our Great Yu has sent people to investigate, but we have yet to discover much.&#8221; The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s Imperial Ancestor had an impressed expression before sighing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded and continued, &#8220;But I heard that a being from the Eternal Overcast Kingdom has appeared. It is closely related and it must be treated with prudence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Imperial Ancestor had a solemn expression as he replied, &#8220;Young Master Changge is right. If the Eternal Overcast Kingdom has appeared, it is definitely an ominous sign.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking, the group had travelled over thousands of kilometres and approached deep into the Imperial Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the cultivators and people looked up while revealing expressions of reverence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gu Changge arrived at the Great Yu Imperial Capital, Emperor Yu had already passed down the decree to invite all of his ministers. Therefore, the news had already spread throughout the Imperial Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Yu Imperial Capital had amazing visuals, it was magnificent and entirely different from the outside world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the skies above, there were various divine mountains and celestial islands. They were placed around like a chess board and were simply countless. It was like a sky of pure land. Deep within the Capital, there were rows upon rows of palace buildings that were decorated with carved beams and beautiful paintings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire place was shrouded in colourful mist, it was truly like the residence of an Immortal. There were plenty of ancient buildings that looked like ancient divine mountains, which were towering and massive. Soldiers were marching around and patrolling the streets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon enough, after travelling across a million kilometres, the group arrived at the Great Yu Palace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This land was high up in the sky, making it seemed like it was floating along the stars in the sky. There was surging Chaos Qi that revealed the Dynasty&#8217;s aura and prowess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the palace gate, there were two prostrating ancient beasts standing guard. Their aura had already reached the Quasi-Nirvana Realm and were extremely powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was an entirely different scene within the palace. It felt like a miniature world that was shrouded in mists and sophisticated structures. It was radiating with golden light while emitting imperial mighty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a banquet in place long ago, beautiful servants were moving around, some were singing and dancing while others were serving wine and spiritual dishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s ministers had already rushed over with their family members. They were all waiting with extreme silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was lowering his head and standing beside his father and elder sister. He would only occasionally lift his head to look at his previous life&#8217;s nemesis and didn&#8217;t dare to show any abnormal signs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the top seat was the current Emperor Yu. He was wearing dragon robes, a vague expression, and had an ethereal aura. Behind him were his consorts and concubines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a smile, Emperor Yu stood up to welcome Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge has travelled a long distance and must be weary. This emperor has prepared a feast to welcome Young Master Changge.&#8221; Emperor Yu spoke with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Changge pays his respects to Emperor Yu.&#8221; Gu Changge returned the same smile, &#8220;Your Majesty is too courteous. I will be troubling you for this trip, I hope that Your Majesty will not blame me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What kind of words are those Young Master Changge&#8230;&#8221; Emperor Yu laughed heartily while shaking his hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a few more conventional exchanges, they sat in their seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the ministers had started to give their greetings to Gu Changge, be it genuine or not. As the Successor of an Immortal Family, Gu Changge&#8217;s current status was already comparable with Emperor Yu. It was natural that none of them dared to be disrespectful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banquet quickly started, with Gu Changge and Emperor Yu sharing the same level in terms of seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu was behind Gu Changge and was wearing a veil. She had a calm expression and seemed ethereal. It felt like everything happening in the palace didn&#8217;t matter to her. Still, her mere presence put a stop to many of the princesses, who wanted to make a toast to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the scene, Emperor Yu laughed out involuntarily and turned to look at the eldest princess, who regarded the most highly, Yu Feiya.</span></p>

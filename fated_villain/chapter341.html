          to ruin us. We can&#8217;t possibly still not reject him out of fear
          of him at this point! I have already discussed it with Uncle Master.
          We will still refuse Gu Changge even if we have to offend him. I
          can&#8217;t let him imprison Sky King Zhi Yang in the Vermilion Bird

          hurt even more when he recalled who she was going to Gu Changge behind
          his back, with the excuse that she had family business to attend to.
          He felt that even if it was something she found it difficult to tell

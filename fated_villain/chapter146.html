      <h4>Chapter 146: Long Aotian's Template; Ant, Ant, ANT!</h4>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Just when everyone looked at Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong’s tiny gestures
        in shock and admiration, the mountains and ruins in front of them
        exploded and spread dust and ash in every direction.
      </p>
      <p><b>"What audacity…"</b></p>
      <p>A roar with icy killing intent resonated in the surroundings.</p>
      <p>
        Immediately afterwards, a terrifying figure surrounded by golden runes
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, Long Teng’s figure radiated powerful Qi and Vitality
        that covered the sky and everything in his surroundings in a terrifying
        sea of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was as if a King had descended upon the world and spread chaos in all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Long Teng revealed his Cultivation Base of a Pinnacle
        False God Realm master without holding back.
      </p>
      <p>
        He held unparalleled strength, but his current appearance…many
        cultivators felt strange looking at the scene in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent couldn’t help but
        turn their heads away; after all, just a moment ago, they watched their
        mighty Lord Long Teng get stomped under someone’s feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strong, indifferent, and domineering appearance he put on before was
        ruined within moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >"Gu Changge, how dare you sneak an attack on me! You are courting
          death!"</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Long Teng spoke with an icy tone.</p>
      <p>He was enraged beyond measure.</p>
      <p>
        He never expected that Gu Changge would suddenly pop out of nowhere and
        curbstomp him like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng was embarrassed and aggrieved, and those feelings only added
        to his rage. Never before had he felt so much murderous intent and
        desire to slaughter someone!
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge showed no change in his expression when he looked at Long
        Teng’s furious, cold eyes, and made it seem as if he had stomped a
        nobody, and not a well-known figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, he stared at Long Teng with a calm gaze, and muttered to
        himself,
        <b
          >"It seems that I guessed it correctly, and you are based on the Long
          Aotian template! Alas! That template is even more ancient than the
          waste making a comeback trope."</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>"Coming across you was a surprise."</b></p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge muttered that, no surprise could be seen on his
        face.
      </p>
      <p>Right then, a System Prompt sounded in his mind.</p>
      <p>
        [Ding! Long Teng, the Favored Son of Heaven, has appeared and triggered
        the following choices:
      </p>
      <p><b>Slaughter Long Teng!</b></p>
      <p><b>Reward:</b> 3000 Fortune Value | 15000 Destiny Points</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> Additional rewards will be calculated separately.</p>
      <p><b>Conquer Long Teng!</b></p>
      <p><b>Reward: </b>3000 Fortune Value | 15000 Destiny Points</p>
      <p><b>Note: </b>Additional rewards will be calculated separately.]</p>
      <p>
        The rewards were the same for both choices, so Gu Changge chose the
        first one without even thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why would he want to conquer a brain-dead trash who didn’t know the
        immensity of the Heavens? It would be a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more? This Long Teng even had the guts to covet what he shouldn’t
        have coveted, so Gu Changge felt that slaughtering him would be letting
        him off easy.
      </p>
      <p>The second choice was never a possibility.</p>
      <p>
        Having said that, Long Teng had 4000 points of Fortune Value, and that
        reminded Gu Changge of the [Fortune Plundering Cards] in his arsenal
        that were accumulating dust since he never used them.
      </p>
      <p>
        They cost around 5000 a piece in the System Shop, but he didn’t think it
        would be a waste to use one on Long Teng.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the plunder succeeds, he will directly clear the Favored Son of
        Heaven’s Fortune Points and trigger the System’s reward feature for
        killing a Favored Run after depriving them of all their Fortune.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe, this Long Teng could bring him some good stuff.</p>
      <p>
        In Gu Changge’s eyes, Long Teng didn’t have the qualifications to be a
        leek — at most, he could be considered an experience-dropping monster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Ye Ling, who had a brain and knew what to do and what not to do
        at times, this fearless Long Teng had no redeemable qualities and
        thought of himself as correct no matter what he did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, it was understandable. After all, if everything went according to
        the plot, then Long Teng would only come across foes weaker than him, so
        it was normal for him to despise and look down on everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where could he meet a final boss-level character like Gu Changge if
        everything went according to plot?
      </p>
      <p><b>"Gu Changge, what do you mean by that?"</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng couldn’t understand what Gu Changge was talking about, but he
        knew that Gu Changge held a contemptuous and indifferent attitude
        towards him, and that multiplied his rage and killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he had never met someone like Gu Changge who dared to insult
        and ignore him since the moment he was born.
      </p>
      <p><b>"It means that you are a retard, retard."</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn’t restrain himself when it came to bullying others, and
        bullying came to him naturally — even the swearing words sounded
        extremely natural when spoken by him.
      </p>
      <p>Almost all the cultivators felt as if he was merely stating facts.</p>
      <p>
        All the young creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent, however, were
        stunned. First, he humiliated him, and then he called him a retard! What
        clawed at their hearts was the fact that they couldn’t refute his words.
      </p>
      <p>
        That Gu Changge was strong, very strong, at least, he was stronger than
        Long Teng.
      </p>
      <p>
        What the creatures from the Continent saw today shocked them to their
        core, and they couldn’t find words to speak for a while.
      </p>
      <p>‘Is this guy hell-bent on pissing off Long Teng?’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er was shocked just like the rest of the crowd, and didn’t know
        what to say as she watched Gu Changge’s familiar figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had thought that Gu Changge wouldn’t waste any time and directly
        one-shot Long Teng to death, yet he started to kick him when he was
        down, and even called him a retard with extreme calm!
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Still, it does match Gu Changge’s temperament! His tongue is as
        poisonous as ever, filling his opponent with hatred right after he uses
        it…’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er realized that she was in a similar situation as Long Teng
        every time she argued with Gu Changge, and could feel her liver hurt.
      </p>
      <p><b>"Gu Changge, what did you say…"</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s expression froze, and he was momentarily stunned by Gu
        Changge’s words.
      </p>
      <p>He had never encountered something like this before.</p>
      <p>
        Rubbing salt on his wound was Gu Changge’s self-satisfied expression
        that filled him with hatred.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Rub! Rub! Rub!]</b></p>
      <p>Long Teng’s rage soared to new heights.</p>
      <p>
        His eyes turned ice-cold and his complexion turned a burning crimson as
        mist rose from all over his body, and divine runes loomed around his
        figure.
      </p>
      <p>His terrifying, cold aura rose sharply.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >"Didn’t I tell you to stand still and get killed? What’s the hurry?
          You sure are disobedient."</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said with a calm and sincere tone, together with a playful
        gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was as if he felt helpless looking at Long Teng, who was courting
        death.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stood in the Void with his hands behind his back as a hazy immortal
        aura and charm flowed around his figure and accentuated the beauty of
        his moon-white coat that seemed to be embroidered with innumerable
        stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the eyes of the onlookers, Gu Changge looked even more arrogant and
        powerful than Long Teng from a while ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >"Come here! Bring the gift this Young Master prepared for Long
          Teng."</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        As Gu Changge spoke, his followers stepped forward and blood splattered
        around in all directions as dazzling sword lights filled the air.
      </p>
      <p><b>"Lord Long Teng, help us!"</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>"Lord Long Teng, save us! We don’t want to die…"</b> Finnd 𝒏ew

      </p>
      <p>
        A large group of aboriginal creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent
        shouted with frightened and pale expressions. Right now, all of them had
        their Cultivation Bases sealed, and were nothing more than fish on a
        chopping block.
      </p>
      <p>
        They hoped that Long Teng, who was in front of them, could save them.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, they went to look for Gu Changge’s trail under Long Teng’s
        command, and were Long Teng’s subordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas! Instead of them finding Gu Changge, Gu Changge found them and came
        knocking at their door.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Puff!]</b></p>
      <p>
        However, before Long Teng could utter anything, sword lights fell one
        after another and a strong smell of blood filled the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the cultivators and creatures watching the scene felt chills go down
        their spines.
      </p>
      <p>
        They felt fear, not because they were weak, but because the scene in
        front of them was far too ruthless. One word, and so many creatures were
        put to death without hesitation!
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to Long Teng’s domineering actions, Gu Changge’s methods were
        far too ruthless and strong.
      </p>
      <p><b>"Slaughter them all, including that dragon-horned chick."</b></p>
      <p>
        The faint smile on Gu Changge’s face finally subsided as he gave an
        indifferent command.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without waiting for a response from Long Teng, the color of whose face
        visibly changed in front of him, he made a move.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s figure moved and he took the initiative to launch an
        offensive. His sleeves fluttered and the Void in front of him blurred as
        a terrifying and vast suction force appeared out of nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        A massive hand stuck out with brilliant splendid and made the world
        around it dim.
      </p>
      <p><b>"Ancient Immortal Gu Family’s [Universe-Devouring Sleeve]!"</b></p>
      <p>
        Many Young Supremes showed a change in their expressions; they
        recognized Gu Changge’s ability, but the ability Gu Changge showed right
        now was far more terrifying than the [Universe-Devouring Sleeve] they
        were familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>It was qualitatively different from what they knew.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >"Gu Changge’s Cultivation Base seems to have broken through to the
          False God Realm! Judging from his overwhelming aura, I am afraid his
          real Cultivation Base is far more terrifying than what we see…"</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>"He’s unfathomable! It’s hard to match him."</b></p>
      <p>
        Even the top-ten Young Masters of the Ancient Immortal Continent showed
        solemn and fearful expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as a true master made a move, the onlookers would know their
        terror.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was definitely an enemy who struck fear in their hearts!</p>
      <p>
        Just now, they had thought that he only got the upper hand because he
        sneak attacked, but now…it seems that he was merely humiliating Long
        Teng.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >"Since you dare to attack me first, I will make sure to slaughter you
          today!"</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s expression suddenly changed and he was about to make a move
        to save the creatures, but Gu Changge’s sudden attack shattered his
        plans.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        He also made a move and released the overwhelming might of the Pinnacle
        False God Realm, accompanied by a deafening dragon roar.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mighty divine light converged into golden dragon claws covering a
        radius of nearly a thousand miles. At the same time, golden runes merged
        together into a golden spear with a terrifying and indestructible edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >"No matter how presumptuous you are today, it won’t change the fact
          that you will die at my hands."</b

        <b

          will be remembered for an eternity!"</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then, Long Teng regained his indifferent and domineering
        appearance, and his voice thundered throughout Heaven and Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wasn't using any Mystical Art, yet his voice still hurt the ears of
        the onlooking cultivators — some even felt their eardrums burst!
      </p>
      <p>Countless people were shocked and opened their eyes wide.</p>
      <p>Long Teng was indeed not a braggart, and did possess real ability.</p>
      <p>Shocking, mighty fluctuations spread in all directions.</p>
      <p>
        The terrifying dragon roar resounded between Heaven and Earth as clouds
        burst apart, and the Universe appeared to reverse with the manifestation
        of an actual True Dragon whose one claw could raze everything to dust!
      </p>
      <p>
        This was Long Teng's [True Dragon Art], and right now, he displayed it
        in all its majesty and its tyrannical force reached the extremes.

      <p>
        <b
          >"The eras are long and the world starts anew even after it's

          trample to death, so do you really believe you deserve to be
          remembered?"</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said with a mockery-filled tone in an unhurried manner, while
        attacking at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cultivation Base he showed was only at the Initial Stage of the
        False God Realm, but he possessed an invincible posture. Right now, he
        was surrounded by endless Immortal brilliance that made him resemble a
        Young Immortal stand in the Void!
      </p>
      <p>A Mystical Ability holding a galaxy in it smashed down.</p>
      <p>
        The scene of the sun falling and the moon sinking manifested in front of
        everyone as terrifying might emerged from his hands and tried to
        slaughter the dragon in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng's body was covered in golden flames that drowned the sky, and
        right now, he released all kinds of terrifying Mystical Abilities.

      <p>
        Long Teng was about to go mad because Gu Changge called him an ant in
        every sentence he uttered. All this time, he was the one regarding
        others as ants! Since when did he become an ant in someone else's eyes?!
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly, Long Teng's expression changed.</p>
      <p>
        As Gu Changge raised his palm, infinite brilliance bloomed behind him
        and the aura of the Great Dao spread everywhere.

        The aura of the Great Dao condensed around him, and it appeared as if he

        moving beneath his feet!
      </p>
      <p>
        One star after another manifested to create a majestic, ancient starry
        sky descending from above Gu Changge.

      <p>
        His use of the power made even her feel the Natural Laws of the Great
        Dao.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, the world behind Gu Changge transformed into his
        domain, and the Great Dao manifested in the shape of the sky.
      </p>
      <p>As soon as he raised his palm, it covered the sky and the sun.</p>
      <p><b>[Puff!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked down on Long Teng with an indifferent expression, and
        then, the giant palm made from the sky and the stars fell to bury
        everything beneath it!
      </p>
      <p>In the next moment, everyone witnessed a shocking scene.</p>
      <p>
        Some of the onlookers felt their souls tremble, and couldn't help but
        want to kneel on the ground in worship of the deity in front of them.
      </p>
      <p><b>"The aura of the Great Dao…"</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng's complexion changed, too, and he understood that he couldn't
        resist the onslaught of the oncoming palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        A terrifying aura descended on him and muffled his sound. At the same
        time, his figure retreated in haste, as if trying to escape from a
        Mountain of Death!
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas! Gu Changge's palm moved at breakneck speed, and also covered the
        entire world, so it gave him no way out as it tried to flatten him to
        death!
      </p>
      <p><b>"You crazy bastard!"</b></p>
      <p>Long Teng punched out with the intent to resist the palm.</p>
      <p>
        His ancient True Dragon bloodline manifested and tried to penetrate the
        Heaven-rending Palm descending down on him!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with a clicking sound, a look of shock, horror, and disbelief
        filled his face as if he was struck by lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, his arms bled as if he smashed his arms into a rock.
      </p>
      <p>
        In everyone's eyes, Long Teng resembled an egg that was smashed into a
        stone!
      </p>
      <p><b>"How is this possible?! I have the blood of a True Dragon!"</b></p>
      <p>
        Long Teng couldn't believe what happened, and roared. His arms spasmed
        and he weakly fell back, as if the pain broke him down.
      </p>
      <p>He was defeated in their first head-to-head clash.</p>
      <p>It was unimaginable for him!</p>
      <p>Long Teng's back turned cold.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >"This is what I meant when I told you to stand still, do you
          understand?"</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A freakish chill went down Long Teng's back as he listened to Gu
        Changge's words!
      </p>
      <p>
        The palm continued its descent, and with a puff, Long Teng let out a
        miserable scream as the palm crushed his arms and made them explode!
      </p>
      <p>
        His mighty force of Heaven and Earth was crushed and endless terror
        gripped his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The might descending on him wasn't something that could be resisted by
        the flesh of cultivators or the creatures of the Continent, or any
        living being in general.

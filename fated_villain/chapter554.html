          he carefully stowed away the jade jar. Immortal Crystals were
          incredibly rare and difficult to obtain, and the items contained
          within this jade jar were a lot more valuable than them. [We must be

          the Heaven Dao Oath, each of them had a share of the Celestial Spirits
          in the jar. Therefore, it would be better if fewer people knew about
          this matter.</span

          immediately dispelled. Several of those ancient beings were seen with
          noticeably different expressions on their faces, but they were
          radiating an undeniable sense of joy.</span

          stood before them respectfully and said, “Rest assured, Young Master
          Changge. We understand that this matter is of great importance. The
          Immortal Foetus is yours to cut open.”</span

          outside the barrier. Although they were extremely curious about the
          contents of the jade jar, they could only suppress their curiosity and
          their urge to ask any questions.</span

          with a mere flick of a finger. If it was something meant to be known
          to them, they would naturally find out. If they found out something
          that wasn’t meant to be known to them, it could potentially lead to
          dire consequences, even death.</span

          the jade jar were undoubtedly far more valuable than the so-called
          Immortal Crystals. Otherwise, these ancient beings would not have such
          a look on their faces.</span

          Changge publicly humiliated, but things didn’t go as he wished. The
          price of a hundred Immortal Crystals could not even faze Gu Changge as
          the items he offered were obviously of greater value than Immortal
          Crystals. Aside from frustration, a deep sense of jealousy also arose
          in his heart.</span

          like the Phoenix Lady, the King with Six Crowns and the Sky Demon
          Sovereign could hardly catch their breath as waves of turmoil arose in
          their hearts. Gu Changge had certainly given them an immense shock
          today.</span

          even for Gu Changge to take out. In the end, he easily presented
          something more valuable than Immortal Crystals.

          surprised looks of those around him and casually instructed a few
          nearby stonecutters who were still stunned.</span

          price of a leftover piece was enough to make them tremble in despair.
          Now it lay before them, ready to be cut, but they were almost too
          afraid to even move their hands.</span

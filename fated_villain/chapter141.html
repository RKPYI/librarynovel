        <h4>Chapter 141: Mighty Visions; Fanatic of the Supreme Being!</h4>
        <p> Hei Ming’s eyes widened in disbelief and he stood up with a start as soon as he heard those words. </p>
        <p> He even dropped the gorgeous beauty in his arms to the ground, and she showed a terrified expression. </p>
        <p> <b>“Who’s talking?!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Who is it?”</b> </p>
        <p> Hei Ming shouted and looked around the elegant room in shock. </p>
        <p> However, everyone around him showed puzzled and shocked expressions as they didn’t hear anything. </p>
        <p> It was as if he had hallucinated or something! </p>
        <p> <b>“Brother Hei Ming, what’s wrong with you?”</b> </p>
        <p> The rest of the young creatures were shocked by his abrupt actions and asked with concerned expressions.
        </p>
        <p> Hei Ming’s sudden actions and words startled all of them. </p>
        <p> What’s more? Even if they didn’t want to do it, they still had to pretend to be concerned about him right
            now. </p>
        <p> Hei Ming stood in silence for a few moments and then sat back down, <b>“It’s nothing.”</b> </p>
        <p> He thought that his desire for power had started to give him auditory hallucinations now, after all, that
            voice was so illusory that he couldn’t find any traces of it anymore. </p>
        <p> It was as if it spoke right inside his mind. </p>
        <p> Hei Ming’s preoccupied and trance-like appearance made the crowd realize that it was about time they left,
            so after a few words, they all took their leave in a hurry. </p>
        <p> Today, Hei Ming seemed to be having some issues, so it was better for them to steer clear of trouble. </p>
        <p> Soon, Hei Ming was the only one left inside the room. </p>
        <p> Even now, he had a dazed expression as he hadn’t recovered from his previous shock. </p>
        <p> The departure of the others didn’t affect him as this was the first time Hei Ming got to hear the deepest
            desire hidden inside his heart. </p>
        <p> He wanted to become stronger! </p>
        <p> He wanted to be admired by hundreds of millions of people! </p>
        <p> Right then, the ethereal voice sounded inside Hei Ming’s mind once more, <b>“Young Man, do you want to
                become strong? Do you want to become an existence standing above hundreds of millions of people?”</b>
        </p>
        <p> It was a cold, emotionless, ancient-sounding voice that made it hard for one to guess the speaker’s age — it
            was as if it belonged to the lord of all beings looking down on everything from the Ninth Heaven. </p>
        <p> The ethereal voice of unknown origin seemed to carry a bewitching force that made Hei Ming widen his eyes in
            disbelief again. </p>
        <p> <b>“Who…”</b> </p>
        <p> He asked with a quivering voice. </p>
        <p> Right now, his body couldn’t help but tremble. </p>
        <p> Hei Ming believed that he wasn’t just hallucinating anymore, and that he truly heard those words just now.
        </p>
        <p> It surprised him — he was excited! Excited…and somewhat terrified. </p>
        <p> Stories about wastes overturning their fates have been famous since ancient times! Those down on their luck
            would, nine out of ten times, chance upon an opportunity that would help them turn around their fortune.
        </p>
        <p> Could it be that what he always longed for was about to materialize into reality? </p>
        <p> Could it be that he was…going to hit the jackpot today? </p>
        <p> Just like the protagonists described in the tales of the wandering wordsmiths. </p>
        <p> Could it be that he had chanced upon an opportunity to meet a powerful senior who he would worship as his
            master and then reach the pinnacle of the world under their tutelage? </p>
        <p> Right now, Hei Ming felt that the Heavens had bestowed upon him an unprecedented opportunity! </p>
        <p> After all, only a senior with an unfathomable Cultivation Base could scatter the fog covering the deepest
            desire of his heart like this. </p>
        <p> Hei Ming had no doubt about his conjecture, and didn’t think it could be anything else. </p>
        <p> After all, he was a useless piece of waste that could be discarded at any time in the Black Sky Eagle
            Family; no one in the Family gave a damn about him except for his grandfather and his sister. </p>
        <p> He was an ordinary being with less than mediocre talent and no strengths. </p>
        <p> What kind of senior would be blind enough to target him with evil intentions? </p>
        <p> These were the thoughts and realizations that made Hei Ming feel as if he hit the jackpot! He was excited
            beyond measure, so without thinking much about the matter, he knelt on the ground with a thund and said with
            a respectful tone, <b>“Senior, I do, I do…”</b> </p>
        <p> Hei Ming repeated the words ‘I do’ several times, showing just how excited he was right now. </p>
        <p> The longer such an ambition was suppressed, the mightier its effects would be once it burst out. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge watched the show in front of him from the Void, but didn’t make an appearance. </p>
        <p> He had learned a lot of things from the memories of the Heavenly God Realm creature he captured before. </p>
        <p> Hei Ming, the ‘trash’ Young Master of the Black Sky Eagle Family, wasn’t all that hard to understand. </p>
        <p> Combined with Hei Ming’s unwilling and aggrieved appearance, and his tragic situation in his family, it
            wasn’t hard for Gu Changge to guess the desires hiding inside Hei Ming’s heart. </p>
        <p> He had a dazzling elder sister, but he was just a b*****d with a mediocre talent and Cultivation Base, so
            how could he stand such a massive gap between them? </p>
        <p> It’s just that Gu Changge wasn’t actually intending to play an old grandpa or some crap like that — instead,
            he was going to use Hei Ming as a chess piece since he only had ordinary Fortune Value. </p>
        <p> After all, a mediocre trash no one gave a damn about was just the right tool to get stuff done for him
            without garnering too much attention or trouble. </p>
        <p> As for why Gu Changge needed someone like him? It was because the Black Sky Eagle Family was from the
            Ancient Immortal Era, so Gu Changge didn’t know much about their hidden strength and background. </p>
        <p> And why would he need that information? It was because right now, he wasn’t just targeting the stuff left
            behind by the Ancient Heavenly Emperor of Reincarnation, but also the Black Sky Eagle Family, and the other
            four Major Families, too, if possible. </p>
        <p> It sounded crazy, but it wasn’t impossible. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge now had two choices: ‘directly turn Hei Ming into a puppet who had no choice but to listen to
            him, or fool him into doing his bidding since he was someone who wouldn’t be able to tell east from west
            after a few enthralling words.’ </p>
        <p> After all, the [Great Dao Treasured Bottles] were extremely precious, and their refining process was
            complicated and troublesome, so Gu Changge didn’t want to waste one on a mere Hei Ming. </p>
        <p> Of course, if Hei Ming proved himself to be worthy enough in the future, then Gu Changge might plant a
            [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] inside his Primordial Spirit. </p>
        <p> <b>“Step through this door, stay mortal no more!”</b>
        </p>
        <p> <b>“Unrestrained by the Yellow Springs, no death to you will Samsara bring.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s voice sounded again, still carrying the elusive, ethereal charm, but this time, mixed with a
            demonic call. </p>
        <p> No matter how firm Hei Ming’s mind might have been, he couldn’t resist the temptation. </p>
        <p> Strength, status…those were things pursued by all living beings in the world. </p>
        <p> <b>[Hum!]</b> </p>
        <p> An incomparably mysterious portal opened in front of Hei Ming’s eyes full of shock, and released a divine
            brilliance filled with endless mystique. </p>
        <p> <b>“This— this…”</b> </p>
        <p> Hei Ming was ecstatic, and without hesitation, stepped directly into the portal. </p>
        <p> <b>[Hiss!]</b> </p>
        <p> Before long, Hei Ming saw a shocking sight that made him widen his eyes and take in a deep breath of cold
            air. </p>
        <p> He couldn’t believe what he was seeing! </p>
        <p> There were majestic and solemn palaces floating high up in the sky, with pillars that seemed to have the
            ability to hold up the Heavens reaching through the clouds! </p>
        <p> He found himself in the middle of a turbulent sea of chaos. </p>
        <p> The aura around him terrified him to the point that he felt like just a wisp of the chaotic energy would
            crush him together with Space and Time. </p>
        <p> When had Hei Ming seen such a shocking and awe-inspiring sight? </p>
        <p> He froze in place and didn’t know what to do. </p>
        <p> Right then, Hei Ming saw a vague figure sitting cross-legged atop an Immortal Palace, with Dragons and
            Phoenixes flying around him, and White Tigers and Black Turtles crawling at his feet — the scene made the
            person in front of him appear as if he was looking through the eras that had passed from beyond the cycle of
            reincarnation. </p>
        <p> The neverending river of time gushed from beneath his feet, and made it seem like it could drown the Heavens
            and Earth! </p>
        <p> <b>“Young Man, do you want to become strong?”</b> </p>
        <p> Right then, Hei Ming heard the hazy figure in front of him look at him. </p>
        <p> The light in the figure’s eyes was deep and gave off a feeling of archaicness that was so vast it seemed to
            contain the secrets of eternal life and death. </p>
        <p> Hei Ming witnessed the destruction of the Universe! </p>
        <p> He witnessed the sky collapse as the earth burst open! </p>
        <p> He witnessed the Immortals fall and the Emperors weep! </p>
        <p> Hei Ming witnessed endless scenes from far off eras! </p>
        <p> Right now, Hei Ming felt as if he was blessed by the Heavens and knelt down and cried out in excitement,
            <b>“I do! I want to become strong! Junior Hei Ming pays respects to Senior!”</b> </p>
        <p> He was already certain that the senior in front of him was an unbelievably mighty existence since he was
            able to bring him to an unknown world without hassle. </p>
        <p> There were magnificent sights and sacred places full of supreme majesty that made even the Immortals lose
            their brilliance in their presence! </p>
        <p> One glance was enough for him to know that the person in front of him was an absolute powerhouse. </p>
        <p> Of course, Gu Changge spent a lot of Destiny Points to create such a perfect scene, and since it coincided
            with his plan of creating a Heaven inside his inner world, he didn’t feel like it was a waste doing all that
            to fool the idiot in front of him. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge had no doubt that a r3t4rd like Hei Ming would be deceived by a grand scene. </p>
        <p> <b>“Get up, I already know your situation.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge spoke with a playful tone, but his ability to control the Natural Laws distorted his voice to
            give it an archaic feeling. </p>
        <p> Hei Ming was further shocked, and couldn’t even stand up as his legs softened. </p>
        <p> He was not even comparable to an ant in front of the supreme existence in front of him, so he wondered how
            he could have the fortune to be favored by the senior? </p>
        <p> <b>“Senior…”</b> </p>
        <p> Hei Ming spoke with a trembling voice, with the intent to tell Gu Changge that he wanted to worship him as
            his master and grow stronger under his tutelage… </p>
        <p> However, Gu Changge interrupted him, and said with an indifferent and emotionless voice, <b>“I already know
                everything about you.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Neither the past, nor the present elude me! You are a direct descendant of the Black Sky Eagle Family,
                and your parents are…”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge repeated the information he learned from the Heavenly God he captured previously, and even
            analyzed Hei Ming’s deepest desires while speaking. </p>
        <p> Hei Ming was stunned when he heard Gu Changge’s words, and gasped for breath in extreme shock. </p>
        <p> How could the Senior know so much about him when they just met for the first time? He wondered. </p>
        <p> He didn’t even dare to suspect the fact that the ‘Senior’ might have investigated his background beforehand.
        </p>
        <p> After all, he was a piece of trash, so there was nothing to investigate about him. </p>
        <p> [TL/N: he’s got self-awareness, so he’s a tad-bit superior to the Favored Runts.] </p>
        <p> So the only possibility left was that the Senior in front of him was omniscient! </p>
        <p> <b>“Senior, if you will allow me to ask, can I ask how I can become stronger? Please give me some
                pointers…”</b> </p>
        <p> Hei Ming excitedly asked Gu Changge for advice, hoping that the mysterious, mighty senior could accept him
            as his disciple. </p>
        <p> <b>“I am the Emperor of Heaven and Earth, the Supreme All Father…”</b> </p>
        <p> [TL/N: Daddy Odin has descended.] </p>
        <p> Gu Changge made up a name that he felt would give off a strong impression and feeling of power. Anyway, the
            longer the name, the better his bluff would be. </p>
        <p> Of course, there were all sorts of loopholes in his remarks but those weren’t worth paying much attention
            to. </p>
        <p> After all, how could there be a supreme existence who would go out of their way to explain stuff to ants,
            and even give such a corny introduction? </p>
        <p> In order to cater to Hei Ming’s fantasy, however, he didn’t mind doing it once. </p>
        <p> <b>“Become my believer! Recite my true name, and you will obtain the secret to eternal life! Even if the
                Heavens are destroyed, your True Spirit[1] will still survive through the long river of time…”</b> </p>
        <p> [1: True Spirit is like the soul of soul, the thing that makes up a person’s consciousness and primordial
            spirit and everything else.] </p>
        <p> Gu Changge said those words with an expression full of intrigue. </p>
        <p> He had to say that even he was touched by his acting. </p>
        <p> <b>“Recite your real name…and I can obtain eternal life…”</b> </p>
        <p> Hei Ming’s eyes widened and he stood there like a dumbstruck chicken shocked to the extreme, to the point
            that it couldn’t even form thought. </p>
        <p> Even True Immortals dared not claim to knowing the secrets of eternal life, yet if he became the believer of
            the Senior in front of him, he could peer upon such a secret? </p>
        <p> How great! </p>
        <p> How terrifying! </p>
        <p> Hei Ming couldn’t help but kneel down as emotions surged through his heart and mind. </p>
        <p> <b>“I would love to become your believer, Supreme Being!”</b> </p>
        <p> Subtly, he changed ‘Senior’ to ‘Supreme Being.’ </p>
        <p> After all, he had nothing but his life, so Hei Ming wasn’t worried about the supreme being in front of him
            plotting something against him. </p>
        <p> Right now, the best course of action for him was to kneel and lick his feet! </p>
        <p> <b>“Since you have become my believer, then let me bestow upon you divine knowledge!”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge uttered those words after he saw that he had almost achieved his goal. </p>
        <p> This…was his ultimate goal! </p>
        <p> <b>[Hum!]</b> </p>
        <p> With that, he raised his hand and brought forth a hazy brilliance that bloomed in front of him and took the
            form of an Immortal Book that seemed to have descended from the Ninth Heaven. </p>
        <p> Hei Ming’s face turned red as he saw the scene in front of him, and his figure shook in excitement. </p>
        <p> <b>“Thank you for your blessing, Supreme Being! I am willing to give everything for you, Supreme Being!”</b>
            Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com</p>
        <p> With trembling hands, Hei Ming took hold of the hazy brilliance, and then felt mysterious and ancient words
            flow into his mind like golden stars one after another. </p>
        <p> The words soon imprinted themselves in Hei Ming’s Sea of Consciousness. </p>
        <p> In the end, three words appeared in Hei Ming’s mind: ‘[Binding Immortal Art.]’ </p>
        <p> Although Gu Changge had a calm and indifferent expression on the surface, he couldn’t help but feel interest
            in his heart as he watched Hei Ming’s fanatical expression and excitement. </p>
        <p> The full name of the [Binding Immortal Art] was [Binding Immortal Execution Art], and it was a mysterious
            art recorded in the [Immortal-Devouring Demonic Art]. </p>
        <p> To put it simply, it worked by creating threads that bound others. </p>
        <p> With him as the source, threads would split into branches that would bind one person after another, and
            create a cob-web that he could freely control. </p>
        <p> [TL/N: it’s like a pyramid scheme where one person controls the life and death of two people, two people
            control the life and death of four people, so on and so forth. The one at the top controls the life and
            death of them all.] </p>
        <p> Right now, Hei Ming had become one of those bound by the thread. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge believed that with Hei Ming’s ambition, it won’t take him long to discover the horrors of the
            [Binding Immortal Art], and once he discovers that, his ambition would inflate, and it would be difficult
            for him to escape his grasp. </p>
        <p> And this…was the little ‘ray of hope’ he bestowed upon Hei Ming. </p>
        <p> A single spark could start a forest fire. </p>
        <p> If he could succeed, then it won’t take long for Gu Changge to nibble away at those Five Major Families of
            the Ancient Immortal Continent. </p>
        <p> After all, those Five Major Families held a greater allure to him when compared to the relics left behind by
            the Ancient Heavenly Emperor of Reincarnation! </p>

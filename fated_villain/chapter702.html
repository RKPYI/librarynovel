        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Neraka, which had lived for eternity and controlled the dark side of the Upper Realm, driving countless Forces into dread and panic, had finally been destroyed.</span><span id="more-36165"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endless flames engulfed the battlefield, aggravating the disastrous scenery as the sky thoroughly fractured. The entire world was collapsing and rotting. Unable to leave anything behind, too many people had died in this war. Their bones were buried in the ground as their souls drifted away from their disintegrated bodies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a few ancient battleships remained levitating in the sky, their broken hulls stained with blood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silently, the survivors peered at the sight in lingering fear. In their eyes, had the Dharma Body left behind by the Ruler of Neraka not faded away, everyone else on the battlefield might have perished along with Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Palm of True World is shattered. All the Forces have paid a heavy price.&#8221; The surviving cultivators were still frantic with fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This war was too terrifying, with the deaths of more than eight True Daoists, each Ancestor-level figures of their respective Immortal Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their goal was to obliterate Neraka, but such a price was too great.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Forces who refrained from participating in this war felt lucky as they didn&#8217;t have to face such tremendous loss. Instead, they discovered various treasures by exploiting each region of Neraka. For instance, Dao Books, ancient scriptures, artifacts, Celestial Herbs, and the wealth Neraka had accumulated all these years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the ancient worlds, which Neraka conquered, were also considered rare and extraordinarily wealthy. Some of them were engraved with Dao Runes and Nirvana Grade Arrays, harbouring offensive capabilities that were excellent for protecting the place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, Forces came to Neraka to plunder the battlefield. While some found the corpses of their Ancestors, some managed to find the buried, damaged artifacts that contained their ancestors&#8217; aura. Regardless, the war might have ended, but its remaining aftereffects were still there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the next fortnight, many cultivators continued to appear outside the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. Ancient battleships soared in the sky, unwilling to miss any spot Neraka used to own.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the extensive discussions of the cultivators, details regarding the war speedily spread to every corner of the Upper Realm. Naturally, Neraka&#8217;s fall was worth celebrating, but it was also a warning to many Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, Gu Changge&#8217;s influence in the war was immeasurable and horrifying. Without him, the Upper Realm wouldn&#8217;t have had a chance of taking down Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, it was as though he had long known that Neraka still had the &#8216;the Ruler of Neraka&#8217; up their sleeves. With this foresign, he called for an early retreat from the final battle and had insignificant losses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, it was Gu Changge who first discovered the hiding place of Neraka, but he was also the first to retreat in the end. At that time, no one knew why he did so. Thus, everyone wondered if Gu Changge had spies planted in Neraka, which might be why he knew every trick Neraka had.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, thanks to the war, many grew wary towards another assassin guild that had been rapidly growing all these years—Nephrite Breeze Pavilion. Some Forces even believe that Gu Changge was secretly supporting the guild all this time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Upper Realm, which had been peaceful for a long time, was greatly stirred up over the destruction of Neraka. Some Elders even predicted that endless chaos of blood and fire would soon consume the Upper Realm in the near future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the fall of Neraka, Pagoda, another assassin guild, that was almost as ancient, was unable to retain its calm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Forces started searching for traces related to Pagoda, intending to wipe it out as they did Neraka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t bother with matters pertaining to Pagoda as everything was under his calculations. After dealing with the situation in Neraka, he returned to the Immortal Gu Family Residence and began searching for a suitable ancient world to plot against.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Qing Luo, the First Palace Lord, and the Third Palace Lord, Gu Changge did not kill them. After he planted Slave Marks in those two and thereby gained control over their lives, he delegated all the responsibilities to Yin Mei and Bai Lian&#8217;er.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, Gu Changge has yet to disclose to anyone about Dark Heaven. However, after Neraka’s demise, the Upper Realm&#8217;s peace and harmony was drastically distorted. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, many were scared for their lives and started praying night and day. Formidable cultivators could even detect the existence of Dark Heaven. Although they had yet to offer their complete faith, their will was already wavering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge had calculated, he would be able to gather more faith and followers with greater chaos in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, half a month had passed, and his wedding with Yue Mingkong gradually closed in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, for some reason, an inexplicable disturbance arose in his tranquil mind. After heaving a sigh, he put down the jade tablet in his hand and walked out of the palace before unknowingly arriving at the peak of a mountain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first glance, one could see the innumerable islands and ancient Divine Mountains within the vast territories of the Immortal Gu Family. Filled with radiant divine lights and swirling Celestial Mists, the territories resembled an Immortals&#8217; paradise that stood atop the world as it oversaw all lives in its eternal invincibility, possessing the power to control life and death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had almost reached the level wherein he could effortlessly reshape the world with just his voice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[System…] Gu Changge seemed rather agitated. His eyes gradually deepened as he called forth the System that had been silent for quite some time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn&#8217;t worried about accidents that might occur during his wedding. Instead, he suddenly felt that although he had appeared so limitlessly glorious, peaceful times were rare to him as he was constantly plotting in the dark.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He already knew that he, as the Demon Lord, carried numerous secrets that would shock the world. It included the origin of the System and his transmigrator identity—mysteries that concealed unending, uncovered truths. Nonetheless, usually, he never brought himself to think about these.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the wedding day nearing, even Gu Changge himself could feel his mind disrupted, which led to such thoughts. He might have tasted the sweetness of glory, but he had also experienced lonely, sleepless nights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What, am I cleansing my Dao Heart?] Gu Changge self-mockingly chuckled. [What Dao Heart? When have I ever depended on such a thing?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, his gaze fell upon the familiar interface. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The origin of the System was an enigma. He once assumed that it was the creation of the Demon Lord, but that assumption was proven wrong later. The only things that was related to the Demon Lord was the vessel in which he was transmigrated into, as well as his Demonic Heart. If anything, the System and his memories as a transmigrator were the aberrances of this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It has been a long time since I&#8217;ve met a Fortuitous One that is actually useful to me, and the System has been quiet since then. I wonder what connection there is between Fortuitous Ones and the System?] Gu Changge subconsciously shook his head as he sank into thoughts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he had an intuition that he would come to understand all the mysteries one day, and something must be waiting for him in the Immortal Domain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;ve always been scheming and scheming. Maybe, I’m getting a little tired of it?] Gu Changge revealed a faint smile. He wasn&#8217;t disagreeing with his own actions, but he was simply surprised by such a thought arising in his mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although his comprehension of the Great Dao was far superior to those numerous True Daoists, he could never break through and become an Immortal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, I guess even Immortals wouldn&#8217;t be able to escape such introspection.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bearing that in mind, he let out a sigh and stopped burdening himself with these thoughts. Thereupon, he shut his eyes and silently took a rest. Since he was in the territory of the Immortal Gu Family, he was sure that he would be safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, from the Outer Island of the Immortal Gu Family, a divine rainbow was cast over islets and mountains between various teleportation arrays.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the members saw who the approaching person was, their faces subtly changed. They bowed with immense reverence as they dared not to feign any disrespect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, that was the Princess of the Immortal Gu Family who possessed a distinctive identity. Be it in the outside world or within the family residence, no one dared to upset her. Besides, the Head and the Elders of the Family still felt guilty towards her due to an incident in the past.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, another major factor was her terrorising Talents. Among the younger generation, she was only second to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, many Ancestors who exited seclusion were especially attentive to her as they would personally mentor her and gift her with numerous treasures and divine techniques.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time ago, following her soundless disappearance, many members of the Family were concerned as nobody knew where she went to, and it was only until she safely returned that they could finally feel relieved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is Gu Changge home?&#8221; Gu Xianer&#8217;s body was slender, her face incomparably stunning and her hair incredibly rich, carrying a cold, boastful aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, even her questioning gesture carried a graceful divineness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she might usually appear childlike before Gu Changge, she was by no means a fool as her Talents alone far surpassed that of countless prodigal damsels in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge has been remaining in the residence lately.&#8221; Startled, one of the family members hastily replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the entire Immortal Gu Family, perhaps she was the only person that dared to call Gu Changge by his name. Even the Ancestors that came out of their seclusion were all courteous to Gu Changge as none dared to treat him as a Junior anymore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, he’s still here…&#8221; Gu Xianer nodded, a hint of pain and complexity flashing across her face, but she quickly regained her composure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, on her way back from the Outer Island to the Immortal Gu Family Residence, she had heard a lot of news about Gu Changge, including his engagement with Yue Mingkong, his venture to the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, and the destruction of Neraka. She heard almost every single thing about him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, she was very sceptical and incredulous about the scene she saw in the Lake of Rebirth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, on her way back, she couldn&#8217;t help but connect all of Gu Changge&#8217;s actions, and that led her to think of such a possibility. Truthfully, she was deeply pained, unwilling to accept the scene in the Lake of Rebirth, but even Hong assured her that the Lake of Rebirth—a World Artifact—wouldn&#8217;t show anything false in its reflection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, that scene might merely be a fragment of the future or a possibility—an outcome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Gu Xianer not only saw her own ending, but she also saw the profusely splashing of blood on the night of Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong&#8217;s wedding. Cold and apathetic, Gu Changge killed his wife with his own hands as if he had no emotions at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But the future can still be changed. Gu Changge won&#8217;t do such a thing. He must have been overtaken by his Demonic Heart. I just know it! The issue of his Demonic Heart has never been resolved this entire time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Xianer gritted her pearly white teeth. As she peered at the distant islands and mountains, her eyes became crystalline, as if moisturised by glistening tears.</span></p>

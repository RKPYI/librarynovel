      <h4>
        Chapter 256-1: It cant be washed off at all, He is more dangerous than
        the inheritor of demonic art (1)
      </h4>
      <p>"Young master Gu."</p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu was also startled, and her silver eyes widened. She didn't
        expect Gu Changge to come here and stand in front of them. It seemed
        that he was going to provide help again.
      </p>
      <p>"Greetings, Young Master Changge!"</p>
      <p>
        Many people of Heavenly Emperor Mountain were not stupid at this moment.
        Seeing that Gu Changge made a move, it seemed that he was about to clear
        the doubts. Especially the man in black, Agu, his expression was even
        more excited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emperor Mountain and Gu Changge should be on opposite sides. But at this
        time, he was willing to stand up for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reminded him of the last scene in the pavilion. If it wasn't for Gu
        Changge, they would have already aroused public anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Young Master Changge is indeed a generous and natural person, no
          wonder so many young Supremes willingly follow him.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        "Miss Ying Yu." Gu Changge turned back, looked at Ying Yu who was a
        little surprised, nodded slightly, and responded with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        His voice was as flat and warm as always, making people feel like a
        spring breeze, and it was hard to find anything wrong.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        With half of his body exploded, Ying Shuang, who was slowly healing,
        trembled slightly. He couldn't help but feel a terrifying chill, and his
        hands and feet were even colder than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the first time he saw Gu Changge. He had only heard it in
        rumors before.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he was the boy who fed the horses, he heard about Gu Changge from
        Miss Yin Mei and knew that his voice held power. G√™tt the latest
        chùíÇpters on nùíê/velbin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        The power and energy he possessed made Miss Yin Mei admire him. Speaking
        of which, the person he was most envious of at that time was Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second was Prince Ying and Emperor Ying. He would rather face Wang
        Ziji, the descendant of Human Ancestor Hall, than Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this guy had a smile on his face and looked like jade, pure and
        unparalleled, but his level of fear was far more than a thousand times
        that of Wang Ziji.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was his intuition. Gu Changge probably already knew his biggest
        secret. That was why he never dared to face Gu Changge directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Ying Shuang felt that the timing of Gu Changge's appearance
        was too coincidental. All of this seemed to have been deliberately
        arranged by him and Wang Ziji.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, do you want to stop me?"</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji's expression was a little surprised, but she didn't expect Gu
        Changge to appear suddenly.
      </p>

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        She also thought that he would honestly hide in the dark and plan to
        watch the show or something. Since he wanted to show up, why didn't he
        talk to her before?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or was it that Gu Changge was actually taking advantage of her? Or was
        it just his sudden decision?
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji felt that it was necessary for Gu Changge to know that
        although she was tempted by him, it did not mean that he could lead her
        by the nose in everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How about stopping today's affairs? As for Prince Ying being the
        inheritor of demonic art is still up for debate."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't know what Wang Ziji was thinking, but he still had a
        smile on his face, "Holy Maiden Ziji, I hope you give me some face."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I won't." Wang Ziji shook her head, her expression seemed a little
        cold, and she turned to Ying Yu, and said with a little interest, "Could
        it be that you are interested in this girl that‚Äôs why you are protecting
        her many times? Can't Brother Gu not see such an obvious abnormality in
        Prince Ying?"
      </p>
      <p>
        She also didn't know why Gu Changge, who had always been indifferent and
        ruthless, did this. Was he acting? But why did he act for Ying Yu, and
        what was his intention?
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji felt that she couldn't guess what Gu Changge was thinking, and
        he was too elusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I just think that there is something strange about this matter. Of
        course, Miss Ying Yu's temperament is indeed more straightforward, and I
        don't want to see her being implicated for no reason."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stood in front of Wang Ziji with a calm expression. His words
        surprised Ying Yu behind him, and then she thought of something, and her
        face couldn't help but turn a little red.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, Ying Shuang's expression became a little gloomy, but it
        was only fleeting. He quickly recovered his calm appearance and one
        could not see any emotions.
      </p>
      <p>During this period of time, he had practiced his acting skills.</p>
      <p>
        "Okay, since Young Master Gu Changge said so, what else can I do? I
        guess I won't be able to beat you then."
      </p>
      <p>Wang Ziji became carefree at this time and was a little helpless.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's sudden reversal caught her off guard. But considering that
        this man's character was like this, she didn't have much to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, in the current state, according to the words from the
        previous life, it was equivalent to her chasing Gu Changge, so what if
        she accommodated him?
      </p>
      <p>
        And she was telling the truth, if Gu Changge insisted on protecting
        Heavenly Emperor Mountain and others, with her current strength, she
        might not be Gu Changge's opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was far from being as simple as it seemed. Sometimes she
        wondered whether Gu Changge's identity might be a hidden boss.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you. I‚Äôll remember this favor." Gu Changge's voice was a little
        more smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ No, no, you are being polite, I'm really not used to it." Wang
        Ziji waved her hand, a little disgusted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's tone made her feel uncomfortable, but thinking about it,
        was he a little moved now?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking this, her figure moved and disappeared like blue smoke, and
        soon disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people nearby looked at this scene with different expressions, while
        some were feeling envy.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        It seemed that the relationship between the descendant of Human Ancestor
        Hall and the young master Changge seemed to be very good, and they were
        very close, otherwise, they would not communicate in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The descendants of Human Ancestor Hall were high above and had a
        detached status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that there was the Ancient Immortal Wang family behind
        Wang Ziji.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was hard for ordinary people to see her like this, and they only had
        the opportunity to see her because of the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield. The place where many younger generations had gathered.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the suspicion that Gu Changge was acting with Wang Zijin? Except
        for Ying Shuang, no one had thought about this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge thought about this, so he didn't mention it to Wang Ziji in
        advance, just because he didn‚Äôt want any flaws.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Young Master Gu for clearing the doubt."</p>
      <p>"Thank you, Young Master Changge, for clearing the doubt."</p>
      <p>
        After seeing Wang Ziji depart, everyone from the Heavenly Emperor
        Mountain couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was nothing wrong with Ying Shuang. They won't be as
        embarrassed as they were today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, Heavenly Emperor Mountain was a sacred place for all the
        Ancient Clans. It was revered by all Clans. Who didn't worship it? It
        could only be said that they were too unlucky. Wang Ziji, regardless of
        identity or strength, was at the top of the bunch, and was completely
        unstoppable.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No worries. However, when I saw you today, Brother Ying's state didsn't
        seem right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge waved his hand and looked at Ying Shuang, who was recovering
        from his injuries, with scrutiny on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang looked very uncomfortable by his expression but still tried
        to maintain a calm face.
      </p>
      <p>"Greetings Brother Gu."</p>
      <p>
        He bowed slightly to Gu Changge and said, "Thank you Brother Gu for your
        kindness today, if you need something in the future‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "No need." Gu Changge interrupted him with a smile, "Brother Ying is in
        such a state, I don't think there will be such a day."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang's expression froze, he didn't expect him to be so direct,
        and he didn't give him face at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that Gu Changge didn't seem to be too cold to his brother.
        Ying Yu spoke quickly and said softly,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Young Master Gu, thank you for your kindness. You have helped many
        times. If you need it in the future, just let me know. As long as it is
        within my power, I and Heavenly Emperor Mountain, will do our best."
      </p>
      <p>
        She felt that Gu Changge seemed to be looking at her face, so she made a
        move. It was he who informed her of the location of the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield, and it was him who helped clear the doubts.
      </p>
      <p>She would not believe that Gu Changge had no intentions in this.</p>
      <p>
        "Speaking of which, this happened because of me. If I hadn't told you
        the entrance to this place, you wouldn't have encountered Holy Maiden
        Ziji."
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing that Ying Yu seemed to have something to say but Gu Changge spoke
        again and explained.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The main reason is that I'm afraid of being misunderstood by you. I
        think I told you that the entrance was obtained by someone else. As a
        person, I don't like being misunderstood."
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, Ying Yu and the others were a little stunned.</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 256-2: It cant be washed off at all, He is more dangerous than
        the inheritor of demonic art (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "I see. Young Master Gu is worrying too much, we are not the kind of
        people who care about the belly of a gentleman with the heart of a
        villain."
      </p>
      <p>
        They spoke quickly. Ying Shuang's heart became more and more gloomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turned out that it was Gu Changge who told them about the entrance to
        the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield. He really didn't feel at ease, and
        now he came to pretend to be a good person again.
      </p>
      <p>However, Ying Yu still looked very confident.</p>
      <p>
        "Brother Ying, did you switch to a different cultivation method? In my
        opinion, your current strength does not match your age and talent."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge suddenly looked at Ying Shuang and asked in
        surprise, "I don't think you are showing weakness on purpose, or is
        there something wrong with your culitvation? For example, something
        happened to your soul during cultivation‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Some kind of cultivation ‚ÄòAccident‚Äô?"</p>
      <p>Hearing Gu Changge's words, everyone was a little surprised.</p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang was a descendant of Emperor Mountain, and he had learned too
        many magical powers. Was there any culitvation in this world that was
        worth his practice?
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, they thought of the recent rumors, and their
        expressions suddenly changed ‚Äò<i>forbidden demonic art‚Äô</i>!
      </p>
      <p>
        These words were like an invisible mountain of terror, pressing down on
        their heads, almost making them unable to breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother Gu, what do you mean by that? Why would I switch my
        cultivation?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang didn't expect Gu Changge to be so straightforward, so he
        almost didn't ask him if he had cultivated forbidden demonic art, which
        made him look a little ugly.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he calmed down and asked rhetorically. On the contrary, the words
        that there was a problem with his soul made his heart skip a beat, and
        his legs almost went weak. This was his biggest secret.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge really knew, that was why he said it like this.</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, that looks like I'm overthinking it." Gu Changge smiled casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        "My brother did tell me that there was a problem with his soul during
        cultivation and he lost a part of his memory‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Ying Yu, who faintly felt that something was wrong,
        couldn't help but mutter, her eyes suddenly seemed to have silver light
        emerging, one after another, with a sharp aura.
      </p>
      <p>"What?"</p>
      <p>"Anything else?"</p>
      <p>
        Everyone from Heavenly Emperor Mountain was extremely surprised. It was
        the first time they discovered this news, and they looked at Ying Shuang
        with incredible eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        What the hell happened during this time? Gu Changge's expression
        suddenly became interested.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang also knew that this matter could not be concealed, and
        simply nodded and said, "When I was cultivating some time ago, something
        went wrong and I accidentally cut off a part of my memory‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        The weapon in his soul was still there. Therefore, Ying Shuang was very
        calm and was not afraid of being suspected of his true identity. After
        all, it was a symbol and recognition of his identity, and it was a
        fetish refined by Emperor Ying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since he explained this, who could doubt his true identity? Even Gu
        Changge, who knew his secret, would not be able to reveal his origin at
        this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After listening to what Ying Shuang said. The expressions of everyone
        from Heavenly Emperor Mountain became cloudy and uncertain. Ying Shuang
        had never mentioned this matter before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that he suddenly said this, what was he planning? It was just a last
        resort.
      </p>
      <p>Forbidden demonic art!</p>
      <p>
        Almost in an instant, they thought of these three words, and a storm
        surged in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>Earlier, they had always felt that Ying Shuang was wronged.</p>
      <p>
        But now all these signs were showing that he was inseparable from the
        forbidden demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>Ying Yu couldn't help but feel a chill on her back.</p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang was hiding too deep, he really intended to drag the entire
        Emperor Mountain into this muddy water.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was almost time to see the real show. With a smile on his face, Gu
        Changge also got up to leave without saying anything more.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge, be careful!"</p>
      <p>"For today's great kindness, we all are deeply grateful!"</p>
      <p>
        Everyone from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain started to speak, and they
        were extremely grateful to Gu Changge. Not only did he help them but now
        they were awakened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled and mentioned it kindly, "Oh right, Brother Ying,
        please pay attention, Holy Maiden Ziji can come at any time. She's not
        as reasonable as this Gu."
      </p>
      <p>
        He took one step, the void was blurred, and he had already left this
        place.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that he came here just to be a peacemaker, and to ask Ying
        Shuang something by the way.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, Ying Shuang was indeed overthinking.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had no intention of revealing his true identity at all. For
        Gu Changge, whether it was Ying Shuang or the little horse feeder
        servant, it was the same, and they all took the blame for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        His purpose was just to let Ying Shuang take the suspicion of the
        inheritor of demonic art for a little longer! To the point where it was
        like coal that could never be washed clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Ying Shuang had been worried that Gu Changge would reveal his
        identity. As for whether it was inheritor of demonic art or something,
        for him, it was not as important as his current status.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, the Son of Luck, Ying Shuang, was suspected by the Emperor
        Mountain, and his Luck was greatly damaged‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        The sound of the system in his mind kept coming. Gu Changge's smile grew
        even stronger. CHùíÜCk for ùíèew stùíêries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

      <p>
        "What does Gu Changge mean? Is it because after knowing that he can't
        reveal my identity, I retreated in spite of the difficulty?"
      </p>
      <p>
        After seeing Gu Changge disappear, Ying Shuang could not help but let
        out a sigh of relief, but his back was already wet with cold sweat.
      </p>
      <p>
        This man was really scary! He obviously didn‚Äôt attack, but it gave an
        unparalleled terrifying pressure. He did not know that the people around
        him from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain had changed their eyes, showing
        expressions of fear, and doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Ying Yu was wary of him. The rest of the young existences nearby
        also had different expressions at this time, and their eyes flickered.
      </p>
      <p>
        They naturally listened to what Gu Changge and Ying Shuang said just
        now.
      </p>
      <p>The inheritor of demonic art!</p>
      <p>
        Now it seemsed that Prince Ying Shuang was inseparable from these words,
        even if he had been trying his best to hide it, he had not shown any
        fluctuations of the forbidden demonic art couldn't be washed!
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>"After watching this for so long, isn‚Äôt it time to come out?"</p>
      <p>
        After leaving the area where Ying Shuang and the others were, Gu
        Changge's figure appeared from the deserted peak, and he couldn't help
        but calm down.
      </p>
      <p>
        "So that was your purpose." Wang Ziji's figure appeared behind him. Her
        expression was strange and surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, she didn't leave very far, and kept watching Gu Changge's
        actions secretly, wondering what his purpose was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, she also saw that Gu Changge made Ying Shuang say a lot. And
        these words were enough to make Ying Shuang no longer able to clear the
        identity of the suspected inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made her feel astonished as a transmigrator. Gu Changge's methods
        were far more amazing than she thought.
      </p>
      <p>This man was even more dangerous than the inheritor of demonic art!</p>
      <p>"What is Holy Maiden Ziji going to do next?"</p>
      <p>At this time, Gu Changge changed to a thoughtful look.</p>
      <p>
        "I‚Äôll naturally wait for Prince Ying to reveal his intentions, and then
        solve it together. But this matter, I am afraid that it has to be handed
        over to Jiang Chuchu."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji thought for a while and replied that most of the reason she
        did it just now was just to vent her anger. If she really wanted to deal
        with the inheritors of demonic art, she felt that Jiang Chuchu was more
        professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But Jiang Chuchu went to the land of Heavenly Extinction all alone, and
        I don't know what to do now. How about we go find her? It seems
        dangerous."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji thought for a while, and asked worriedly, she didn't know what
        the relationship between Gu Changge and Jiang Chuchu was like.
      </p>
      <p>Logically, the two of them had met twice.</p>
      <p>
        Many people even thought that Jiang Chuchu and Gu Changge had a very
        good relationship, otherwise she would not have expressed her admiration
        and respect for Gu Changge many times in the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when she mentioned Gu Changge in front of Jiang Chuchu, Gu Changge's
        expression was very cold, and it was many times colder than usual.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, since that's the case, then Gu will not intervene after that."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge shook his head, as if he had other things to
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        He found a few ancient monsters with good talent, knowing that they were
        also in the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, so he intended to take the
        opportunity to break through to the middle stage of the Sacred Realm.

      <h4>
        Chapter 256-3: This guy seems to be the Sea King, An Ancient freak from
        the Golden Unicorn family (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        The jet-black aura of Absolute Heavenly Extinction spread between the
        heavens and the earth, making the whole space look gloomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the distance, there were fluctuations of battle, and there were
        creatures with dark eyes who were fighting against the young
        cultivators. The aftermath was very terrifying, and the black fog was so
        thick that the surrounding area of thousands of miles was affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young creature that was attacked was very extraordinary, and its
        fighting power was very strong. However, it did not affect their
        arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were actually quite a few such scenes on the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield right now, and many battles had been breaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quota of True Immortal Academy had made many younger generations
        crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Gu Changge and Wang Ziji, who were recognized as the most powerful
        of the younger generation, still needed to kill these creatures in order
        to gain points and enter the True Immortal Academy to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        So there was no such thing as going through the back door and relying on
        relationships. At this time, all beings were equal, and as long as they
        had points, they could enter the academy to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>"Since Brother Gu said so, then we have to split temporarily."</p>
      <p>
        On the top of the depleted mountain, there were many strange stones with
        strange appearances. The two of them stood side by side, like a pair of
        immortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji was wearing a long light blue dress, with her hands behind her
        back, smiling, the air around her was ethereal and clean, showing
        flawlessness and perfection.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had a special aura on her body that attracted the spiritual energy
        of Heaven, and her whole body was filled with the energy of Immortal
        spirits, as if she could fly away at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes even Gu Changge couldn't help but want to swallow her up. This
        kind of breath was not only as simple as the Immortal spirit, but there
        was another spirit in her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge guessed that it was her golden finger or a companion. But he
        just thought about it, Wang Ziji's methods were hundreds of times more
        difficult than those Ancient freaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Wang Ziji would not affect his follow-up plans. Gu Changge
        thought that he had not yet reached the point of madness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Wang Ziji had plans on him, why didn't he have plans for Wang
        Ziji? This person was greedy for his body and wanted to attack him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge wanted to see who would attack who in the end. At the moment,
        he couldn't help but smile and said, "The Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield is not too big, maybe we will meet again someday. Also,
        thank you for what happened just now. If you didn't give me face at the
        time, I might not be able to step down."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji didn't know if he really thanked him, or if he was just
        talking on the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she still said with a smile on her face, "Even if Brother
        Gu really wants to thank me, then that‚Äôs fine. You owe me a favor, and
        you can remember it later."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled and said, "Okay, then I'll leave first."</p>
      <p>
        Seeing Gu Changge talking like this and not paying much attention to
        Jiang Chuchu's affairs, Wang Ziji didn't ask much. She was just a little
        curious why Jiang Chuchu's expression towards Gu Changge was extremely
        cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was very different from the Jiang Chuchu she knew well. As a woman,
        she had a natural instinct for this kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially after being nurtured by various dog-blood episodes in her
        previous life, she always felt that this matter was a bit resentful of
        women.

        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        It was very difficult for a man like Gu Changge to be tempted by any
        woman. The surface was gentle and jade-like, but it was nothing more
        than disguising the indifference in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, she didn't know what happened between Gu Changge and Jiang
        Chuchu. The descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall who walked outside
        some time ago was actually a fake arranged by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"Then we will part for now," Wang Ziji replied with a smile.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded. Then, with a hum, he took a step forward, his figure
        disappeared, and he appeared thousands of miles away in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>Even Wang Ziji couldn't keep up with his speed at this time.</p>
      <p>
        "This guy‚Ä¶ He is so elusive why is he not interested in me‚Ä¶? Am I not
        attractive enough?" Wang Ziji couldn't help rubbing her eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the first time in her life that she felt tempted by someone. But
        Gu Changge's attitude made her think that he didn't seem to be
        interested in women, as if he was chasing supreme power.
      </p>
      <p>But judging from Gu Changge's many actions, this was not the case.</p>
      <p>He easily got a good impression on that Ying Yu.</p>
      <p>
        "This guy seems to be like the Sea King. Forget it, the more I think
        about it, the more headache I get. I don't believe this guy's heart is
        made of rock‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Wang Ziji left this place. She planned to venture deep into
        the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, Jiang Chuchu seemed to be trapped in there. Her life and death
        was unknown.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        "Master, this area has been occupied by us, and the Heavenly Extinction
        creatures in it have been cleaned up. Most of the cultivation bases are
        around the False God Realm, and there are very few True God Realm‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, after Gu Changge and Wang Ziji separated, he went to
        find his followers. At this moment, Ye Han was respectfully reporting on
        their gains after entering the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that our area is on the periphery, and the real powerhouses
        are still located in the depths."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded, his eyes swept away the area of ??tens of thousands
        of miles, there were no other young creature to be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, because of his name, those people would not dare to stay here
        for a long time unless they wanted to offend him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the followers also had the corpses of Heavenly Extinction
        creatures in their hands, waiting to leave this place and go to the True
        Immortal Academy to exchange for points.
      </p>
      <p>
        A place in the True Immortal Academy required a lot of points, and it
        was completely insufficient for beings in the False God realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge didn't intend to ask for these points in their
        hands. For him, it was enough to just go to the depths and kill a
        Quasi-Sacred Realm creature casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of his coming to the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield was not
        for the quota of the True Immortal Academy. He had to make some
        arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were still a lot of things to do, and there was no time to waste
        on killing Heavenly Extinction beings.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

      <p>
        The jade pendant he gave to Wang Ziji actually had his seal on it. Wang
        Ziji probably didn't notice it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge planned to let her go to find the way for him first, and
        then he would find a way to sneak into the land of Heavenly Extinction
        and see if he could find the core of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as he knew, the existence of Absolutely Heavenly Extinction was
        inseparable from the core area that existed when it was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        For countless years, the outbreak of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction
        involved many worlds, and the almost incomprehensible devouring power
        was enough to make all existences fear it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the core area, there was the original substance that gave birth to
        the absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge planned to devour it with his Great Dao treasure bottle. It
        was not impossible, and there was also an almighty Destiny Value. For
        these, Gu Changge had made a lot of preparations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the Heavenly Extinction aura in the depths of the land of
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction was very strong, and ordinary creatures
        couldn't stick to that kind of place at all as they would be swallowed
        by the Heavenly Extinction aura on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was not worried about any strong existence that would get in
        the way of his plans. The scope of this Heavenly Extinction Battlefield
        in front of him was quite large, but the area occupied by Ye Han and the
        others was actually still small.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge thought about it and intended to cover their ears and
        simply instructed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well done, but with this amount of points, it's still far from enough.
        This is my token, if anyone dares to interfere next, use it to notify
        me. I'll leave this place for a while." ùí©ewW ùíèovels updùíÇtes on
        nov/ùíÜl/b(i)ùíè(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        After saying that, he threw the token in his hand to Ye Han. His
        identity was very special, many people were staring at him, at this time
        if he wanted to do something, it would be very troublesome.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge planned to take off his shell in gold, using the excuse of
        leaving the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, so that fewer young
        existences would pay attention to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time comes, there would also be much less trouble. Seeing this
        scene, the rest of the followers couldn't help but be envious, being
        able to get the token given by the master meant that Ye Han was highly
        valued.
      </p>
      <p>
        They did not have such an honor. Ye Han was also excited as he
        respectfully accepted the token, and hurriedly said, "Master, please
        rest assured, this subordinate will definitely complete the task you
        entrusted to me."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded, "I'm still at ease with your work."</p>
      <p>
        Saying that his figure left this place, and he quickly disappeared
        without a trace.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I wonder what the reason is for the master to leave the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield, is there something big going on outside?"
      </p>
      <p>
        After seeing Gu Changge leave, a heavenly girl with a pretty face
        couldn't help but ask with some doubts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know, the Master's affairs, and it's not something we can ask."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's better to finish what Master has explained first, with Master's
        identity around, when we encounter a Heavenly Extinction being, not many
        people would dare to compete with us, this is a good opportunity to
        enter the True Immortal Academy."
      </p>
      <p>
        A few followers next to him smiled and shook their heads, not daring to
        ask more questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many young existences then did notice that Gu Changge‚Äôs figure had
        appeared at the entrance place of the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        He seemed to have left the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield and returned
        to the outside world. This news made many people a little uncomfortable,
        Gu Changge was now deservedly dominant in the young generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Heavenly Emperor's Son, Ying Shuang, acould not help but weaken
        a few chips in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Gu Changge was no longer in the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield
        the competition had weakened, frankly speaking, many people were
        relieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Heavenly Extinction Battlefield was a huge territory, and the area
        where Gu Changge was located was only a very small area. The news about
        him also spread only in a small area and did not make a big ripple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu, Ye Langtian, Wang Ziji, and others did hear about it, but each

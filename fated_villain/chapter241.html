      <h4>
        Chapter 241-1: Gu Changge presence was not an imagination, Just a
        disciple? (1)
      </h4>
      <p>It was not without basis that Yue Mingkong would think so.</p>
      <p>
        The importance of the Nirvana Green Lotus needed no further explanation,
        even the Human Ancestor had been planning hard for this Green Lotus for
        a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After much effort, twists and turns, he finally found a suitable place
        for its growth in the Heavenly Star Realm, and he chose to pick it when
        it would mature.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why did the unknown mysterious existence left behind those equally
        precious Lotus seeds after merging with the Nirvana Green Lotus, instead
        of taking them away. Were they planning to give them to later
        generations?
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong was very confused, looking at the few chaotic Lotus seeds
        in the depths of the Lotus body, all kinds of thoughts flashed in his
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>Did the mysterious existence accidentally forget about these?</p>
      <p>How likely was this?</p>
      <p>Soon, she shook her head and thought that it was impossible.</p>
      <p>This was too far-fetched.</p>
      <p>
        After all, even the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor was defeated in
        his hands, and it was still in the Netherland Heavenly Pond, the place
        where the Human Ancestor laid down many traps.
      </p>
      <p>Would that mysterious existence make such an obvious mistake?</p>
      <p>
        Also, Yue Mingkong had already felt a vague sense of familiarity before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Women had always believed in their intuition, and Yue Mingkong was no
        exception.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she frowned immediately, almost concluding that the mysterious
        existence deliberately left it for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she had never seen the true face at all, and she was not even sure
        who that mysterious existence was.
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn't understand why the other party would leave it for her. Or
        was the monstrous figure who was outside the Netherland Heavenly Pond
        and warned her not to approach it also what the other party did?
      </p>
      <p>The two of them had never even seen each other.</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, now there was only the last possibility left, that was the
        mysterious Immortal who was suspected to have fallen in the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why did he do this…" Yue Mingkong frowned, feeling that she was getting
        close to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that the mysterious Immortal deliberately fell in the
        Netherland Heavenly Pond, just to confuse the world and paralyze the
        senses of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of calculation instantly reminded Yue Mingkong of someone, her
        fiance Gu Changge!
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides Gu Changge, who else had such a means to destroy the Human
        Ancestor on the site of his reincarnation?
      </p>
      <p>And, reconnecting with those familiarities.</p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>The truth almost surfaced!</p>
      <p>"Gu Changge…"</p>
      <p>"It must be this guy…"</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong gritted her teeth a little, almost instantly deciding.</p>
      <p>
        Except for Gu Changge, she thought about all the possibilities, but she
        couldn't think of anyone else who had such a terrible method.
      </p>
      <p>She suddenly got angry.</p>
      <p>
        This unscrupulous guy had been secretly hiding by her side for so long!
      </p>
      <p>
        But thinking that he was also secretly hiding his visit to the Lower
        Realm, Yue Mingkong didn't know what to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, speaking of it, she was also at a loss. Although she did have
        the idea of ??solving the problem of the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor and helping Gu Changge, Gu Changge didn't know about it.
      </p>
      <p>Now it seemed that it was Gu Changge who did something to her.</p>
      <p>
        That was why he could know her whereabouts, follow her secretly to the
        Lower Realm, and hide in the dark, never showing his face from beginning
        to end.
      </p>
      <p>That mysterious Immortal was also an image made by Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Yue Mingkong thought of the strangeness of Jiang Yang's
        appointment at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it seemed that Gu Changge helped her secretly at that time,
        otherwise Jiang Yang would not have gone there and let her plan an
        ambush.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all these things, Yue Mingkong couldn't help rubbing her eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before she felt that Gu Changge had placed eyeliner beside her, saying
        that he trusted her, but in fact, he was still paying attention to her
        movements.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Ancient Immortal Continent, Gu Changge found her many times
        because of this method.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she had clearly cleaned up all the people around her, but how did Gu
        Changge find her?
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that my actions when I left the Gu family caused Changge's
        suspicion, so he followed."
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong whispered to herself, and quickly found a doubt that would
        make Gu Changge suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>It should be that she was too hasty when she left the banquet.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was thoughtful and meticulous, so he would naturally notice
        this doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong was not in a hurry to explain to Gu Changge after returning
        to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Gu Changge had followed him all the way, he should have seen
        everything she did.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong didn't believe that Gu Changge would continue to be
        suspicious of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But this guy is still a bit conscientious, and he even left me some of
        the soup."
      </p>
      <p>
        After Yue Mingkong understood this, she breathed a sigh of relief and
        showed a slight smile.
      </p>
      <p>This time there was nothing strange about it.</p>
      <p>
        These Nirvana Lotus seeds seemed to be reserved for her by Gu Changge on
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        So she waved her sleeves, and a burst of multi-colored divine light
        swept across, and took them all directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, she left here, intending to end it, get rid of some easily
        exposed troubles, and then return to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Gu Changge had personally solved the biggest hidden trouble of
        Human Ancestor, she had nothing to worry about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Gu Changge wanted to see her, she also knew that, by her own
        means, it was impossible to find Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some things, it seemed that she would only get asked after returning
        to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she was worried that with Gu Changge's temperament, he would
        refuse to accept the account at that time, saying that all this had
        nothing to do with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        One must say that Yue Mingkong didn't fully understand Gu Changge's
        temperament now, but she had already felt it very clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge would leave Nirvana Green Lotus seeds for her, which had
        already shown that she had a certain position in Gu Changge's mind.
      </p>
      <p>This still made Yue Mingkong very happy.</p>
      <p>
        She, who had always been indifferent in front of her subordinates,
        couldn't help showing a faint smile today.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        On the other side, after being shot down into the Heavenly Pond by that
        gray fog in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao felt that she had withdrawn from that state of indifference and
        saw everything as ants.
      </p>
      <p>
        She no longer had the power of the strongest, who could destroy the
        world at once, but had once again become that weak girl who couldn't
        even kill a chicken.
      </p>
      <p>And now she was slowly falling into the depths of the lake.</p>
      <p>
        She felt powerless and desperate, let alone struggling, she couldn’t
        even exert a trace of strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying pressure came from above, and it was still astonishing
        across the lake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under that kind of pressure, all living beings could only choose to
        kneel on the ground and dare not move. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on

      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao knew that with her grandma's strength, she couldn't save her at
        this time. Maybe her grandma rushed up and fought against that
        terrifying figure, and was already one step ahead of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        They had already torn their relationship with Jiang Yang, so he couldn't
        save her grandma.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of these things, Yaoyao was a little sad.</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 241-2: Gu Changge presence was not an imagination, Just a
        disciple? (2)
      </h4>
      <p>Speaking of which, this had nothing to do with her grandma.</p>
      <p>
        She came here with her and could stay outside, but because of her, she
        put her grandma’s life in danger here.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, that kind of terrifying existence, apart from the Master,
        probably no one could defeat it, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        She was going to die here, to accompany her Master, her grandma, and her
        elder brother Jiang Yang, who was long gone.
      </p>
      <p>Many scenes flashed in her mind.</p>
      <p>
        There were scenes of playing with her brother when she was a child, and
        there were days when she got along with her grandma, but more of it was
        the day and night with the Master.
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao can't avenge you, Master…"</p>
      <p>"But I'll see you soon."</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, the thing that she regretted the most was not finding
        any trace of Gu Changge, not killing Jiang Yang, avenging her Master.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao closed her eyes tightly and did not notice the position between
        her eyebrows, the peach petal-like pattern was blooming with dazzling
        brilliance, reflecting the dark lake bottom into a splendid sight.
      </p>
      <p>There was a strange light emerging.</p>
      <p>
        A Peach Tree rooted in endless Chaos could be seen faintly, where the
        Divine chain of laws hung down.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, Yaoyao felt that she had fallen to the bottom.</p>
      <p>
        But why didn't it feel like falling in the mud, instead it was so warm?
      </p>
      <p>There was no imaginary cold and dark.</p>
      <p>
        It was like the time when she fell from the sky that day and was
        suddenly caught by the Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wanted to open her eyes. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, a gentle voice suddenly sounded in her ears,
        like a clear spring flowing over a rock, natural and warm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why is the little girl so disobedient? I asked you to wait for me in
        the Immortal Lun Sect, why did you sneak here alone?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing these familiar words, Yaoyao suddenly opened her eyes and looked
        at the scene in front of her in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't know when, but the nearby lake had been emptied, forming a
        gentle space.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        And the man in white who spoke in front of her and caught her was not
        the Master she was familiar with?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Impossible, isn't Master already dead? Could it be that this is the
        legendary underworld, I saw the Master in the underworld…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao looked at all this in disbelief and then murmured softly,
        thinking that she was already dead, that was why she met Master in this
        place.
      </p>
      <p>But her Master was way too beautiful!</p>
      <p>
        No wonder she couldn't usually see the real face of her Master, he had
        to cover it with fog so that no one could see it clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, when so many women saw it, wouldn't they be scrambling to
        become his mistress?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Yaoyao suddenly felt a little happy. Although she
        died, she finally fulfilled a wish she had always wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        She finally saw what her Master looked like. She had always known that
        the Master should not be very old.
      </p>
      <p>He was not one of those dull oldies.</p>
      <p>
        Thinking like this, she suddenly didn't know where the courage came
        from, she stretched out her small hand, it was like a ghost, and she
        even touched her Master's face.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that she wanted to see if the Master in front of her was real
        or fake.
      </p>
      <p>However, a hand stood in front of her and hit her on the head.</p>
      <p>At the same time, it was accompanied by a slightly helpless voice.</p>
      <p>
        "You little girl, what are you thinking about? Your Master is so
        powerful, how could you die, and even if you are in the underworld, your
        Master can take you away."
      </p>
      <p>"Huh?!"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's little head suddenly couldn't turn around. How could Master
        suddenly say such a thing, could it be that all of this was completely
        imaginary?
      </p>
      <p>Or was her Master really not dead? She had always thought wrong.</p>
      <p>"Master…"</p>
      <p>Yaoyao intended to speak and ask again.</p>
      <p>
        However, in the next moment, the Master in front of her suddenly moved,
        and with a wave of his robe, the whole lake began to shake, as if it was
        pushed away by a pair of invisible hands, and it was isolated.
      </p>
      <p>After that, he took her to the sky and quickly left the place.</p>
      <p>
        Looking at the scene in front of her, no matter how slow Yaoyao's
        reaction was, this time she had already reacted.
      </p>
      <p>"Master, Master, you are really not dead…"</p>
      <p>
        She couldn't help but let out a voice, her little face was full of
        tears, and she burst into tears, hugging Gu Changge tightly.
      </p>
      <p>Master treated him well and did not die.</p>

      </div>
      <p>
        During this period of time, emotions such as worry, anxiety and sadness
        erupted together, as if the embankment had burst, and her tears could
        not be stopped at all.
      </p>
      <p>"How could your Master die? What are you thinking?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge touched her head helplessly, his voice was unprecedentedly
        gentle, and then said, "It seems that during this period of time, when
        Master was away, a lot of things have indeed happened."
      </p>
      <p>"I'm sorry, Master, I made you worry."</p>
      <p>
        At this time, he definitely couldn't say that he had been hiding in the
        depths of the Netherland Heavenly Pond to watch the show.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, he told Yaoyao that he had an accident at the time and was
        trapped here, unaware of what was happening outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't know what to say to this pure and kind girl, so he
        could only give her as much compensation as possible in the future.
      </p>
      <p>Since he was her Master, he naturally couldn't abandon her at will.</p>
      <p>Either way, it was the same.</p>
      <p>
        And even if he didn't show up just now, Yaoyao would be fine. As the Dao
        fruit, the power she had shown until now was only a small part.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could it be possible to drown her with just a little lake water?
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that she didn't know it herself, and had been worrying about
        it all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's words, Yaoyao cried even more, as if she wanted to
        cry out all the sadness and grief she had experienced during this
        period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shook his head slightly, at this time, he released an aura of
        Immortal spirit and passed by, so as not to hurt her heart at this time.
      </p>
      <p>Under great joy and great sorrow, this was the easiest.</p>
      <p>In this little girl's heart, he occupied an unparalleled position.</p>
      <p>And soon, Yaoyao slowly came over this great sadness and joy.</p>
      <p>
        Remembering the disrespectful act she had just done, her face turned a
        little red.
      </p>
      <p>She looked up.</p>
      <p>
        Those flawless and moving eyes like black gems stared at Gu Changge,
        "Master, don't leave Yaoyao alone next time, okay?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing her almost pleading tone, Gu Changge shook his head slightly and
        smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he said warmly, "How could Master leave you alone? Didn't he
        promise you that even if you couldn't cultivate, he would still support
        you as a teacher?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Little girl has been thinking about what to write all day, you are the
        disciple of the teacher."
      </p>
      <p>
        When Yaoyao heard this, she was a little stunned, not happy for some
        reason.
      </p>
      <p>The tone was also a little low, like a loss.</p>
      <p>"Yaoyao is just a disciple to Master…"</p>
      <p>
        "Of course, it's not just the disciple. I didn't tell you that for the
        Master, sometimes the disciple is more closer than his relatives."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge touched her head, and his voice was as gentle
        and calm as ever.

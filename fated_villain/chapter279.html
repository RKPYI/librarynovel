        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing Zu was not an unfamiliar name to the Elders of the Immortal Academy. The
                name once represented a terrifying being once upon a time.</span><span id="more-27919"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!* Another disturbance occurred from another direction, followed by
                the appearance of the most intimidating figures of Immortal Academy. One of them was an old man called
                Lao Shi. His presence left the white woman in white named Xing Zu stunned, while the rest of the Elders
                stupefied. They all respectfully greeted him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Elder Shi!&#8221; Xing Zu slightly bowed to Lao Shi.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t need to be so courteous, Xing Zu. It&#8217;s been so many
                years, and you&#8217;ve grown even younger.&#8221; Lao Shi subtly smiled</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Xing Zu bitterly grinned. &#8220;Stop teasing me, Elder Shi. You
                know I can&#8217;t physically do that.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Lao Shi wordlessly smiled. He then turned to the Wondrous Stone
                and said, &#8220;Anyway, the Wondrous Stone and I can be considered to be of the same root since
                we&#8217;re both stones. However, the being inside it wouldn&#8217;t come out, and I can’t deduce its
                actual origin.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re joking, Elder Shi. If even you are unable to identify its
                origin, how can any of us do that?&#8221; Xing Zu helplessly grinned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I am not joking,&#8221; Lao Shi replied with a smile.
                If it weren&#8217;t for the Wondrous Stone, he wouldn&#8217;t have come over.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than Lao Shi and Xing Zu, many Elders of various forces, including many
                in the Sacred Emperor Realm, were gathered, to witness the rebirth of the being inside the Wondrous
                Stone. In that instant, everyone was fully attentive as all eyes were on the Wondrous Stone.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Crack!* The next moment, the brightly glowing Wondrous Stone
                suddenly shook. Covered in mystical energy and distinctive Grand Runes that were constantly spewing out,
                the Wondrous Stone appeared extremely mysterious. Cracks slowly occurred on it, revealing vibrant lights
                and traces of Chaos Qi, which made it seem even incomparably extraordinary.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, mysterious runes swirled into the air, and instantaneously, the crowd
                could see a vast, mysterious world surging from within the Wondrous Stone, where mythical beasts and
                primordial trees dwelt, seemingly extremely ancient.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What a startling rebirth! Could really be the rebirth of a True
                Immortal…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even if it isn&#8217;t, it must be someone on par that&#8217;s related
                to the Immortals. The disturbance alone must indicate that its physique is superior to whatever that is
                known. Is the world within the stone the legendary Nine Realms?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Speaking of disturbances caused by one’s birth, the Gifted Lady from
                the Wang Family was the most shocking one yet. It had only been revealed by the Immortal Wang Family
                recently. They had hidden it exceptionally well.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She&#8217;s the Successor of the Mortal Palace after all. She was born
                already in the Sacred Realm. It is indeed incomparable.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        </p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradually, the crowd started conversing as their eyes were all filled with
                immense shock, keenness, and curiosity. None tried to stop the process before them as they were all
                anticipating the living being within the Wondrous Stone about to be reborn.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Very soon, following the last crack on the Wondrous Stone, a talisman
                was shot into the sky. Quickly, only an ambiguous figure whose face was concealed by runes was seen
                sitting within the Wondrous Stone. Nonetheless, what caught the most attention was the gleaming
                celestial energy on its body, as if it was an ancient Immortal that had been sealed for a long
                time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was distinguishable that the figure belonged to a man. His ancient
                garments were artifacts of millennia ago, but for now, there was no telling exactly which era they
                belonged to.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am finally reborn. This familiar atmosphere of the world, the
                Principles of the World… I am finally out of that damned Nine Realms. It has truly been three hundred
                years of hellish torment!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the man in the Wondrous Stone seemed to be talking to himself
                as his face was full of excitement, amazement, and thrill. His intonation, not of the current era, was
                of an ancient age. It was incomprehensible even for Lao Shi and the Elders. Nevertheless, they could
                roughly make out that he was talking about the Nine Realms.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Lao Shi was stunned. [His intonation seems to originate from the
                Forbidden Epoch that was buried in the River of Time. Is he from the same era as me?] Lao Shi was
                visibly perturbed by his complicated thoughts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am finally out into the world. Even so, the state of the outside
                world remains unknown. I have spent three hundred years in the Nine Realms, but that must not be as long
                to the outside world.&#8221; The man in the Wondrous Stone was still muttering to himself, disregarding
                the presence of those observing him as he was fully immersed in his memories.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once upon a time, his name was Qin Wuya, and he was a renowned senior of
                Borderless Sect. Possessing excellent Talents, he earned the respect of his Elders and Juniors. He also
                took in a female Junior who was focused on walking the Path of the Great Dao, and he also had a gentle
                partner who loved him to the bones.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything was perfect.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, it was not until one day when he ventured out into the world to
                cultivate that he encountered a crevice and accidentally fell into it. And that crevice was the path
                towards the fabled, mysterious Nine Realms.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, he never expected to be that unfortunate. Nine Realms, a legendary
                place countless cultivators hoped to reach one day, was so easily found by him. In Nine Realms, he
                discovered as many hazards as allies, whom he then made his codependent partner to survive. And so, he
                struggled in agony for three hundred years.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Qin Wuya found a Celestial Origin Stone and hurriedly thought of
                a way to seal himself within. As Celestial Origin Stones were the only thing that could break through
                the barriers of Nine Realms into other worlds, he knew it was his only way of leaving Nine Realms. And
                only by leaving Nine Realms could he return to his Sect to reunite with his Elders, partner, and
                Juniors. Thus, Qin Wuya was in awe right now, unaware of the surrounders that were observing him with
                weird faces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His bloodline… It&#8217;s strange…&#8221; A Grand Rune flashed across Lao
                Shi&#8217;s eyes as he frowned. &#8220;The aura belongs to a human, and an ordinary human being at that.
                What is going on? Did I have it all wrong?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confused, Xing Zu nodded and replied, &#8220;Indeed, he&#8217;s a human, and
                his cultivation level is not exactly high either. We might have gotten it wrong…&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were shocked and disbelieving to discover that, upon the dispersion of
                the vibrant lights, the man in the Wondrous Stone seemed too normal. Except for his ancient garments,
                nothing about him seemed unique, be it his appearance or body shape, and his cultivation level was only
                in the Enlightened Noble Realm. No being in the world could be more ordinary than him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, the anomalies that occurred along his rebirth were only
                fabricated by the Wondrous Stone, while the grand disturbance was caused by the spiritual materials that
                Immortal Academy piled up for a long time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So much for the rebirth of a True Immortal…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;D*mn. How disappointing.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young female disciples nearby the mountaintop expressed their
                disconcertment as the result was awfully underwhelming.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was expecting it to be a man as mighty as Young Master Changge, only
                to witness this atrocity. This man undoubtedly bears no relation to a True Immortal. In contrast, Young
                Master Changge is the one who seems to be related to the Immortals, and his title, Avatar of the True
                Immortal, isn&#8217;t baselessly earned…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, whether it was young prodigies or Elders, everyone was
                stupefied and in dismay as their built-up anticipation was shattered by this ordinary man. Hence, the
                disparity between their expectation and the actual event was nothing but drastic, rendering them
                absolutely speechless. It was as the saying went, &#8216;the harder they fly, the harder they
                fall.&#8217;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things would have been easier to explain if the man possessed a higher level
                of cultivation, yet his aura or qualities were nowhere close to those of an Immortal, as if he was
                merely a nobody that luckily bumped into the Wondrous Stone for no good reason.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This…&#8221; In the meantime, the Phoenix Lady and Prince Shen, who
                were eager for the rebirth of the Wondrous Stone, were visibly dazed by the massive twist.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Immortal Academy&#8217;s Wondrous Stone that was said to have fallen
                from the sky is quite the let down, huh.&#8221; Prince Shen subconsciously shook his head as he grew
                sceptical towards the term &#8216;Wondrous Stone.&#8217;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the Phoenix Lady remained silent, though her emotions in
                her eyes betrayed her expressionlessness. She was expecting the rebirth of a formidable foe, only to
                find out it was a man who was ordinary in every way.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, to be fair, as ordinary as he was, he would still be perceived as an
                outstanding talent in the outside world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By right, things aren&#8217;t supposed to be this simple…&#8221; Lao
                Shi was still assiduously observing Qin Wuya, thinking that he must possess numberless secrets. [His
                cultivation level is certainly suspicious. He has been sealed for so many years and soaked in dense
                celestial energy. This isn&#8217;t right. Is this man deliberately hiding something?]</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, Qin Wuya finally noticed the situation around him and the crowd
                that was peering at him. Instantaneously, he came to a realisation. He could understand the
                condescension and doubt in the eyes of these surrounders, but he wasn&#8217;t bothered by them. Having
                survived Nine Realms for three hundred years, he came to acknowledge many lessons, and staying a low
                profile would be the wisest choice ever.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, his actual strength was definitely not as simple as Enlightened
                Noble Realm, which was his cultivation level before he fell into Nine Realms. During his time in Nine
                Realms, he had undergone a tremendous increase in his cultivation level and also obtained numerous
                celestial treasures that could only be found in Nine Realms. Therefore, he wasn&#8217;t concerned by the
                opinions of the crowd, unless they actually dared to explicitly provoke him.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now, I must figure out what place this is and how long it has been since I
                fell into Nine Realms. Those are my priorities now,] Qin Wuya said in his heart, contemplating his next
                moves.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the depths of Immortal Academy were filled with merriness as many young
                prodigies and Elders hurried over, Gu Changge appeared at the top of a grand mountain. His limitlessly
                vast divine sense covered the entire region, and he was only relieved when he finally made sure there
                was no being that could detect his presence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess now is the best opportunity for me.&#8221; Gu Changge revealed
                a deep grin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, he directed his gaze downwards and noticed Ying Shuang, who was
                cultivating in a sitting posture with his eyes shut, in the cave below him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Gu Changge had no intention of engaging Ying Shuang as the latter
                could still prove useful for his plans. After all, there was insufficient chaos, and he would need
                assistance from the dark.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, Gu Changge set his target on a secluded forest, which
                wasn&#8217;t far from Ying Shuang&#8217;s cave, but it was a number of young prodigies’ caves away. The
                forest was gloomy with absence of light. There were various ancient herbs growing outside of it,
                emitting dense purplish gleams out of the crevices of rocks which then vaporised in the air.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the forest, there was another cave, in which sounds were barely audible.
                Perfect for cultivating. Evidently, the cultivator must be at a crucial point in their cultivation. A
                young prodigy, possessing a unique physique, was cultivating with his legs crossed as mists arose around
                him. Focused on his cultivation, he didn&#8217;t even notice Gu Changge&#8217;s glare at him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* At the mountaintop, Gu Changge took a step forward and his body
                instantly vanished into the air.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You—&#8221; A shocked, incredulous voice reverberated through the
                cave, which was then overtaken by silence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiftly, Gu Changge appeared once again with an unaffected look. There was
                nothing but dead silence in the cave, and not even a trace of life or sound. In other words, there were
                no young prodigy in the cave at all.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Gu Changge took a glimpse at the cave Ying Shuang was in and revealed a
                momentarily, uncanny grin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, the being inside Immortal Academy&#8217;s Wondrous Stone has
                been reborn, but it turned out to be a strange youth. Although his origin is ancient and mysterious, his
                cultivation level is rather low. He is only in the Enlightened Noble Realm, and that has left the masses
                disappointed.” After returning to his palace, Gu Changge listened to the reports of his followers and
                was surprised. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Enlightened Noble Realm? After all the build-up? Such an underwhelming
                outcome?] He tensed his brows.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Gu Changge was informed of the news, but he didn&#8217;t go to
                witness the event himself. Essentially, he had to take the opportunity to help &#8216;prove&#8217; that
                Ying Shuang was the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, many Elders and Ranked Disciples rushed over there only to be
                disappointed. Eventually, the mysterious youth was taken away by the Elders, seemingly for an
                interrogation,&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s follower respectfully replied.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Changge nodded with a pondering look as he dismissed his
                follower with a wave of his hand. For some reason, he could tell that the youth sealed within the
                Wondrous Stone was more than meets the eye. Besides, Enlightened Noble Realm was quite a low cultivation
                level to the Immortal Academy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the day of Qin Wuya&#8217;s rebirth from within the Wondrous Stone, a
                piece of news was widely spread to the world by disciples of Immortal Academy, causing great turmoil. It
                was pertaining to the unnoticed disappearance of a young prodigy, who possessed a unique
                physique.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the young prodigy had vanished into nothingness when he was
                cultivating in the cave all by himself, leaving no traces of a clash or energy. Even the Elders that
                went to investigate the site found no oddities and felt helpless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the news dispersed, many were dumbfounded as a notable panic followed.
                After concluding the incident, the people immediately tied it to the Successor of Demonic Arts. After
                all, many precedent cases indicated that the Successor of Demonic Arts tended to abduct young prodigies
                with unique physiques and leave without any traces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, young prodigies and Elders came to a conclusion from the grave
                news. Without a doubt, the young prodigy in the cave was taken away by the Successor of Demonic Arts,
                which suggested that the Successor of Demonic Arts infiltrated the Immortal Academy and was hiding among
                the youths under a different guise, hence none could discern his real identity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, the conclusion caused another turmoil and panic, whereby
                unfamiliar young prodigies were treated with hostility. At the same time, the Elders also commenced
                their investigation in an attempt to find out who the real Successor of Demonic Arts was. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is very hasty of you. You barely entered Immortal Academy for
                long yet you&#8217;re already starting to move. Although you have done a good job covering your tracks,
                it&#8217;s too reckless to act now. What if you were seen?&#8221; At that moment, Mo Lao appeared in a
                cave with intertwining godly lights, speaking sternly with Ying Shuang out of concern.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he first heard that a young prodigy was attacked by the Successor of
                Demonic Arts, he quickly thought of Ying Shuang, since he was the one who took Ying Shuang in. Though
                the latter never displayed any of his Forbidden Demonic Arts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, judging by the past incidents and rumours, Mo Lao thought that
                Ying Shuang was undoubtedly the Successor of Demonic Arts, and the Successor of Demonic Arts&#8217;
                appearance this time must also be the doing of Ying Shuang. Thus, he came over to question Ying Shuang,
                worried that he might accidentally expose his true identity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Ying Shuang calmly answered, &#8220;I know my limits. There
                won&#8217;t be an issue.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite saying that, Ying Shuang was hiding his tightly clenching fists
                underneath his robe, feeling immensely infuriated and disaffected. Although he certainly needed the
                identity of the Successor of Demonic Arts to gain Mo Lao&#8217;s support, he couldn&#8217;t afford to be
                innocently framed again and again.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel enraged and frustrated as he was
                wrongly blamed for someone else’s doing. He never even stepped out of his cave once, yet he was framed
                to be the abductor of the young prodigy. Even worse, he had no choice but to admit that it was his
                doing. [Is there anything more frustrating and unfair than this!?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s the case, do proceed with caution. Don&#8217;t
                be too impetuous.&#8221; In response, Mo Lao nodded and left after he was reassured.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;D*mn it! Another strike!&#8221; After Mo Lao left, Ying Shuang&#8217;s
                face was turned grave, one which was filled with immense rage and exasperation.</span></p>

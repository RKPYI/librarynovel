<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the main hall, the fragrance of the tea lingered in the air as steam curled up from the cups of tea.</span><span id="more-28485"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Gu Changge finished speaking, there was complete silence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Qingxuan stood beside Gu Changge and filled his cup with tea. She looked at the woman in the purple dress in front of her from time to time, who appeared quiet and graceful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman in the purple dress seemed only around 20 years old, and the light veil that had been used to cover her face was also taken off. Her pretty face was pale and delicate. Her lips and teeth were sparkling, and her hair was black. Her beauty was transcendent and ethereal. But at this moment, her beautiful face as pretty as a picture was covered with all kinds of black and white marks, which looked extremely out of place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she was a little embarrassed and distressed, she still behaved herself. If those young prodigies outside saw this scene, they would have their eyes wide open in disbelief. Then, they would become furious, wishing to jump out to support the Saintess and wash away the shame.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a piece in her hand, Liu Ziyan was about to put it down. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she did not see anything that could turn the tables on him. He had seal off any of her escape routes without leaving her any chance of surviving. She was stunned for a moment and didn&#8217;t know what to do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, she could only sigh with a little disappointment. &#8220;I lost again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, every time she asked for advice about chess from Gu Changge, she would always lose miserably.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She believed that she was a great player. No matter what kind of opponent she had met before, even if they had immersed themselves in the game of chess for hundreds or thousands of years, she was confident that she could defeat them and win.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in front of Gu Changge, who was around her age, Liu Ziyan always failed and never won. No matter what, she couldn&#8217;t find any chance of survival. Every route of hers, even her retreat, would be set up and blocked off by Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, she couldn&#8217;t believe it. After all, one&#8217;s time was always limited. His cultivation level was already so high, which meant that he had spent a lot of time cultivating. But why was his chess skills so great? Even better than her own, who had studied this field intensely for a long time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t accept this. How could there be someone with such monstrous talent in this world?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the way Gu Changge played chess was flawless and every step he took was interlocking. Even if she had just fought with him on the chessboard, she could not help but feel a palpitation in her heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reminded her of the scene she had seen that day. Although she couldn&#8217;t be so bold as to take all living beings as pawns on a chess board, with Heaven and Earth as his set. Of course, what she didn&#8217;t know was that Gu Changge, the so-called ‘master of chess’, was depending on the hints that the System had given him. Before this, he didn&#8217;t know anything about chess. He just learned all these thing on the spot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, if it weren&#8217;t for Liu Ziyan, he wouldn&#8217;t have spent so much time studying chess.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Saintess Ziyan, you’ve lost again. I&#8217;ve already let you off with three moves, but I didn&#8217;t expect that the result would still be like this.&#8221; Hearing this, Gu Changge sighed helplessly and smiled. Then, he raised his wrist, unconsciously picked up the brush next to him, dipped it in ink, and was about to apply it to the face of the beauty in front of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liu Ziyan bit her lips and stared straight at him nervously. &#8220;Young Master Changge, can’t you let me off?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How many times have I given in to you? Does Saintess Ziyan want to play a rascal now?&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seemed as beautiful as a jade at this moment. Even if what they were doing now was a little abominable, it was difficult for the women to have a sense of disgust. Hearing this, she had no choice but to close her eyes as if she was destined to do so. Her long eyelashes trembled slightly, allowing Gu Changge to draw on her face randomly with a brush.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who would have thought that in order to learn chess from him, she even made a bet? Of course, this bet was proposed by him. She didn&#8217;t think there was anything wrong, but she was a little bit on the edge as a result of his evil interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll make do with this.&#8221; Soon, Gu Changge stopped with a look of interest. With her eyes down, Liu Ziyan was annoyed. Without looking at the bronze mirror, she knew that her face must be filled with ink and black brushstrokes. This was simply torturing for a woman, who loved beauty. No one could do such a thing except for Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Again.&#8221; Then, she raised her head and said again. There was a stubborn and unyielding look in her eyes as if she had to win against him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head, picked up the teacup, and held it up to his mouth. His eyes were calm and composed, with a transcendent demeanor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t. Young Master Changge, you’re such a bully. How can you just refuse like this&#8221; Liu Ziyan suddenly stood up, a little angry, and was not as calm as before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she didn&#8217;t win a round against him, she would really turn insane.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyway, Saintess Ziyan, you can&#8217;t win against me. It&#8217;s not interesting to keep winning anyway.&#8221; Hearing this, Gu Changge replied slowly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liu Ziyan understood what he was implying. He felt that such a bet was getting boring and senseless. So she asked directly, &#8220;What can I do to make you agree to play the next round with me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saintess Ziyan, why are you so stubborn about this? Have you fallen in love with the feeling of being mistreated by me?&#8221; Gu Changge asked with a somewhat strange smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liu Ziyan was stunned and her face flushed. She hurriedly waved her hand and said, &#8220;Young Master Changge, please don&#8217;t spout nonsense. I&#8217;m just happy to have my old interest awakened again. I don&#8217;t mean anything else.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled. There were no flaws on his handsome face. Even though his face was pale and he was still badly injured, his demeanor was still refined and extraordinary. He looked out at the window and gently placed the teacup down. &#8220;Here I am starting to think you are really planning on bringing a grandson back to Purple Mansion. Otherwise, why are you pushing so hard for this?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, her face became redder, but it was not obvious because of the ink.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She calmed down and explained hurriedly, &#8220;Young Master Changge, please stop joking around. Ziyan has never had such thoughts.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also knew of the many rumors on the outside that were spreading these days. Especially what Gu Changge said to the Sect Master of Purple Mansion, about him experiencing the joy of becoming a grandfather. When she first heard it, she was stunned for a long time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, she pretended to be serious and asked Gu Changge about it, but in return, he said, &#8220;Oh, Saintess Ziyan, your dreams are certainly picturesque.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn&#8217;t forget her stupefied, ashamed and furious expression. How she wished she could find a hole to hide in. Although she obviously knew that she was only under house arrest in the eyes of the outside world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she herself had believed in it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, she could tell that he had no interest in her at all. Otherwise, why did he say that?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, it seems that I&#8217;m thinking too much.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and then seemed to be lost in thought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing his expression, Liu Ziyan couldn&#8217;t help but ask curiously, &#8220;Young Master Changge, you have been looking outside for a while. Is there anything wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, Gu Changge took a look at her and shook his head. &#8220;I just feel a little restless all of a sudden. It seems that it wouldn’t be peaceful for the next few days. Saintess Ziyan, you should pay attention and be careful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I should pay attention to?&#8221; Liu Ziyan was stunned and didn&#8217;t understand what he meant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;d better move in and stay close to me for the next few days,&#8221; Gu Changge didn&#8217;t explain anything else and only said this one sentence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge&#8230; No way… I&#8230; I won&#8217;t give you a baby!&#8221; Hearing this, Liu Ziyan was stunned for a while. Then, with a sudden panic on her face, she couldn&#8217;t help but take a few steps back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, the first thing that popped up in her mind was the fact that a few days ago, Gu Changge told her father that he would make him experience the joy of becoming a grandfather. So, she blurted it out in a hurry. But as soon as she said that, she felt something was wrong, that her reaction seemed to be too over the top.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saintess Ziyan, why do you always think about things that are too good to be true?&#8221; Hearing this, Gu Changge raised his eyebrows and seemed to be a little helpless. &#8220;I mean, you moving in here. If anything happens, I can take care of you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing him say this, Liu Ziyan reacted quickly and opened her eyes slightly. She was not stupid. Judging from what he said just now, he seemed to have noticed something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, do you mean that someone will come to assassinate me?&#8221; Liu Ziyan calmed down, frowned, and thought carefully. She did not doubt this possibility. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything happened to her at this time, Gu Changge would definitely have something to do with it. Most importantly, because of her, there had been many voices within Purple Mansion that objected to protecting Sky King Zhi Yang. If something happened to her, it would definitely infuriate those from Purple Mansion, and perhaps that little bit of hope would be extinguished.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I was Sky King Zhi Yang, I would definitely send someone to kill you at this time,&#8221; Gu Changge smiled, he had already spoken in such an obvious manner. He didn&#8217;t believe that she couldn&#8217;t figure it out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liu Ziyan was lost in thought. What she had done was all for the good of Purple Mansion, and all Sky King Zhi Yang had done was nothing more than push Purple Mansion into an endless abyss.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, she had become an obstacle to Sky King Zhi Yang!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Gu Changge called in a group of followers and asked them to increase patrol and be on high alert in case someone came in to seek revenge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a heavy heart, she had no intention to continue playing chess with Gu Changge, so she dismissed herself first.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Qin Wuya, it&#8217;s time for you to take action…] After seeing Liu Ziyan leave, Gu Changge smiled. He had already set up an inescapable net, which was just waiting for Qin Wuya to take action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, he had already guessed Sky King Zhi Yang’s goal. Of course, it was not to kill her, but to save her. And, the only helper that Sky King Zhi Yang could find now was his Eldest </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Brother, Qin Wuya.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge then sent a message to Tang Wang, asking her to rush over. He had a matter that he wanted to leave in her hands. [It would be great if we can let another Fortuitous One, Chu Hao, get involved in this as well.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, outside this palace group. A middle-aged man with an ordinary face was watching something with a frown in a remote alley.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was murmuring in a soft voice. A stone with strange patterns was circulating in his right hand with inexplicable fluctuations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Gu Changge’s current state, as long as I avoid his followers, he won&#8217;t be able to find me. By then, I will be able to secretly save Saintess Ziyan and complete the task given by Junior Brother Zhi Yang.&#8221; Of course, this person was Qin Wuya, who had agreed to the request of Sky King Zhi Yang to save Saintess Ziyan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to accurately know the whereabouts of Gu Changge’s many followers, at the same time, figure out the defense and guards of the palace where Gu Changge was in; Qin Wuya had been observing for three days before he was certain of everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place was heavily guarded, and the entry was under strict control. No strangers were allowed to enter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the entire Black Tortoise Empire, even the restricted areas of the imperial capital city, had no such a terrifying state of vigilance. It could be seen how serious the matter of Gu Changge’s injury was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many people&#8217;s eyes, he claimed to have almost recovered. However, it was not that easy to recover from an injury to one&#8217;s Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If he wasn&#8217;t seriously injured, he wouldn&#8217;t have been so vigilant like this and wouldn&#8217;t have let go of any signs or trace of trouble. It seems that although Gu Changge is good at strategising, he is still worried that others will take the opportunity to attack him. The Successor of Demonic Arts is hidden in the dark and eager to make a move, which is definitely a life and death threat to him. One which Gu Changge will definitely try everything to get rid of.] Qin Wuya carefully concealed his aura and hid somewhere near the palace. Even those on patrol could not notice him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the sky darkened. The evening glow in the distance sprinkled on the palace in front. It was like the Jade Palace had been placed in the mortal world, it looked incomparably magnificent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The passing cultivators all looked at it in awe, but they didn&#8217;t dare to stop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, a slight fluctuation came from the void.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wuya&#8217;s figure became blurry. He stepped into the void and disappeared soon after. At this time, even a cultivator who was extremely proficient in the Dao of Space couldn&#8217;t find him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mysterious stone in Wuya&#8217;s hand, which was shining, came from the Nine Realms. Whether it was to cover up the heavenly secrets or to hide the aura of the cultivators, it had an indescribable miraculous effect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Qin Wuya had a lot of tricks up his sleeve. That was why he was so confident and extremely assured. Along the way, Qin Wuya saw many patrolling young prodigies, but none noticed him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, as long as one was not stupid, they should know how frightening the security around Gu Changge was after he was injured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, no one would come here unless they really wanted to kill Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group patrolling in front of him, more or less, holds this same thought. However, they were not as serious as Qin Wuya had thought they should be. Most of them were just wandering around. Naturally, this was the opening he hoped for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, after entering the palace, there was an unusual look in Qin Wuya&#8217;s eyes. He glanced at the many arrays, as well as the patrolling young prodigies and cultivators.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, he carefully avoided them and went straight to the palace pavilion that was deep inside. He had already known of the location Gu Changge stayed and the area where the disciples of Purple Mansion were imprisoned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it was only a hundred kilometers away from where Gu Changge was. Even so, for cultivators like them, such distances were trivial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After arriving at a mansion, Qin Wuya began to use his divine sense to search for traces of Saintess Ziyan. The most important thing now was to find the Saintess Ziyan and take her away. This way, Purple Mansion need not be afraid of what Gu Changge might do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Gu Changge had guessed, the current situation Sky King Zhi Yang was in, was not good. Even if Purple Mansion was backing him, protecting him and his whereabouts, there was a limit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A message had spread from the Sect Master of Purple Mansion, that if Sky King Zhi Yang had anything to do with the Successor of Demonic Arts, he would naturally not be shown any mercy. That he, the Sect Master himself, would definitely personally put an end to Sky King Zhi Yang, ensuring that he would not be able to cause any trouble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was why Sky King Zhi Yang had started to panic. His greatest reliance now was the Purple Mansion backing him. If even the Purple Mansion gave up on him, what would happen to him? He might even end up beneath Prince Ying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, in a quiet mansion, Liu Ziyan, who was about to fall asleep, frowned and felt alarmed. The rune in her hand flickered, and the light was shining. Her aura was surging. She quickly stood up and was ready to take action at any time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the courtyard, a black shadow suddenly appeared, and the moon became blurry as if it was covered by endless dark clouds. Looking at the figure in black robe who suddenly broke in, Liu Ziyan felt uneasy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of the night, this person suddenly broke into her courtyard, and entered without making any sound. And she noticed that with the appearance of the man in black robe, the aura around him seemed strange. Even the night sky seemed to be shrouded in darkness. A terrible black mist suddenly swept over from all directions, completely enveloping the entire courtyard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she made a huge noise, she wouldn&#8217;t be noticed by those patrolling outside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a method made Liu Ziyan feel very uneasy. [They must have come well prepared!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, she was now within the palace compound where Gu Changge was located. The defense was very strict, beyond imagination, but there were still people who could sneak in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didn’t that mean that if this person had an ulterior motive, it would be easy for him to assassinate her here? If he and the Successor of Demonic Arts were on the same side, and he planned to assassinate her when Gu Changge was seriously injured… Such a possibility was simply too painful to imagine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, Liu Ziyan thought of what Gu Changge had said, and it sent shivers down her spine. [Is there really someone who’s planning to kill me at this time, and cause hatred between Gu Changge and Purple Mansion?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was a little regretful that she didn&#8217;t listen to Gu Changge’s words and moved to his place. At this time, if there was someone who would look after her, it would haven been much safer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hehe, Saintess Ziyan&#8230;&#8221; The black figure suddenly appeared and looked at Liu Ziyan with a sneer, as if he was staring at a prey. His whole body was wrapped in black mist, and his face could not be seen clearly, but the terrifying aura was almost suffocating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His appearance reminded her of one person, the Successor of Demonic Arts. Of course, the person in front of her was definitely not the Successor of Demonic Arts, but he must have something to do with him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, many young prodigies saw the scene in the Land of Eternal Overcast. Beside the Successor of Demonic Arts, several terrifying figures in black robes shrouded in black mist appeared. Each of them was at least in the Sacred Lord Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who exactly are you? Why do you want to kill me? Did Sky King Zhi Yang send you here?&#8221; Although Liu Ziyan felt uneasy, she forced herself to calm down and coldly ask. She knew that she couldn&#8217;t panic at this time. Moreover, she wanted to use this to draw out information from the other party.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who is the Sky King Zhi Yang?&#8221; However, the man in black robe only sneered and did not say much. &#8220;You’re about to die, and yet you still have so many questions. If you want to know, go to Hell and ask the others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that, he said no more. He struck down with his palm directly, like a Heavenly Blade slashing down endless Principles. The Sacred Lord Realm might fell, about to kill Liu Ziyan, here and now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silavin: Honestly, the ending is so dramatic. Seriously. Reminds me of the meme, the ‘to be continued’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would be hilarious if there was eye tracking and I could activate the soundtrack. But, you’re most likely already hearing it in your mind by the time you read this.</span></p>

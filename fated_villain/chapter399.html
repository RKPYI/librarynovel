          after being supported by Gu Changge. She was confused as to why she
          felt dizzy after only drinking one glass. Gradually, her hands and
          feet became weak, and even her vision was blurred.</span

          she still looked fine to others as she stayed in her seat.</span

          calm down. Despite her reassurance, her view was starting to get
          blurry, and her mind was already a confused mess. Not to mention, the
          level of her Qi at the moment was like a runaway wild horse that
          galloped through her meridians and organs. She might end up being torn
          to shred if she dared to use her Qi right now.</span

          I get poisoned? Who would do something like this?] Empress Yao
          Xi&#8217;s heart turned cold when those questions filled her head.
          Someone actually managed to infiltrate this hall even though she had
          such tight control over the palace. [I never would have imagined this

          white as chalk now as limpness she had never known before enveloped
          her. This was the first time she had felt this from the time she
          became the Empress of the Demon World 6000 years ago. She didn&#8217;t

          poison to take effect so quickly. Empress Yao Xi was someone in the
          Sacred Emperor Realm, but still, she fell into a weak state in just a
          short moment. However, it wasn&#8217;t all bad for Gu Changge, who

          real strength was far inferior to the attackers. Furthermore, there

          assassination attempt on me today? Is that why you are not surprised

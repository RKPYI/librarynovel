        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if devoid of any emotion, the Elder in white was impassively standing in Boundless Immortal Valley. When the palm thrust forward, he picked up the unconscious Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and quickly backed away. However, a vague figure in white seemed to be manifesting and charging at him from an unknown space, as the space in front of him collapsed.</span><span id="more-34800"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seemed to be 3000 floating chaotic worlds around the figure. Clusters of silver flames manifested, glowing brightly, seemingly capable of burning everything. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thrust of the figure&#8217;s palm contained all the stars in the sky as they fell directly onto the Elder’s face. and it was so powerful it felt as if the universe was suddenly collapsing. Even the white-robed Elder&#8217;s face changed slightly. Not daring to attack, he chose to back away instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* At this moment, the unrivalled aura filled the space, and every inch of the surrounding void collapsed and became fragments. The thick fog around Boundless Immortal Valley dissipated, revealing a dry river bed and cracked land. It seemed as if an everlasting and unresolvable major collision had happened here. Chaos Qi soared to the sky, the black astral wind raged/ The endless lingering World Principles were now gushing to the edge of the universe, leaving behind only desolation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What a piece of work. Who exactly is this man!?] The Elder in white&#8217;s figure suddenly faded a great deal after he was thrown backwards and upside down. His indifferent expression was also replaced by an irked one as he kept his eyes on the void in front of him. After the aggressive energy gradually subsided, he saw a figure in white strolling out of the space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a faint smile on the figure&#8217;s handsome and flawless face. As soon as he appeared, the whole world suddenly fell silent. All the World Principles were suppressed as a mighty Will filled them, and a petrifying aura visible to the naked eye, swept across. It was no exaggeration to say that his presence alone would cause a part of heaven and earth to dim as universes collapsed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This put an even sourer look on the Elder in white&#8217;s face. He knew that the other party was trying to control this whole space, clearly indicating they had already noticed something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who are you to sabotage my plans?&#8221; The Elder in white coldly demanded while staring at Gu Changge, who appeared with indifferent hostility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like this is part of your incarnation. Ah Da did not go to the wrong place the other day after all.&#8221; Gu Changge proceeded to ignore the Elder&#8217;s words and casually took a look at the Immortal Valley. Slightly amazed, he nodded, understanding what was so special about this place. To be precise, this place was not located in the Profound Sword World. Instead, it was an independent small space opened up using some kind of Secret Technique. In other words, it was most likely formed from either a cultivator&#8217;s Knowledge Sea or Spiritual Palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the Elder in white in front of him was the incarnation of the World’s Will that manifested that day. However, Gu Changge could tell from the Elder in white&#8217;s aura that he was not a complete World’s Will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tell me where the World Source is, and I can keep your consciousness intact.&#8221; Gu Changge chose to get straight to the point as he nonchalantly mentioned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are here for the World Source?&#8221; The Elder in white&#8217;s face gradually grew chilly as his killing intent showed on his face. &#8220;Were you the one who destroyed my eyes that day?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge chuckled upon hearing that. &#8220;Why would I come to this world if it wasn&#8217;t for the World Source? Even though it is rare for you to have a consciousness while you are a Will of this world, I don&#8217;t mind annihilating you if you dare stop me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking, he glanced at Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, who the Elder was carrying. The Fortuitous One stayed unconscious the entire time. Gu Changge had a feeling that the Elder had done something to him, but Gu Changge was not interested in this. He just wanted to get rid of Tuo Ba Xiao Yao regardless of whether he was unconscious or awake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The World Source is related to my Absolute Detachment. How can I tell you just like that?&#8221; The eyes of the Elder in white were filled with indifference, and there was a vast power of the World&#8217;s Will emerging from his body. However, it was obvious that the surrounding void was filled with a more powerful Will, which was constantly suppressing his attempt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Absolute Detachment? Now that you have a Will, it seems like you don&#8217;t only want to be a World&#8217;s Will. You want to transform into a living being, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hmm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled, amused. He somewhat understood the Profound Sword World&#8217;s intention &#8211; to not only hide somewhere but also to use the World Source to achieve detachment and transformation. Transcending its current state. After all, an entity like a World’s Will practically stood at the top of the world. It was born from all kinds of Principles. As a result, it was extremely difficult for it to develop a consciousness, let alone transform into a living being. A plant aged over millions of years was hard enough to develop its own consciousness, what about a whole entire world? But as soon as the World’s Will managed to do so, it would have unimaginable strength. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Gu Changge&#8217;s view, it would have reached the Immortal Realm. And even if it didn&#8217;t, it wouldn&#8217;t be too far from it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You sure know a lot.&#8221; The old man&#8217;s eyes looked cold as his previous indifferent expression dropped. It was obvious that Gu Changge&#8217;s was saying exactly what he was thinking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the World’s Will, he was born to maintain the Heavenly Dao and everything in the world. But now that he happened to have his own Will, he naturally wasn&#8217;t willing to be a mere chess piece blessing everything from behind the scenes. That was why he had been looking for opportunities to achieve Absolute Detachment from his Source and the Fortuity gathered in the world throughout the years. But because of an accident where a Space Rift had appeared outside the world, causing the Upper Realm Forces to discover the existence of this world, he had no choice but to hide in a deeper area, as he bought more time and waited for the opportunity to Transcend his current binds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was forced out of hiding to remove Gu Changge, who was a potential threat when he noticed Gu Changge launched attacks, which resulted in horrifying fluctuations in space a few days ago. However, he never imagined Gu Changge would be so unfathomably strong to easily tear apart a manifestation he made and find his way here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was something that was completely out of his expectations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since you are not going to tell me where the World Source is, I will have to find it myself.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head lightly. He didn&#8217;t fear this incomplete World’s Will. when not even a complete one could faze him. He didn&#8217;t want to waste any more time either. Now that he had found this place, it probably wouldn&#8217;t take long before he found the so-called World Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, he didn&#8217;t spend another second on idle talk and directly attacked. A terrifying grey fog swept in instantly, covering the sky like a big wave breaking through the dike and completely covering the world. Terrifying black Divine Chains seemed to spread from the deepest part of the darkness as they rushed at the Elder in white to devour him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The face of the Elder, who had been staring at Gu Changge vigilantly, suddenly fell when he saw this, and his already-vague figure trembled. [What is this…] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uncontrollable fear he felt was as if he had encountered his nemesis out of nowhere. The Heavenly Secrets here had become extremely eerie, and the thick black fog contained a mysterious godly power, capable of devouring all the Divine Principles. Even if he was the incarnation of the World’s Will, he couldn&#8217;t defend himself against Gu Changge&#8217;s attack at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you?&#8221; He whispered in a shaky voice as fear filled his eyes. He didn&#8217;t think Gu Changge was capable of using such a technique. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was probably not one being in this world who was not afraid of this kind of power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge had no intention to answer him. In an instant, the fearsome black fog with strong devouring power swallowed the Elder in white. After a few screams, sounds of bones being chewed and broken could be heard. The place gradually regained its tranquillity after that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge calmly closed his eyes as he digested the memory related to this incarnation. With a small smile on his face, he said to himself, &#8220;How fascinating. He actually thought things out to this extent.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the memory was not complete, it allowed him to understand something interesting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turned out that the Profound Sword World&#8217;s Will had acquired its consciousness a long time ago. It wanted to go a step further in Absolute Detachment from its Source. Thus, it attempted a World-Destructing Sacrifice to sacrifice all living beings so that it could break free from its shackles. Unfortunately, the top expert from that time noticed what it was up to, and they joined forces with the rest of the experts to come up with a counterplan. That resulted in a Heaven-Exterminating War that was forgotten from history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That terrifying battle almost consumed all the Fortuity accumulated in the Profound Sword World, and it almost destroyed the world itself. The experts eventually emerged as the victors as they sealed off the World Will&#8217;s consciousness in the depths of the Mirror Lake. The expert also went to search for various sacred materials to forge a Divine Sword which they dropped into the lake to subdue the World Will&#8217;s consciousness. But due to the heavy repercussions of the battle, the expert passed on not long after. The key to unlocking the Mirror Lake, too, subsequently fell into the hands of the expert&#8217;s descendants. The descendants were the only ones who could use the key.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that was a long time ago. Plus, a portion of the World’s Will, which had broken free from the seal, performed miracles in the world to destroy the records about the Heaven-Exterminating War. As a result, there was barely anyone in Profound Sword World who knew about this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t have known about this part of Profound Sword World&#8217;s history if he hadn&#8217;t flipped through this part of the incarnation’s memory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turned out that this world was more of a muddy water than Gu Changge had thought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s no wonder only part of the World’s Will could be manifested. Most of it has been sealed off at the bottom of Mirror Lake…] Gu Changge&#8217;s interest was piqued. [That is not a key to unseal the Heavenly Dao Sword; it is used to unlock the Mirror Lake! Lin En must be the descendant of the experts who sealed off the World’s Will. It had long since noticed him and planned for this…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge only learnt about Lin En&#8217;s journey to Boundless Immortal Valley after he looked through the incarnation’s memory. However, Gu Changge still didn&#8217;t know where the World Source was. The World’s Will was also careful as to not leave any memory in this incarnation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, the key to finding the World Source was still in Mirror Lake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right when Gu Changge was in the middle of his own thoughts, Ah Da carried the unconscious Tuo Ba Xiao Bao over. The Elder in white had thrown him aside when he tried to escape just now. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, should we keep this man alive?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge thought that it was necessary for the World’s Will to morph in order to undergo Absolute Detachment. Coincidentally, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, who had integrated the energies and Principles of the two worlds, obviously had the most suitable physique. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using him, there wouldn&#8217;t be any barriers or obstacles for the World&#8217;s Will to successfully integrate into the Upper Realm.</span></p>

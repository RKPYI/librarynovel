          up. Three Elders from the Immortal Academy had finally rushed through
          space and arrived, two men and a woman, all incomparably old. Gu
          Xianer and the Azure Dragon Emperor were already waiting for them at
          the entrance of the palace.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No need to be so courteous,&#8221; the old woman said, waving
          her hand. She was known as Grandma Yin Hua. She was dressed in
          floral-patterned clothes and holding a dragon headed cane. Her silver
          hair was combed neatly which made her look austere.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She seemed annoyed as she had greatly favoured Qing Xiaoyi and even
          fought against several other Elders to get her. The sudden news was so
          shocking that she was rooted for a while. She didn&#8217;t know who
          would be daring enough to kidnap Qing Xiaoyi during the trial.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The other Elders all had similar reactions. They were all shocked,
          worried and angry. Nonetheless, none of them dared to place the blame
          on Gu Xianer. She might share some of the blame for failing to take
          care of them as the Senior Disciple, but she had Gu Changge backing
          her. So, who would dare blame her? Maybe in their heart but not in
          their words and actions. Still, their emotions could not be hidden
          from their expressions when they saw her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Xianer knew the reason for their reactions but didn&#8217;t want
          to comment on it, looking cold as ever. She had done all she could,
          even sacrificing some rare and precious Sacred Herbs in order to save
          Qing Feng.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, they arrived at the palace where Qing Feng was recuperating.
          His life had been saved after some hard work by the doctors of the
          Empire, but he was still unconscious. When the Elders arrived, he was
          reaching out involuntarily, as if still wanting to save his sister.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Xianer, calm as ever, noticed this and raised her eyebrows. [Seems
          like the situation had probably gone like this. Qing Feng realised
          Qing Xiaoyi was being abducted and he chased after her. But, he got
          struck by that mysterious expert’s palm. That one attack was strong
          enough to destroy all the protective artifacts the Elders had given
          him, and had nearly killed him. The wave of energy I had sensed must
          have been from that attack. My quick arrival is most likely the thing
          that made him cease his attack, completely focused on taking Qing
          Xiaoyi away without being bothered about me.]</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How pitiful…&#8221;</span></p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how he survived such an

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The three Elders sighed and checked on Qing Feng&#8217;s injuries,
          curious and shocked about how he had survived yet couldn&#8217;t find
          the cause.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I still have a Nine-Cycles Spirit Restoration Pill on me. He
          can have it.&#8221; One Elder unwillingly pulled out a pill brimming
          with nine-coloured light, which was about the size of a thumb. Once it
          appeared, a wave of energy, which made nearly every pore relax, spread
          into the air. Strange scenes such as soaring celestial birds around
          divine mountains seemed to appear.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;re really making a great sacrifice.&#8221; The two
          other Elders inhaled sharply when they saw this pill. This was a pill
          that even they could use when they were gravely injured. They quickly
          understood the Elder&#8217;s motive. If he could use this to save Qing
          Feng and find Qing Xiaoyi, she would be so grateful that she would ask
          to become his student. When they realised this, they regretted missing
          such an opporunity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After the pill was consumed, a rainbow shone and many extraordinary
          phenomena intertwined, making Qing Feng&#8217;s unconscious body shine
          brilliantly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The Nine-Cycles Spirit Restoration Pill is truly
          amazing…&#8221; The Elder looked pleased. Even though he was initially
          anxious, it was fine as soon as it showed its effectiveness. Qing
          Feng&#8217;s weak condition was now improving at a rate visible to the
          naked eye. His pale face was already now filled with colour.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s really all thanks to the Nine-Cycles Spirit
          Restoration Pill. No wonder it&#8217;s called a Lifesaving
          Pill,&#8221; praised Grandma Yin Hua.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, Gu Xianer noticed a strange pattern flash across the
          ancient flask. After the pill had been consumed, Qing Feng spat a
          mouthful of dirty blood and his broken bones and organs began to heal.
          Spiritual energy weaved together into Purple Qi and enclosed him,
          making his appearance much healthier.</span

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sister…&#8221;</span></p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Qing Feng&#8217;s eyes shot open as he instinctively screamed while
          he got up. This sudden movement tugged on his injuries, sending an
          intense wave of pain through him. His face paled and he began to sweat
          profusely. He then realised that he was no longer in the garden, just
          like that night.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          while the Elders did the same.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Elder who had procured the Pill let out a smile. &#8220;Good,
          good. At least it wasn&#8217;t a waste.&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;My sister has been kidnapped…&#8221; Qing Feng looked stunned
          and didn&#8217;t seem to notice them, still murmuring in fear and
          worry.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Grandma Yin Hua frowned upon hearing that. &#8220;His soul seems to
          be in shock and need some quiet time alone to recuperate.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As she spoke, she waved one of her sleeves and a blurry ball of light
          moved towards him. Qing Feng, who had been stunned, slowly recovered
          and calmed down. It was a Calming Spell.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Thank you, Elders and Senior Xianer for saving me.&#8221; Qing
          Feng was now calm and knew he couldn&#8217;t beat around the bush. He
          began to relate what had happened that night. He had completed his
          trial and was preparing for bed when he suddenly sensed a strange
          disturbance from his sister&#8217;s lodgings next door.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It wasn&#8217;t him, of course, but the flask that detected it. He
          immediately felt something was wrong and when he rushed over, he saw a
          mysterious man whose face was hidden. He was entirely covered in
          pitch-black runes, holding onto an unconscious Qing Xiaoyi and
          planning to leave.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sight angered him and he didn&#8217;t think twice before trying
          to save her. Yet, the man had merely slapped down a hand and made the
          protective amulet the Elders had given him to explode into pieces. At
          that point, he instantly lost consciousness.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If not for this mysterious flask blocking the blow, I
          would&#8217;ve died,&#8221; said Qing Feng bitterly. He couldn&#8217;t
          hide the presence of the mysterious flask now, since the three Elders
          had already noticed it. Likewise, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to
          withstand the blow with his own strength, and lie his way out of all
          the potential questions.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That flask…&#8221; Grandma Yin Hua took it with some surprise
          and studied it. It had an ordinary pattern and looked ancient and
          rusty, thus it was hard to see anything unique about it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Is this flask, the Flask of World Domination?&#8221; Another
          Elder stared at it intensely to investigate it, soon recognising
          it.</span

          >&#8220;The Flask from the Seven Tools of World Domination?&#8221; Gu
          Xianer was flabbergasted. She had naturally heard of the Seven Tools
          of World Domination; gathering all of them enabled one to find and
          open the Immortal Palace Treasury, which contained immeasurable
          precious items and even opportunities. She hadn&#8217;t expected this
          unassuming flask to be the Flask of World Domination.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even if Qing Feng had admitted it, the Elders couldn&#8217;t take
          possession of it no matter how much they desired it. Thus, they
          returned it after studying for a bit.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The man has been extremely decisive in his attack, knowing
          that Qing Feng won&#8217;t be able to counter and would immediately
          die. This makes it hard for us to trace what happened.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Afterwards, the three Elders, all in the Sacred Emperor Realm,
          appeared in the compound, conjuring their respective techniques to
          retrace what had happened. Very quickly, Chaos Qi spread out,
          accompanied by colourful light of multiple Principles. It was like
          they had returned to the day of the world&#8217;s creation, blurry
          objects materialising into the sky. The sight was
          shock-inducing.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just when they were about to see the mysterious man, a terrifying
          grey fog swept in. All three of them grunted and became pale as if hit
          by lightning, quickly withdrawing. All that effort and they saw
          nothing.</span

          mysterious treasure or some Talent which disturbs fate itself.&#8221;
          The three Elders looked solemn as they knew this was going to be
          difficult. Both possibilities showed that the culprit was strong, and
          had plotted this kidnapping in advance.</span

          suddenly suggested an idea while looking at the Flask.
          &#8220;It&#8217;s said that the Flask is part of the Seven Tools of
          World Domination because it is made of a unique material, with both
          attack and defensive properties. It could even absorb and reflect the
          opponent&#8217;s attacks…&#8221;</span

          activating it. We can then trace and restore the blow. The man most
          likely never expected Qing Feng to possess such a thing. We can use
          the energy and Principles from the stored attack to find out who has

          Xianer thought the idea would work as well, feeling really hopeful.
          After all, no one had expected Qing Feng to have the Flask of World
          Domination at all.</span

          >Terrifying Principles of the Sacred Emperor Realm rained down, each
          ray extremely terrifying and making the sky change colour. All within
          a million kilometres had the urge to prostrate themselves. Great
          surges of energy rose to the sky as the rust marks on the Flask fell
          from its surface. It shone with beams of light from the Great Dao, as
          if cleansed of all its impurities.</span

          and nearly killed me!&#8221; Anger and hatred shone within his eyes
          since he would never forget the feeling. One strike was enough to
          almost crush him like an ant.</span

          that person…&#8221; Grandma Yin Hua studied the pitch-black palm print
          and soon noticed its strangeness. She seemed to remember something
          suddenly, becoming wary and no longer speaking.</span

          to remain unruffled by this sudden revelation.</span

          uncertain as he glanced at Qing Feng, sighing deeply with an
          indecisive and helpless eyes.</span

          >&#8220;What? Why are you all like this so suddenly…&#8221; Qing Feng,
          who had been expecting them to uncover the identity of the culprit,
          froze when he saw their expressions. He became uneasy. [Is the culprit
          not someone they can go against? That’s why they are now so wary, and
          are unwilling to explain any further? Or, is their conclusion just
          that impossible?]</span

          palm, runes flickering in her eyes as she deduced the situation. She
          was in shock as well.</span

          surveyed the silent Elders before continuing, &#8221; I think the
          Elders have noticed it too.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Sky King Zhi Yang was a Ranked Disciple of the Immortal Academy,
          his strength used to be unrivalled among the younger generation of the
          Upper Realm and he was known to be number one before Gu Changge came
          into the picture. He had the Purple Mansion, an Immortal Sect, behind
          him. Thus, it wasn&#8217;t strange that the Elders were cautious and
          refused to speak. Even Gu Xianer was shocked, wondering if he had been
          framed.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On another thought, she began to wonder if it was another ancient
          monstrosity who did it. Besides, the culprit had avoided her on
          purpose. However, considering the way the Sky King had courted her, Gu
          Xianer now knew why.</span

          though?&#8221; Gu Xianer couldn&#8217;t make the connection but had
          already said her thoughts.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The three Elders looked at each other cautiously, not daring to speak
          much of this. The Purple Mansion was extremely powerful, and they had
          purposefully seated an extremely old Elder from an ancient generation
          in the Immortal Academy. That Elder views Zhi Yang in a favourable
          light, and was his protector.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          them. It was said that he had once failed to reach the Great Dao, and
          had removed his cultivation. However, he could still return back to
          his peak anytime, due to his unfathomable strength. They were
          suspicious of the Zhi Yang, but they couldn&#8217;t discuss this
          further nor think about his motive in taking Qing Xiaoyi when she had
          never wronged him. Every Ranked Disciple had powerful backgrounds,
          which could not be trivialised.</span

          face became pale as he wasn&#8217;t stupid. Gu Xianer&#8217;s words
          and the Elders&#8217; change in attitude definitely explained
          something.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Sky King Zhi Yang was an ancient monstrosity who was backed by
          Purple Mansion. His background was enormously powerful and he had
          immeasurable strength. He and Qing Xiaoyi had no power or position to
          speak of. The only thing they had was their potential, which was
          appreciated by the Elders of the Immortal Academy. Otherwise, they
          have nothing. Who would dare offend Sky King Zhi Yang and the Purple
          Mansion backing him for them?

          >&#8220;I…&#8221; Gu Xianer froze on the spot, her brain rapidly
          pondering over Sky King Zhi Yang’s motive in taking Qing Xiaoyi. [He
          can’t be doing this same thing right? Kidnapping her, planning a whole
          act, and then taking the credit for finding her, and protecting her?
          All this just to pique my interest? It can’t be. It’s too
          unlikely.]</span

          Zhi Yang begun working together with the Successor of Demonic
          Arts?&#8221; Gu Xianer&#8217;s expression was grave as she really
          wanted to help Qing Feng, yet she couldn&#8217;t face the power behind
          Zhi Yang with just her own strength. The Immortal Gu Family would
          never listen to her, and the Elders with her were all too cowardly,
          trying to exclude themselves from this mess.

          link between him and the Successor of Demonic Arts. If there was, she
          could use this chance to inform everyone about it. However, there were
          too many reasons and excuses to abduct her. Thus, without evidence, he
          would just refuse to admit to it, and there would be no
          consequences.</span

          as he pleaded with her, pulling out the Flask. &#8220;If all of you
          can safely return Xiaoyi, then I will give you this

          about this…&#8221; He looked like he had caught a lifeline, speaking
          urgently to her as he felt hopeful. The other young prodigy who could

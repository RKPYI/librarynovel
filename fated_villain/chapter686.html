        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the many Blue Flood Ancient World young prodigies were discussing their future, a knock came from outside the manor.</span><span id="more-36149"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pardon the intrusion, but is Lady Xue Yan here?&#8221; Asked a middle-aged man with a smile on his face, standing outside the mansion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, many cultivators followed behind him respectfully, both human and other ancient races, each exuding a powerful aura, overwhelming and awe-inspiring.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s here indeed. May I know who you are, sir?&#8221; Asked the servant guarding the door at once, having never seen such a spectacle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was evident from the middle-aged man&#8217;s attire and demeanour that he was no simple man, having been in power for a long time. He also had a gaze that carried a hint of authority.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am the Third Treasurer of the Alliance of Thousand Merchants in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. I have come to seek Lady Xue Yan at the request of our Young Master,&#8221; the middle-aged man said with a smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Third Treasurer of the Alliance of Thousand Merchants!?&#8221; Those from Blue Flood Ancient World, who were in the manor, were shocked and gasping in amazement upon hearing the servant&#8217;s report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status of the Third Treasurer of the Alliance of Thousand Merchants was no less than that of the Master behind the Vermilion Bird Hall. He was incredibly mysterious, a character not seen by many. So, who&#8217;d have thought he would show up and deliberately ask for Xue Yan!? Also, it was at a request of their Young Master!?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those from Blue Flood Ancient World were taken aback, and they gazed enviously at Xue Yan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xue Yan quickly realised the terrifying status of the middle-aged man after coming around, and she quickly approached him, asking deferentially, &#8220;I heard you seek of me, sir.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not me who&#8217;s looking for you; it&#8217;s our Young Master,&#8221; the middle-aged man said with a gentle smile. &#8220;Come with me. We shan&#8217;t keep the Young Master waiting.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His tone was casual, but there was an undeniable sense of authority, and he didn&#8217;t seem to care whether Xue Yan agreed or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the way he saw it, no one would ever dare to refuse such a request. After all, even the many goddesses of the Upper Realm would be ecstatic, knowing their presence was requested by Gu Changge. So, just what had this mere Lower Realm maiden done to have Gu Changge send his men to fetch her?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That Young Master is looking for Junior Xue Yan!?&#8221; Envy and jealousy enveloped the other young prodigies of Blue Flood Ancient World right then. They had already gathered a lot of information about Gu Changge through indirect means in the past few days, and for such a character of the Upper Realm to request Xue Yan&#8217;s presence, what did that entail? No one dared imagine. Still, they were beside themselves with envy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Go on, Junior Sister Xue Yan. Don&#8217;t keep him waiting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget about us after you have become successful, alright?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The youths from Blue Flood Ancient World spoke up one after another, their words full of flattery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Junior Sister Xue Yan…&#8221; Lu Ming had originally resolved to request divine abilities from the remnant soul within the mysterious rock that evening. But now, the situation was like a wet blanket over him, rendering him wholly dispirited and stumped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why would that man ask for Junior Sister Xue Yan so late night?] In an instant, countless possibilities played in his head, and some unsettling images ultimately came to mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His fists, hidden under his sleeves, were clenched tightly. So much so that his knuckles popped, and despite taking deep breaths, he had trouble calming down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew Xue Yan couldn&#8217;t refuse the request no matter what. She wouldn&#8217;t dare say no even if she didn&#8217;t want to go. After all, such a mighty figure could wipe out their ancient world a billion times over if he just said the word.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was more, no maiden would likely refuse such a rare opportunity anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Lu Ming was lost in thought, Xue Yan smiled and politely bowed to the middle-aged man. &#8220;Thank you, sir. When shall we depart? We shan&#8217;t keeping Young Master Gu waiting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go now.&#8221; The middle-aged man nodded, surprised Xue Yan acted neither overbearingly nor servilely. She especially didn&#8217;t behave as though she had hit the jackpot. He had to admit that the people Gu Changge acknowledged were extraordinary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very quickly, the middle-aged man took Xue Yan away, gradually disappearing into the end of the long street and entering the deepest part of the Vermilion Bird Hall, to the most magnificent palace in the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Lu Ming watched the whole scene develop grimly. Suddenly, the sensation of something that belonged to him being taken away overcame him, and he couldn&#8217;t calm down for a long time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, a slight sneer rang in Lu Ming&#8217;s ear. &#8220;Kid, find a contact person of Neraka, and I can help you get your love back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His pupils shrank and quickly recovered. He knew it was the middle-aged man in the mysterious rock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How can you help me?&#8221; Lu Ming asked through voice transmission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can help you become the Successor of the Neraka of this generation. That way, your status will be on par with that Young Master Gu,&#8221; said the middle-aged man confidently with a smile, his eyes flickering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He might have never left the mysterious rock, but he learned many things about the outside world from Lu Ming, and though the many rumours about that Gu Changge sounds terrifying, he thought they were too unrealistic. If anything, they had been exaggerated too greatly. [As if someone so young can be that powerful. Not even the books dare to write something so outrageous.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Successor of Neraka?&#8221; Lu Ming&#8217;s breath suddenly quickened, for he was well aware of what that meant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many young prodigies have mysteriously disappeared from the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds lately?&#8221; Gu Changge quirked a brow as he read the jade tablet in his hand in the depths of the magnificent Vermilion Bird Hall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eyes of the Alliance of Thousand Merchants were everywhere in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. Hence, many things that ordinary people couldn&#8217;t perceive would fall into the information network of the Alliance of Thousand Merchants. He was surprised he would find unexpected gains while investigating Neraka and Pagoda. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mysteriously disappearance of young prodigies? And they all happen to contain a certain unique physique? Why hasn&#8217;t Su Qingge come to see me when she&#8217;s here?] Gu Changge frowned, thinking things were starting to divert from his intended vision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t think there were other Successors of Demonic Arts in the Upper Realm apart from Su Qingge. Of course, only the Successor of Demonic Arts would devour a young prodigy’s Source and cultivation. The other Forces of the Upper Realm would never dare do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t rare for some strange techniques similar to Forbidden Demonic Arts to appear in the vast Upper Realm. However, Gu Changge had a feeling Su Qingge must have already contacted Chan Honyi, and now, she was likely in the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[To think she wouldn&#8217;t come to him and is even deliberately avoiding me…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, she has found out the truth, huh?] Gu Changge put the jade tablet down as his gaze gradually deepened. [But, it’s not like she’s an ideal and obedient tool. She should have her own thoughts and feels…]</span></p>

          not only to test Jin Chan&#8217;s strength, but it was also to display
          his terrifying power in front of the crowd. Afterwards, the Immortal

          still smiling mildly. &#8220;But if you decline, I won&#8217;t force

          not take his opponent seriously. They knew this wasn&#8217;t him being
          arrogant as he had the power to back it up and silence any doubts. The

          the outside world and mostly consisted of Inner Disciples and Unranked
          Disciples. Meanwhile, many of the Ranked Disciples were not present.

          >Now that many ancient monstrosities had shown themselves, as well as
          another Successor of Demonic Arts existing, his power would no longer
          be as eye-catching as before, no matter how strong it became.

          >Therefore, even if he was competing against those within the younger
          generation, he was compelled to make them understand that the
          difference between them was not small. In simple terms he was telling
          everyone that he was much stronger than them.</span

          >The resources at the Immortal Academy were not what Gu Changge
          preferred, but that didn&#8217;t mean he didn&#8217;t care for them.
          Furthermore, the more powerful he was, the more he would gain. So,
          everything he did brought him numerous benefits.

          >Jin Chan shook his head at Gu Changge&#8217;s words but did not say
          anything. His expression was completely calm. There was no trace of
          anger or dissatisfaction at his loss; he still had plenty of
          techniques, but he knew that it would be hard to defeat Gu Changge
          even after using all of them. [He&#8217;s just too powerful, all the
          way down to the bone! I am just unfortunate to run into Gu Changge
          today. If he were to meet any of the other Ranked Disciple, he would
          ask for the same thing. He clearly just wanted to exhibit his power
          and make everyone wary of him, which would allow him to dominate
          everything in the Immortal Academy.]</span

          Elder Mo, who had become silent, told Ying Shuang with a grave
          expression outside the entrance. “You are now the only Successor
          who&#8217;s suppressed by another prodigy in the same
          generation…&#8221;

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Elder Mo felt that this was going to be troublesome. He had thought
          things would become much easier once he found the Successor of Demonic
          Arts for this generation, but Gu Changge just had to appear, whose
          power was otherworldly.</span

          >Ying Shuang&#8217;s expression was stiff as well, the being feeling
          frustrated at how powerful Gu Changge was. Even the original Prince
          Ying was not as strong as Gu Changge. Ying Shuang clenched his fist in
          dissatisfaction; the only thing that relieved him slightly was that Gu
          Changge was in the spotlight, while he was concealed within the
          shadows. Thus, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t know he was there as well. This
          would serve as an opportunity for him to take his revenge!</span

          >[I need to resolve this carefully. I have to think of a way to tell
          Gu Xianer about how dangerous Gu Changge is. She might be indifferent
          to me, but I&#8217;m not going to let her die.] Sky King Zhi Yang
          frowned, a grave look upon his face. He wasn&#8217;t sure who would
          win if he went all out against Gu Changge in a fight. This was the
          first time he was so uncertain and unsettled; Gu Changge was more
          terrifying than the rumours had described.</span

          makes him lucky already&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s smile was
          intriguing.

          again. [Is it because of the Demon-Burying Abyss?]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, the news of the fight spread, sending shockwaves through not
          just the Academy but also the rest of the Upper Realm. All the sects
          had always paid attention towards the younger generation, and the
          fight between Gu Changge and the Chosen Monk Jin Chan was especially
          attention-grabbing.</span

          >The results of the fight were recorded by the photographic stone and
          passed among the city and market. This immediately took Gu
          Changge&#8217;s reputation to further heights. Many had thought he was
          inferior to the ancient monstrosities due to how young he was, which
          meant he did not have enough time to cultivate. Thus, this fight
          shocked them to the point that it was hard to remain calm. These
          monstrosities were far too inferior compared to him. Even many of the
          older generation felt they could not beat him; he had now developed to
          the point where many of the older generation were aware yet wary of
          him.</span

          older brother still has that Flask.&#8221; Yue Mingkong murmured, a
          complicated expression in her eyes. She was currently in a grand
          palace very close to where Gu Changge currently was.

          forces in the Upper Realm and was one of the two disciples whom the
          Academy was most proud of. The other one being a Wondrous Stone long
          preserved within the Immortal Academy.</span

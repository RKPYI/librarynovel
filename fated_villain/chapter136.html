        <h4>Chapter 136: Don’t You Love Digging Bones; Lord Longteng Will Like You!</h4>
        <p> <i><strong>[Puff!]</strong></i> </p>
        <p> Blood splattered everywhere as the black sword light broke through the air and directly destroyed the
            Seventh Princess’s Primordial Spirit! </p>
        <p> Although Gu Xian’er faced setback after setback at Gu Changge’s hands, but under the guidance of the old
            monsters back at the Peach Village, she had developed an extremely decisive temperament. </p>
        <p> Right now, she felt no need to show mercy. </p>
        <p> The Sea King Palace tried to murder her, and the Seventh Princess chased after her for so long, so how could
            she let her live now? </p>
        <p> Soon, the Seventh Princess died and her body turned into a huge golden fish filled with divine intent. </p>
        <p> Countless black and white stripes covered her figure that resembled a KunPeng. </p>
        <p> <b>“Fortunately, she’s not a humanoid or I wouldn’t know what to say right now.”</b> </p>
        <p> Afterwards, with a calm expression, Gu Xian’er directly dissected the fish and cut the meat right in front
            of Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> She was far too familiar with the motions since it wasn’t her first time doing it. </p>
        <p> After the Seventh Princess died and turned into a massive fish, she was nothing more than good food and a
            source of nice materials in her eyes. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge looked at her with interest, but didn’t interrupt. </p>
        <p> Although Gu Xian’er spent most of her life under her Masters’ tutelage, he could tell from her swift motions
            that she hadn’t dealt with just one young genius and wasn’t a greenhorn. </p>
        <p> Alas! She wasn’t as rich as actual Young Supremes, so the first thing she did was to pocket the Seventh
            Princess’s Spatial Ring, as if she was afraid Gu Changge would snatch it from her. </p>
        <p> <b>“Look at how poor you are! I can’t stand it anymore.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge couldn’t help but shake his head with an expression of regret. </p>
        <p> According to the normal trope, Gu Changge would be taking out some treasures to ‘relieve’ Gu Xian’er after
            seeing her poor and pitiful appearance, but there was no way Gu Changge would do that. </p>
        <p> Instead, he acted as if he was relishing in her plight. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er gave her a sideways glance with a cold and prideful expression, while her small and delicate
            hands kept on ravaging the fish corpse in front of her. </p>
        <p> After a while, however, she took out a dazzling rune bone intertwined with gold and black brilliance, and
            threw it in front of Gu Changge while saying, <b>“Here, take this! Don’t you like digging bones like
                this…”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge just stared at her. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er wasn’t afraid of him at all, and looked straight at him with a calm expression and a triumphant
            smile on the corner of her mouth. </p>
        <p> Since she was begging for her beat time and again, Gu Changge decided to fulfill her desire. </p>
        <p> Just like before, a golden palm as massive as a mountain pressed down on her and suppressed Gu Xian’er’s
            rekindled arrogance. </p>
        <p> <b>[Piak!]</b> ? </p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge, I will pay you back for everything sooner or later…”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er was embarrassed beyond measure and gnashed her teeth while her face blushed and made her resemble
            a boiled shrimp. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge, however, was too lazy to give a damn about her and brought his bunch of followers and left the
            scene. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er, on the other hand, was left suppressed under the golden palm, and gnashed her teeth with hatred.
        </p>
        <p> Although she ended up like that because she provoked Gu Changge, getting suppressed so easily was still a
            matter of great embarrassment. </p>
        <p> The moment she broke free, she looked in the direction Gu Changge left and madly cursed him in her heart.
            She cursed him to choke to death on water, and then went to find a place for secluded cultivation. </p>
        <p> The cultivators in the surroundings only watched from afar, shocked, as none of them had the guts to
            approach. </p>
        <p> <b>“If only I could find a pit for her…”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge showed a somewhat regretful expression as he left. </p>
        <p> He really wanted to find a ditch where he could suppress Gu Xian’er for three to five years. </p>
        <p> After all, what use was having a sister if you weren’t going to bully her? </p>
        <p> [TL/N: I can attest to this as I have a toy in the form of a smol sister. I use her cheeks to relieve
            stress.] </p>
        <p> Alas! A Favored Daughter of Heaven like Gu Xian’er was better left by herself since she had her own
            opportunities to grasp. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge couldn’t be bothered to interfere with her life. </p>
        <p> Afterwards, he looked through his Attributes Panel. After all, he earned 5000 Destiny Points this time, and
            that wasn’t a small sum. </p>

        <p> ‘I haven’t jacked myself up in a while and my Cultivation Base right now is somewhat low.’ </p>
        <p> Gu Changge swept a glance at this progress of the [Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex] and directly decided to
            upgrade his Cultivation Base since he was too lazy to waste his time on Cultivation and Enlightenment. </p>
        <p> His Cultivation Base broke through a major realm in one fell swoop and he directly stepped into the Initial
            Stage of the False God Realm! </p>
        <p> His [Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex] also reached the Ninth Layer as countless secrets of cultivation, Mystical
            Abilities, and whatnot flooded his mind from the Ninth Layer of the [Heavenly Immortal Dao Codex]. </p>
        <p> He achieved another qualitative leap in his Cultivation due to the blessing of his [Transcendence] talent.
        </p>
        <p> ‘Next, I should be getting a surprise from Ye Ling, the man of the hour.’ </p>
        <p> A strange smile appeared on Gu Changge’s face as he thought about this. </p>
        <p> He sensed the trail of aura Yin Mei left for him and followed after them. </p>
        <p> …… </p>
        <p> Soon, the news about the death and defeat of the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace at Gu Changge’s
            hands spread everywhere like a hurricane, and caused a massive sensation in various areas of the Ancient
            Immortal Continent. </p>
        <p> All of those from the younger generation who heard the news were horrified. </p>
        <p> Many felt chills go down their spine even though it was daytime and they were standing under the sun, so
            much so that even their souls trembled. </p>
        <p> Many cultivators fell into shock and silence after they listened to the details of the matter. </p>
        <p> Speaking about the cause of the incident, it was the younger brother of the Seventh Princess of the Sea King
            Palace. </p>
        <p> In order to avenge her young brother for his murder, the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace called upon
            all of her minions from the Sea Families — several Young Supremes, even — and hunted a young girl in blue.
        </p>
        <p> The girl in blue turned out to be related to Gu Changge, the contemporary Heir of the Heavenly Immortal Dao
            Palace. </p>
        <p> The chase continued for several days, and in the end, the Sea King Palace even set up a great formation to
            trap the girl in blue. </p>
        <p> Everyone thought that the girl in blue would die without a doubt, but an accident happened and Gu Changge
            appeared out of nowhere and killed several Young Supremes with his tyrannical means. The Seventh Princess
            took the initiative to use countless powerful moves, but she failed miserably and lost after a single move,
            and then her Dao Heart collapsed. </p>
        <p> In the end, the Seventh Princess died and the Sea Creatures who accompanied her were slaughtered. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s strength during this battle shocked everyone. </p>
        <p> Young Sovereign! </p>
        <p> Those two words set off a storm when they spread everywhere, like a meteorite smashed into the deep sea.
        </p>
        <p> Even the Young Supremes who firmly believed in their invincible might couldn’t help but gasp for breath and
            show a change in their complexion. </p>
        <p> Although the Cultivation Base revealed by Gu Changge was only in the Late Stage of the Conferred King Realm,
            he defeated the Seventh Princess — who had a reputation for being invincible and was in the Pinnacle Stage
            of the Conferred King Realm — in a single move. </p>
        <p> The result sparked a terrifying wave, and many speculated that Gu Changge couldn’t just be in the Late Stage
            of the Conferred King Realm! </p>
        <p> After all, no one had seen him go all out. </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace was definitely among the top-tier Young Supremes in the Upper
            Realm — after all, how many from the younger generation had reached the Pinnacle Stage of the Conferred King
            Realm? — yet in front of Gu Changge, she couldn’t gather an iota of strength to fight back, and was defeated
            within an instant. </p>
        <p> At that time, Gu Changge showed an extremely terrifying sword art which contained an absolute edge, and that
            sword art killed countless Young Supremes with just a wisp of its sword energy. </p>
        <p> Chills went down the backs of all the Young Supremes on the Ancient Immortal Continent, and they asked
            themselves if they could resist in the face of such might, and realized that they couldn’t. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge, the mountain pressing down on their heads, turned even bigger and heavier. </p>
        <p> The realization made everyone gasp for breath. </p>
        <p> <b>“Young Sovereign…Brother Gu’s strength is terrifying indeed! I feel ashamed to be mentioned in the same
                sentence as him.”</b> </p>
        <p> A young man surrounded by spirits and phantoms shook his head with a wry smile and showed a face full of
            shock outside an ancient cave oozing Immortal Mist. </p>
        <p> He was Ye Langtian! </p>
        <p> Over the last period of time, he was only able to break through to the Middle Stage of the Conferred King
            Realm, so he didn’t hold much confidence in winning if he were to be put against the Seventh Princess of the
            Sea King Palace, yet Gu Changge easily obliterated her. </p>
        <p> There was no need to even think about the chasm between the two of them. </p>
        <p> <b>“In the younger generation, I am afraid that no one can go against Brother Gu except for actual Young
                Emperor’s and those Ancient Monsters…”</b> </p>
        <p> Ye Langtian couldn’t help but sigh, but that didn’t mean his Dao Heart was shaken and he was now afraid of
            Gu Changge…it was just that he could see the chasm that separated them. It wasn’t something he could make up
            with hard cultivation or just his talent alone. </p>
        <p> Recognizing reality and understanding the gap between them wasn’t bad. </p>
        <p> Similar scenes transpired in other areas of the Continent as well </p>
        <p> Countless cultivators of the younger generation had come to the Ancient Immortal Continent — the Dao
            Heritages alone sent innumerable disciples, not to mention the unaffiliated cultivators from all over the
            world — and all of the were shocked when they receive the news about the death of the Seventh Princess of
            the Sea King Palace at Gu Changge’s hand. </p>
        <p> Finding a divine opportunity wouldn’t shock them as much as this piece of news did! </p>
        <p> …… </p>
        <p> <b>[In a corner of the Continent right now.]</b> </p>
        <p> A world-shattering war was taking place in the Easter region of the Ancient Immortal Continent. </p>
        <p> Large tracts of mountains collapsed and lakes dried up as the aftermath of the battle shook thousands of
            miles. </p>
        <p> Two women fought without break. </p>
        <p> A person with a picturesque face wearing a large, blue, silk robe fluttering in the wind moved her flawless
            hands and flew through the sky at breakneck speed with a dazzling brilliance surrounding her. </p>
        <p> Brilliant silver light bloomed in her hands, like silver vines rooted in the Void, and dazzling light
            overwhelmed her surroundings and overturned everything. </p>
        <p> It was Yue Mingkong’s mighty Weapon Art…it could be called an Imperial Art. </p>
        <p> Alas! The other party resisted it well. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong showed an indifferent expression on the outside, but on the inside, she was burning with worry
            as she increased the intensity of her attacks. </p>
        <p> The cultivators in the surrounding were startled by the bout between the two peerless Empresses who appeared
            to cover the Universe with their jade hands and desired to rule over everything! </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong’s opponent was a tall and slender woman with dragon horns, a beautiful face, simple clothes,
            and a wild and domineering aura. </p>
        <p> Her aura struck terror in the heart of the weaklings, and she resembled a young True Dragon. </p>
        <p> As she waved her arm for attack, the Void in front of her burst open and a massive hole appeared. </p>
        <p> Such terrifying might made the cultivators in the surroundings tremble with fear, and they suspected that
            they might be jolted to death and turn into blood mist if they approached them too closely! </p>
        <p> Right now, Yue Mingkong was bathed in silver light. </p>
        <p> She appeared to be in control of Heaven and Earth in her surroundings as she grasped endless might in her
            hands that made the world around her rumble. </p>
        <p> Still, she didn’t dare to confront her foe head on, and could only use subtle tactics to fight her opponent.
        </p>
        <p> <b>“Crown Princess Mingkong is mighty beyond measure! She doesn’t show her strength on normal days, but
                right now, she looks invincible!”</b> </p>
        <p> The onlooking cultivators couldn’t help but show shock. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong’s unprecedented aura shocked all of them, and they wondered if any of them could even compete
            with her? </p>
        <p> <b>“This is the might of Crown Princess Mingkong! The Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family was
                already strong enough, and now, his fiancee turns out to be no worse than him.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Which Young Supreme is she fighting? That woman’s face looks unfamiliar, and I don’t think she’s even a
                Young Supreme from the outside world! Her Cultivation Base has already broken through to the False God
                Realm! It’s unimaginable.”</b> </p>
        <p> Countless cultivators watching the battle trembled in their hearts, not because they were timid, but because
            the battle in front of them truly shocked them. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong was already so strong, yet she still couldn’t take down the dragon-horned woman in front of
            her. </p>
        <p> Suddenly, a cultivator widened his eyes after he thought of something, and took in a deep breath and said,
            <b>“She…couldn’t be from the remnants of the Ancient Immortal Tribe, right?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Didn’t the Ancient Immortal Tribe perish a long time ago? No matter how vast the Ancient Immortal
                Continent might be, it was nothing but a small continent back in the era it’s from. Could it be that
                some of the Ancient Immortal Tribe’s people survived and are living here?”</b> </p>
        <p> The person next to that cultivator was agitated and felt incredulous over the revelation. Gett your
            𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com</p>
        <p> The Ancient Immortal Tribe, as the name suggests, was a mysterious Race that existed during the Ancient
            Immortal Era. </p>
        <p> If they really existed on the Ancient Immortal Continent, then…the rest of the aborigines of the Continent
            might just be their subjects, no…their slaves, to be precise. </p>
        <p> The Ancient Immortal Tribe has always been shrouded in mystery, and the contemporary Non-Human Ancient
            Immortal Families were more or less their distant relatives related to them through their bloodlines. </p>
        <p> This alone showed the horrors of the Ancient Immortal Tribe. </p>
        <p> Of course, the main reason for their fear towards them was the fact that the Spiritual Qi on the Ancient
            Immortal Continent was far denser than the outside world. </p>
        <p> If there were remnants of the Ancient Immortal Tribe living on the Ancient Immortal Continent, then their
            younger generation would clearly be much stronger than the younger generation of the outside world. </p>
        <p> The dragon-horned woman in front of them was a clear example of what they were thinking about. </p>
        <p> She looked to be in her early twenties, yet she was already in the False God Realm…she easily surpassed
            countless Young Supremes of the outside world. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong could naturally listen to the words of the onlookers, but her expression didn’t change as she
            already knew the details in her heart. </p>
        <p> As a regressor, she, of course, knew that there were remnants of the Ancient Immortal Tribe living on the
            Ancient Immortal Continent. </p>
        <p> What’s more? The dragon-horned woman in front of her was a leader of the Ancient Immortal Tribe’s younger
            generation, or how else could she have stalled her for so long? </p>
        <p> It’s just that Yue Mingkong never expected to bump into someone like her from the Ancient Immortal Tribe so
            soon. </p>
        <p> The other party had real dragon blood flowing through her veins, so her physical strength was through the
            roof. It was said that her ancestor was a literal True Dragon with Cultivation Base surpassing even that of
            True Immortals. </p>
        <p> As a leader among the descendants of the Ancient Immortal Tribe’s survivors, the strength of the girl in
            front of her obviously couldn’t be questioned. </p>
        <p> If the one in front of her was another Young Supreme, she would have already crushed them — they would never
            be her opponent. </p>
        <p> What’s more? Yue Mingkong knew about the existence of someone even more terrifying than her, an amazing and
            brilliant figure known as Long Teng, who was said to be the Reincarnation of a True Dragon! </p>
        <p> He held extremely tyrannical strength, and a conceited temperament that made him believe that if he claimed
            to be the second strongest in the world, no one would dare claim to be number one. </p>
        <p> In her last life, he left the Ancient Immortal Continent and challenged all kinds of talents from all walks
            of life in the outside world. He never tasted defeat…but then, he disappeared without a trace one day. </p>
        <p> [TL/N: Daddy Changge nom-nommed him.] </p>
        <p> But now, Yue Mingkong concluded that Long Teng probably encountered Gu Changge and dug his own grave in the
            process. </p>
        <p> ‘If it weren’t for the fact that there are too many outsiders watching our battle, and I can’t use some of
            my cards, how could she hold me back for so long…’ </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong couldn’t help but frown. </p>
        <p> Right now, she didn’t know about what became of Gu Xian’er, so she was somewhat worried about her. </p>
        <p> Right then, the dragon-horned girl in front of her suddenly spoke up in the language of the outside world.

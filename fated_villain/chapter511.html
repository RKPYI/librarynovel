          powers. In a split second, the grand hall was left quaking as the
          intertwining runes occurred. The crevices that were left on the walls
          immediately exploded.</span

          shocked by Luo Feng&#8217;s remarks after the latter awakened. Even
          worse, he never expected Yan Ming to strike right away without sparing
          him any thought.</span

          father and shook his head. There wasn&#8217;t much change in his
          expression, and he seemed strangely serene, as though he wasn&#8217;t
          bothered by his opponent.</span

          >*Whoosh!* The next moment, before the dumbfounded gazes of the crowd,
          a faint, golden gleam appeared on Luo Feng&#8217;s forehead. It bore
          the semblance of an ancient symbol, carrying an intertwining aura of
          mystery and wonders. Its emergence was followed by an intimidating,
          horrifying aura. Anyone touched by the spine-chilling aura would then
          feel the temptation to kneel towards Luo Feng.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing the ability, the crowd in the grand hall was awestruck. Their
          bodies froze as they couldn&#8217;t believe their eyes.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon the sight, Luo Ying’s jaw dropped in stupefaction, and she
          couldn&#8217;t even finish her sentence. As a Direct Member of the
          Family of Protectors, she was aware of many secrets, naturally
          including this symbol and what it signified. In that instant, her mind
          forcefully rang as she could barely trust her eyes.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Vaguely, the crowd could see shrieking gods and demons, chanting of
          Immortals within the symbol. Even the air began to grow hazy, followed
          by an eruption of unparalleled force, as if stars were exploding right
          before their eyes. Runes gushed to the sky, and its blinding shine
          forbade anyone from opening their eyes.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many started to tear up as they quickly turned their heads away, not
          daring to look into the dazzling light, and that indicated how
          frightening the shockwave was.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Apart from that, what left them absolutely shocked and dismayed was
          the existence of the golden symbol and why Luo Feng was able to
          conjure it and deflect Yan Ming&#8217;s attack.</span
        >

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Argh…&#8221; Following a groan, Yan Ming, who initiated the
          fight, spewed a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying away like a
          broken sack.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone was appalled by the sight. After all, Luo Feng had never
          cultivated.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;W—What is that thing…&#8221; The members of the Luo Clan
          opened their jaws agape and stuttered an incomplete sentence with
          their shivering voices.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >What they just witnessed was truly traumatising. None would have
          expected that Luo Feng, the twenty-year old idiot, would suddenly
          regain his senses, let alone summon such a strange symbol and gravely
          injure Yan Ming.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After regaining their senses, the Luo Clan members grew frantic with
          awe and worry. After all, Luo Feng injured the Young Master of Crimson
          South City right in front of the public eye, so they couldn&#8217;t
          help but be concerned whether the Swallow Clan would forgive them or
          that they would be exiled from the vast Crimson South City.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that in mind, they genuinely hoped that Luo Feng had never
          regained his senses.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Who is Luo Feng? What connection does he bear with the Prime
          Ancestor? Why does he have the symbol of the Prime Ancestor?&#8221;
          The members of the Luo Clan were distressed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, Luo Ying couldn&#8217;t be any more shocked. Her
          breath quickened as she stared at Luo Feng. At the same time, to her,
          the intimidation from Gu Changge and his gang was no longer worth
          worrying about, as the symbol alone was the very proof that Luo Ming
          bore no simple identity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;This is a light punishment for disrespecting me!&#8221;
          Unbothered by the disbelieving, agitated faces of the crowd, Luo Feng
          retained his serene expression with a trace of coldness as he glared
          at Yan Ming, who was being helped up by other members of the Swallow
          Clan, as he blandly spoke. As he spoke, the symbol on his forehead
          gradually disappeared, as though the exchange earlier was merely an
          illusion.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Feng&#8217;er, t—that was…&#8221; Perplexed, the leader of the
          Luo Clan peered at Luo Feng as he still had yet to process what just
          happened.</span

          >&#8220;I shall explain everything to you after I have resolved the
          problem, Father.&#8221; Luo Feng gently shook his head without saying
          much, as his gaze was fastened on Gu Changge.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          retreat, or he would only find himself filled with regret.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that, the grand hall instantaneously became silent as everyone
          was peering at the unaffected, extraordinary-looking Luo Feng with
          their thoughts jumbled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Gu…&#8221; Yan Ming faced a major loss as he
          never expected such a move from Luo Feng. Shamefully, he walked
          towards Gu Changge. He was still unable to comprehend what ability Luo
          Feng used to defend against his full-powered attack.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So that was it? Well, it’s not that surprising…&#8221;
          Nevertheless, Gu Changge did not pay attention to Yan Ming as he was
          gazing at Luo Feng. He seemed to be whispering to himself in a
          somewhat disappointed tone, with an inexplicable feeling.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          thinking that the latter must be related to the Prime Ancestor of the
          Four Powerful War God Clans, but after seeing Luo Feng&#8217;s symbol,
          he realised that it was the fabled Symbol of Epoch.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Symbol of Epoch&#8217;s function was similar to that of the
          Symbol of Reincarnation. Nevertheless, the origin of the Symbol of
          Reincarnation was even more mysterious. Meanwhile, the only way to
          obtain the Symbol of Epoch is by cultivating through the Tree of
          Epoch.</span

          >As for why Luo Feng had fallen this low, there could be many reasons
          to it, but none of them piqued Gu Changge&#8217;s interest. All he
          wanted to know was whether Luo Feng was precisely the person who stole
          the Fortuity of the Upper Realm, and that was enough to him.</span

          oblivious about the Symbol of Epoch nor had they heard about it. It
          was certainly something out of their reach, but judging by Luo
          Feng&#8217;s expression, the Symbol of Epoch must be a powerful

          Changge merely feigned a smile. In others&#8217; eyes, his casual,
          condescending expression resembled that of a cat when it was toying
          with a rat. Nonetheless, at this point, he no longer had the intention

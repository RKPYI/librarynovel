        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The incredibly sharp, glistening life-like golden spear was surging with divine light. Yet right then, it was
            stained with blood as it pierced through Chu Hao, and blood containing Divinity dripped from high above one
            after another, turning the lake into a near-bottomless pit while bloody mist mixed with cream-white bone
            shards floated in the air. <span id="more-30329"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a shocking and fearful sight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Gu Changge raised his right arm into the air, gave it a gentle tremble, and Chu Hao&#8217;s body
            exploded into dust with nothing of him left. Even his soul was wiped away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alas, Chu Hao, the Fortuitous One, died just like that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dead silence filled the air as Lin Wu and the others shuddered involuntarily. None of them had foreseen such
            an ending.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As powerful as Chu Hao was, his attacks did nothing to his opponent, even when he went all out. Instead, he
            was killed by his opponent with ease in mid-air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The man was so powerful that it was despairing, and one couldn&#8217;t even have the will to fight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re both from the other realm, yet they can kill each other like this. This man is a
            monster! Do we even have cultivators that can defeat him?&#8221; Huo Rong couldn&#8217;t help whispering in
            a shaky and barely audible voice as fear surged within him. &#8220;We better get going…&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The others nodded agreement, and they held their breaths while silently retreating far away, not daring to
            show the slightest bit of abnormality.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lin Wu, Lu Luo and the others fell into silence as their hearts grew heavy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was the enemy they could not face right now. They dared not imagine how good of a chance they would have
            in defeating Gu Changge when not even someone as strong as Chu Hao could give the man as much as a scratch.
            [How devastating.]
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [I wonder what the Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest has in store this time…] Gu Changge glanced in the direction Lin
        Wu and the others were leaving but didn&#8217;t bother himself with them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sure, the place was massive, but no one could escape his eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [Since Chu Hao was here for the Supreme Dao Diagram, then it would mean that the Fortuitous One of the Eight
        Wastelands and Ten Domains is looking for some other supreme treasure. So, I will need him to find the treasure
        for me.] Gu Changge thought he could make proper use of the Fortuitous One of the Eight Wastelands and Ten
        Domains.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [He&#8217;s also the perfect pawn for me to use to explore the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.] Before killing
        Chu Hao, Gu Changge had already emptied his Fortiuty. Hence, a quaint, mysterious lavender-glow-surrounding
        Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest that only he could see dropped out of Chu Hao&#8217;s body the next moment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a twist of his sleeve, he claimed the treasure chest and finally turned to the members of the Supreme
            Cave Heaven, who were shaken by what happened to Chu Hao.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Sect Master Chu Hao is dead!&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Gu Changge killed Sect Master Chu Hao!&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nearly all the eyes of the Supreme Cave Heaven members were bloodshot as a glow enveloped their bodies, and
            all of them had gone on a rampage, doing whatever it took to avenge Chu Hao.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Massive turbulence surged the world as everyone brought out their artifacts which shone brightly with divine
            lights.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Ah Da was terrifyingly powerful, and he had the upper hand even when he alone had to face all
            of them. His black spear swept across like a heavenly blade struck down, creating gusts of strong wind that
            ravaged all directions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*Pfft!* Just like that, everyone was forced to back up as they coughed up blood. Their bodies were aching
            with pain, and who knew just how many of their bones were broken?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gu Changge found there were two Sacred Emperor Realm Beings who were the strongest amongst them, and it was
            those two who were still standing at this point.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*Buzz!* The next moment, he narrowed his eyes, and the space seemingly froze as he extended his arm. With
            that, a massive ball of golden light merged into a golden palm with flashing runes that landed towards them,
            wanting to kill them all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The palm moved like a world-ending millstone, terrifying and magnificent, unparalleled and unstoppable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*Boom!* Despair filled everyone as they screamed and exploded under the attack. Having no way to defend
            themselves, they were crushed into chunks of flesh and blood in no time while their souls shattered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Master.&#8221; Ah Da withdrew his black spear and stood before Gu Changge deferentially.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon, too, was kneeling deferentially at one side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The world finally returned to quietness as Gu Changge nodded in reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave all of this to
            you,&#8221; he said before looking towards the Supreme Dao Diagram.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he moved his mind, a majestic divine sense swept across, like the manifestation of the Heavenly Dao. With
            this, he suppressed the diagram with a will that could not be resisted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Supreme Dao Diagram rustled as though there were stars spinning. Mountains and rivers manifested as
            terrifying blade auras emerged and struck down one after another towards him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Looks like the innate blade&#8217;s aura is only one of its many tricks…&#8221; Gu Changge mused. Back
            when he first learned about the Supreme Dao Diagram, he had already wondered if it had connections to the
            legendary Innate Tai Chi Diagram. After all, they both distinguished black and white, divided into Yin and
            Yang, and could resolve heaven and earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ah Da opened his mouth wide and swallowed the bloody mist after receiving Gu Changge&#8217;s
            consent. Though the Dao Hearts of many had been crushed, their Dao ability and cultivation were still
            contained within the bloody mist.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For Gu Changge, only the Life Force of a Nirvana Realm expert and beyond would make a difference, so he had
            no intentions of swallowing these Life Forces and instead gave them to Ah Da. After all, the latter was born
            from one drop of his True Blood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If it wasn&#8217;t that he was trapped in the Demon-Burying Abyss for countless years, how would he only be
            in the First-Order Quasi-Nirvana Realm now!?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Though the Supreme Dao Diagram was still resisting Gu Changge&#8217;s forced refinement, it was also
            gradually weakening.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With that, slivers of divine light enveloped in an endless black-and-white aura fell and landed on Gu
            Changge&#8217;s head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As his mind shifted, the Supreme Dao Diagram, too, was shifting the magnificent view, and the space around
            them could seemingly be swallowed into it, turning imagination into reality.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [Attack and defence in one… It is indeed extraordinary.]
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [I wonder if the Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest from killing Chu Hao will be useful, though…] After putting the
        Supreme Dao Diagram away, Gu Changge pulled out the Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest. Following a flashing lavender
        glow, a crystal-clear ancient mirror of an unknown era with quaint patterns emerged from within.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [This is… The Mirror of Wonders?] Gu Changge quirked a brow in surprise before reading the ancient
        mirror&#8217;s description closely. [Know everything from the past to the present.]
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a mysterious treasure that could reflect many wondrous views, and such wonders were indescribable. It
            could be the legendary Hell or the Nine Heavens and even possibly traces within this timeline. As for what
            use there would be after it was reflected, Gu Changge had no clue.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That said, another artifact popped into his mind—the Spacetime Stone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [Will something fascinating happen if I combine it with the Mirror of Wonders?]
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the rest of the day, Gu Changge searched for the Grand Furnace Chu Hao left behind and stored it away
            before finding a place there to advance his cultivation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sure, the Grand Furnace was very powerful, but it wasn&#8217;t very useful for him. Hence, after much
            deliberation, he decided to make a trip to the Violet Supreme Alchemy Sect when he had the time and it to
            Lin Qiuhan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since she had Alchemy Talent, the furnace would be of better use in her hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the rest of the day, divine light that shot through the sky erupted there as the place filled with a hazy
            glow and celestial mist. Shards of Dao fell ceaselessly and merged into a massive white cocoon on
            surrounding Gu Changge.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Inside the cocoon, Chaotic Lights permeated out as the thunderous sound of Qi and blood coursed through his
            veins as though the universe exploded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After killing Chu Hao and changing several of his Absolute Detachment Bones, his cultivation advanced to the
            Quasi-Nirvana Realm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If it weren&#8217;t for the fact that the heavenly tribulation had disappeared for aeons, the sensation of
            his advancement alone would certainly be a ginormous one. Shaking the past and present wasn&#8217;t just
            mere grandeur for his accomplishments.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, the sensation didn&#8217;t last long as the Chaotic-Light-surrounding cocoon cracked, and Gu Changge
            walked out from it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;People have entered this space… Seems like two batches of people.&#8221; Gu Changge quirked a brow as
            he sensed faint turbulence in the air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Followingly, he took a step out, appeared on top of the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon&#8217;s heads, ripped
            the space in front of him apart, and disappeared from the place in two shakes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a group of powerful cultivators were rushing within a mountain range not far away, and one of them
            was mumbling with a frown, &#8220;According to the news the Lady delivered, the so-called Void Realm should
            be here.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The others, too, sized the massive unfamiliar space up carefully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;What a shame that, for years, we have no clue the Spirit Gourd Master&#8217;s supreme treasure had
            been left behind here,&#8221; lamented an elder covered in a red aura.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was a member of the Ancient Huo Family from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, and the blood coursing
            through his veins was of the ancient ‘God of Flames’.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Compared to the other realm, what we lack are not talents or Qi or physique, but champions that stand
            at the peak. Our chances of winning will increase if we can get one more supreme treasure,&#8221; said the
            burly man in armour after nodding.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His name was Lin Yunxiao, a cultivator of the Lin Family from the Blood Dragon Clan. He was also Lin
            Wu&#8217;s uncle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The other cultivators, too, nodded in agreement as they swept their gazes across the place.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;But the Lady said cultivators of another realm have also sneaked into this place.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;So what? What&#8217;s there to worry about? Since they dare come to our realm, they should be prepared
            to be annihilated. Those damn bandits, burning and killing their entire path… How many of our people have
            died in their hands?!&#8221; Someone raged as their malice shot through the roof. Wanting nothing more than
            to bring the Upper Realm invaders to death, even more so at the mention of the Upper Realm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To them, the Upper Realm&#8217;s countless invasions had destroyed their peaceful environment, and for
            countless years, innumerable warriors were buried at the shores of the Boundary Marker Sea, leaving their
            wives and daughters to safeguard their homes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, how could such hatred be resolved easily?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

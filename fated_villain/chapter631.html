        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, countless Divine Swords hummed with unimaginably terrifying energy within the thousand-kilometre radius of the Shu Sect. It was so loud that it shattered the skies and quaked the earth.</span><span id="more-34796"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the forefront was the Sword of World Domination. The weapon was enveloped in a divine azure glow, emitting brilliant rays of light, looking as though it came from a land far, beyond this realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind, countless Divine Swords followed, moving so speedily that one could only see their silhouettes as they collectively enveloped the world in darkness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an astounding scene, and all the Elders and disciples of the Shu Sect came out of their quarters to the outdoors to watch the incredible phenomenon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, at the yard, Ah Qing, Princess Xuan Dea, the Snow Sword Immortal, and the others were forced to retreat. The turbulence was far too terrifying for them to bear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!* Peerless energy was emitted from the awakening of the Sword of World Domination as it flew towards Gu Changge, wanting to annihilate him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; Roared Tuo Ba Xiao Yao with madness as he manipulated the Sword of World Domination wildly with bloodshot eyes, wanting to kill the man. While seemingly falling into a frenzy, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s skin cracked, and fresh blood began seeping out. It was evident he paid a great price to awaken the Sword of World Domination. Of course, it was also his last-ditch attempt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the timely opportunity, he took advantage of the powers of the Shu Sect&#8217;s innumerable Divine Swords coupled with the Sword of World Domination to kill Gu Changge there and then.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had only resolved to do it after much deliberation. He knew the consequences were great, but it was the only solution he could come up with so far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sword Qis of countless Shu Sect experts from over the hundreds and thousands of years remained within Shu Sect. The will of the countless Divine Swords sealed within the place since its establishment had long seeped into their blades after hundreds and thousands of years of continuous refinement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the guidance of the Sword of World Domination, the power they released would certainly be apocalyptic, and the damage caused to Gu Changge would be devastating—better yet, he might even die on the spot—especially if he hadn&#8217;t expected it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!* The sky shook, and the space in the yard cracked as countless swords shot towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master!&#8221; Ah Da, who had been ordered to stay in the shadows, came out with a grim expression, wanting to withstand the attack for Gu Changge. Even he felt the immense danger. Just standing in front, his skin cracked and nearly exploded because of the Sword of World Domination&#8217;s power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beings close to becoming True Daoists would have a hard time withstanding the blow, so what more of the Earth Sword Immortals?!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. There&#8217;s no reason for me not to take the Sword of World Domination when it is flying towards me, right?&#8221; said Gu Changge with a chuckle as he told Ah Da to back down, unruffled by the terrifying scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had always been within his expectation that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao wouldn&#8217;t willingly give up the Sword of World Domination. However, he never thought the man would be so bold as to attack him at this time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How will you defend yourself from this attack, Gu Changge!?&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao roared as rage surged within him once again when he sensed Gu Changge&#8217;s scorn. As he cast the secret technique with all his might.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How pathetic if this is all you&#8217;ve got,&#8221; ridiculed Gu Changge with a subtle smile while impassiveness laced his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He raised his palm under everyone&#8217;s appalling gaze, then pressed it gently towards the front. It seemed as though a whole universe had collapsed into itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the entire world fell into dead silence as terrifying fluctuations rang out, just like a supernova. The energy stormed towards the zillions of Divine Swords and caused a massive explosion in the air, enveloping the sky in blinding light before absolute darkness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Divine Swords flying towards Gu Changge vibrated, and the blades curved into themselves as cracks formed bit by bit before snapping into shards with a crack, turning to dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Sword of World Domination, wanting to destroy everything, shone with an intense azure glow. The glow enveloped the sword as a mirage of a flying Immortal appeared holding the blade. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it seemed to be restricted by invincible chains, obstructing its movement. Around its edge, was the clashing of Principles, as Chaos Qi seeped out from the cracks of the void the sword left behind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, it can&#8217;t be…&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s vomited  fresh blood as madness surged in his eyes. He couldn&#8217;t believe Gu Changge could resolve this attack so effortlessly under such circumstances. [He shouldn&#8217;t be able to be this domineering in the Profound Sword World!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!* Even more Divine Swords charged towards Gu Changge from all directions of the Shu Sect. But just as they were about to pierce the man, a brilliant light burst out, and an intangible hand blocked them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One simple gesture was all it took for Gu Changge to resolve the danger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Clang!* Just like that, countless Divine Swords snapped under his two fingers, and large areas of Principles exploded like firecrackers, transforming into brilliant and dazzling light before disappearing into the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Sword of World Domination, which had Immortal Principles coursing within it, hummed and had difficulty advancing. In fact, its surroundings began crumbling and obliterating into the nothingness that could devour anything and everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Impossible! Sword of World Domination, kill him!&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao roared, unwilling to resign to fate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who would have thought the technique he cast with all his might didn&#8217;t even touch a corner of Gu Changge&#8217;s clothes, let alone injure the man!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terrifying gap between him and Gu Cangge made him feel absolutely hopeless and powerless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;ll be damned once my plan fails. Gu Changge will never spare me]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao began burning his Life Force. A horrifying red glow set him ablaze in two breaths, turning him into a human torch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, intense energy erupted from the Sword of World Domination again as a profound power of Immortals, and unparalleled edge pierced through the skies, destroying the stars in the outer regions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elders and disciples of the Shu Sect shuddered in fear upon seeing the scene, fearing Gu Changge&#8217;s ruthlessness. Of course, they were even more afraid and worried the battle would wipe out their Sect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Sword of World Domination can&#8217;t stop me even when it has been completely awakened, much less in its state right now…&#8221; Commented Gu Changge impassively as he simply flicked his wrist while the power of Dao remained in the air. It seemed that time had become non-existent to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After becoming a True Daoist, obliterating the Profound Sword World wouldn&#8217;t be something difficult for him, even when this world had handicapped him. Still, the difference in their levels was right before their eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the countless Divine Swords shattered, the mountain where the Shu Sect was located exploded with a boom. The surrounding buildings and mountain range instantly turned into dust, and the void before it crumbled, allowing Chaos Light to peek out. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Small Universe was born just like that, and a kind of energy from the beginning of time entered the place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a grand and unparalleled attack, and Gu Changge grabbed the sword with his bare hands. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multicoloured glows painted the sky as divine lotuses sprouted from the ground while various lights merged into a massive divine ocean.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this the power of a supreme expert from that world?&#8221; The Shu Sect Master, the Snow Sword Immortal, other Earth Sword Immortals, and the rest were all ghastly pale. They could not help but think of themselves as tiny and powerless ants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone dropped to the ground. Though none were assaulted, they couldn&#8217;t stand the apocalyptic oppression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Argh!&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao spat out blood continuously as he fell back. At this point, his entire body had crumbled, and his burning soul was quickly extinguishing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Sword of World Domination&#8217;s glow quickly disappeared now that it was no longer being controlled, and the rest of the Divine Swords in the air which had been shattered to bits, silently turning into specks of dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Gu Changge reached his arm out to catch the Sword of World Domination. He could tell this last piece of Tool of World Domination was unlike its other counterparts, well deserving its title as the number one tool for attacking amongst the Seven Tools of World Domination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s cultivation, his attack was comparable to an attack from a True Daoist, after he forcefully activated the Sword of World Domination. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Shu Sect&#8217;s several hundreds of thousands of years of Fortuity had something to do with it, it was enough, which prove the sword&#8217;s remarkableness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Gu Changge took control of the Sword of World Domination. A terrifying burst of immortal essence burst out from the sword and transformed into a blade that shot towards Gu Changge, who dispersed the immortal essence instantly with a flick of a finger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other movements and noises gradually quieted down very quickly, and the yard turned deadly silent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, on the ground afar, the bloody Tuo Ba Xiao Yao watched the scene with deep frustration and disappointment. He had come around as well at this point. His entire plan came to nothing in the end because absolute power trumps all schemes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps things would&#8217;ve ended differently for him if he just gave Gu Changge the Sword of World Domination right off the bat. However, what was done could never be undone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anything else you want to say?&#8221; It was after Gu Changge kept the Sword of World Domination away and nodded with satisfaction that he approached Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just kill me.&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao chuckled wryly as many memories of his past life flashed across his eyes. He was just as hopeless when he faced Gu Changge back then. However, he at least had Yu Feiya by his side at the time, unlike now, all alone. Perhaps his family might even be compromised as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t an option, to begin with,&#8221; monotoned Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Sword of World Domination is in your hands now. You promised you&#8217;ll let my sister go,&#8221; said Tuo Ba Xiao Yao with a grim smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And I will. I never go back on my words,&#8221; said Gu Changge plainly after an enigmatic expression flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next second, he sensed an inexplicable wave of turbulence, and he couldn&#8217;t help frowning while looking towards the sky. &#8220;To think it didn&#8217;t continue to hide. There seems to be something wrong with the World’s Will.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By right, a World’s Will would avoid him once it sensed his presence. [So why would this one show itself at this time?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shockwave of his attack had already exceeded this world&#8217;s limits. Thus, it was normal that the World’s Will would get stirred up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can it be that the World’s Will main consciousness still lay dormant, and what appears is just an incarnation?] Gu Changge shook his head lightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the countenances of nearly everyone within the Shu Sect turned awful as they sensed an inexplicable Principle appearing in this part of the sky, like a pair of eyes were looking closely at all that was happening here from an unknown land far away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world quaked, and a pair of blood-red eyes appeared. It was godly and massive, so massive that it filled the entire sky, and various ancient patterns like the divine bird and sun surrounded them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chills ran down the spines of countless as they shuddered in fear, and all thoughts and actions were laid bare in front of the pair of icy and bloody eyes. They were as tiny and lowly as a speck of dust. In the face of this eye.</span></p>

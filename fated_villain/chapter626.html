        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black hand stretched across the sky for thousands of kilometres and caught the three Earth Sword Immortals immediately before reducing them to ashes while the sounds of desperate and terrified screaming filled the air.</span><span id="more-33876"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a sight which could make anyone shiver with fear, and even the Snow Sword Immortal, who was also in the Earth Sword Immortal Realm, felt threatened. She even clenched a fist beneath her sleeve. There was such an unfathomable insurmountable gap between them. It made her feel helpless and desperate. She would never have survived against the three Earth Sword Immortals, yet they were easily killed by Gu Changge with one strike, as if made from paper-mâché.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, she finally understood why the Otherworldly Sky Demons had such a deeply-ingrained fear towards Gu Changge. It felt like ants facing a dragon when faced against him. Such a feeling of submission and fear seemed to come from the deepest parts of their souls and was hard to erase. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing and Princess Xuan Dea felt a strange feeling of unfamiliarity when they looked at Gu Changge, whose expression did not change as he stood on the city walls. Even an Earth Sword Celestial was like an insect in his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This may be his true personality. He&#8217;s far too gentle with us,&#8221; Ah Qing muttered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old City Lord and the others beside her looked terrified and yet, reverent. They had all treated him like a saviour and were worried about him. The scene they had witnessed made them realise that he had dared come openly to the Profound Sword World for a reason. They were simply not a threat to him. His terrifying strength had given him such confidence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How did he do this? This world would not allow someone with abilities this powerful to appear so easily.] Lin En&#8217;s pupils contracted since he was unable to conceal his shock. He had been proud of himself for reaching the Earth Sword Immortal Realm in his twenties, but he had now been humbled. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene before him was unfathomable. It felt like a dream. At that moment, Lin En could sense an overpowering threat. If Gu Changge wanted to kill him, Lin En wouldn&#8217;t be able to take one strike from him even with his true body materialising. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, his Master, the Old Sword Immortal, had sent out the Sword Immortal Order and commanded every Sword Immortal to hunt down Gu Changge. It was as though there was a great hatred which could only be resolved with death. How could Gu Changge ever allow Shu Sect and the Old Sword Immortal to survive after this?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I&#8217;m still too weak. I have to think of a way to strengthen myself or I won&#8217;t be able to save the Shu Sect!] Lin En&#8217;s gaze became solemn as he felt the huge burden weighing down on his shoulders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems that Earth Sword Immortals vary in strength too.] Gu Changge shook his head lightly, unbothered by the terrified looks everyone directed at him, and descended from the city wall. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he saw it, the Star Sword Immortal was at most in the First Order Quasi-Nirvana Realm. The other Earth Sword Immortals were far more powerful than the Star Sword Immortal, which might be the effect of the World Principles of Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what he saw, this world could clearly give rise to more formidable beings. It was just that the presence of the World&#8217;s Will did not allow the birth of a far too powerful being, in case they overcame its control. The abilities of Heavenly Monster Grandma and the others proved his assumption right. While they stood at the peak of the Profound Sword World, they were still very far away from being True Daoist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Will of this world is really ambitious.] Gu Changge had a faint assumption within his mind/ [What if it was before this world had developed a Will of its own? Would there not be True Daoists around during that time?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge stepped into Ancient Mulberry City, everyone retreated while looking at him with fear in their eyes. The heads of the other Forces, who had planned to cooperate with the Earth Sword Immortals to attack him, were quivering in fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, all of you want to attack me as well?&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at them carelessly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head of the Wu Family and the others felt their blood freeze within their veins as their souls collapsed into ashes before they were entirely wiped from existence. They had been prepared to explain themselves but they were shaking so badly they couldn&#8217;t speak.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next moment, Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes landed on them, and a terrifying pressure rushed towards them like a flood. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every wisp of his aura felt heavier than a tonne, causing space to collapse and destroy Principles of this world. Naturally, towers and pavilions in front of him were instantly disintegrated into ash and smoke, while the Head of the Wu Family and the others suffered the same fate as their bodies and souls were turned into ash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thick clouds of blood spread into the air and rained down, mixed in with shards from broken weapons as well as broken bones. This made those in Ancient Mulberry City shake with terror. They could see that these Forces were already intending to attack once the Heavenly Monster Grandma and the rest showed up. Their intentions were easily discerned by Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a total of four Earth Sword Immortals who had died outside Ancient Mulberry City, all gone because of just one man. Not that many peak experts had died even during the exploration of the Space Rift. It was undeniably a terrible loss for Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news spread quickly to the outside world and shook all Thirteen States. Many were shocked and frightened, since no one expected such an earth-shattering event to happen right at the centre of their world, just when the military forces sent by various Forces were defending their borders against the Otherworldly Space Demons. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deaths of four Earth Sword Immortals was something unfathomable during peaceful times, much less their terrible demise at the hand of the same man.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that same day, the location of Star Sword Valley was flattened by an expert. An enormous crater appeared thousands of kilometres within the area, which had been completely ravaged and reduced to rubble. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Sect had existed here for tens of thousands of years. It had a deep history and an Earth Sword Immortal as well. However, it had been annihilated by just one person, completely eradicated to the point it could no longer exist..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This information made every Force of the Profound Sword World quiver with fear and they worried that they would be affected by this. They all knew the causes and consequences of this event; such a disaster wouldn&#8217;t have occurred if the Old Sword Immortal hadn&#8217;t wielded the Sword Immortal Order. It could even be said that the existence of the Sword Immortal Order had been the source of the problem, while the Old Sword Immortal had been the perpetrator. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He must be suicidal to dare to offend that man out of everyone else. He probably doesn&#8217;t care about his survival at all since he did something so stupid.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those from the Upper Realm, who received the news, all laughed at the Old Sword Immortal mockingly and scornfully. They also showed sympathy towards the many Forces of the Profound Sword World. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, who had infiltrated the Shu Sect, became stricken as well. The Old Sword Immortal&#8217;s actions were equivalent to bringing the war to the whole Shu Sect, which might cause his plans to fail.</span></p>

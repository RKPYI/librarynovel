          that nearly all Forces of the Upper Realm would be joining. It was a
          significant event, and the importance and the distinguished status of
          a Source Masters would become apparent at this juncture. Every Force
          would want to get their hands on a powerful Source Master.</span

          the entire Dark Kun City.</span

          >Many believed he was a mysterious Divine Source Masters or a
          Successor of one. Hence, they all came up with all sorts of ways to
          recruit him. However, he was a peculiar character. Nearly all those
          who extended an olive branch towards him would be rejected at the
          doorstep. In fact, they never even saw the Master, himself. Yet, they
          were in crucial times. Thus, many Forces dared not act rough. They
          could only cajole their way into his favour.</span

          her his Blood King Ginseng for nothing back in the stone-gambling
          hall. So, she had a feeling that the mystery man might actually see
          her if she paid him a visit.

          recruit him. Who in the vast Upper Realm would ignore Gu
          Changge&#8217;s recruitment nowadays!?</span

          great interest, feeling somewhat surprised. He had indeed come to Xiao
          Ruoyin for this exact purpose, but it all depended on Jiang
          Chen&#8217;s current attitude toward her.</span

          >&#8220;Then, I shall await your good news.&#8221; Gu Changge grinned,
          then gave Xiao Ruoyin a few more instructions before leaving the
          place.</span

          >Certainly, he&#8217;d like to witness the beginning of Xiao Ruoyin
          and Jiang Chen&#8217;s fallout, but he still had other things to see
          to, so he could only leave it be.</span

          >She was well aware that she had to get to the mystery man’s aid as
          soon as possible, or he would take up someone else&#8217;s offer.
          Hence, she quickly sorted herself out despite her discomfort and
          gathered her fellow disciples, who went to the stone-gambling hall
          with her to search for the mystery man.</span

          >&#8220;Say, Jiang Chen, aren&#8217;t you afraid of exposing yourself
          when you show off your face so openly?&#8221; Right then, in a
          courtyard on the east of Dark Kun City, a young woman in light yellow
          asked in bewilderment as she crossed her arms in front of her chest.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The courtyard wasn&#8217;t large. If anything, it could only be
          considered a secluded corner of Dark Kun City. However, here lived the
          mysterious Divine Source Master that had stirred up Dark Kun
          City.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen was sizing up a cut-out purple gold item in his hand when
          he replied to Ji Chuyue plainly. &#8220;What&#8217;s there to be
          afraid of? Who else other than you know who I am now?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          identity. Naturally, he was very trusting of Ji Chuyue.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Though she and her brother had tricked him back at the Purple
          Mountains, he still chose to forgive her. He understood that she had
          no other choice but to throw him under the bus due to Gu
          Changge&#8217;s coercion.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Later, he ran into Ji Chuyue again in an auction house, and the young
          woman had a unique ability that allowed her to see through his
          disguise in one glance.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          target and even nearly died. Fortunately, Ji Chuyue came to the rescue
          in the end.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Chuyue also actually had Jiang Chen to thank for when she managed to
          hear Ji Shengchu&#8217;s call for help at Kun Mountain.</span

          last time I&#8217;ll ever talk to you as a friend. Yaoxing has laid
          his eyes on you for a long while now,&#8221; Ji Chuyue gave him a
          friendly warning, stupefying Jiang Chen for a second.</span

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure either.&#8221; Ji Chuyue shook her head in
          response. &#8220;He warned me about you when Gu Changge paid my family
          a visit.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >&#8220;Got it. I&#8217;ll be careful from now on.&#8221; Jiang Chen
          nodded solemnly. He always had a feeling Ji Yaoxing wasn&#8217;t as
          righteous as he appeared to be.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He, too, had heard about Gu Changge&#8217;s voluntary assistance
          towards the Ji Family, to save their Prime Ancestor. Hence, he
          believed Ji Yaoxing would likely tell Gu Changge if the latter decided
          to track him down.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[It seems that I really have been careless. This is getting a little
          dangerous.] Jiang Chen locked his brows into a thigh furrow. He
          initially believed his disguise to be impeccable, but who&#8217;d have
          thought Ji Yaoxing had learned about his whereabouts for a long
          time.</span

          voluntarily told you such information.&#8221; Monk Pu Du
          couldn&#8217;t help teasing as he walked over after Ji Chuyue left,
          leading Jiang Chen to shoot him a nasty look, saying, &#8220;you
          should note that you won’t be in a safe position if my cover is blown.
          What do we do now? Leave Dark Kun City?&#8221;</span

          so happens that the Ji Family plans to invade Kun Mountain while Dark
          Kun City is having its once in a million years Divine Rock Conference.
          Do you really want to leave just like that?&#8221;</span

          Xiao Ruoyin against Gu Changge. How could he leave in peace just like
          that? Even if he was to leave, he had to think of a way to take Xiao

          recruitment.&#8221; Jiang Chen frowned with displeasure, reflexively
          believing that another Force was attempting to recruit him, and had
          come to his doorstep.</span

          ways on the ancient battleship when they first arrived. But Jiang Chen
          frowned very quickly as he attentively noticed the young woman’s steps
          looked a little odd.</span

          technique last night.&#8221; A hint of awkwardness laced Xiao
          Ruoyin&#8217;s face upon hearing the question, but she still gave a
          random excuse.</span

          >&#8220;You sprained your ankle? Is it serious?&#8221; Jiang Chen
          didn&#8217;t suspect a thing at all, and he just thought that Xiao
          Ruoyin was really careless. [You&#8217;re a cultivator, yet you
          sprained your ankle!?]</span

          >Certainly, it sounded a little exaggerated, but different cultivation
          techniques would likely lead to such possibilities. Those foot
          techniques in particular, might consist of difficult moves and it
          might result in injury.</span

          days.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin waved her hand dismissively, thinking this
          mysterious Divine Source Masters seemed to be overly concerned about
          her.</span

          >&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221; Jiang Chen nodded, then invited
          everyone to take a seat before asking her purpose of visiting.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin wasted no time either, telling him about her purpose of
          visiting, including the current situation in Dark Kun City as well as
          about the upcoming Divine Rock Conference.</span

          stiffening and in the end, grim.</span

          >&#8220;You&#8217;ve come to me because you want me to work for Gu
          Changge?&#8221; Jiang Chen seethed with rage as he bore into Xiao
          Ruoyin while his knuckles cracked.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Never had he thought the young woman would come to him for such a
          reason. He was livid with rage.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin frowned in response. She wasn&#8217;t sure why Jiang Chen
          had such a deep resentment toward Gu Changge, but she just assumed
          that he was lofty. So she couldn&#8217;t help persuading, &#8220;You
          should know that Young Master Gu is basically the most influential
          cultivator in the Upper Realm right now, and he has abilities beyond
          most&#8217;s imagination. Even True Daoists revered him. I know as the
          Successor of a Divine Source Master, you have your pride, but
          it&#8217;s also your honour to be able to help him.&#8221;</span

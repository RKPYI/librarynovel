          Bai Lian&#8217;er, who was by the street, quickly calmed her surprised

          to live by collecting herbs in the mountains. They were now trying to

          tall frame fluttered with grandeur. The robes were woven with silk
          spun by Frost Weavers, using Immortal Silkworms that had been alive
          for eight million years. There were many ancient patterns embroidered
          on his robes. All kinds of faint divine brilliance and splendor flowed
          between each thread as Principles wove between them, unveiling
          magnificence and mysteriousness.

          King&#8217;s Manor when I have time.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and
          continued to stroll along the street. However, he seemed a little
          surprised when he came to Bai Lian&#8217;er and Bai Hua&#8217;s

          composure before she showed a nervous expression on her face as she
          spoke gingerly. &#8220;K-Kind sir, these herbs don&#8217;t cost a

          made it difficult for anyone to stop by her stall. However, Gu Changge
          didn&#8217;t seem to care at all as he took a few looks at the herbs
          before bringing his gaze up to take a proper look at her again. Seeing
          this, Bai Lian&#8217;er, who looked petrified and jumpy, quickly
          lowered her head to avoid his gaze.</span

          cultivation levels were not high. At most, they were a little better
          than ordinary people. Even Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s behaviour seemed
          normal to them. In fact, anyone would have such a reaction if Gu

          smile. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not someone who would take your things for
          free. I&#8217;ll pay you ten times the usual price. Please sell them

          realised what Gu Changge was saying, she couldn&#8217;t believe that
          such a wonderful thing could ever happen. A surprised look soon
          replaced her initial fear, and she blurted out her gratitude

          was right under her nose. [Is there something special about the
          medicinal herbs that I randomly found? Why didn&#8217;t I notice

          the herbs were special enough for Gu Changge to pay a hundred times

          also bowed to Gu Changge one after another. Jun Fan, who was among the
          crowd, didn&#8217;t let any emotion show as he kept his head
          down.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Quelling Chaos King then led the way and brought Gu Changge into
          his manor. Seeing Bai Lian&#8217;er and Bai Hua following behind Gu
          Changge shocked many members of the Jun Family.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Jun Family were filled with disdain as they wondered how someone
          dressed in rags and only had cultivation levels slightly higher than
          the average person had the right to walk alongside Gu Changge. The
          woman was especially odd and ugly to look at. However, they knew
          better than to ask anything about the siblings.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Among the Jun Family crowd, a woman in a green robe looked at the
          young man walking with the Quelling Chaos King, and she began to sigh
          in a voice full of admiration and longing. &#8220;Fan, this is the
          first time I have seen Young Master Changge up close. Am I dreaming?
          He smiled at me just now. How can such a perfect man exist? Ha…
          It&#8217;s a pity that someone of my identity has no reason to get
          closer to him. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the dream of many prodigal
          damsels to be his concubine.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The woman who spoke was an absolute beauty who only had a thin layer
          of makeup to enhance her exquisite features. Her skin looked so soft
          and smooth it might break from just a light touch, and she had locks
          as smooth as silk. Not even the loose robe she had on could hide the
          sensual curves of her body.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Yao was beside him when his face immediately turned sour upon
          hearing his sister&#8217;s words. Even though he had been reborn with
          memories of his past life, his elder sister in this lifetime treated
          him well. He, too, genuinely thought of her as his sister. However, he
          couldn&#8217;t help feeling upset when Jun Yao said that about the man
          he loathed for sabotaging his plans again and again. If it
          wasn&#8217;t for Gu Changge&#8217;s obstruction, Jun Fan
          wouldn&#8217;t have failed the assassination and had to force Qing Zhu
          to die.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just as Jun Yao was talking, she couldn&#8217;t help asking out of
          confusion when she noticed the strange look on Jun Fan&#8217;s face.
          &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Fan? You don&#8217;t look too
          good.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. I just feel weird hearing you say that.
          With your beauty and status, there have been so many young prodigies
          in the enormous capital who have come for you, but none of them stood
          a chance to take you as their wife. I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d
          say something like this.&#8221; Jun Fan had quickly collected himself,
          and he shook his head, seemingly in resignation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Jun Yao turned red in the face as she rolled her eyes
          at him. &#8220;What do you mean by that? Can&#8217;t I have someone I
          admire? Someone of Young Master Changge&#8217;s identity and status
          must have tons of admirers. Who am I but another one among the
          crowd?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Fan sighed again, &#8220;Indeed. It&#8217;s a shame. With your
          identity, you probably don&#8217;t even stand a chance to get along
          with him. I advise you to let go of your fantasies and give up
          completely. I bet a man like Gu Changge has more women by his side
          than he needs. You probably won&#8217;t catch his fancy
          anyway.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He knew that slandering Gu Changge behind his back would only bring
          about the opposite effect of making Jun Yao think Jun Fan was a
          narrow-minded man. Moreover, Jun Yao had always had a difficult
          personality, which made it difficult to change the things she believed
          in.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >And so, he decided to change his approach in letting her understand
          those were just pipedreams. Useless and she was better off giving up
          on having ideas about Gu Changge.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;How dare you look down on me? Are you looking for a
          beating?&#8221; Jun Yao glared at him when she heard that. &#8220;But
          you sound like you know Young Master Changge well.&#8221;
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even though she knew Jun Fan was speaking the truth, it irked her to
          hear it directly. She was confident there was no other woman more
          beautiful than her in the Demon World. Not even Song Youwei stood a
          chance against her in terms of appearances.</span

          him. I just don&#8217;t want you to waste your time. Give up on him,
          sister.&#8221; He shook his head. &#8220;You should give it a go if
          you don&#8217;t believe me. You&#8217;ll see for yourself if you stand
          a chance.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing this, Jun Yao only became more unwilling to accept the fact.
          However, she soon became discouraged again when she thought about Gu
          Changge&#8217;s status and ability.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As Jun Fan and Jun Yao were talking, Bai Lian&#8217;er, who was
          quietly following behind Gu Changge, peeked at Jun Fan with a rather
          complicated expression. She didn&#8217;t expect to be able to look at
          Junfan so closely again after 6000 years. If she hadn&#8217;t come
          along with Gu Changge, she probably wouldn&#8217;t have been able to
          take half a step into the Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s Manor. At the
          thought of this, she began to think of a way to pass the brocade bag
          to Jun Fan.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, doing such a thing in the Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s Manor,
          especially under Gu Changge&#8217;s nose, could easily expose her true
          identity. It would instead put her at risk, and her losses might even
          be more than her gains.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The group soon arrived in the hall of the main room. After the
          Quelling Chaos King invited Gu Changge to take a seat, he ordered his
          servant to bring tea before he asked curiously, &#8220;May I know to
          what do we owe the pleasure of your visit, Young Master
          Changge?&#8221;</span

          no reason. [He must have come for something.]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing this, Gu Changge lifted the cover of his teacup and lightly
          blew. The corners of his mouth then raised into a small smile.
          &#8220;I&#8217;m actually here because of Yao Xi,&#8221; he
          mentioned.</span

          >&#8220;Her Majesty? Is there news about the assassins that
          attacked?&#8221; Quelling Chaos King&#8217; expression changed ever so
          slightly as he asked. He didn&#8217;t seem to mind the way Gu Changge
          addressed the Empress. However, everyone else in the room turned
          solemn in an instant. Even Jun Fan was paying attention now. As
          uncomfortable as it was for him to hear Gu Changge calling Empress Yao
          Xi so intimately, now wasn&#8217;t the right time for him to worry
          about such trivial things.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Relaxed, Gu Changge took a sip of tea before he smilingly replied,
          &#8220;It has something to do with that. Yao Xi’s body has been
          aching. So, I wanted to share her burden for her, and I happened to
          recall something that might have something to do with the
          assassination a while ago.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >[Yao Xi’s body is aching?] Jun Fan froze when he heard those words.
          He swiftly lowered his head so that no one would notice the glum look
          on his face.</span

          >Jun Fan&#8217;s expression quickly changed again as he took a deep
          breath to calm himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m fine, Sister. Remembering

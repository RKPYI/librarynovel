        Chapter 260-1: Bait to draw out the organization in the shadows, This is
        my advice but it‚Äôs also a warning (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "It's come to this, and even these people have appeared, brother, why
        don‚Äôt you admit it? How would you explain this? You lied to us for so
        long!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu‚Äôs voice was trembling after seeing the current scene. Her
        expression was even colder, and she almost believed that Ying Shuang was
        the inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, she had never seen these three terrifying Great Sacred Realm
        existences before, but they were so respectful to Ying Shuang. The
        corner of Ying Shuang's mouth was bitter, but, what could he explain?
        Would it even be useful to explain?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Little girl, shut up! How can our young lord be someone you can ask for
        an explanation? You are just courting death!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, one of the Great Sacred Realm existence's eyes turned cold and
        divine light burst forth. Hearing Ying Yu's words, he seemed very angry
        and murderous. He directly slapped her with a palm, this was a demonic
        technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world was gathered in his palm and the laws were infused making it
        extremely terrifying. Just like a world-destroying millstone, and it was
        necessary to kill Ying Yu and wipe her out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aftermath alone caused many people to explode who were still very
        far away, and it was completely unbearable. This was an attack from the
        Great Sacred Realm, but the Quasi-Sacred Realm Ying Yu was not an
        opponent at all, and any resistance seemed powerless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, her Ancient Golden Bell was fighting against Ying Shuang, and
        it was difficult for her to escape for a while to protect her.
      </p>
      <p>"Miss‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"No, protect Miss!"</p>
      <p>
        The expressions of everyone from the Emperor Mountain changed, and they
        hurriedly shot forward, trying to resist the blow. But just touching the
        aftermath, they exploded directly and turned into blood fog. Visitt

      </p>
      <p>
        The majesty of the Great Sacred Realm was boundless, and in front of it,
        they were no different from ants. The other two Great Sacred Realm
        existences also made their move, attacking the rest of the young beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was extremely ruthless. It was like piercing the sky and destroying
        everyone here. This scene made everyone despair, and they only hated why
        they didn't avoid this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, this place became more tragic than before, blood and corpses
        were everywhere, and many people died there.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The sky has been pierced, and so many young existences have died, even
        if Emperor Ying descends, it would be impossible to protect the prince‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian sacrificed a divine weapon to protect the people behind him,
        and his expression turned extremely pale.
      </p>
      <p>"Ying Shuang, you are so mad that you even want to kill me, right?"</p>
      <p>
        Facing the palm of an existence at the Great Sacred Realm, Ying Yu's
        complexion also became pale and desperate, her soul swayed, and she knew
        that it was difficult to resist. She looked at Ying Shuang, her eyes
        were cold and unfamiliar.
      </p>
      <p>It was more of the pain from breaking up.</p>
      <p>"Stop‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang opened his mouth to stop the attack from the Great Sacred
        Realm existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when this Great Sacred Realm existence heard these words, there was
        only a hint of teasing in his eyes, and he didn't stop at all. He didn't
        listen to Ying Shuang's words, and he wanted to kill Ying Yu.
      </p>
      <p>"Miss!"</p>
      <p>
        Everyone from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain roared, their eyes were red,
        and they were so desperate that they didn't expect that their Miss would
        die today at the hands of her own brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        After becoming the inheritor of demonic art, Ying Shuang had disregarded
        family affection, and had become a devil who would ignore everything!
        Ying Yu couldn't help closing her eyes in despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her greatest life-saving means was the Ancient Golden Bell in her soul.
        Other than that, there was no way for her to counter this blow.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, the pain she thought did not arrive, but a warm
        and peaceful voice sounded into her ears.
      </p>
      <p>
        A terrifying wave broke out in front of her, and the palm of the Great
        Sacred Realm existence was blocked by someone with a Great Sacred
        weapon.

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"Fortunately, I wasn't too late."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Ying Yu suddenly opened his eyes. She widened her eyes in
        disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, a young figure appeared in front of her, he was not very tall,
        but his figure looked unusually huge in her eyes. The eyes were warm and
        peaceful, the white robe had wide sleeves, and the hair was fluttering.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a detached bearing, even in front of such a situation, he was calm.
      </p>
      <p>As if the world could be saved.</p>
      <p>
        The person here was Gu Changge, who had been watching the play for a
        long time and then showed up.
      </p>
      <p>"Master Gu‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu almost murmured these words. She didn't know when, in her silver
        eyes like gems, his back was etched, and it couldn't be removed for a
        long time.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge!"</p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge, that's great! We are saved!"</p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge has come to save us!"</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, the sky fell silent for a moment, followed by a
        terrifying sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone stared at the figure in the sky, and they couldn't help but be
        ecstatic, extremely excited, and felt like the rest of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother Gu is finally here, if you were another half step late, I'm
        afraid all of us would have died here today‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "But there are three Great Sacred Realm existences here today, even with
        Brother Gu, I'm afraid it will be very difficult."
      </p>
      <p>"I don't know how he'll deal with it?"</p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian and the others breathed a sigh of relief, and couldn't help
        but smile, they were a hundred times more relaxed than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn't know when it started, but in their eyes, Gu Changge had
        become a representative of stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        With him, all crises could be suppressed. The inheritor of demonic art
        was no exception!
      </p>
      <p>"Junior, who are you? How dare you seek death?"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing that his palm was blocked, the Great Sacred Realm existence, who
        was hidden in the black robe, seemed extremely angry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In its eyes, the golden light seemed to break everything. He stared at
        Gu Changge, paying attention to the ancient mirror in his hand, with a
        murderous aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was through the ancient mirror in his hand that Gu Changge resisted
        him just now. Everyone looked at all this, and hope rose in their
        hearts.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge had many methods.</p>
      <p>
        Since he dared to come here, he must have a way, otherwise, it would be
        impossible to stand in front of Ying Yu and save her life.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge!"</p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang was also staring at Gu Changge at the moment, extremely
        angry, and his eyes were full of killing intent and hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for the difficulty in controlling the Ancient Golden Bell,
        he would have wanted to kill Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others did not know. But he knew that all of this was probably directed
        and acted by Gu Changge, including the attack just now and saving Ying
        Yu, which he had already planned.
      </p>
      <p>However, Gu Changge didn't care about his expression.</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        He didn't care about the three Great Sacred Realm existences in front of
        him and said to himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother Ying, why are you obsessed with it? If you just abolish the
        forbidden demonic art, we might be able to sit down and have a drink and
        have a good talk. Does it do you any good for you to be like this now?
        Shouting and fighting, and making everyone in the world an enemy."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Forbidden demonic art is something that should have disappeared in the
        long river of time, why do you have such greed?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge sighed slightly, in a very regretful tone.</p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, you despicable villain, all of this is your fault. If it
        wasn't for you, why would I be what I am now? Stop pretending to be a
        good person there now!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's words, Ying Shuang's lungs were about to explode
        with anger, and he didn't look as calm as before.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he could only wish to kill Gu Changge, and he was
        clearly framed. But now he still looked righteous and awe-inspiring. Why
        were there such shameless people in this world?
      </p>
      <p>
        "I know you hate me, but if you don't, there will be more cultivators
        who will suffer at your hands. Unmasking your identity will indeed make
        you hate me to the core, but there is no other way. Although I pride
        myself on not being a good person, I can't do something like this."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge just shook his head and looked very helpless.
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, his expression became straight and a little cold, "But you
        shouldn't do anything to kill your peers, even your own sister. Why is
        there still a heartless person like you in this world?"
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"In this case, only you can say it!"</p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang was so angry that he almost vomited blood, and his head was
        about to explode. There had never been a moment like today in his life
        when he became so angry with just a few words.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, he was very tolerant and would not care about what other
        people said. But how could Gu Changge be able to endure such a false
        accusation in front of everyone?
      </p>
      <p>"Don't worry, Mr. Inheritor, we will kill him now!"</p>
      <p>"Including him, no one can leave alive today!"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, the three Great Sacred Realm existences opened their
        mouths in unison, their eyes were very indifferent, they stared at Gu
        Changge, and began to shoot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying might of the Great Sacred Realm was intertwined between
        heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people were even sitting cross-legged in the sky, their figures
        were blurred, but there were strands of chaotic fog hanging down,
        strictly preventing anyone from taking the opportunity to escape!
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master Gu, be careful!"</p>
      <p>Ying Yu couldn't help but remind him aloud, very worried.</p>
      <p>"No problem!"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled faintly, and his hands faintly drew a bright fairy
        light in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of fairy light was extremely amazing, and there was a
        terrifying atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        One by one, the order of the laws and the chains of the Great Dao seemed
        to be intertwined in different worlds, evolving into a furnace that
        could smelt the heavens and the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        Many geniuses and creatures in the vicinity were all trembling, giving
        birth to a feeling of trembling. Primordial spirits were frozen as if
        everything was about to usher in the end of destruction, being smelted
        and returning to chaos!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Seeing Gu Changge's move, a very vague but very solid furnace began to
        appear, the red glow bloomed, and hundreds of millions of strands
        appeared, with the aura of the Dao emerging on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is the most powerful magic of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family
        Family, the Ten Thousand Way Furnace, smelting everything within the ten
        thousand ways, to the end‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Someone recognized it, and his voice trembled.</p>
      <p>
        "However, with the strength of Young Master Changge, even if he uses
        such a powerful technique, he cannot stop the three Great Sacred Realm
        cultivators!"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, the three Great Sacred Realm cultivators shot together and
        fell in front of Gu Changge, trying to crush and obliterate him.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 260-2: Bait to draw out the organization in the shadows, This is
        my advice but it‚Äôs also a warning (2)
      </h4>
      <p><strong>Buzz!</strong></p>
      <p>The sky was shaking, the momentum was too terrifying and vast!</p>
      <p>
        There seemed to be an endless burst of immortal light for a while, and
        it was terrifying to the extreme. The laws of the Great Sacred Realm
        seemed to overturn everything.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>The void was penetrated.</p>
      <p>
        Then, under the unbelievable gaze of the three Great Sacred Realm
        existences. An incomparable divine imprint floated up and down, the
        mountains, rivers, sun and moon, and the universe, all appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of brilliance was so amazing, there were even laws of Dao
        between heaven and earth, spreading through the void!
      </p>
      <p>"Hiss!"</p>
      <p>"This is‚Ä¶ the Supreme weapon!"</p>
      <p>"Young master Changge actually has a Supreme weapon! This‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        "Could it be the divine weapon bestowed by the Ancient Immortal Gu
        Family? It seems that he activated it himself, which is unbelievable."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, everyone lost their voices in shock and noticed that
        kind of fluctuation, although it was difficult to recognize what kind of
        Supreme weapon it was.
      </p>
      <p>But that kind of fluctuation was enough to shock the world.</p>
      <p>
        In today's younger generation, in addition to the Emperor's children
        such as Prince Ying, another young existence had a Supreme weapon in his
        hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        What a terrifying background this was! How many methods did Gu Changge
        have that he had yet to reveal to the world? It could only be said that
        he was worthy of being the strongest person of the younger generation!
      </p>
      <p>"Not good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this scene, the three Great Sacred Realm existences changed their
        expressions and could not help but quickly retreat.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the Ancient Golden Bell of that Prince Ying was already
        occupied, and it was difficult to separate out the extra effort to come
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone felt the same way. At this time, as long as they weren't
        stupid, they wouldn't dare to face the Supreme weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it was the Great Sacred Realm or the Quasi-Supreme Realm
        cultivator, in front of the real Supreme Artifact, they were like paper
        and appeared very weak.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Puff!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge couldn't help but turn pale and spurted out a
        mouthful of blood. It seemed that it was difficult for him to continue
        to support the Supreme Artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five-colored divine light began to rise from his body, and the aura of
        chaos permeated out, and the bones and bloodline contained amazing
        divinity as he was struggling to support himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene made everyone's heart tremble, and then they couldn't help
        but admire and awe. The activation of the Supreme weapon, and even a
        single blow, required massive support of spiritual energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        With their ability, it was estimated that they would be drained alive if
        they tried to support the awakening of the Supreme Artifact. But at this
        time, Gu Changge was still supporting it, and this strength and
        perseverance made them admire him!

      </p>
      <p>
        Some young geniuses were full of reverence and there was even a little
        fanaticism in their eyes. Hearing it was one thing, seeing it with their
        own eyes was another, making their blood surge.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, the three Great Sacred Realm existences also seemed to
        sense something was wrong. They looked at each other a few times, and
        their expressions suddenly changed.
      </p>
      <p>"No, at this time, we have to leave first!"</p>
      <p>
        "There is something weird about this guy, and if he stays, it will
        probably attract other Ancient existences!"
      </p>
      <p>"We can't delay‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing their words, many of the people from the younger generation
        breathed a sigh of relief, fearing that the three Great Sacred Realm
        existences would go crazy and bury them all here. FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on
        n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>"Young Lord, we need to leave quickly!"</p>
      <p>"You can't stay here for long!"</p>
      <p>
        Afterward, the three Great Sacred Realm existences attacked directly and
        forced Ying Shuang to leave the place. Although Ying Shuang's expression
        was still angry and cold, it was difficult to break free.
      </p>
      <p>Then they quickly disappeared.</p>
      <p>
        Even the power that covered all directions with the Ancient Golden Bell
        quickly dissipated, leaving the place in ashes and ruins. Everyone
        breathed a sigh of relief at this time, and they felt like they had
        survived the catastrophe, instead of the sense of life-and-death crisis
        just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were even more grateful to Gu Changge. Without him, everyone would
        have died here today. Gu Changge watched the scene of Ying Shuang being
        taken away and did not stop or pursue him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he just took back the divine seal floating in the chaotic mist.
        This was naturally the Immortal Lun seal, but Gu Changge used a means to
        hide its true aura so that no one would recognize it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, he glanced at Ying Yu, shook his head, and sighed, "It's a pity‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Young Master Gu, you have done your best. I didn't expect Ying Shuang
        to have such an organization behind him. What happened today is really
        shocking."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu spoke hurriedly, asking Gu Changge not to blame herself, and was
        very moved. No matter it was Gu Changge who suddenly came to rescue her.
        Or to stand up now and fight against the three Great Sacred Realm
        cultivators, it was all worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain also came forward at this
        time and was grateful to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"What an eventful time!"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded when he heard the words, and his expression showed a
        little sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he said that, he couldn't help spurting out blood again, staining the
        front of his clothes, as if forcibly activating the Supreme Artifact and
        hurting his origin.
      </p>
      <p>"Young master Gu‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        "Young Master Changge, how is your injury, I have a lot of healing
        medicine here‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"I have it too!"</p>
      <p>"I have that too!"</p>
      <p>
        This scene made everyone's heart tighten, and they were extremely
        concerned, and they all opened their mouths.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's okay, thank you for everyone‚Äôs concern, it's not a big problem."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled slightly, with a very natural expression, and waved to
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Ye Langtian, Wang Wushuang, Chi Ling, and others also arrived
        to reminisce with him, with lingering fears in their hearts.
      </p>

          });

      <p>
        Soon after, what happened in this place quickly spread, and it couldn't
        help causing a sensation in the entire Heavenly Extinction Battlefield,
        and even outside the Southern Heaven, and the Upper Realm for many days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The various Dao forces behind the cultivators were furious! Especially
        the fact that many of their young powerhouses lost their lives here
        caused a major earthquake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, the angriest was the Qilin Family of the Demon Realm, and
        the Endless Fire kingdom!
      </p>
      <p>
        The inheritor of demonic art had appeared, urging the Supreme weapon,
        slaughtering the geniuses of all races on the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield, causing terrifying waves, and making countless cultivators
        angry, disturbed, and fearful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this matter, the forbidden demonic power behind Prince Ying also
        surfaced, causing countless people to be equally shocked and terrified.
        After all, those were the three Great Sacred Realm existences!
      </p>
      <p>
        If Young Master Changge hadn't arrived in time, everyone probably would
        have fallen in their hands, and there would be no survivors. This made
        countless cultivators uneasy and frightened and they thought that Prince
        Ying was really cruel!
      </p>
      <p>
        In this matter, Gu Changge's reputation once again reached a peak. After
        all, he finally took the shot and saved many young beings at that time.
        This made countless people grateful!
      </p>
      <p>
        After this incident, Emperor Mountain issued a legal decree immediately
        and announced that Prince Ying had nothing to do with them, and
        everything he did was caused by Prince Ying alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, even though such a decree was issued, it still could not
        quell the public anger. Many Dao forces arrived at the Heavenly Emperor
        Mountain to seek justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, undercurrents were surging in all parts of the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>A few days passed in a blink of an eye.</p>
      <p>
        On the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, on an uninhabited barren
        mountain. Gu Changge stood with his hands behind his back, with his
        robes flying.
      </p>
      <p>
        His figure, standing here, looked down at the bottom with a calm and
        indifferent expression.
      </p>
      <p>"Master, things have been completed as you ordered."</p>
      <p>
        "After Prince Ying was taken away by us, we just found a deserted place,
        dropped him, and let him fend for himself. We also said that someone
        would come to him later, so he should not worry."
      </p>
      <p>
        The figures of the three Great Sacred Realm existences were standing
        respectfully behind him and reporting what happened next.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although they were puppets, they also had a certain intelligence. After
        they were refined, they were destined to never betray Gu Changge. So Gu
        Changge was not worried at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "After the break up with Emperor Mountain, Ying Shuang's Luck points
        have almost ended, and now he is an unlucky person, but I hope my guess
        is correct. If there is no demonic organization, he won‚Äôt be able to
        recite anything. Otherwise, we can only kill him and see if something
        falls out."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded with a thoughtful expression on his face.</p>
      <p>
        In the eyes of many people, Ying Shuang had actually been taken away by
        the demonic organization. Therefore, Gu Changge could completely wipe it
        from the root, and Ying Shuang could also continue to take the blame
        even after he died.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge didn't do that. If he wanted to attract the demonic
        organization, he also needed a bait like Ying Shuang.
      </p>
      <p>"Next, we can consider who the inheritor of the demonic art is."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's eyes couldn't help but squint. Logically, the news that he
        asked Yan Ji to check should also have some results.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time. In Southern Heaven, in a splendid pavilion.</p>
      <p>
        "I don't know Princess Mingkong, what do you mean by looking for me?"
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving the Heavenly Extinction battlefield, Ying Yu was here at
        this moment with a haggard face.
      </p>
      <p>
        With silver eyes, she looked directly at the beautiful woman in front of
        her, and she couldn't help frowning. She couldn't stand the scrutiny and
        the feeling of being on top of the other party.
      </p>
      <p>
        It felt like it wasn't a woman in front of her. But a goddess who was
        proud of the world for nine days and had a peerless elegance!
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was the daughter of the Heavenly Emperor, and her status
        was equally respected, she couldn't help but feel that she was weak in
        front of the opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu didn't know why Yue Mingkong was looking for her. During this
        time, she was very busy because of Ying Shuang.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Of course, I have something to do with you. I advise you not to have
        any extra feelings for Gu Changge. This is my advice, but it's also a
        warning."
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Yue Mingkong finally spoke in her calm voice.</p>
      <p>
        After sizing up Gu Changge's "hero saves the beauty", she withdrew her
        gaze as her eyes retained their calm and depth.

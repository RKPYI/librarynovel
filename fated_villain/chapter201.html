      <h4>
        Chapter 201: Digging Deeper into the “Truth”; A Coincidental
        Reincarnation?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin, who was dressed in men’s clothing, looked like an ordinary
        young master with his slender white skin and blue silk clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her complexion was fair and delicate, with a glistening lustre. Her
        slightly curved eyes and faint smile gave her an aura of transcendence
        as if she was an Immortal from another world.
      </p>
      <p>
        She stepped forward and took the initiative to greet Gu Changge in front
        of the Main Hall.
      </p>
      <p>Many Young Supremes that had noticed her showed signs of shock.</p>
      <p>
        Because even Wang Wushuang, the heir of the Immortal Wang Family, seemed
        to be walking half a step behind her.
      </p>
      <p>What did this mean?</p>
      <p>
        Obviously, it meant that the status of Wang Zijin was obviously higher
        than that of Wang Wushuang, who was supposed to be the heir!
      </p>
      <p>And yet no cultivator had ever seen her before now.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“His origin is definitely not simple if he is acquainted with Young
          Master Changge!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The stunned Young Supremes quickly speculated and hypothesised about the
        situation, keeping their eyes on Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the accompanying guests was not only an old monster of the Wang
        Family but also other Young Supremes from various Dao forces and Dao
        Lineages, their energies abundant and fierce.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was without a doubt that Wang Wushuang was the most dazzling of
        them all, with the sole exception of the mysterious Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, even Wang Wushuang had to take a step back and become humble in
        front of this unfamiliar young man, which made people think that Wang
        Zijin was most likely an Ancient Freak of the Wang Family.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Miss Zijin.”</b></p>
      <p><b>“Please!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge wasn’t surprised at all upon seeing Wang Zijin, and merely
        smiled faintly back, before gesturing for all the guests to enter the
        hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the host of his mother’s birthday banquet, there was nothing wrong
        with him personally welcoming the guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Gu Changge also intended to take a peek to see which Young
        Supremes would show up this time, in order to find a suitable scapegoat
        amongst them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Half a month ago, he took Gu Xian’er on a spending spree in Heavenly Dao
        Ancient City and had spent quite a sum, making her understand what it
        means to truly be rich.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a huge shock to Gu Xian’er, who was used to being poor since
        her childhood and always acted like a cheapskate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her opinion, it could be said that Gu Changge possessed near-endless
        wealth and that the little bit of coin he had revealed at then was just
        the tip of the iceberg; a drop in the boundless ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s not mention drying up Gu Changge’s wealth, what she had spent was
        probably not even considered ‘spending’ for Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This discouraged her. The life of a rich person was not easy to imagine!
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s hatred towards Gu Changge quickly rose by several levels in
        the blink of an eye, as she cursed him inwardly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It had nothing to do with anything else. But Gu Changge’s sheer wealth
        was already enough to make her feel suffocated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under his detestable monetary onslaught, she scolded Gu Changge for
        being despicable and shameless in her heart, while at the same time
        thinking of different methods on how to take advantage of his wealth and
        eventually take it all for herself.
      </p>
      <p>Needless to say, Gu Changge saw through her intention in no time.</p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, the spanking she expected him to give her never came to
        pass, and Gu Changge had instead said something along the lines of,
        “It’ll be yours sooner or later”, which made Gu Xian’er all the more
        confused by his actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Kshn: If she’s saying “spank me, daddy” by herself and you don’t do it,
        there’s something wrong with you.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge spoke as if she was going to inherit everything from him.
      </p>
      <p>As Gu Changge talked with Wang Zijin and others—</p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        In the other direction, a group of cultivators arrived right at this
        moment, riding divine rainbows as they landed in the Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the leader of this group was none other than Ye Langtian. The heir
        of the Ancient Immortal Ye Family. Behind him was his sister, Ye Liuli,
        who looked like a young sun goddess, so dazzling and radiant.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Greetings, Brother Gu!”</b></p>
      <p>Ye Langtian greeted Gu Changge before entering the Main Hall.</p>
      <p>
        Then, he glanced at the many Young Supremes of the Gu family behind Gu
        Changge, his eyes narrowing slightly out of surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from aura alone, he could sense that the Young Supremes of
        Immortal Gu’s Family were actually slightly stronger than those Young
        Supremes from their own family.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a startling fact, and one could see from just this that the
        heritage of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family was truly terrifying and
        deep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Immortal Ye Family was also one of the most powerful Daoist
        forces in the Upper Realm, there was still a big gap between them and a
        force such as the Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Gu Family was a force that stood irrefutably at the highest
        peak of the world, overlooking the masses and raising turbulent waves
        with a single hand, a monolith since the Immortal Period!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Brother Ye.”</b> Gu Changge wore a plain and clear white robe,
        greeting the Young Supremes present with a calm and gentle smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The picturesque scene made even the Young Supremes who had never met Gu
        Changge before unable to help but feel favourable towards him. According
        to the rumours, Gu Changge was an arrogant and imposing individual,
        innately different from the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was why his humble attitude had such an impact on them, to the
        point where the Young Supremes felt a little flattered by it.
      </p>
      <p><b>“This is…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian soon noticed a new face next to Gu Changge. Wang Zijin.
        Based on her position within the group, it looked as if she was the
        leader of the Young Supremes of the Immortal Wang Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang explained, <b>“This is my older sister, Wang Zijin.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>He didn’t mention much, but it was enough.</p>
      <p>
        Young Supremes gazed at each other, as a myriad of thoughts flashed in
        their hearts, speculating her identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone roamed around and chatted at the entrance of the Main Hail for
        a while, with Gu Changge smiling and nodding slightly from time to time
        to keep up his image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin, who was beside him, also had a face full of smiles, as she
        talked to Gu Changge in a friendly manner.
      </p>
      <p>To outsiders, this was nothing surprising.</p>
      <p>
        However, this scene just outside the Main Hall was quickly spotted by an
        observant Yue Mingkong, who was currently accompanying a beautiful woman
        with a majestic temperament.
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn’t help frowning. Who couldn’t see that Wang Zijin was a
        female disguised as a male? This was nothing but self-deception.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Yue Mingkong didn’t understand was... when did Gu Changge become
        acquainted with this strange woman?
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, Gu Changge had gone completely off track from how he was in
        her previous life, which was now giving her a headache.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed like a vixen who didn’t know her place had arrived yet again
        when she wasn’t looking. Yin Mei, who she warned earlier, had not even
        learned her lesson yet, and somehow there was already another strange
        young woman appearing next to him?
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong’s expression was indifferent and cold, as she looked at
        Wang Zijin carefully, burning her appearance into her mind.
      </p>
      <p>For this, Wang Zijin posed a threat different from Yin Mei.</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong had perceived it the moment she saw her.</p>
      <p>It was a woman’s intuition.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        And although she was quite sure that Gu Changge couldn’t be easily
        attracted to any woman, having vipers around her husband was not
        something Yue Mingkong would tolerate.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, she could sense that Wang Zijin was not simple.</p>
      <p>
        Whether it was in cultivation or talent, there was an unfathomable aura
        around her, like an impenetrable fortress.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Emperor’s Qi empowerment, Yue Mingkong’s Cultivation Base
        reached the God King Realm, meaning she had broken through more than one
        major realm.
      </p>
      <p>Yet even now she was unable to see through Wang Zijin.</p>
      <p>‘Her origin is not simple; she is likely to be an Ancient Freak.’</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong speculated as such.</p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, accompanying the beautiful woman beside him, she greeted the
        group of guests from the various Dao Sects and Immortal Clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t a stretch to say that any one of the people present today
        would be able to create terrifying earthquakes in the outside world just
        by casually stamping their feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        All-powerful figures from thousands and thousands of years ago that were
        once also invincible Young Supremes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power they wielded now was so monstrous that it could only be
        described as earth-shattering.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Mingkong, what are you looking at?”</b></p>
      <p>
        The beautiful woman beside Yue Mingkong was none other than Gu Changge’s
        mother, the last Saintess of the Primordial Divine Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also noticed Yue Mingkong’s gaze at this moment and couldn't help
        but look over curiously, asking out loud.
      </p>
      <p>She was very satisfied with her daughter-in-law, Yue Mingkong.</p>
      <p>
        Whether it was talent, personality, background, or appearance, she was
        unparalleled and could be said to be Gu Changge's best match, a match
        made in heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Yue Mingkong of the present was the acting Emperor of the Supreme
        Immortal Dynasty, possessing immense power and influence, with each word
        and action of hers capable of overturning mountains and rivers.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she still left her many important responsibilities and came to
        accompany her mother-in-law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's mother adored her perfect future daughter-in-law from the
        bottom of her heart and was extremely pleased with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially because of the many rumours about her in the outside world,
        saying that Yue Mingkong’s ironclad tactics were amazing and worthy of
        one who would become the future Emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Auntie, Mingkong is just watching what Changge is doing.”</b> Yue
        Mingkong’s elegant and magnanimous tone rang out after hearing Gu
        Changge’s mother’s words, a slight smile on her face.
      </p>
      <p>She had cleverly changed the topic over to Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin kept sticking beside Gu Changge all the time, with a smile on
        her face, looking very happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This caused Yue Mingkong to feel very uncomfortable, even though she
        knew that with Gu Changge’s temperament, he was more likely planning the
        best way to use her, instead of thinking anything indecent.
      </p>
      <p>But the squirming feeling in her heart still persisted.</p>
      <p>
        Ever since their departure from the Ancient Immortal Continent, she and
        Gu Changge haven't contacted each other at all, and Gu Changge’s
        attitude towards her had also become extremely cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was to the point where Yue Mingkong actually found herself missing
        the past when she pretended to be a fool and was occasionally teased by
        Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of the indifference he showed her now as if he had regressed to
        the attitude he had towards her in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong and Gu Changge’s relationship reached a freezing point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge might disguise himself in front of outsiders, but there was
        no need to disguise himself in front of her since he knew it was
        useless.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's icy attitude towards her was undoubtedly real.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Oh, that woman has quite a pretty face. I’ve never seen someone like
          her in the Immortal Wang Family before... . Her strength is in the
          Quasi-Sacred realm. Was there a person like her in the Wang Family?
          How shocking.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s mother was also a little surprised at this moment.</p>
      <p>She noticed the peculiarity of the woman accompanying Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Quasi Sacred Realm?”</b> Yue Mingkong was slightly stunned, and she
        felt that her intuition was right on the mark.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s mother’s insight was definitely not wrong.</p>
      <p>To reach the Quasi-Sacred Realm at such an age was truly appalling.</p>
      <p>
        If she did not go through Emperor’s Qi empowerment, Yue Mingkong
        would’ve only been in the True God Realm now.
      </p>
      <p>
        It could clearly be seen how terrifying of a talent Wang Zijin
        possessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Given Changge’s current temperament, it is very likely that he is
          merely acquainted with the woman. Don’t think too much about it,
          Mingkong dear.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Noticing Yue Mingkong’s subtle emotional changes, Gu Changge’s mother
        couldn’t help but comfort her with a smile, afraid that Yue Mingkong
        would think too much and misunderstand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s mother was one of the few people who knew the secret of Gu
        Changge having a Devil Heart, a matter that involved Gu Changge’s future
        and present. And it was a matter so huge that, if it were to ever be
        exposed, would ruin everything he had worked hard to plan and manage up
        until now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Gu Changge’s mother needed to be careful not to accidentally
        say anything that might incriminate him.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also felt guilty for not being able to tell Yue Mingkong. But she
        could not reveal this secret to anyone, as the more people who know, the
        more dangerous it would become.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, Gu Changge’s performance in front of the world wasn’t very
        different from before, and it would be difficult to spot the subtleties
        if one was unfamiliar with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Don’t worry Auntie, I believe in Changge very much.”</b> Hearing
        this, Yue Mingkong couldn’t help but smile softly.
      </p>
      <p>‘Current’. The word stood out to her, easily captured in her ears.</p>
      <p>But why did Gu Changge’s mother use that word?</p>
      <p>Did she know about the changes in Gu Changge’s temperament?</p>
      <p>
        This made Yue Mingkong feel a little bit more spirited because this was
        also one of the reasons she decided to visit the Immortal Gu Family this
        time: to unearth Gu Changge’s hidden secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now she has already gotten some confirmation from Gu Changge’s
        mother, though it was still unclear exactly what the reason is.
      </p>
      <p><b>— — —</b></p>
      <p><b>“Brother Gu, I’m afraid you won’t be at peace after today.”</b></p>
      <p>
        At this time, Wang Zijin, who was talking to Gu Changge, also noticed
        the two gazes from across the hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, she had investigated Gu Changge and learned a lot about him
        and his life, so she naturally knew who his fiancée was.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong was no stranger to her.</p>
      <p>
        And Gu Changge, realising who she was talking about, replied with a warm
        smile on his face,
        <b
          >“Mingkong is quite sensible. She will not easily misunderstand
          anything.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        As Gu Changge spoke, he looked back into the hall and made direct eye
        contact with Yue Mingkong, nodding as he slightly smiled.
      </p>
      <p>Their gazes locked for a moment.</p>
      <p>
        A bit flustered, Yue Mingkong was a bit stunned, but reacted quickly to
        Gu Changge’s intention nonetheless, showing a gentle smile in response.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene fell in the eyes of many of the guests present, making them
        sigh as they felt envious of this match made in heaven, a loving pair of
        Immortals.

        ‘There’s no sign of the common jealousy trope from the usual plotlines.
        This Yue Mingkong doesn’t seem like an ordinary woman either.’
      </p>
      <p>Wang Zijin was a little taken aback.</p>
      <p>
        She was somewhat betting that there would be some clichéd face-slap
        plot, but it was obvious that she had thought too much into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with her aloof and free character, it was naturally better that
        she did not end up encountering such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving the Human Ancestral Hall, she gradually discovered that
        many things were not as she thought to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s actions were, no doubt, vastly different from the routines
        she commonly witnessed. Wang Zijin even felt that if she wasn’t careful,
        she might actually start falling into Gu Changge’s trap.
      </p>
      <p>This man had completely confused her.</p>
      <p>
        This feeling made Wang Zijin want to open his heart to see what he was
        thinking, poking out his secrets one by one.
      </p>
      <p>He was simply addicting.</p>
      <p><b>“Mingkong has indeed been wronged.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Seeing this scene, Gu Changge’s Mother in the hall couldn’t help but
        sigh slightly and express her pity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an experienced person, she could naturally see that there was a
        conflict between Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was no wonder that Gu Changge’s attitude towards Yue Mingkong was
        almost noticeably colder today.
      </p>
      <p>He did not even receive Yue Mingkong when she arrived.</p>
      <p>
        This attitude was very similar to how Gu Changge treated Yue Mingkong at
        the beginning; cold and uncaring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s mother knew nothing about what had happened between the
        two, but it was obvious that Yue Mingkong was just cooperating with Gu
        Changge out of consideration for his face.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Auntie, it’s not Changge’s fault, it’s all my fault...”</b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong shook his head lightly,
        <b
          >“I’ve always been too wary of him. and ended up misunderstanding his
          good intentions...”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge’s mother was taken aback for a while, before
        asking in disbelief, <b>“Mingkong, do you know—?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        But as soon as she said this, she realised that she had spoken without
        any consideration, and quickly shut her mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        She thought that Yue Mingkong was wary of Gu Changge’s Devil Heart,
        fearing that he would suddenly be unable to suppress it and become as
        indifferent as before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yue Mingkong was disappointed and couldn’t help shaking
        her head.
      </p>
      <p>What Gu Changge’s Mother said had already confirmed her guess.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge must have had an unknown past which would trigger a series of
        huge changes, similar to her previous life.
      </p>
      <p>However, for the time being, she wasn’t sure what it was.</p>
      <p>
        ‘What exactly happened half a year before I regressed? Did Changge
        really go to the Lower Realm just to find an opportunity?’
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong was puzzled in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        Then, she thought of something, and she took the lead and spoke to Gu
        Changge’s Mother.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Auntie, I have heard that Changge went to the Lower Realm and
          brought back two women, one named Lin Qiuhan, who is now studying
          alchemy in the Supreme Amethyst Pill Sect.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“And the other name is Su Qingge, who was sent to you by Changge to
          practise…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        These things have been investigated by her, and it was not very
        difficult to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, if she wanted to know what Gu Changge had done in the Lower
        Realm, she had to ask these two women.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Qingge is a clever girl, I like her very much, so I’ll keep her by
          my side and guide her in cultivation.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s Mother replied in surprise when she heard the words.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Auntie, do you know what’s special about her then?”</b> Yue Mingkong
        asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Qingge has two souls in her body. She must have been some Demon
          Giant. Although I once tried to trace her origin with a secret method,
          her soul is too fragmented so I couldn’t see anything.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s mother explained.</p>
      <p>These same words were also said to Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>Hearing this, Yue Mingkong frowned even more.</p>
      <p>
        At this birthday banquet, the woman named Su Qingge was obviously not
        brought by Gu Changge’s Mother, but still remained in the Primordial
        Divine Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Gu Changge brought them up and didn’t care about them anymore. It
        seemed that they had been used up and lost all their value, so they were
        thrown aside.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong guessed so, based on Gu Changge’s temperament, it was
        totally possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that case, Gu Changge brought them to the Upper Realm with no
        particular intention or just as eye candy.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It seems that the key lies in this period of time in the Lower Realm,
        the time that exactly coincides with my regression. This isn’t a
        coincidence.’ Yue Mingkong speculated.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘When Changge came back from the lower realm in my previous life, he
        didn’t bring anyone up.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It is very likely that in this life, he really got something in the
        Lower Realm, which he did not get in my previous life.’
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side, when Gu Changge talked with the younger generation,
        his attitude was natural and casual, without any arrogance.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this group of Young Supremes also spoke, praising and admiring what
        Gu Changge had done in the Ancient Immortal Continent as if they
        regarded him as the greatest of the younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        On that day, in front of Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace, the confession of
        the done digging by Gu Changge was already forgotten and no one dared to
        mention it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Brother Gu, during this time, the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic
          Arts has been wreaking havoc in secret. I wonder if you can do
          anything about it?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, it was Ye Langtian who spoke, his expression gradually
        becoming heavy, as he changed the subject to the Forbidden Demonic Arts
        Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        As soon as these words came out, there was pin-drop silence in the
        surrounding area!
      </p>
      <p>
        It was like a gloomy and cold breath blowing past everyone, and everyone
        couldn’t help shivering.
      </p>
      <p>
        After hearing this, Gu Changge’s expression was slightly contemplative,
        as if he was thinking seriously about what to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Brother Gu is, after all, the only one who has fought against the
          Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts and also severely injured him.
          The rest of us have never met the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic
          Arts, let alone fought against him.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Another Young Supreme opened his mouth to explain, covered in silver
        light, like silver water was pouring out from him, with three pairs of
        arms growing behind his back, with terrifying strength.
      </p>
      <p>He was from one of the Great Immortal Sects.</p>
      <p>
        Even Wang Zijin became interested when he heard the words. Speaking of
        which, the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts was the must-kill
        target of the Human Ancestral Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even she couldn’t see through Gu Changge’s strength. It was not
        impossible for him to seriously injure the Inheritor of Forbidden
        Demonic Arts. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        She also wanted to know Gu Changge's opinion on the Forbidden Demonic
        Arts’ Inheritor.

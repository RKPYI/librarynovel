          >Recently, Gu Changge had been pondering about the matter regarding
          Demon-Burying Abyss, hence he wished to head to Peach Village to
          inquire Tao Yao about it. At the same time, as a Master, he could also
          pay his disciple, Yao Yao, a visit.</span

          to go to Peach Village alone, the old men there would surely suspect
          that he went with an ulterior motive against Peach Village. Therefore,
          he decided to wait for a little longer in the family territory until
          Gu Xianer was finished with her own business. Simultaneously, he could
          also complete his other arrangements.</span

          was frustrated about something, but since she never brought it up, he
          never cared to ask about it. Judging by Gu Xianer&#8217;s personality,
          she would never trouble others to help her with a matter she could
          resolve herself, especially one in which her parents were

          leaving any order, she left alone. She also noted that she
          didn&#8217;t want anyone from the family to follow her,&#8221; the

          along—as a fitting excuse—to Peach Village. However, it seemed she
          would be taking her time. Given how it took her half a year to tend to
          such a frivolous matter, there was no telling how much longer she
          would need.</span

          Sea. It may be hit by the shockwaves from the battle with Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains. Anyway, back then, her grandfather went
          there to hunt for her, in an attempt to refine some precious blood for
          her, but he was unfortunately engulfed by the waves of Boundary Marker
          Sea. Gravely injured, he vanished without a trace.]</span

          family of Gu Xianer&#8217;s mother resides. Her parents went looking
          for her grandfather, and now, it&#8217;s been over ten years since
          they last returned to the Gu Family Residence.] Gu Changge suddenly
          recalled the news back when he instructed his servant to help Gu

          obstacles on her way to look for her parents and her grandfather.
          After all, she had the Immortal Gu Family backing her. Even if her
          parents&#8217; still hold onto a grudge and are unwilling to return,
          they would not be able to stop her from returning.]. With that in
          mind, Gu Changge instantly smelled out a scheme, which might not have
          been formed or assisted by Gu Xianer, but she was definitely
          related.</span

          war against Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. After all, among the
          countless Lower Realm Worlds that neighboured Boundary Marker Sea, the
          Heavenly Tide Realm was the closest to it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Heavenly Tide Realm was a vast, borderless ancient world filled
          with excellent talents and rich lands. Although it was nowhere as big
          as the Upper Realm, it was regarded as the most popular among the
          nearby Lower Realm Worlds.</span

      <p>

          >Within, spectacular mountains and rivers were limitlessly grand, and
          by looking down from the sky, one could perceive the vaporising
          spiritual energy and wafting Celestial Mists amid the huge cities,
          making them seem like a paradise in the mortal world. There were
          countless, incomparably prosperous divine cities levitated in the sky,
          accompanied by downward gushes of waterfalls, while vibrant mists and
          clouds floated in the air.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the Heavenly Tide Realm, apart from the ancient clans, there were
          mighty Holy Lands—with long history and legacies—that oversaw all
          lives. In every ancient city, traces of heavenly mists of different
          shades could be seen. The ancient cities were filled with elites,
          including innumerable formidable cultivators and young prodigies. In
          this world, the standard of cultivation was high, and in some aspects,
          it could even rival that of certain regions in the Upper Realm.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >But of course, the Heavenly Tide Realm would remain significantly
          inferior to the Upper Realm if they were thoroughly compared, and such
          discussion would even be considered bizarre. After all, the disparity
          of the powers, legacies, and World Principles of those two worlds were
          simply too great.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Realm had ascended to the Upper Realm, leaving behind rumours that
          inspired countless. At times, formidable cultivators could be seen
          descending to the Heavenly Tide Realm to look for young ones that
          possessed extraordinary Talents to train them back in the Upper Realm.
          Therefore, as time went by, to those of the Heavenly Tide Realm, the
          Upper Realm was no longer mysterious. Though, the latter still
          retained its nobleness.</span

          a lady decide for her marriage? Are we going to force her? Let me ask
          this first. Do you even dare to force her? We all know that her body
          carries half of the Gu Family&#8217;s direct bloodline? If Xianer was

          courteously and politely, knowing that his body was cursed by a unique
          situation. His Spiritual Sea was fractured, we spent days scouring for
          precious materials &#8211; heavenly herbs and age fruits solely for

          in three years, the marriage agreement would be deemed void, and the
          Shen Family no longer owed him anything. Now that three years have
          passed, there are still no signs of improvement in his body. And now,
          he&#8217;s blaming the Shen Family, not recognising the agreement
          three years ago. How am I supposed to bear with that?&#8221; The

          Essentially, the agreement three years ago was frankly made as a joke.

          express that the fractured Spiritual Sea was merely a frivolous issue,
          and should it fail to be cured, there was naturally no need for the
          marriage agreement to be in effect. After all, seeing that the person
          behind Li Xiu was extraordinary, they thought Li Xiu would be worth

          Her beauty was breathtaking—her hair was as smooth as clouds; her
          features were flawlessly charming and elegant; her snowy skin was as
          delicate as the finest gemstone. Her expression was highly cold as she
          carried a peerless celestial energy. The young woman was none other
          than Gu Xianer.</span

          Don&#8217;t you worry about it. You are quite similar to your sister,

          instant, they sounded somewhat disaffected upon the mentioning of Shen
          Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s issues as they told Gu Xianer not to be

          something terrible happened to her during the years she had
          disappeared. Although they were devastated, they wanted an heir, so
          they gave birth to another daughter who was three years younger than

          Even the surname of their second daughter was &#8216;Shen&#8217;
          instead of &#8216;Gu.&#8217; Such a matter was never mentioned to the
          Gu Family.</span

          to that of hers, the former wanted only to achieve the Great Dao
          without giving in to distractions. As a matter of fact, she possessed
          brilliant cultivation Talents which were far superior to that of her
          peers. Even if she were in the Upper Realm, she would still remain a
          prominent individual that could trump unrivalled young

          Boundary Marker Sea to hunt in an attempt to capture the beasts that
          possessed special bloodline in order to refine its precious blood for
          her to use to cultivate, he was unexpectedly slammed by the waves of
          Boundary Marker Sea which left him critically injured.</span

          family, scoured everywhere for him, but for a long time, they could
          not find a single trace of him. Followingly, upon receiving a piece of
          shocking news from the Gu Family, they grew absolutely depressed as
          all their hopes were shattered, after which they decided to live in
          the Shen Family Residence.</span

          the Shen Family, immediately attempted to search for her paternal
          grandfather upon being informed of the news.</span

          her maternal grandfather ended up being trapped with him. Having been
          trapped for many years together, they had faced life-threatening
          dangers.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that most crucial time, a mysterious Elder suddenly appeared and
          rescued the two of them before tending to their wounds. At that
          moment, the Elder was followed by a child, whose name was Li Xiu, and
          the background of both the Elder and the child was unknown, hence they
          remained mysterious.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In order to show their gratitude to the Elder, while also considering
          that he possessed extraordinary abilities, Gu Xianer&#8217;s
          grandfathers had a discussion before introducing themselves and swore
          an oath, in which they promised that they would repay the debt and
          would allow Shen Xian&#8217;er, who was just born, to be his disciple.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sadly, the Elder did not agree to it and expressed that he had no
          intentions of accepting a disciple.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hence, the two grandfathers had a change of mind. Seeing how the
          child was of mature age, they decided to arrange a marriage, to which
          the Elder did not hesitate to agree. With that, the arranged marriage
          between Shen Xian&#8217;er and Li Xiu came into existence.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As of late, the Shen Family basically forgot about such a matter,
          since the Elder instantly departed with the child without a trace
          after agreeing to the marriage. Despite the Shen Family&#8217;s effort
          to search for him, they couldn&#8217;t come to a fruitful result, so
          they treated it as a mere dramatic, mindless promise.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Alas, a young man named Li Xiu popped up at the doors of the Shen
          Family Residence out of nowhere with the agreement written by Gu
          Xianer&#8217;s grandfathers in his hands and demanded the
          actualisation of the marriage.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, the members of the Shen Family were stupefied, never
          expecting the event back then was real. Nevertheless, considering that
          they were indebted to the other party, the Shen Family did not trouble
          Li Xiu. Not only did they allow him entry, but they even tried to help
          him mend his fractured Spiritual Sea.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for the mysterious Elder back then, the Shen Family did not see
          him, and so they suspected that Liu Xiu was actually his disciple.
          Nonetheless, they still welcomed Li Xiu with open arms. However, Li
          Xiu&#8217;s Spiritual Sea was quite unique. Not only was it fractured,
          but the spiritual energy didn&#8217;t seem to be able to amass within.
          Despite the spirit herbs he consumed, which became wasted resources,
          he never showed any signs of recovery.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >And so, Li Xiu became a local laughing stock as many claimed that the
          Shen Family had a good-for-nothing for a son-in-law, which certainly
          embarrassed the Shen Family, yet they couldn&#8217;t revoke the
          promise they had made years ago. To them, what was worse was the fact
          that Shen Xian&#8217;er had only cultivation in her mind, and she was
          quite disgusted by the idea of marriage. Besides, she merely met Li
          Xiu a couple times over the span of three years.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Li Xiu&#8217;s personality and mannerism are dubious. Over the
          course of three years, he came everyday only to water the flowers and
          plant some grass. He never cared about anything else. No ordinary
          person could possess such self-control.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Heaving a sigh, Gu Xianer’s Mother, who was from the Shen Family
          continued, &#8220;If his Spiritual Sea weren&#8217;t so problematic,
          he might stand a chance, but he just had to be a piece of trash that
          can&#8217;t even cultivate. Sometimes, I, for some reason, sometimes
          get the impression that he is an Ancient Monstrocity, who has
          experienced the many ups and downs of the world. Isn&#8217;t Xian’er
          being unnecessarily burdened now? Our fathers shouldn&#8217;t have
          swore that oath. Out of everything they could have promised, they just
          had to go with Xian’er&#8217;s marriage.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, the father awkwardly chuckled. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
          point in dwelling on the matter now. We&#8217;ll see how the family
          handles it, since no one would dare to force Xian’er against her
          will.&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then, Gu Xianer nodded and coldly replied, &#8220;This is indeed
          unjustifiable. But the Shen Family spent three years of resources on
          Li Xiu. Frankly, that is more than enough to repay the debt. By then,
          an amount of remuneration is more than appropriate. If his mysterious
          Master were to return and express his dissatisfaction, we&#8217;ll
          have him come up with another condition.&#8221;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her idea was quite simple. No matter how unjustifiable Li Xiu&#8217;s
          action was, she would never allow her younger sister to suffer.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All of a sudden, a divine rainbow shot towards the mountain, and the
          person walking coming out of it was none other than Shen
          Xian&#8217;er, who just left the palace. As she overheard the
          conversation, she looked at Gu Xianer and said, &#8220;Thank you,
          Sister.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Right, Xianer, you&#8217;ve been tending to your younger
          sister&#8217;s matters all this time, but you&#8217;ve never mentioned
          your own. What do you plan to do with the Gu Family? At the end of the
          day, the Gu Family still owes us for what happened back then. Gu
          Changge was so young, yet he was so ruthless. You liked him so much
          back then, yet he treated you so cruelly,&#8221; the mother suddenly
          asked with an agonised expression, and she was visibly vexed when she
          brought up the Gu Family.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon those words, the father grew silent, as that was the very reason
          as to why he never returned to the Gu Family Residence all these
          years. He was awfully conflicted, being unable to accept the tragedy,
          which Gu Xianer had to shoulder in her young age. If it weren&#8217;t
          for their inability, they would have gone straight to Gu Changge and
          question his actions.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In response, Gu Xianer shook her head and clarified, &#8220;Mother,
          it&#8217;s a big misunderstanding, so don&#8217;t worry about it
          anymore. The members of our branch are now living very well, and Gu
          Changge isn&#8217;t as vile as you describe to him. He simply bears an
          unspeakable secret.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since the matter involved Gu Changge&#8217;s secret, although Gu
          Xianer knew that her parents were worried about her, she would never
          reveal it as that would only cause unnecessary burdens.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Shen Xian&#8217;er looked at Gu Xianer. She knew what happened to Gu
          Xianer ever since the former was merely a child, and she was very
          sympathetic towards what happened to Gu Xianer during the
          latter&#8217;s childhood. At times, she would even assume that Gu
          Xianer no longer lived, to which she planned to cultivate in order to
          avenge her older sister.</span

          her parents, she had nothing but hatred for him. She would never have
          expected one of the same family, Gu Xianer&#8217;s cousin, would pull

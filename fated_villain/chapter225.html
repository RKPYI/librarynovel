      <h4>
        Chapter 225-1: Let you know how high the sky is, Young people shouldn’t
        cross the line (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang didn't care about the reaction of the people in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>This seemed to him to be the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>
        He was the Human Ancestor who stood on the top of all races. Although
        many memories of this life had not been fully awakened yet, the
        character and habit of being aloof and overlooking life and death in the
        past had penetrated deep into his soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mere person from the Upper Realm, which qualification did he have to
        make him visit?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of the countless gods, demons, beasts and big figures of all
        races who knelt down in front of him back then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of them was an existence who could destroy the worlds with only
        their breath!
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, in Jiang Yang's view, the cultivators who would come here to
        the Lower Realms most likely came to find him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before he recovered to his peak, they came to show his loyalty, tried to
        follow him, and would go back with him to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        So that they could enjoy a high position by staying on his side in the
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could tell the purpose of that Immortal at a glance, otherwise there
        was no explanation for why he would be so nice to his sister who was
        staying in the Northern Mountain Village.
      </p>
      <p>In the end, wasn't it only to please him?</p>
      <p>
        After all, with all the benefits, as long as he was not stupid, he would
        understand what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Human Ancestor Hall he built back then had an extremely detached
        status in the Upper Realm. At this time, it should have sensed his
        existence and came to look for him!
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang knew this well.</p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Yang, you probably lost your mind by your cultivation. Don't let
        that Immortal hear your words."
      </p>
      <p>
        "When the time comes to implicate our Immortal Lun Sect, you can't just
        eat and walk around."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, several elders reacted, their expressions changed
        drastically, and they scolded Jiang Yang for a while.
      </p>
      <p>This made them sweat a lot.</p>
      <p>
        For fear of being overheard by the Immortal, it would bring unwarranted
        disaster to the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        These words made Jiang Yang frown, but his face was still indifferent.
      </p>
      <p>In his eyes, these elders were no different from ants.</p>
      <p>So he naturally ignored their ignorance and stupidity.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Jiang Yang said lightly, "If I were you, I wouldn't be
        so stupid. If I say such a thing, I should first ask the so-called
        Immortal, does he dare to let me wait?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Dare to let me wait, contained an indescribable self-confidence, and did
        not put that Immortal in his eyes at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made the expressions of the elders change drastically again, and
        they began to stare at Jiang Yang in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was either a lunatic or a fool, could it be that he really had such
        confidence?
      </p>
      <p>"Let's follow Jiang Yang's words."</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Zhao Yi's figure appeared and she said lightly to several
        elders.
      </p>
      <p>She chose to trust Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>
        In Jiang Yang, she saw a confident bearing that made people unable to
        help but convince.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, she felt that Jiang Yang's words were not for no reason, and
        she even had a faint expectation for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from Jiang Yang's reaction just now, he seemed to have expected
        that the immortal would come to him.
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, Elder Taishang."</p>
      <p>
        Seeing Zhao Yi said so, the elders didn't dare to say anything more,
        their faces were pale, and they wanted to return to the hall to return
        to their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        They came to call Jiang Yang, but instead of calling him, they had to
        let the Immortal come over in person?
      </p>
      <p>
        Although these words were simple, who of them would have the courage to
        say such a thing to that Immortal?
      </p>
      <p>
        Several elders were grief-stricken, such as mourning their concubine, it
        was too difficult for them, they just hoped that Jiang Yang's words
        would be really useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if the Immortal blamed them, who would dare to protect them?
      </p>

            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>And soon, several elders left in a hurry.</p>
      <p>
        "You still have a wink. Although the talent is not very good, it took so
        many years to cultivate till the Sacred Realm."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang glanced at Zhao Yi and said indifferently, "But in the
        future, you can be a swordsman by my side."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing that, Zhao Yi's expression froze. She had lived for hundreds of
        thousands of years. She was a goddess in the Heavenly Domain back then.
      </p>
      <p>Geniuses of the same era as her were all boiled to death by her.</p>
      <p>As a result, in Jiang Yang's mouth, her talent was not very good?</p>
      <p><i>Swordsman?</i></p>
      <p><i>What the hell was this?</i></p>
      <p>
        However, considering Jiang Yang's confident expression when he said
        this, it was difficult for Zhao Yi to refute for a while, and he felt
        that Jiang Yang was unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, in Jiang Yang's mind, another voice sounded with anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm going to see Yaoyao, that Immortal treats Yaoyao so well, how could
        you have such an attitude?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Yang said indifferently, "I will meet Yaoyao, but
        you think too much. If I didn't exist, do you think that Immortal would
        be so good to Yaoyao?"
      </p>
      <p>
        In his view, all of this was nothing more than a set up to please him.
      </p>
      <p>That Immortal was a wise man.</p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        "Jiang Yang… he said that at the time, it has nothing to do with us!"
      </p>
      <p>"I hope that Mr. Immortal won't blame us."</p>
      <p>
        On the other side, hearing the words of several elders who were kneeling
        on the ground, their faces turned pale, and they were shivering.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the entire hall, even the falling of a needle was audible for a
        while, and there was a dead silence.
      </p>
      <p>"It's over!"</p>
      <p>
        This was the first reaction of everyone, including Holy Master Xian Lun.
        Their faces were pale and their whole bodies were cold.
      </p>
      <p>And their souls were trembling.</p>
      <p>They couldn't wait to shoot Jiang Yang to death.</p>
      <p>
        "Instead, you should ask the so-called Immortal, does he dare to make me
        wait?"
      </p>
      <p>
        In everyone's mind, such a sentence still echoed. Although they didn't
        see anyone, they could feel Jiang Yang's arrogant and confident look and
        attitude.
      </p>
      <p>But this time. it was not an ordinary person in front of him!</p>
      <p>
        It was the terrifying existence that destroyed the Sacred Mountain at
        will, and it was unknown how powerful his cultivation base was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once that Immortal was offended, could the Immortal Lun Sect still
        continue to exist?
      </p>
      <p>
        Their Ancestors were in the Supreme Realm, but who knew if the means he
        left behind could actually compete with this Immortal?
      </p>
      <p>"Is this really what Jiang Yang said?"</p>
      <p>
        Holy Master Xian Lun's expression changed suddenly, and he hated Jiang
        Yang at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before, he was still very optimistic about him, and now he couldn't wait
        to slap himself a few times.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Elder Taishang was also by Jiang Yang's side at that time, and this
        sentence was approved by her."
      </p>
      <p>
        At the critical moment, several elders did not hesitate to sell the
        elder Taishang.
      </p>
      <p>A dead Taoist friend was not a poor Taoist.</p>

          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>At this time, he must not be angered!</p>
      <p>
        After all, everyone could see that the Immortal at the top had a much
        deeper expression, and his terrifying aura was like a vast galaxy
        floating up and down.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone was out of breath!</p>
      <p>"Dare to make him wait?"</p>
      <p>"That's interesting."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge finally spoke, his expression was very calm and deep, but his
        tone seemed to be full of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The many elders of the Immortal Lun Sect below felt that they could not
        breathe, their legs were weak, and they were about to kneel on the
        ground!
      </p>
      <p>"Master…"</p>
      <p>"Brother…"</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Yaoyao next to him was also extremely surprised, her
        little face was full of unbelievable expressions, worried that Gu
        Changge would be angry because of this.
      </p>
      <p>She really didn't expect her brother to say such a thing now.</p>
      <p>Let her Master go to see him in person?</p>
      <p>Her brother used to be honest, but he wouldn't say it like this.</p>
      <p>Of course he had changed.</p>
      <p>
        In such an environment, he was unable to maintain himself, and became
        arrogant.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, how did Jiang Yang become what he is now…" Granny Yinhua sighed. As
        Jiang Yang's relative, she was very disappointed and couldn't believe
        it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang, who was honest and kind back then, turned out to be like
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry, for your sake, Master won't be angry." Gu Changge said to
        Yaoyao with a very gentle expression,
      </p>
      <p>"But it seems that your brother is somewhat arrogant."</p>
      <p>His words had been very straightforward.</p>
      <p>
        All the people in the Immortal Lun Sect were extremely pale and smiled
        miserably in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several elders who came back to resume their lives, at this time, were
        even more eager to slap Jiang Yang in the face.
      </p>
      <p><i>What to do?</i></p>
      <p>
        At that time, they thought he was crazy, but they didn't expect that
        even the elders would go crazy with him!
      </p>
      <p>
        This was to push the entire Immortal Lun Sect into the abyss of eternal
        doom!
      </p>
      <p>"I'm sorry, Master…"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was very moved, Gu Changge was still thinking about her at this
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for her, anyone who said such a thing would have been
        slapped to death by Gu Changge, right?
      </p>
      <p>"This has nothing to do with you." Gu Changge smiled slightly.</p>
      <p>In fact, he was not surprised that Jiang Yang would do this.</p>
      <p>
        In a good way, it was a reincarnation’s memory awakening, but in a bad
        way, it was actually a rebirth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was actually similar to the rebirth routine of the remnant soul of
        the God King that he encountered in the Lower Realm at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor should have
        recovered a lot of memories.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise he wouldn't have said such a thing.</p>
      <p>"It's a real forced king…"</p>
      <p>
        "Just pretending to be forceful in front of me, is there something
        wrong?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's smile seemed a little playful.</p>
      <p>
        He understood the idea of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor very
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a normal way, the cultivator who came to look for him now came from
        the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reincarnation of the Human Ancestor must subconsciously think that
        this was someone who wanted to please and hug his thighs before he grows
        up, paving the way for future prosperity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this time, the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor probably did not
        expect that.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 225-2: Let you know how high the sky is, Young people shouldn’t
        cross the line (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Gu Changge in front of him, always wanted to devour him, squeeze out his
        Luck points, and replace him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "System, the source of the Luck for the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor, does it involve the fate of the Heavenly Star Realm?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge asked the system in his mind.</p>
      <p>
        The system replied, "Yes, the fate of the Heavenly Star Realm is closely
        related to the direction of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor."
      </p>
      <p>
        "When the Human Ancestor was reincarnated in this world, he was already
        entangled with the luck of this world."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's heart became clearer when he got the answer.</p>
      <p>It was pretty much the same as his guess.</p>
      <p>In terms of luck, it had always been illusory.</p>
      <p>
        And Human Ancestor's own Luck was not only related to the Heavenly Star
        Realm, but also to his own various causes and effects.
      </p>
      <p>Including Yaoyao, it was actually related to him.</p>
      <p>
        Even all beings in the heavens and the earth, the beliefs of hundreds of
        millions of beings were related to the Luck of the ancestors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that his memory had not fully awakened, the Luck of the belief part
        that involved hundreds of millions of living beings was very likely not
        to fall on the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, alienating the relationship between Jiang Yang and his
        relatives had always been Gu Changge's plan before that. nÊw st𝒐ries at
        n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
      </p>
      <p>But now this plan did not need to be considered any more.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao and her grandma's attitude towards Jiang Yang had changed a lot.
      </p>
      <p>They did not even trust him anymore.</p>
      <p>
        What he needed to do next was to convince Yaoyao that the current Jiang
        Yang was no longer the older brother he used to be.
      </p>
      <p>Even if it was the opposite, it was easy.</p>
      <p>
        "You caused all this yourself. The so-called reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor seems to be just a feigned perpetrator."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't believe that the Human Ancestor who had not yet
        returned to the Upper Realm, could find out what kind of storm he had
        created with his hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, even if the Human Ancestor was reincarnated and brought
        the Luck of the entire Heavenly Star Realm to fight against him, he
        would not need to care.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry, Mr. Immortal, this time the villain will definitely bring
        the arrogant guy Jiang Yang up and make a good apology to the Immortal."
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression of Holy Master Xian Lun changed for a while, and he
        hurriedly cupped his hands and said.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, who cared about Jiang Yang's status as Yaoyao's brother.
      </p>
      <p>He had offended the Immortal himself, and no one could save him!</p>
      <p>
        At that time, when Gu Changge took out his anger at Immortal Lun Sect,
        they would be wronged!
      </p>
      <p>
        After saying that, the figure of Holy Master Xian Lun blurred for a
        while, he turned into a divine light with a pale face, and went to the
        place where Jiang Yang was cultivating.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the elders also rushed there together. Even if it was
        suppressed at this time, Jiang Yang had to be brought along!
      </p>
      <p>In the hall, Gu Changge's expression was calm.</p>
      <p>He turned to drink a cup of tea.</p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, after this time, you should return to the Upper Realm with your
        teacher."
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, Yaoyao will listen to Master."</p>
      <p>Yaoyao nodded.</p>
      <p>Now the thought of missing her brother had faded a lot.</p>
      <p>It didn't even matter if she saw him or not.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing him on the other hand, was considered a farewell, an explanation
        for her longing for so many days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded and heard the prompt sound from the system clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, Yaoyao is extremely disappointed with her brother. The Son of
        Luck, Jiang Yang, has suffered damage to his luck. You have gained 8,000
        Luck points and 40,000 Destiny value."
      </p>
      <p>It seemed that he no longer had to do anything.</p>
      <p>Yaoyao looked young, but her heart was like a mirror.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge laughed in his heart, but his face was calm.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, Jiang Yang, who was shocked, was suppressed by several elders and
        was brought to the main hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind Jiang Yang, there was the Holy Master Xian Lun with an angry
        expression, and Zhao Yi, the Supreme Elder who was full of shock and
        disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>"Reporting to the Immortal, Jiang Yang has already been brought!"</p>
      <p>
        Several elders said respectfully, and then looked at Jiang Yang with a
        deadly expression.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Their cultivation base had reached the Quasi-Sacred Realm, and they had
        shot together to suppress Jiang Yang. Now Jiang Yang, who was only in
        the Divine power Realm, was naturally unable to resist.
      </p>
      <p>He was quickly captured.</p>
      <p>
        With Holy Master Xian Lun personally taking action, Zhao Yi, the Supreme
        Elder, did not dare to say anything more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even at this time, she was full of expressions of shock, puzzlement,
        doubt, and so on.
      </p>
      <p><i>Why things were different from what she thought.</i></p>
      <p><i>It was also different from what Jiang Yang showed.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i
          >This mysterious Superior Immortal, not only did not come to visit
          Jiang Yang, but instead, he let people suppress him and bring him.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Combined with the confident and indifferent expression on Jiang Yang's
        face at that time, it really made her feel that her face was hurting for
        Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>It turned out that his expression at that time was completely fake?</p>
      <p>
        "Ding, you slapped Jiang Yang, the Son of Luck in the face, and got
        1,000 Luck points and 5,000 Destiny value."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge's mind sounded the prompt sound of the system
        again as promised.
      </p>
      <p>However, he didn't bother.</p>
      <p>
        If he pretended to be forceful in front of him, he had to be prepared to
        be slapped in the face.
      </p>
      <p>"Elder brother."</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao looked at the young man in front of the main hall with various
        complicated expressions on her small face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from his face, it was still the brother she was familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>But the atmosphere was completely different.</p>
      <p>
        He was dressed in a luxurious and exquisite robe, and many accessories
        looked exceptionally extraordinary. The charm and runes flowing in every
        thread showed that he was living a good life in the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, he frowned but his expression remained calm.</p>
      <p>But he didn't look at her, nor at the granny behind her.</p>
      <p>Instead, he looked at her master.</p>
      <p>What did this mean?</p>
      <p>Yaoyao's lips turned pale.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Her brother was no longer the kind and honest man he used to be.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        And even Yaoyao herself didn't notice that at this moment, there was a
        peach-like pattern on the center of her eyebrows, which flashed by and
        quickly disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, who had been paying attention to her, saw this scene, and
        his expression was a little strange.
      </p>
      <p>But soon, Gu Changge looked at Jiang Yang below.</p>
      <p>
        This big guy whom he met for the first time was reincarnated as the Son
        of Luck.
      </p>
      <p>Oh no, it should be the Son of Reincarnation's Luck.</p>
      <p>It had come to this, and he was still keeping his calm.</p>
      <p>
        With this kind of bearing, if Gu Changge didn't know his truth, he would
        have been fooled by him.
      </p>
      <p>"You are Jiang Yang?"</p>
      <p>
        Many thoughts passed through his mind, but Gu Changge's expression
        seemed very calm and indifferent, and he asked aloud.
      </p>
      <p>"I am Jiang Yang." Jiang Yang said calmly.</p>
      <p>
        Although it was watched by everyone in the hall, there were still many
        terrifying auras, surging in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>But he didn't seem to feel it.</p>
      <p>And he was also seriously looking at Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        From the appearance, it looked very mysterious, couldn't see the true
        face, and was covered by a layer of fog.
      </p>
      <p>Even the cultivation base was the same.</p>
      <p>
        If he could break through the world barrier, he must have a divine
        weapon for breaking the world barrier, or his realm was extremely high,
        reaching the peak of the Great Sacred Realm, or the strength of the
        Quasi-Supreme Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene of Jiang Yang calmly looking at Gu Changge also made many
        people secretly wonder, was there really something strange about Jiang
        Yang?
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, where did he come from?</p>
      <p>
        "Hmph, what an arrogant guy. If it wasn't for his sister, I don't
        believe he would still be able to stand here."
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Holy Master Xian Lun snorted coldly in his heart, it was fortunate that
        Gu Changge did not blame Immortal Lun Sect for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, he was afraid that Jiang Yang would do something
        disrespectful to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, then do you still remember Yaoyao?"</p>
      <p>Above the main hall, Gu Changge put down the teacup in his hand.</p>
      <p>
        Staring at Jiang Yang, he asked slowly, "She came all the way here to
        see you, but you have such an attitude. As a brother, don't you think
        it's wrong?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Yang frowned and looked at Yaoyao beside Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, what happened today surprised him, and it was completely
        unexpected.
      </p>
      <p>The Immortal in front of him didn't even know his identity at all.</p>
      <p>His previous thoughts were all wrong, and even made him lose face.</p>
      <p>Would he dare to do this if he knew who he was?</p>
      <p>Wouldn't he be directly scared to the ground?</p>
      <p>
        This made Jiang Yang feel a little uncomfortable, and felt that Gu
        Changge was extremely annoying.
      </p>
      <p>From start to finish, things were always under his control.</p>
      <p>
        Now that Gu Changge appeared, everything was completely out of his
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao is my sister, of course, I remember her, how could I forget."
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment, Jiang Yang said lightly, "As for your attitude, I think
        Your Excellency should reflect on it. I hate when someone speaks to me
        in such a high position as you, and you will regret what you did today."
      </p>
      <p>After hearing this, everyone's expression changed.</p>
      <p>
        Even if she had a good sense of Jiang Yang, the Supreme Elder Zhao Yi,
        who had previously thought of him as mysterious and unpredictable, had a
        big change in her expression, feeling that Jiang Yang was crazy and
        wanted to die.
      </p>
      <p>For a while, the hall was dead silent.</p>
      <p>
        Everyone didn't dare to speak, their faces were pale, and they were
        silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for interceding for Jiang Yang? Unless they wanted to die with him.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone thought that Gu Changge would be angry.</p>
      <p>
        Even Yaoyao didn't dare to say anything more at this time. It could be
        interpreted as Jiang Yang's arrogance before, but now this was already a
        provocation.
      </p>
      <p>He was provoking Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        "Oh, it seems that you think you are Yaoyao's older brother, so the
        deity won't do anything to you, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't get angry when he heard the words, but his expression
        looked like he was looking at the ants hopping around at his feet.
      </p>
      <p>With contempt and indifference.</p>
      <p>
        This look made Jiang Yang frown, and his expression was faintly cold.
      </p>
      <p>He was about to speak, but was interrupted by Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        "Forget it, today I will help Yaoyao to teach you a lesson, so that you
        can understand, how high the sky is, the young people shouldn’t cross
        the line, right?"
      </p>
      <p>The tone was filled with regret and pity.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        With his palm, the false name in front of him seemed to explode, and the
        sky was torn apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire hall seemed to be shrouded in a vast starry sky, the runes
        flashed, the rules fell, and a trembling sound came out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying big palm print, as if the sky was falling down, weighed
        as much as tens of millions of pounds!
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone was chilled, their souls were trembling, their legs were weak,
        and they couldn't help kneeling on the ground!
      </p>
      <p>"You……"</p>
      <p>The calmness on Jiang Yang's face finally couldn't be maintained.</p>
      <p>
        He subconsciously wanted to arouse the Luck terrain here, thereby
        triggering the shadow of the Ancestor of the Immortal Lun Sect, and
        resisting the blow just like that day.
      </p>
      <p>But in the next moment, puff!</p>
      <p>
        The speed of the palm was too fast, and his body suddenly shook
        violently, and he fell directly on the ground, spitting blood
        constantly, and his bones were broken a lot.
      </p>
      <p>If it wasn't for Gu Changge holding back.</p>
      <p>
        Under this palm, he would probably explode directly, making the imprint
        of reincarnation and improving the fusion of recovery.
      </p>
      <p>Many plans had come to nothing.</p>
      <p>
        "It's better for young people to be down-to-earth and less pretentious."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shook his head, with a slight sigh, and did not continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what he said made Jiang Yang look extremely ugly, like a pig's
        liver.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't expect Gu Changge's action to be so fast, and he didn't even
        let him react, and he didn't even have time to use his countermeasures!
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, he would never be so embarrassed!</p>

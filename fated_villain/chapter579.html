        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why do I have the feeling that someone is calling out to me?” Jiang Chen came to a sudden halt as he ventured deeper into the underground palace. Doubt crept onto his face as he strained to listen for any sounds. There was nothing but silence now. He gazed up and scanned his surroundings, there was nothing aside from towering pillars.</span><span id="more-32762"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could it be the voice of the Ji Family’s Prime Ancestor?” A suspicion crossed Jiang Chen’s mind. After his recent experiences with the Ji Family, he had already lost all respect he may have had for them and therefore, did not feel inclined to rescue their Prime Ancestor. Besides, he couldn’t be sure whether Ji Shengchu would express gratitude or ingratitude for his kindness. After all, Jiang Chen had found himself in far too many unfavourable circumstances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe it’s worth testing your luck. The Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family is rumoured to be a benevolent man, otherwise many Forces wouldn’t have accepted his generosity. This could be a great opportunity,” the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation encouraged Jiang Chen to give it a try.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen contemplated for a moment and decided that the advice sounded reasonable. Perhaps this was his opportunity to prove his innocence. Without any hesitation, he set off toward the source of the voice. He was also ready to make a quick escape if necessary. The Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family had been trapped here for countless years, relying solely on Inner Voice Transmission to communicate. Surely, he must be at the brink of exhaustion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t think he poses much of a threat to me.] With that thought in mind, Jiang Chen steeled his resolve as he delved deeper into the underground palace. After walking for dozens of kilometres, he sensed an overwhelming force ahead, akin to a massive tidal wave. It was as if an ancient sky was collapsing, compelling him to kneel in reverence. It was an indescribable power that rendered all living beings feeble in its presence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s this?” Jiang Chen looked at the scene in front of him in shock. What seemed like a turbulent river ran on both sides of him, as if they were winding their way through the starry expanse, leading to the depths of the universe. The jet-black waves in them were like the ones in the Great Yin River, brimming with Chaos Qi that filled the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dragon coffins floated along these turbulent rivers, their ancient and weathered appearance hinting at a history that stretched beyond the ages. It was a sight that was difficult to comprehend, as though he had been transported to the depths of the universe itself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ancient celestial bodies floated above his head, making a dazzling display of thousands of stars like a magnificent tapestry that seemed to lead to the very ends of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen caught sight of the blood gathered on the ground ahead of him. A mesmerising nine colours intertwined, emitting a dazzling celestial brilliance. The sheer terror of the aura emanating from it made his skin feel like it was being sliced by a sharp blade, down to his very bones. Even the Chaos Qi surrounding it crackled with an ominous energy, making it difficult to approach. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Immortal King’s Blood! Not only that, there is quite a substantial amount of it! Enough to form a small lake!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, the Immortal King really fell here… and he was linked to the Dragon Clan. Could this be the very palace where the Dragon King slumbers?” Jiang Chen stood frozen in place, hesitant to take even a single step forward. He was aware of the danger posed by the Immortal King’s blood. Despite the passage of countless years and the dissipation of its divine essence, the mere remnants of its aura were still capable of extinguishing any living being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young one…” Jiang Chen was greeted once again by the voice of Ji Shengchu, the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family. He turned to the source of the sound and noticed an extremely high platform in the deepest part of the underground palace. His eyes fell upon a faint figure atop it, appearing almost skeletal in its emaciation. The figure didn’t even look human, but more like a matchstick.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Senior, is that you?” Jiang Chen asked aloud. He never expected the once-revered Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family was now reduced to such a pitiful state. Surviving for so many years in the confines of Kun Mountain was no small feat and spoke volumes about his strength and resilience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, it is I, young one. There are prohibition arrays left by the True Dragon Clan and remnants of the Immortal King’s Qi here. Do not act rashly, lest you bring harm upon yourself,” said the frail figure on the platform. He appeared to be as vulnerable as a candle in the wind that could be snuffed out at any instant. Despite his weakened state, Ji Shengchu’s concern for Jiang Chen’s safety left a positive impression on him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand. How can I rescue you, Senior?” Jiang Chen asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Find the eight eyes of the formations here and break them. The restriction in this place will then be lifted. This old man is fortunate to have found refuge on this platform to escape the grip of the restriction . You must be careful. These restrictions were laid down by the Immortal King himself. Although they are weakened now, they still possess significant power.” Ji Shengchu sighed. Although he was still weak, he found renewed hope in Jiang Chen’s arrival, which helped him muster the strength to brace himself up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand, Senior, I’ll rescue you right away.” Jiang Chen nodded, and began searching for the eyes of the formation, as instructed by Ji Shengchu. At the same time, he was also talking to the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation in his mind, curious to know if rescuing Ji Shengchu was a worthwhile endeavour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you are able to rescue him, he may extend his support to you,” the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation exclaimed excitedly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that Ji Shengchu, who has been confined in Kun Mountain for years, may have found unexpected blessings in his misfortune, leading to a further advancement in his cultivation. Even during his prime, he has most likely surpassed the Immortal Realm . Despite the imperfections in the Principles of the World, I have a strong intuition that once he regains his strength, he will be no less powerful than a True Immortal,” it said confidently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing these words, Jiang Chen’s heart began to burn with anticipation. The prospect of gaining the backing of an ally who was as powerful as True Immortal filled him with hope for a successful revenge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen continued searching for the eye of the formations while conversing with Ji Shengchu and discovered the intriguing story of how he got trapped in Kun Mountain in the first place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ji Shengchu’s account, he was here for the Legacy of the Immortal King. The Kun Mountain was once the abode of the True Dragon Clan in the Upper Realm and the Dragon King was killed here under mysterious circumstances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Shengchu, being a brave and skilled individual, ventured into Kun Mountain alone, hoping to find the Legacy of the Dragon King. Unfortunately, he accidentally triggered an array in the area. He was able to evade the danger and survive thanks to his quick thinking and hiding on the platform. As a result, he got trapped in Kun Mountain for many years, unable to communicate with the outside world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Things must have changed greatly in the world outside. I can’t help but wonder about Ah Lin… As someone who has travelled the world extensively, I have never once broken a promise to anyone, except for her.” Ji Shengchu let out a long sigh. As he recounted his lost love to Jiang Chen, tears of regret cascaded down his wrinkled face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Jiang Chen’s words, he learned about the current state of affairs in the world. The bamboo tree he had planted together with Ah Lin long ago was likely now nothing but dust. Despite Ji Shengchu’s emotions, Jiang Chen remained focused on rescuing him, so that he could win Ji Shengchu’s protection in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Shengchu appeared to be aware of Jiang Chen’s concerns and chuckled. “Young one, you can rest assured. As the one who saved me, you are now the saviour of both myself and my entire Family. Throughout my life, I have always conducted myself with integrity and fairness, never resorting to deceit or betrayal.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have never doubted you, Senior.” With those words, Jiang Chen felt a weight lifted off his shoulders and let a rare smile grace his face. He was suddenly reminded of Ji Chuyue and the comment Gu Changge had made when he was in the dungeon. Perhaps becoming the son-in-law of the esteemed Ji Family wasn’t such a far-fetched notion after all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a long time, a deafening rumble echoed through the air and a dazzling light illuminated the space. The terrifying waves on both sides gradually subsided and returned to the surrounding darkness around them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The nine eyes of the formations have been dealt with, and the oppressive aura that enshrouded this place has dissipated…” Jiang Chen’s face lit up with a sense of amazement, seemingly relieved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Shengchu’s eyes lit up with happiness as he spoke. He took a deep breath before turning to Jiang Chen and said, “Well done, young one. I must ask for one more favour. This old man has been trapped here for years and is extremely exhausted. I need time to recover before I can lead you out of this place. In the meantime, I ask that you provide me protection.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen nodded and readily accepted the request. From Ji Shengchu’s emaciated appearance, Jiang Chen could tell that he had already depleted all his energy while trying to survive here. Ji Shengchu quickly entered a deep state of meditation. Spiritual energy began to gather around him, as the Dao Energy that had accumulated in the underground palace for eons transformed into a mesmerising vortex.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My life shall be rewritten as soon as I leave Kun Mountain! I bet you have never expected this to happen, Gu Changge!” Jiang Chen took a deep breath, his eyes gleaming with determination as he settled into a cross-legged position and began to recover his stamina. His mind raced with thoughts of how to reveal Gu Changge’s true nature, as well as seek revenge for himself and his friends! He vowed to make Gu Changge pay for everything he had done!!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jiang Chen was lost in thought, he suddenly caught the sound of footsteps approaching from a distance. The steps were slow and deliberate as if the person was intentionally making their presence known, allowing the calm footsteps to echo through the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen’s eyes immediately snapped open. For some reason, a bad feeling arose in his heart. As he turned his gaze toward the other side of the underground palace, his eyes widened in disbelief at the sight that greeted him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air around him was thick with an eerie presence, causing his hair to stand on end. A chill ran through his body, causing him to tremble. Fear gripped his heart. An overwhelming dread consumed him, threatening to crush his very being. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge’s sudden appearance was the last thing he expected. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Isn’t he supposed to be fighting with the Daoist Sage right now?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gu Changge, why are you here?” He tried his best to calm down, but his voice was trembling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge walked toward him calmly, shaking his head when he heard Jiang Chen’s question. With a neutral expression on his face, he replied, “I came here to rescue Senior Ji Shengchu, of course. What about you? Why is the Successor of Demonic Arts here, after releasing the Daoist Sage in the mysterious jade in an attempt to kill everyone who came here to rescue Senior Ji Shengchu?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gu Changge, don’t you dare to slander me! I am not the Successor of Demonic Arts! You framed me!” Jiang Chen’s eyes were ablaze as he glared at Gu Changge. He was filled with an overwhelming sense of fear as his limbs grew numb from the cold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps you could enlighten me as to how you came to possess the knowledge of the Demonic Arts? Furthermore, I’m curious as to why you destroyed the mysterious jade to free the Daoist Sage trapped within so that he could unleash his wrath upon everyone.” Gu Changge remained smiling.</span></p>

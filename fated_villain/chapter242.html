      <h4>
        Chapter 242-1: Do I look like a savior? It’s the so-called
        self-direction (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Although she was more satisfied with Gu Changge's answer than she was at
        the beginning, Yaoyao still felt a bit annoyed.
      </p>
      <p>She didn't know what she was annoyed about at her young age.</p>
      <p>
        The disciple was a person who was closer than family. She had firmly
        remembered this sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that her brother was gone, her grandma’s fate was also probably not
        good, and the only family member she had left was her Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have helped you to avenge your brother, Jiang Yang, from now on you
        do not need to be sad."
      </p>
      <p>
        "In the depths of the Netherland Heavenly Pond, I met him and learned
        about you from his mouth, so I killed him with my own hands."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But the one who took him was only a wisp of the True Soul of the
        Immortal Lun Supreme, the real true culprit is still somewhere in the
        Upper Realm."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But you can rest assured, this Master will find him when the time
        comes……" Subsequently, Gu Changge continued to speak, taking the
        initiative to talk to Yaoyao about her brother's matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang had died, and the Reincarnation Seal was now still in the
        Great Dao treasure bottle under digestion.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, he could not tell this detailed process to Yaoyao.</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Yaoyao did not know the true identity of Jiang Yang,
        since Gu Changge told her that the real culprit was Immortal Lun
        Supreme, then she would blame Immortal Lun Supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all of this, even if the Peach Tree from earlier wanted to project
        something, it was impossible to find out the breach.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Immortal Lun Supreme was indeed the accomplice of the Human
        Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The existence of any traces left by the Human Ancestor had been erased
        by Gu Changge?
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time comes, the investigation would only lead to the head of
        the Immortal Lun Supreme, after all, the Immortal Lun Seal and Immortal
        Lun Sect were left behind when he left the Heavenly Star Realm.
      </p>
      <p>"I know, thank you, Master."</p>
      <p>Hearing Gu Changge say this, Yaoyao couldn't help but nod her head.</p>
      <p>
        This hatred, even if Gu Changge didn't make a move, she would still try
        to solve it by all means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Gu Changge had helped her solve a part of it, but for the remaining
        part, Yaoyao felt that she needed to solve it by herself.
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao……"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Granny Yinhua, who had been hiding at the side of the
        Heavenly Pond, suddenly shouted in shock and surprise.
      </p>
      <p>Tears streamed down her old face, and she was incomparably excited.</p>
      <p>
        At that time, when Yaoyao fell into the Heavenly Pond, she wanted to go
        and save her.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the figure of the terrifying existence in the high sky stood there,
        the aura was deterring all directions, enveloping heaven and earth, so
        she did not dare to move a single step.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the safety of the young lady, the silver haired granny was naturally
        incomparably worried, but could only worry with anxiety, and could not
        move.
      </p>
      <p>
        She really didn't expect that Yaoyao had been brought out from it by Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"Grandma……"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was also incomparably surprised at this time, she originally
        thought that her grandma would die under that terrifying figure, but she
        didn't expect that she was alive and well.
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"You two grandma and granddaughter should be reunited first."</p>
      <p>"I still have unresolved matters here."</p>
      <p>
        And at this time, Gu Changge put down Yaoyao and said in a calm voice,
        and his eyes fell towards the terrifying figure in the high sky.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm, Master."</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was very understanding and knew what the things Gu Changge was
        talking about now.
      </p>
      <p>Her eyes couldn't help but be filled with adoration.</p>
      <p>
        The gray mist was monstrous, the mountains were crumbling, and even the
        dome of the sky broke open and was burned down like a mirror inch by
        inch, falling down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a scene was incomparably terrifying, not only make the young,
        silver haired granny and other people feel a palpitating uneasiness, but
        also making the most powerful people of the Heavenly Domain who had been
        watching this place were uneasy.
      </p>
      <p>The sky had collapsed, and a horrible crack appeared.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>At this time, it seemed to have suddenly noticed Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        The terrifying figure shrouded in a thick gray fog high in the sky, the
        cold and merciless eyes suddenly came down, along with the blood aura,
        accompanied by the heaven and earth turmoil, which could turn the sea
        into ash with its terrible pressure.
      </p>
      <p>This kind of aura was too terrifying.</p>
      <p>It was like a Supreme True Demon was awakening.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, not only the entire Heavenly Domain but even the rest of
        the Domains in the Heavenly Star Realm, the Xuan domain, the Hong
        domain…… All felt this overwhelming aura.
      </p>
      <p>As if the world broke down, and the universe collapsed!</p>
      <p>
        Countless living beings and cultivators trembled under this aura, and
        their dharma souls were about to break apart as if they were facing a
        natural disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terrible laws of Divine chain intertwined there, light burst through the
        sky, stars trembled and fell, and were smashed on the ground!
      </p>
      <p>The whole world seemed to be heading toward extinction.</p>
      <p>"It's too terrifying……"</p>
      <p>
        "What kind of existence is hidden under this Netherland Heavenly Pond?
        How come it feels like this aura has surpassed what this Realm can
        withstand?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, what kind of terrifying Great Demon is this, just waking up and
        breaking the vault of heaven, this is destined to bring disaster to all
        beings."
      </p>
      <p>"What should we do about this……"</p>
      <p>
        On a Divine mountain, the Ancient existence in the forbidden area, the
        voice trembled as they looked at this terrifying scene, and their souls
        began to despair.
      </p>
      <p>The higher the level, the more they could feel this horror.</p>
      <p>
        This was no longer a power that the cultivators of the Heavenly Star
        Realm could resist.
      </p>
      <p>The collapse of the sky was one aspect.</p>
      <p>
        Once that True Demon was fully revived, and came out of the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond, it would wipe out the entire Heavenly Star Realm, that
        was the real despair of all living beings and spirits!
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at its current state, it seemed to be trapped in the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond, and it could not leave there.

      <p>
        But that overwhelming demonic might had broken through the vault of
        heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, countless living beings and cultivators, with pale and
        desperate faces, all crouched down on their knees, praying for a savior
        to rescue them.
      </p>
      <p>"Do I look like a savior?"</p>
      <p>"But it's time to end this disaster."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, standing at the edge of the Heavenly Pond, with his
        fluttering robe, his figure was upright, with a seemingly endless
        Immortal aura lingering around.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, hearing these words coming from everywhere, his handsome
        and peerless face could not help but float up with a look of interest.
      </p>
      <p>"Master is the savior sent from heaven to save us……"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao firmly said, now Gu Changge had unparalleled worshippers and
        believers.
      </p>
      <p>Her Master was more powerful than her imagination!</p>
      <p>"The Immortal from the Upper Realm was waiting for this day?"</p>
      <p>
        Silver-haired granny’s respect for Gu Changge, was now revered to the
        extreme, like respect for the gods.
      </p>
      <p>She had thought that he had fallen here.</p>
      <p>
        But she did not expect him to show up again today, and seems to intend
        to suppress this True Demon with his power.
      </p>
      <p>To save heaven and earth from falling!</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        And at this moment, Gu Changge took a step. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at
        n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>
        An Immortal aura emerged, and the colorful divine light beside him
        boiled at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hanging aura floated, in which black particles pervaded, seemingly
        containing a depleted world.
      </p>
      <p>Heaven and earth resonated, and all of the Dao trembled.</p>
      <p>
        True Dragon, Immortal Phoenix, Vermilion Bird, and many Supreme fierce
        figures emerged, like a young Immortal Emperor patrolling the sky!
      </p>
      <p>It was infinitely powerful, suppressing all the laws of this place!</p>
      <p>
        The vault of heaven trembled, and the Netherland Heavenly Pond rumbled,
        raining down a terrifying divine chain of laws!
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength he displayed instantly far surpassed this realm’s limit and
        reached an earth-shattering level.
      </p>
      <p>The majestic dragon aura was like a boundless mountain range.</p>
      <p>
        It penetrated the heavens, tore through the universe, and entangled
        endless chaotic Immortal aura!
      </p>
      <p>Heaven and earth were shocked!</p>
      <p>The eight directions were silent!</p>
      <p>"It's…… It's that Immortal ……"</p>
      <p>"Didn't he already fall in the Netherland Heavenly Pond?"</p>
      <p>
        There were Supreme beings among the Divine Mountains, and their voices
        were trembling with disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless cultivators and living beings were trembling as they watched
        this scene, and could hardly imagine that at this time, there was really
        a savior appearing to save the world and the living beings!
      </p>
      <p>
        And it was the same Immortal who was suspected to have fallen in the
        Nehterland Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 242-2: Do I look like a savior? It’s the so-called
        self-direction (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        At one time, there were cultivators and living beings everywhere
        kneeling, unable to resist bowing in that direction with incomparable
        reverence.
      </p>
      <p>Prayer sounds resounded through the heavens and the earth!</p>
      <p>
        "Today, I will suppress you, the True Demon, and return heaven and earth
        to a clear and bright place!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge rose up and gently shouted at the terrifying figure in the
        gray fog, "You are not allowed to wreak havoc on heaven and earth, the
        living creatures, all the spirits in the world, go back to where you
        belong!
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, his aura of righteousness was overwhelming, and there
        seemed to be an infinite amount of merit and virtue flowing from his
        body!
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, countless cultivators and living beings were
        excited, their blood surging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some even burst into tears and were moved to feel unquestionable
        righteousness to purge all great evils!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rumble!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Soon, a great battle erupted here, earth-shattering and extremely
        terrifying!
      </p>
      <p>
        The aura displayed by Gu Changge was so terrifying that it covered the
        sky and overwhelmed the vault of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the surroundings trembled as if one side of the supreme universe
        was pushing across and suppressing.
      </p>
      <p>Every cell was glowing, dazzling, and exploding with extreme power!</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The sky and the earth were filled with gray mist, which was surging.
      </p>
      <p>But accompanied by a loud boom.</p>
      <p>
        The gray demonic aura dispersed as if there were broken bones, blood
        clots burst, bone scraps splattered, and the blood mist swept!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the sky and earth, Gu Changge's figure became the only one visible!
      </p>
      <p>
        Eternal and peerless, across the sky, with a bang, this terrifying
        figure in the gray mist was blown up!
      </p>
      <p>
        In this place, a black hole suddenly appeared with no bottom in sight
        and the demonic fog that covered the sky.
      </p>
      <p>All of that scenery disappeared.</p>
      <p>
        That scene just now became the last image in the eyes of many living
        beings and cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>Their blood was boiling with fervor!</p>
      <p>
        "I did not expect this Immortal to be such a person with a just heart
        for the world…… We are ashamed to be uncomfortable!"
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({

            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"If I had a trace of that Immortal's guts, why would I cower here!"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, many of the most powerful existences, infected with the
        same warm blood, had rushed up from all over the sky to come to the
        Netherland Heavenly Pond to assist Gu Changge in suppressing the True
        Demon.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Puff!</strong></p>
      <p>
        But before this group of beings could get close to the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond, they were blown by the horrible wind from the broken
        heavenly dome, and were instantly turned into pieces, including their
        souls.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene, moreover, shocked everyone, causing countless living beings
        to tremble in fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, this kind of thing was not something that ordinary people
        could do.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, their reverence for Gu Changge deepened, what kind of verve
        and great righteousness for the sake of the world's living beings, to
        make him like this, where life and death were at war.
      </p>
      <p>"Master will be fine!"</p>
      <p>"He is our savior!"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao's small hands were clenched and she was led by the silver haired
        granny, away from that horrible battlefield for fear of being affected
        by the afterwaves.
      </p>
      <p>She had no doubt about Gu Changge!</p>
      <p>He would be able to clear up all the scourges!</p>
      <p>
        In the end, this terrifying battle that alarmed the entire Heavenly Star
        Realm lasted for half a day, and then was accompanied by an
        earth-shattering roar.
      </p>
      <p>As if it was incomparably unwilling!</p>
      <p>
        Immediately afterwards, endless black light rushed out, obscuring heaven
        and earth, and no one could see what was going on in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, the gray mist that covered everything dispersed, along with the
        terrifying aftershocks, also disappeared into thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the Netherland Heavenly Pond also turned into ashes in this
        battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing left in the original place were the many ruins and dust,
        nothing left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mountains, heavenly pond, ancient trees…… All of them were beaten into
        robbery ashes.
      </p>
      <p>The gray fog dispersed.</p>
      <p>
        Sunlight once again poured down on the heavens and earth, the sky was
        restored, and all creatures were shocked and surprised to find that the
        ruptured vault of heaven seemed to have been patched up by that Immortal
        by supreme means!
      </p>
      <p>The scourge had been stopped.</p>
      <p>
        However, the only thing that became the greatest regret and suspense
        among countless cultivators and living beings was the fact that the
        Immortal also disappeared in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        That Immortal, who cleared all the scourges for all beings in heaven and
        earth, finally disappeared, and even his life and death were unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        This matter became a pile of ancient suspense, even after countless
        years, no one would know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, many people believed that with the power of that Immortal, he
        was unlikely to have problems.

        It was likely that after solving this scourge, he chose to fly away and
        return to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people even felt that the Immortal rushed to the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond in order to strike to suppress the True Demon in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Netherland Heavenly Pond, was a side of the seal to suppress the
        ultimate True Demon, and the day it broke the seal, was the day the
        Heavenly Star ushered in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the Immortal was sent down from heaven to save the Heavenly Star
        Realm and be their savior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such and all kinds of rumors had appeared, and for even more outrageous
        rumors…… powerful, and many people were still convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the sight of that day, was really too amazing, there were
        even a lingering stone to save the blurred image of what was glimpsed at
        the time, circulating around the Heavenly Star Realm
      </p>
      <p>
        This matter was also recorded in the history books, for all future
        generations of living beings and cultivators reverence chanting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, by the grace of the Immortals, this place had countless
        cultivators and living beings, thanks to the gratitude, established as a
        ruin, called the Immortal Ruins. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
      </p>
      <p>
        In the ruins, statues were rising from the ground, by the incense and
        faith day after day.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, all of this was an afterthought.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge had already left the Heavenly Domain with
        Yaoyao and was ready to take her back to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, the silver-haired granny did not choose to leave with
        Yaoyao, she was very relieved to have Gu Changge take care of Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        She still had her things to do and regrets, and there were still many
        things waiting for her in the village, so she didn't want to leave the
        Heavenly Star Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Yaoyao was reluctant to leave, she also expressed her
        understanding and would not force Granny Yinhua to leave along with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the Ture Demon was so powerful and troublesome that in the
        end, her Master had to suppress it for the world.
      </p>
      <p>In the beginning, the Master was only a little wounded.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, Gu Changge would not tell her that the True Demon who seemed
        to be planning to wreak havoc on the world was just his Innate Dharma
        Soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also had no intention of disrupting the world and had no time to do
        so.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that in front of all beings, it was self-directed, playing a
        savior, the many effects behind it, did not matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, by the way, through this incident, in front of her young
        disciple, he casually brushed himself as a teacher’s image of greatness.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, at that time, even if there was a supreme existence,
        intended to deduce the existence of the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor, and finally deduced to the Heavenly Star Realm, might also
        suspect that he was the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>For this kind of move, Gu Changge was well aware in advance.</p>
      <p>
        It was just that he wasn’t sure whether there would be probing or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this process, he found a lot of benefits, no wonder the Human
        Ancestor liked to engage through such means as faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power of faith was the purest power, which could strengthen the
        Primordial Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>It was just that Gu Changge had never believed in this.</p>
      <p>
        However, after the Great Dao Treasure Bottle finished devouring and
        refining, it could even be used as another resource to help him in his
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, after cleaning up many traces, Gu Changge brought Yaoyao to
        the top of a randomly found mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, today I will take you out of the Heavenly Star Realm and return
        to the Upper Realm." He said with a smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p>"Hmm."</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gritting her teeth, Jiang Luoshen stared back at him as she forced herself to
                calm down, and her eyes were notably icy.</span><span id="more-29568"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, do you think killing them will drive me to retreat?
                I&#8217;ll have to say, you must not have thought this through.&#8221; As she was speaking, the golden
                paper appeared in her hand with divine glyphs on it. It emitted golden glows like a miniature sun.
                Followingly, a dense aura surged, as though it could subdue all demons in the world. The power it
                displayed was in the Sacred Emperor Realm, and it vigorously filled the air. Such tremendous power was
                fathomless, as though it could engulf the world in fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, really? So you think you can take me on with a piece of paper
                containing the full power of a strike from someone in the Sacred Emperor Realm?&#8221; Gu Changge turned
                to her and blandly mocked. &#8220;Besides, you must have gotten something wrong. I didn&#8217;t kill
                these people, the Godly Illusion Clan did. The forces behind the deceased will surely exact revenge upon
                the Godly Illusion Clan, and I have nothing to do with that.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, you…&#8221; Surprised by Gu Changge&#8217;s statement,
                Jiang Luoshen was taken aback. Rage surged in her heart as her eyes grew even colder. &#8220;You
                despicable scum! How brazen are you to say those words? And here I thought you were as graceful, kind
                and gentlemanly as the rumours claimed.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My apologies for letting you down. Though, I&#8217;ve never admitted
                to being a good person,&#8221; Gu Changge leisurely replied as he steadily approached her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Jiang Luoshen was grasping the golden paper filled with the full
                power of a Sacred Emperor Realm being, her fear towards Gu Changge drove her to step backwards.
                &#8220;I&#8217;m not the only one who witnessed you slaughtering those four Sect Masters! Do you think
                everything here will stay unexposed?&#8221; Jiang Luoshen coldly said as she glanced at Wang Zijin, who
                was in the corridor, intending to stir the pot between her and Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Princess Luoshen, how vile you are, plotting to kill the crowd and
                slaughtering the four Sect Masters, and now you are even trying to frame Brother Gu!&#8221; However,
                hearing that, Wang Zijin didn&#8217;t seem to be surprised. She then smilingly spoke as she
                mischievously winked at Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221; Dazed by Wang Zijin&#8217;s words, Jiang Luoshen was
                stunned and revealed a hideous glower. [The Saintess of Mortal Palace dares spout such nonsense? She
                must have grown as sly as Gu Changge to be able to walk beside him!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, Gu Changge glanced at Jiang Luoshen and casually asked,
                &#8220;Done with your last words?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, how is killing me here beneficial to you?&#8221; Jiang
                Luoshen felt a chill up her spine upon Gu Changge&#8217;s words.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Princess Luoshen, you exaggerate! How could I ever kill you? You’d
                just happen to perish by accident when you were fighting the Sect Masters over the Godly Illusion
                Divinity Crystal.&#8221; Gu Changge slightly shook his head and grinned as he corrected her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, you are the number one of the younger generation, yet you
                are so shameless, so dreadful!&#8221; With that, Jiang Luoshen gritted her teeth. Her beguiling face
                grew as cold as ice and the chilly sensation around her intensified.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did Gu Changge intend to murder her right away, but he also
                planned to frame the murder to those deceased Sect Masters. As such, he could easily stir up a feud
                between the Godly Illusion Clan and the rest of the forces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you speaking all this nonsense to buy time?&#8221; Gu Changge
                faintly asked. As he raised his arm, a sword energy surged, resembling a heaven-piercing divine sword
                that gleamed amid devastation. Overpowering and blinding, the sword energy was swung towards Jiang
                Luoshen.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s face blanched as she was overtaken by
                immense dread. Failing to react in time, she hastily conjured the golden paper and cast her powers into
                it. Nevertheless, before she could fully display her power, she was struck by Gu Changge&#8217;s sword
                energy. Hit by a massive explosive shockwave, she immediately fell to the ground.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, she gritted her teeth and made a hand sign, displaying an ancient
                divine ability. Her golden hair began to rise as golden heavenly light burst with brightness that could
                make one blind. Such strength was significantly more powerful than that of most young prodigies, and it
                might even rival that of the King with Six Crowns.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, her effort turned out futile before the sword energy. Letting out an
                agonised scream, she spewed a mouthful of golden blood as she was sent flying away before crashing into
                the wall behind her. Had her divine armour not activated at the most critical time and mitigated the
                force of the sword energy, that strike would have taken her life.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With such meagre strength, what will buying time do for you?&#8221; Gu
                Changge scornfully questioned as he walked over to her. Almost instantly, he appeared before Jiang
                Luoshen and grabbed her by the neck before lifting her up.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Cough, cough!* It was Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s first time being strangled this
                way. Unable to breathe properly, she was suffocating.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, she remained persistent, raising her head and glared at Gu Changge with
                her golden eyes filled with relentless detestation. If gazes could kill a person, there was no telling
                how many times she had killed Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, you will regret your actions someday!&#8221; She coldly
                shouted.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really?&#8221; Gu Changge sounded very calm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess, run now!&#8221; Right at this moment, the golden-haired old
                woman suddenly shouted in anger, and her body seemed to be shining.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From her pores, golden blood spilled as ambiguous Mists of Chaos gushed out
                of her skull. Her entire aura grew remarkably stronger than previously, but her flesh was speedily
                ageing. Swiftly, she charged towards Gu Changge, intending to rescue Jiang Luoshen from him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge remained unmoved by this. Without shifting his gaze over,
                he exerted force into his palm to trigger his strength. In that instant, a terrifying shockwave erupted
                in his eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You really want to kill me…&#8221; A trace of disbelief persisted on
                Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s face, and her voice was trembling with fear. Immediately, her entire body exploded
                as mists of blood filled the sky.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess!&#8221; Exasperated, the golden-haired old woman dropped her
                jaw.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Jiang Chen and Monk Pu Du were also shocked, standing still
                where they were.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He sure is ruthless.&#8221; Wang Zijin&#8217;s face grew somewhat
                awkward.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, I&#8217;m going to kill you!&#8221; Dismayed by what she
                saw, the golden-haired old woman, as if she was a frenzied demoness, charged at Gu Changge without a
                care in the world, displaying all sorts of powerful techniques and divine abilities. Unimaginably
                terrorising shockwaves broke out across the region, and even the platform began to tremble as vague
                lights surged around the Godly Illusion Divinity Crystal contained within it, making it seem ever more
                mysterious and beautiful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, Gu Changge&#8217;s face remained unchanged as he raised his hand
                and slammed it on her body, sending her flying away and coughing blood.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why!?&#8221; The golden-haired old woman angrily shouted. As someone
                in the Sacred King Realm, she even used her Forbidden Secret Technique, yet it stood no chance against
                Gu Changge. Quickly, she coughed up a mouthful of blood as she was sent flying away and her body
                exploded. Gu Changge&#8217;s vehemence shattered her hope. Now that Jiang Luoshen had fallen, even if
                she were to return to the Clan alive, she wouldn&#8217;t know how to explain herself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm. Not bad.&#8221; At that moment, Gu Changge suddenly raised his
                brows, seemingly rather surprised. He then raised his head and turned to the air, not far away.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* There, beams of golden lights condensed as a disturbance surged.
                Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s figure appeared once again, but her face was pale and filled with fear as she
                warily stared at Gu Changge. It was as though she had yet to recover from her senses.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She never expected that Gu Changge actually intended to murder her so
                mercilessly without any hesitation. Such decisiveness and ruthlessness left her shivering as she finally
                experienced how death felt, and she was unable to shake the fright off.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A Death Substitution Puppet, huh? To think there&#8217;s such a
                thing…&#8221; Revealing a pondering look, Gu Changge instantly knew what protected her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, as the method of forging Death Substitution Puppets was lost in
                time, they were now invaluable items desired even by even those in the Sacred King Realm. Thus, it was
                regarded as a priceless treasure since using one of them would mean the world had one of them
                less.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Gu Changge was rather surprised to see that Jiang Luoshen possessed
                a Death Substitution Puppet.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aunt Jin&#8230;&#8221; Looking at the golden-haired old woman&#8217;s
                tragic state, Jiang Luoshen failed to contain her emotions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, what the golden-haired old woman used was a Secret
                Technique of Godly Illusion Clan that would burn one&#8217;s Life Force. Although it allowed a temporary
                boost of cultivation power, the side effect was terrifying and irreversible, and not even breakthroughs
                in cultivation levels could help the user to regain their Life Force. Therefore, no members of the Godly
                Illusion Clan would resort to it unless the situation was life-threatening.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the golden-haired old woman&#8217;s eyes, Gu Changge was obviously
                undefeatable, and there was no way she could have delayed Gu Changge without putting her life on the
                line.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess, I&#8217;m glad to see that you&#8217;re fine.&#8221; The
                golden-haired old woman smiled, but she was continuously spewing blood.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aunt Jin, you didn&#8217;t have to do this…&#8221; Jiang Luoshen
                clenched her teeth and tore a talisman in her hand.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, a hazy, monumental golden figure appeared behind her.
                Alarming and grand, it resembled a Godly Spirit that rose from the River of Time. The golden Godly
                Spirit was as dazzling as the giant sun, possessing a fathomless cultivation. Its face was concealed,
                and only its cold, all-seeing eyes were visible.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A Dharma Body of a Master in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm…&#8221; Wang
                Zijin was stupefied by the sight as she didn&#8217;t expect Jiang Luoshen to carry this many protective
                measures.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Gu Changge, furrowing his brows, slowly pulled out a large
                seal filled with the auras of mountains and rivers from his garment. It made the world seem as though
                everything was a dream. It was none other than the Great Seal of Mountains and Rivers.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Right at this moment, Jiang Chen, who was staring at Gu Changge and
                Jiang Luoshen, suddenly gritted his teeth as he just finished communicating with the Artifact Spirit of
                the Celestial Boat of Creation and he had it triggering the arrays of the region.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, the walls lit up as vibrant lights filled the palace,
                illuminating the entire region. Then, what seemed to be the stars in the sky appeared, followed by
                blinding lights that were shot through the clouds to blast down.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole place began to crumble amid horror-striking sounds as the
                reawakened arrays emitted bursts of daunting forces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, Jiang Chen took the chance and dashed towards the location he
                was tasked to head by the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kind Sir Jiang, wait for me!&#8221; Monk Pu Du noticed Jiang
                Chen&#8217;s action. As his eyes glistened, he quickly became a divine rainbow and speedily followed
                Jiang Chen out of the palace.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is happening?&#8221; Not expecting the drastic change of the
                situation, Jiang Luoshen was dazed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Gu Changge, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t seem affected by his
                surroundings. As his body flickered, he charged towards Jiang Luoshen, as if he was to murder her right
                away.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, there&#8217;s no bad blood between us. Why do you wish to
                kill me?&#8221; She clenched her teeth and triggered the Dharma Body behind her to fend off Gu
                Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the Dharma Body was bequeathed to her by an Ancestor back when she
                left the clan&#8217;s territory. Harbouring the strength of the Quasi-Nirvana Realm, it could save her
                life at crucial moments. Given Gu Changge&#8217;s identity, Jiang Luoshen, naturally, knew that he would
                also possess similar cards to play. Thus, she only hoped that she could defend herself against Gu
                Changge’s attacks. She hoped that she could buy herself some more time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, I can spare your life. Be my servant and I&#8217;ll consider
                whether to let you live,&#8221; Gu Changge casually replied with an expression as though he did not give
                it much thought.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As if I&#8217;ll believe you, Gu Changge! You&#8217;ll definitely kill
                me!&#8221; Jiang Luoshen gritted her teeth so tensely they were crushed to bits, and her face was ever
                so icy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indubitably, there was no way she would believe Gu Changge as all she felt
                coming from him was his intimidating murderous intent that was filling up the sky and gushing towards
                her as though it was about to engulf her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe me? Forget it, then. Though, what a pity this is.
                I didn&#8217;t want to be the cruel person to pluck such a pretty flower.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his
                head, sounding somewhat remorseful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Jiang Luoshen&#8217;s eyes were full of chilliness. [How shameless
                of him to speak such words? If it weren&#8217;t for my Death Substitution Puppet, I would have died by
                his hands!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, spine-chilling thunder occurred in the air, harbouring
                celestial figures and dense heavenly lights as well as gleaming golden runes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This place is falling apart. I&#8217;m going to stay here forever if I
                don&#8217;t get out now…&#8221; Wang Zijin muttered as she took a glance at Gu Changge. Knowing that Gu
                Changge possessed unthinkable abilities, she believed that this collapse would not affect him at all.
                Thereupon, she began to retreat and became a divine rainbow leaving on the same path which they entered
                from.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* At that moment, the underground area started to fall to ruins. Upon
                the enormous change, the faces of the others inside quickly changed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hastily retreated to the way they came in from, not daring to
                delay.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What a timely collapse.&#8221; At the same time, Gu Changge, letting
                Jiang Luoshen off, took the opportunity and blinked to the platform as he intended to grab the purple
                crystal.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vast, unwavering aura was surging, and an unparalleled Godly Spirit seemed
                to be sitting within it. Surrounded by glyphs, the Godly Spirit was overseeing the world, possessing
                endless strength.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when Gu Changge was about to grab the Divinity Crystal, a terrifying
                force of resistance was let out from within.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Only for the Successors of the Godly Illusion Clan, huh?&#8221; Gu
                Changge&#8217;s face was as composed as usual. Then, black lights appeared in his palm, followed by
                gushes of black beams that resembled a waterfall, which engulfed the purple crystal. It was similar to a
                terrorising black hole that could engulf existence itself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, the force of resistance notably waned, and an ambiguous feeling of
                fear could be detected.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems a divine consciousness has been born after all these
                years.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes deepened, having no intention of giving up the Divinity Crystal as
                it might be able to help him achieve another cultivation breakthrough.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aunt Jin, let&#8217;s go!&#8221; Seeing that, Jiang Luoshen felt
                somewhat relieved. She coldly gazed at Gu Changge, knowing that he wouldn&#8217;t be able to retrieve
                it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, she triggered the Dharma Body and swiftly left the place.
                Immediately, she became a divine rainbow and helped the golden-haired old woman out of the region. For
                now, she put a pause to her acquisition of the Godly Illusion Divinity Crystal of her Prime Ancestor,
                since protecting the lives of her fellow clansmen was undoubtedly more important.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge turned to her without chasing after her. &#8220;Everyone has left.
                Now, that&#8217;s better.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unaffected by the collapse, he turned back and conjured the Grand Flask,
                which landed from above. The countless Sources in his vicinity were absorbed by the Grand Flask, as
                though they were smoke rising to the sky.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are still Sect Masters that have yet to leave the
                palace.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, he began to search for his prey.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the many young prodigies, these Sect Masters were in the Sacred Lord
                Realm or even the Sacred King Realm. They would not really be affected by the collapse of the
                underground tomb. Therefore, there was no way they would leave yet as they were still scouring for
                treasures.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in the outside world, everyone was watching as the crack grew
                bigger before collapsing in a flash, and the cultivators that failed to escape in time were
                instantaneously trapped within.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did Young Master make it out?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those of the Gu Family were tense. The King with Six Crowns, who was the
                first to enter the crack, had already made it out. He even donned an accomplished look, and the rest of
                the disciples of Immortal Academy had rushed out too.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge didn&#8217;t find something precious in there and grew
                reluctant to come out, did he?&#8221; Gu Xianer glanced at the collapsing crack, unconcerned about Gu
                Changge&#8217;s safety. In her eyes, out of everyone in the world, he was the least they needed to worry
                for.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t Gu Changge with you? Why didn&#8217;t he leave with
                you?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu stared at Wang Zijin with a scowl.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing on the balls of her feet, Wang Zijin turned to the crack and
                muttered, &#8220;The place was collapsing, so given the disastrous circumstances, I immediately fled. I
                didn&#8217;t even notice him.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, amid forces not far away, shouts of sorrow, shock, and
                disbelief could be heard.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Sect Master’s Life Plaque has been broken!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How is this possible!? The Sect Master is only one step away from
                reaching the Sacred King Realm! How could he have died here?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is unbelievable!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immensely dejected, many disciples and Elders were yelling. The death of
                numerous Sect Masters left the region in turmoil.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon that sight, Wang Zijin revealed a fascinated grin.</span></p>

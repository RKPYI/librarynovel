          them.&#8221; Gu Changge said as he picked up Lu Luo, who was just
          beside his leg. She looked very pale. Since her power were sealed, she
          couldn&#8217;t even commit suicide.</span

          >Gu Changge knew that the mysterious Immortal-Killing Gourd needed to
          be subdued in special ways. If he did it forcefully, it would burrow
          itself into the ground, making it hard to find it. Otherwise, Gu
          Changge would have immediately taken it for himself. With Lin
          Wu&#8217;s current strength, he would not be able to stop him at all.
          Even if a miracle happened or if he somehow acquired plot armour,
          nothing would change if he wanted his way.

          teeth. She couldn&#8217;t stay calm; how could Lu Luo, the most
          beloved Young Lady of the Lu Family be humiliated till this
          degree?</span

          Lu Luo felt like she could not breathe. Yet, she was still determined
          and did not plead for mercy. However, this only caused Lin Wu and the
          other young prodigies to fall silent, as they knew they could do
          nothing. Their hearts bled but what could they do?</span

          and continued in a mild voice. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t like repeating
          myself.&#8221;</span

          >Lin Wu&#8217;s expression flickered, feeling at odds with himself.
          The value of Immortal-killing Gourd was obviously invaluable since it
          had performed outstandingly in the past battles against the Upper
          Realm. Many great experts had been decapitated by it and had died in
          the Border Marker Sea. So, how could he be willing to hand it over to
          Gu Changge just like that?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, Lu Luo would be killed if he didn&#8217;t do so. He had
          already witnessed the man&#8217;s cruelty. Even talented experts from
          his own side had been killed without so much as a change in his
          expression.

          fall into their hands, especially not his. No one could ever win
          against him if that happens.&#8221; Lu Luo was stubborn, suppressing
          her fear as she gave Lin Wu her last piece of advice. Before she could
          finish, Gu Changge grabbed her chin and removed it; causing pain that
          made her shiver and turn pale.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t waver, remaining
          impassive. A worthless woman like her was no different from a corpse
          to him.</span

          Changge said coldly. Lin Wu&#8217;s heart wretched so hard he wished
          he could scream. Her tormented expression in particular made it throb
          ever more so painfully.</span

          Gourd. But you have to swear on your Dao Heart or I won&#8217;t
          believe you.&#8221; Lin Wu was filled with rage but he forced himself
          to remain calm. He could not act recklessly right now.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The others were stricken upon hearing that. Lu Luo was moved yet
          saddened, not expecting Lin Wu to actually consider agreeing.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;This is not the time to be negotiating with me. You do not
          have the right.&#8221; However, Gu Changge did not agree and shook his
          head.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare go too far.&#8221; Lin Wu gritted his
          teeth as his hatred nearly consumed him. The calmness he had acquired
          from cultivating for a long time could no longer be maintained, since
          this was the first time he was facing such a terrifying opponent, who
          made him feel helpless and lost. He had always been able to turn
          things around to his advantage when he faced any kind of danger, but
          this was the greatest threat he encountered in all his years of
          cultivating.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The gaze of the grumpy Elder from the Ancient Huo Family suddenly
          shifted slightly as he looked up into the air.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s—&#8221; He was shocked, not expecting to sense
          the energy of a precious treasure.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If anything happens, you cannot leave this place either. I
          have already alerted my side to activate the Mirror of Heaven and
          Earth, which can gather energy from millions of star systems. If
          anything strange happens, the mirror will appear and destroy
          everything. Everyone here, including you, will die here. Our lives are
          worthless and it will be fine if we all die. But, you are not willing
          to die, right?&#8221; He sneered, suddenly calming down and becoming
          more confident.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were all going to die anyway. Thus, it wouldn&#8217;t be a loss
          if they could take Gu Changge with them. Gu Changge&#8217;s status,
          abilities and Talents were unrivalled in the Upper Realm. So, his
          death would be a drastic blow to his side and also something extremely
          beneficial for the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The other members of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were
          shocked, including Lin Wu, who had suddenly remembered something. The
          Mirror of Heaven and Earth was an invaluable treasure and had been the
          product of the collective efforts of countless Elders from their side.
          Building the Mirror had taken millions of years and its strength was
          all-encompassing and monstrous. One strike from it would turn every
          being into ash. Even True Daoists might not be able to withstand it
          and thus would avoid it in fear. Thus, it wouldn&#8217;t be hard for
          it to destroy the place. Since everyone here would die anyway, what
          regrets would they have if they had Gu Changge to accompany them in
          death?</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The Mirror of Heaven and Earth? So that&#8217;s your secret
          weapon? Where did you get the confidence that it can kill me?&#8221;
          Gu Changge only smiled after hearing that. He was brave enough to
          appear in their domain, so he wasn&#8217;t afraid of being targeted.
          The strike from the Mirror might be powerful but relying on it to kill
          him was laughable.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Even if you don&#8217;t die, everyone with you won&#8217;t
          escape alive,&#8221; Lin Wu said coldly, feeling that this man must
          have some sort of weakness. [He can’t be invincible and remain
          impassive about everything. After all, isn’t there a woman in blue who
          is from the same family as him?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Do you think I would care about that?&#8221; Gu Changge still
          shook his head mockingly, as if he had heard something stupid yet
          entertaining.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Fine then, I&#8217;ll give you the Immortal-Klling
          Gourd.&#8221; Lin Wu&#8217;s expression was conflicted and indecisive
          as his emotions clashed inside of him. He had no choice but to give up
          and yield. After all, as Gu Changge had said, he wasn&#8217;t in a
          position to negotiate.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. I will do as I promised. I will let all of
          you go when the time comes.&#8221; Gu Changge remained unruffled, not
          surprised by this development. He knew that Lin Wu would eventually
          give in since he was a Fortuituous One and took his ties extremely
          seriously.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Lin Wu gritted his teeth and did not hesitate any longer. He took out
          a palm-sized golden flask from inside his shirt. Wisps of purple smoke
          swirled around it as sharp Sword Qi. It looked very strange as it had
          a mysterious energy woven around it. Everyone could faintly see a
          heavenly sword stained with blood from countless killings, which was
          ready to emerge from its scabbard and attack.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Is this the Immortal-Killing Gourd from the Eight Wastelands
          and Ten Domains?&#8221; Those from the Upper Realm were astonished.
          Their eyes were all drawn towards the golden gourd. It had performed
          brilliantly in the battle between the two realms. Many mighty experts
          had ended up dying at the Border Marker Sea because their heads had
          been chopped off by this sword, which drew blood with every single
          attack.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Here you go.&#8221; Lin Wu threw it towards Gu Changge. He did
          not dare to play any tricks because Lu Luo was still under Gu
          Changge&#8217;s control and could be killed at any time.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;re very decisive.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and
          caught it, then a black Dao Rune fell into it. He could clearly sense
          a terrifying repelling force exuding from within. Despite being given
          away by a Master it had recently accepted, it was still reluctant and
          did not want to recognise Gu Changge as its Master. It was truly
          something born much earlier than the heavens since it contained such
          astonishing consciousness. It knows where fortune and destruction lay.
          In other words, it knew who to follow so it would not be
          enslaved.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t planning on consuming it immediately. Thus,
          he sealed it with his special ability before throwing it into his
          storage ring. He then looked at Lin Wu with interest.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Now, it&#8217;s your turn to fulfil your promise.&#8221; Lin
          Wu watched him warily, afraid that he would go back on his word.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Gu Changge waved a hand and the arrays binding Huo Rong and the others
          were released. However, he stopped when his gaze landed on Lu
          Luo.</span

          >&#8220;What do you mean by this?&#8221; Lin Wu was stunned before
          becoming puzzled, angry, and uncertain. &#8220;Are you going to renege
          on your promise?&#8221;</span

          whatsoever.</span

          and furious. He didn&#8217;t think Gu Changge would let everyone go
          except for her. The others were taken aback and infuriated as
          well.</span

          me in half a month.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s expression did not show
          any change. He looked up into the sky as he sensed the powerful energy
          closing down on them. He waved a hand and golden fog rose to transform
          into a Golden Rune, which tore space apart and took everyone
          away.</span

          because of his hatred, especially after seeing Lu Luo’s desperate eyes
          as she was being taken away by Gu Changge. His heart felt like a
          thousand needles were stabbed into it, as if it was being torn into
          pieces.</span

          them while waving her green snake cane. Beams of divine light shot
          from it as she attempted to save Lu Luo. However, Gu Changge did not
          even look back. It was as if he hadn&#8217;t heard her.

          She coughed blood and flew backwards, nearly exploding from the
          impact.</span

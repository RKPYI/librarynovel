        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shu Sect Palace was completely quiet as everyone stared silently at the Old Sword Immortal. This was connected to the survival of the Shu Sect and he couldn&#8217;t protest even if he held high seniority. Many Elders eyed each other, as frustration flickering within their gazes.</span><span id="more-33878"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uncle Master, your suggestion makes sense, but the Shu Sect didn&#8217;t have to bring this upon ourselves. Gu Changge&#8217;s strength is much more terrifying than the Otherworldly Sky Demons who have invaded so far.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current Sect Master, a refined man known as the Abundance Sword Immortal, finally spoke, his expression filled with helplessness. Gu Changge&#8217;s strength was known to the Profound Sword World now since he had killed three Earth Sword Immortals with just one hand. It would be hard to fight him even with the most powerful experts of the Shu Sect or even if all Thirteen States worked together. All this could be linked back to the Old Sword Immortal sending the Sword Immortal Order of his own accord. After all, Gu Changge and the Profound Sword World could have coexisted peacefully otherwise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So you&#8217;re all blaming me now?&#8221; The Old Sword Immortal wasn&#8217;t stupid and quickly realised what everyone present was rabjubg. He was furious since the Shu Sect wasn&#8217;t thinking about how to fight Gu Changge at this moment but how to avoid this disaster, even blaming him for it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This disappointed him; how could they all lose their spirit and just decide to accept their circumstances? The Profound Sword World was now facing a great threat, and Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t kind at all. He just knew to disguise himself properly. It wasn&#8217;t just the Snow Sword Immortal who had been fooled, but the Elders of the Sect, who were so afraid they dare not take up the challenge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uncle Master, we all know what you want to say. But, the Shu Sect can&#8217;t withstand such a great loss. Star Sword Valley was reduced to ruins and I think you know exactly why. Even if Gu Changge has ulterior motives, we are still safe before he comes. So, we can drag this out and find a solution.&#8221; Abundance Sword Immortal sighed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had already explained things clearly enough. The Sect would be destroyed if it tried to go to war with Gu Changge. They would definitely end up as ashes.  The Shu Sect still had a last resort, which was to drag this out until the World’s Will was restored, and the world would start changing. This was what they had learnt from the ancient altar</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. So you are all planning to capture me as an apologetic gesture to Gu Changge in order to avoid this disaster, right?&#8221; A sneer suddenly appeared on the Old Sword Immortal&#8217;s face, which looked despondent compared to the aura he was exuding. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire palace was quiet without a word from anyone, with only the sound of vibrating swords reverberating in the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fine. Lin En will avenge me.&#8221; The Old Sword Immortal suddenly laughed as he glanced around at everyone scornfully. &#8220;I believe he&#8217;s the last hope of our world, not the so-called World&#8217;s Will which you all trust.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t change. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t make things difficult for us, Uncle Master.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that day, a terrible event occurred within the Shu Sect which shocked all the disciples. The ancient bells within the mountains all rang without pause as Sword Qi moved and swooped through the air towards the main peak.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ancient Elder of the Shu Sect, the Old Sword Immortal, had sent the Sword Immortal Order without authorisation, thus bringing disaster upon the Shu Sect. It even brought diaster to the Thirteen States. As a result, he was now confined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news caused an uproar in the Profound Sword World, especially the Sword Cliff and Kong Mountain. Countless had their eyes wide in astonishment as they wondered if they had misheard. The Old Sword Immortal of the Shu Sect was an untouchable figure in the minds of all cultivators in this world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories from his youth still circulated within cities, while the cliffs, sword valleys and stone he had cultivated in were being visited by countless people aiming to emulate him and understand some of his Sword Qi. However, he had now been abandoned and left to fend for himself by the Shu Sect, which shook the entire world and its inhabitants. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many youngsters who saw him as a god exclaimed in disbelief. They couldn&#8217;t understand how this was happening. It was undeniably a hard choice made by the Shu Sect, besides being an admission of weakness and a plea for mercy to Gu Changge. Many knew this since the Shu Sect&#8217;s first course of action in the face of a great threat was to take down the perpetrator of attracting the threat to them, the Old Sword Immortal. It was an extremely humble position to take so that Gu Changge&#8217;s anger wouldn&#8217;t be directed at them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides that, Sword Cliff, Kong Mountain, and other Force immediately distanced themselves, since they had finally realised that Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t on the same side as those Otherworldly Sky Demons. Meanwhile, the Otherworldly Sky Demons rejoiced at the sad fate of the Shu Sect upon knowing the Sect had offended Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing to do was not to cross Gu Changge and not to interfere in his affairs, which was the only way to bring peace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master…&#8221; Lin En was on his way to Boundless Valley and his eyes darkened at the news. He looked extremely murderous but that quickly dissipated as he calmed down, knowing that the only way to save the Old Sword Immortal was to kill Gu Changge or to avenge the Old Sword Immortal. Since he couldn&#8217;t do either of them, he had to find a way to go into the depths of the valley.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shu Sect personally captured the Old Sword Immortal to avoid this disaster?&#8221; Ah Qing and Princess Xuan Dea were taken aback by this information. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of Gu Changge crushing the three Earth Sword Immortals to death around Ancient Mulberry City had caused the atmosphere within Profound Sword World to become fearful, with many Forces feeling uncertain. However, they had become close to him and didn&#8217;t have to worry about that. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had been accompanying him on the journey to seek an explanation from the Shu Sect when they coincidentally heard of the news.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a smart move for the Shu Sect to do, but it may elicit scorn from the other Forces.&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea frowned as she looked towards the mountain range in the distance, where flashes from swords could be seen. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ever-evolving scenery made the place look extremely majestic. This was where the Shu Sect was situated; unlike the other Forces, it was located deep within a mountainous area with steep cliffs. Clouds and mist surrounded the grand palaces and towers there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was their fault and my saviour did nothing wrong.&#8221; Ah Qing nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s gaze became conflicted under her white mask upon hearing them. She had already advised the Old Sword Immortal to not act recklessly but he did not listen, brandishing the Sword Immortal Order so he could take down Gu Changge. It had been his own fault for doing this. Her relationship with the Old Sword Immortal made her wish she didn&#8217;t have to see such a thing happen, but sadly, it did not go as she wanted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, several divine rainbows flew towards them. They were all Elders of the Shu Sect who had already known of Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival and dared not dawdle. Their expressions were filled with worry and fear. Other than the Elders from the Shu Sect, te Abundance Sword Immortal himself was present as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The actions taken by the Old Sword Immortal weren&#8217;t what the Shu Sect intended. We&#8217;ve locked him up in prison so that you can deal with him.&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal immediately recognised Gu Changge standing before him and behaved respectfully.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many disciples of the Shu Sect all shook involuntarily in terror. This man had a domineering aura, and he had killed Earth Sword Immortals just with one hand. The Shu Sect could never fight against him although they were enormous. It was hard to describe how formidable he was even by comparing him to gods of legend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m not one for killing anyone innocent. I will not blame all of you too much since you acted appropriately.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded calmly. As far as he was concerned, the Shu Sect&#8217;s attitude wasn&#8217;t surprising and saved him a lot of effort. He had already wasted a lot of time in the Profound Sword World, so he could use this opportunity and find the World Source with the Shu Sect&#8217;s assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew that my saviour wouldn&#8217;t hurt the Shu Sect.&#8221; Ah Qing didn&#8217;t look surprised at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal and Princess Xuan Dea were all secretly taken aback at how Gu Changge had let this go so easily, while the Elders of Shu Sect, including the Abundance Sword Immortal, all sighed in relief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire Shu Sect was in an uproar since many disciples hadn&#8217;t expected Gu Changge to come so quickly and felt frightened at the thought of an impending disaster. However, they all exhaled in relief when they knew Gu Changge had no intention of directing his anger at them. Some even felt that he was different from the Otherworldly Sky Demons, since he did not kill the innocent without regard. His words could probably be trusted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Old Sword Immortal&#8217;s strength had already been sealed and he was now locked inside the Shu Sect’s prison. Naturally, he could not be released without Gu Changge&#8217;s permission. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had originally been too unbothered to care about a bug, which he could easily crush, but he had acquired a lot of information from the Snow Sword Immortal. That included the fact that the Fortuitous One he had seen in Ancient Mulberry City was a disciple of this Old Sword Immortal. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aura of the Fortuitous One wasn&#8217;t present within the Sect since he seemed to have journeyed far away, which took Gu Changge by surprise. Thus, he had told the Sect Master to leave the Old Sword Immortal alive. After all, the Old Sword Immortal was the Fortuitous One&#8217;s Master and might provide some use. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shu Sect didn&#8217;t know of Gu Changge&#8217;s intention and felt immensely grateful for his request.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many days passed and the Profound Sword World became more and more chaotic, with all Thirteen States being embroiled in war. The Forces of the Upper Realm had sent more armies of nearly infinite numbers; even Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts had brought along their mysterious supreme treasures and concealed their auras as they arrived to kill without any regard. This made those of this world desperate and hopeless, while Forces, including Sword Cliff and Kong Mountain, had placed their last hope on the World&#8217;s Will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was temporarily residing in a grand palace situated within the depths of the Shu Sect. He stood with his hands behind his back, his white clothes spotless and free of dust as he looked up into the distant Forbidden Areas of the Shu Sect with a thoughtful expression. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many female disciples who had come to deliver spiritual fruits and wine looked at him in a daze; who would have thought that a being who had easily killed Earth Sword Immortals with just one hand was such an otherworldly, ethereal-looking prince?</span></p>

      <h4>
        Chapter 233-1: Master is so strong that it is impossible for him to die,
        Fine then you can die (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "Impossible, Master is so powerful, how could he fall there, this must
        be fake, impossible‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"I don't believe it, I'm going to find my Master."</p>
      <p>
        In the Immortal Lun Sect, Yaoyao's face was pale, her eyes were red and
        swollen, her little hands were clenched in her sleeves, it was very
        cold, she couldn't believe that these rumors were true.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Netherland Heavenly Pond, her incomparably powerful Master was
        suspected to have fallen into it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside her, Granny Yinhua's face was also bitter and helpless, and she
        couldn't believe it either.
      </p>
      <p>Because that Immortal had made a deep impression on her.</p>
      <p>He had an unfathomable and terrifying confidence in every gesture.</p>
      <p>How could such an existence fall there?</p>
      <p>
        But the moment they heard this news, the jade pendant that Immortal had
        left for Yaoyao cracked.
      </p>
      <p>All of these confirmed the authenticity of this news.</p>
      <p>Therefore, she was even more bitter.</p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao, Mr. Immortal may not have really fallen. It's just a suspicion.
        At that time, it was very far away, and no one saw him really fall
        there‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Granny Yinhua said and comforted Yaoyao, wanting her not to
        be too sad.
      </p>
      <p>But she didn't even believe these words.</p>
      <p>Although no one saw it with their own eyes.</p>
      <p>
        But in the public, that earth-shattering terrifying phantom, unless
        their eyes were blind, who couldn't see it?
      </p>
      <p>
        What she said was like only holding a fluke-like fantasy, that's all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, Yaoyao's face was still pale, and at this moment,
        she was almost unable to stand still.
      </p>
      <p>"Woooooooo‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Then, tears poured out of her eyes, like beads with a broken thread and
        they couldn't stop at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, he is so powerful, he cannot die‚Ä¶ He promised Yaoyao that he
        would not leave Yaoyao‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        She murmured, recalling in her mind the days she had spent with Master
        over the past few days.
      </p>
      <p>He saved her and her grandma from the Black Wind Bandits.</p>
      <p>Accepted her as his disciple and taught her cultivation techniques.</p>
      <p>
        He took her through the ancient cities, across the sacred mountain, the
        forbidden area‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p>
        The man who was extremely gentle to her, who gave her infinite warmth
        and peace, and made her understand the beauty in this world.

      <p>
        The mountains and rivers were magnificent, the lights were brilliant,
        the wind and the clouds were light, the snow was bright and spring.
      </p>
      <p>How could he just leave like this?</p>
      <p>Did he just throw her away?</p>
      <p>At this moment, Yaoyao felt that her eyes were getting dark.</p>
      <p>She didn't want to believe that it was all true.</p>
      <p>
        "Master, he knew that the Netherland Heavenly Pond is so dangerous, and
        he still went there‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is all planned by Jiang Yang in advance. He told Master about
        this. And my Master clearly knew this, so he still wanted to go."
      </p>
      <p>
        "He must have been forced for some reason‚Ä¶ I won't let Jiang Yang go!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Yaoyao calmed down and wiped away her tears, as if she had
        suddenly grown a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        She decided to go to the Netherland Heavenly Pond to find her Master.
      </p>
      <p>Live to find his corpse to confirm his death.</p>
      <p>
        She didn't believe that with her Master‚Äôs strength he would really fall
        into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she heard Yaoyao's decision, Granny Yinhua was shocked and
        unbelievable, but from Yaoyao's expression, she saw determination.
      </p>
      <p>"Huh, if Mr. Immortal knew about it, he wouldn't let you risk it‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>She shook her head and sighed.</p>
      <p>
        She understood that the current Yaoyao was completely different from the
        little girl who would hide behind her when she met a bandit.
      </p>
      <p>She had become more mature and sensible, and no one could stop her.</p>
      <p>
        "Your grandma supports you, Mr. Immortal is so kind to you, how can we
        ignore him when he has done so many things for us?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, the silver haired granny's smile became somewhat relieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        And she didn't even notice that after Yaoyao made this decision, there
        was a faint pattern of Peach petals between her brows, glowing brightly,
        and then quickly disappearing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao had an ethereal aura on her body, as if she could fly away at any
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, what happened in the Netherland Heavenly
        Pond, quickly swept through the entire Heavenly Domain like a storm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless forces and cultivators were shocked, horrified, and couldn‚Äôt
        believe that such a big thing happened. R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on

      <p>
        The mysterious Immortal from the Upper Realm who destroyed the Sacred
        Mountain at will, and finally rushed to the Netherland Heavenly Realm,
        and was suspected to have fallen into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        On that day, the blood shone into the sky, reflecting the sky outside
        the Netherland Heavenly Pond, accompanied by a terrifying phantom that
        made countless hearts palpitate and terrified, they fought there, and a
        monstrous war broke out.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this battle, many cultivators witnessed the figure of the
        Immortal from the Upper Realm getting torn apart, and finally the aura
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>This news was way too scary.</p>
      <p>
        The news of a miraculous phenomenon in the Netherland Heavenly Pond
        caused a sensation in all directions, causing many forces and
        cultivators to rush to it, but now there was a more terrifying
        atmosphere there.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>Even the sky seemed to have turned bloody.</p>
      <p>Even the Immortal could bleed here.</p>
      <p>
        If they went, would they be any better than Immortal? It would only be
        worse in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, many cultivators and creatures retreated and hurriedly
        evacuated from the Netherland Heavenly Pond, daring not to stay there.
      </p>
      <p>Even if a fetish was born, it must be taken with a life!</p>
      <p>
        This incident directly made the Netherland Heavenly Pond in the Heavenly
        Domain thousands of times more terrifying than the restricted area!
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a radius of 10,000 miles, no creatures or cultivators dared to
        approach.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        "What a stupid and arrogant guy, do you think you will be invincible
        when you come to the Lower Realm? Didn't I kill you in the Netherland
        Heavenly Domain in the end‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, among the tall ancient trees, between the vast and
        magnificent mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the road in the remote town, Jiang Yang, who looked indifferent and
        wore a long gown, was smiling. While hearing the news from all sides, he
        couldn't help but say this.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked extremely confident, as if everything was under his control.
      </p>
      <p>In his eyes, this was exactly how things should be.</p>
      <p>After all, this was his calculation for Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>How powerful was it?</p>
      <p>Didn't he get killed by the pit he left behind?</p>
      <p>
        In Jiang Yang's view, Gu Changge was extremely conceited, boasting that
        he was from the Upper Realm, showing contempt and indifference towards
        the creatures from the Lower Realm, and he didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, once he heard that a divine object was born in the Netherland
        Heavenly Domain, Gu Changge would definitely rush there immediately,
        even if he knew it was a conspiracy, he would not care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang knew Gu Changge's temperament, so he was even more certain.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a person from the Upper Realm, with Gu Changge‚Äôs vision, he would
        definitely know that the thing in the Netherland Heavenly Pond was
        precious, so it was even more impossible for him to give up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if he knew that there was probably a fire pit ahead, he still had
        to jump.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, it was impossible for Gu Changge to know that Netherland
        Heavenly Pond was actually related to him, and many of the traps were
        arranged by him back then.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not an exaggeration to say that except for Jiang Yang, any other
        creature who dared to easily set foot on the Netherland Heavenly Pond
        would only face a dead end.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was no exception.</p>
      <p>
        "That Immortal from the Upper Realm was actually killed by Jiang Yang‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind Jiang Yang, Zhao Yi, who was acting as a maid holding a sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, her eyes suddenly widened, and she was extremely
        shocked, and her heart set off a storm.
      </p>
      <p>
        She really did not expect that with just a few words and orders from
        Jiang Yang at that time, the mysterious and powerful Immortal would be
        killed in the Netherland Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        This terrifying and unpredictable method made her back feel cold, and
        she couldn't help shivering.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the reverence for Jiang Yang in her heart had
        increased by several levels.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Yang was really unfathomable!</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 233-2: Master is so strong that it is impossible for him to die,
        Fine then you can die (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        The terrifying power of that Immortal from the Upper Realm at that time
        was still vivid in her eyes, but in the blink of an eye, he had fallen
        into the Netherland Heavenly Pond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Zhao Yi couldn't help but sigh. Although Jiang Yang's
        cultivation was not as good as that of the Immortal, these methods were
        far more terrifying than his cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>"A mere Immortal from the Upper Realm, what‚Äôs your qualification?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang noticed her expression, and couldn't help but smile lightly.
        In his words, he had already forgotten about Gu Changge in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>In his eyes, Gu Changge was now a dead person.</p>
      <p>
        According to the news that came, even if he didn't die, it would be soon
        anyway. How could his methods be able to compete with ordinary people?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had previously bullied him because of his profound
        cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang still remembered that he was not a narrow-minded person, but
        some hatred must be avenged.
      </p>
      <p>Especially when Gu Changge blocked his way.</p>
      <p>"It's a pity that I didn't kill him myself‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang shook his head slightly, and quickly put the thought aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his past reincarnations, he actually encountered quite a few enemies
        like Gu Changge, and the final outcome was similar to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either they were killed by his own hands, or they were solved by his
        many tricks, which could not hinder him in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>And what he had to do next became much easier.</p>
      <p>
        "The descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall in this life is a cautious
        generation. Even the agreed location is so far away from the Immortal
        Lun Sect. Are they afraid of the so-called Immortal?"
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, three days later, Jiang Yang took Zhao Yi through many
        mountains, and finally arrived at the agreed place.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a valley that looked extremely vast, and the surrounding
        mountains looked extremely majestic, with towering ancient trees and
        intertwined vines.
      </p>
      <p>In the middle of the valley, there was an emerald-like blue lake.</p>
      <p>After getting here.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's brows couldn't help but wrinkle, and he felt a sense of
        danger in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        An existence like him almost instinctively believed in the aura in the
        dark.
      </p>
      <p>"Could there be any surprises?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang frowned secretly, but this time he was not empty handed when
        he left Immortal Lun Sect, so he didn't care too much.
      </p>
      <p>He had been through too many things.</p>
      <p>Even if there was an accident, he could confidently settle it.</p>
      <p>"I'm here, come out?"</p>
      <p>Then, he spoke lightly and swept towards the mountain range ahead.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        He had already sensed that there were fluctuations coming from there.
      </p>
      <p>Obviously the person who invited him here was in the middle.</p>
      <p>And with Jiang Yang's words falling.</p>
      <p>Whoosh whoosh!</p>
      <p>
        Figures appeared from all around, all dressed in golden armor, with
        powerful aura, and amazing killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>"Someone from the Upper Realm."</p>
      <p>"How can that be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Noticing the special aura fluctuations on these people, Zhao Yi's
        complexion couldn't help but change. He didn't expect Jiang Yang to come
        here, but it was someone who came from the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>What the hell was Jiang Yang‚Äôs identity?</p>
      <p>
        And at this time, Jiang Yang was still calm, not surprised at all, which
        shocked Zhao Yi even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang's origin was probably far more frightening than she imagined.
      </p>
      <p>"What about the Master behind you?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang didn't care about the status of the Upper Realm of the group
        of golden armored warriors in front of him, and said indifferently, "Let
        her come out to see me, it took a lot of trouble, but why is she so
        vigilant?"
      </p>
      <p>He said in the language of the Upper Realm, not from this realm.</p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, Zhao Yi had a strong cultivation base and could understand
        what he was saying. So she wasn‚Äôt confused at this time.
      </p>
      <p>"Master is in Huxin Pavilion, please come in person."</p>
      <p>
        The Golden Armored Warrior at the head looked at Jiang Yang with a
        scrutiny, as if he wanted to be sure, and then said so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Yang frowned. He personally came here to give some
        face, but at this time, she still hadn't come out to greet him?
      </p>
      <p>This made him unhappy.</p>
      <p>
        However, on the surface, there was still an indifferent expression,
        which could not show any emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his opinion, the descendants of the Human Ancestor Hall in this life
        were probably arrogant and had a somewhat unruly temperament, so they
        were not willing to submit to him like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking like this, Jiang Yang figured out the unease he had just felt.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe things would be less simple today.</p>
      <p>
        But he didn't mind teaching a lesson to the descendant of the Human
        Ancestor Hall, so that she could understand the truth, how to greet the
        Elders, and how to greet the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>"I hope she doesn't regret her disrespectful act today."</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang said lightly, then took Zhao Yi and followed behind the group
        of golden-armored warriors, and headed toward the Huxin Pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the strange expressions of the group of golden-armored warriors
        around him, Jiang Yang didn't care. R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on

        At this time, he also wanted to understand why the current descendant of
        the Human Ancestor Hall asked him to come to such a remote place.

      <p>Instead of going to Immortal Lun Sect to visit.</p>
      <p>
        All kinds of actions were extremely concealed and did not reveal any
        movement.
      </p>
      <p>Wasn't this a sign of disobedience?</p>
      <p>Soon, Jiang Yang saw the figure waiting in the Huxin Pavilion.</p>
      <p>
        Although her face was covered with a veil, it was difficult to hide the
        peerless Immortal face, her expression was calm and deep, and the
        temperament was extremely detached and out of the world, with a kind of
        peerless meaning above all living beings.
      </p>
      <p>She was looking at him with a strange expression.</p>
      <p>
        It was Yue Mingkong who had been here for a long time and planned to
        catch a turtle in the jar.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't expect him to come here, and after sending the letter, Jiang
        Yang actually believed it and left Immortal Lun Sect to come to the
        appointment.
      </p>
      <p>Although there were some doubts and confusions.</p>
      <p>But it didn't affect Yue Mingkong's idea of ??killing Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>
        So‚Ä¶ she set up a net of heaven and earth here, which was a thousand
        times better than the last time she planned Ye Ling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if Jiang Yang's methods were heaven defying, even if he didn't die
        this time, his skin would get peeled off.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is the current descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall? No wonder
        they would do such a thing."
      </p>
      <p>
        When Jiang Yang looked at the figure in the Huxin Pavilion, he was a
        little surprised.
      </p>
      <p>He had always been very accurate.</p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of temperament, he could infer it from the stunning
        woman had in front of her.
      </p>
      <p>She was probably unwilling to succumb to him.</p>
      <p>
        So Jiang Yang didn't really care. He had met a lot of women with such a
        rebellious temperament before, and he knew how to make them surrender.
      </p>
      <p>"You are Jiang Yang?"</p>
      <p>And just when Jiang Yang's many thoughts passed by.</p>
      <p>
        The woman in the Huxin Pavilion also spoke up, her voice was like the
        sound of nature, but it contained a cold killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm Jiang Yang." Jiang Yang said indifferently, "That's the person
        you've been looking for."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Are you the descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall of this lifetime?"
      </p>
      <p>
        When he confessed his identity at this time, it was not a sign of his
        self-confidence, and he didn't worry about the other party's intentions
        at all.
      </p>
      <p>"Fine, then you can die!"</p>
      <p>
        However, Yue Mingkong only frowned upon hearing this, and did not answer
        him.
      </p>
      <p>Then, accompanied by her words.</p>
      <p>
        She suddenly waved her sleeves, her expression indifferent to the
        extreme.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The mighty terrifying aura came from all directions, the blood was
        surging, covering the sky and the sun, and it was incomparably vast.
      </p>
      <p>
        From all sides of the mountain range, many golden armored warriors
        descended like a torrent, suddenly attacking them.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever it was at such moments, Jiang Chuchu would involuntarily think of Gu Changge If he was around, he would definitely be thinking of a method to help her resolve these matters.</span><span id="more-32770"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this period of time, she was actually paying attention to everything that was happening on Gu Changge&#8217;s side. After all, the incident in the Kun Mountain had stirred up the Upper Realm. None of the Forces were able to sit still. In fact, Mortal Palace had also sent plenty of experts over. However, the results were the same as the other Forces. All of them had fallen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had led a group of people to the depths of Kun Mountain. It was such a dangerous place that Jiang Chuchu started to worry. She would keep thinking of what she should do if anything bad happens to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Jiang Chuchu worried, the white-clothed old woman stated, &#8220;Saintess. This month, such crises caused by the Eternal Overcast have broken out six times. Moreover, it has happened around the Sky Domain. We suspect that the Eternal Overcast Royal Family has appeared and they are the reason why there are so many Eternal Overcast Scourges.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu frowned lightly, &#8220;The appearance of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The existence of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom wasn&#8217;t a secret in the Upper Realm. Many Ancient Beings even guessed that the Eternal Overcast Kingdom was actually closely related to the Nine Nethers of myth. They might even be one of the natives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the period this myth got created stretched too far back, it was unknown how many eras back. Even experts, who had extreme knowledge about ancient texts, would have a hard time finding out if the Nine Nethers truly existed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it was really the Eternal Overcast Kingdom, she would need to send someone to investigate. After all, the Eternal Overcast Kingdom was ancient and mysterious as well. All of the major Forces were avoiding the Eternal Overcast like poison, even if they were able to move freely within and unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular cultivators would never dare to contact the Eternal Overcast Kingdom and would treat them like the representative of misfortune.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I heard from members of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty that a strange new world has appeared due to the unusual space rifts. The Eternal Overcast Scourge broke out in that location as well. So, it seems to be a connection to the ancient world, which no one has explored before. Still, this is just a rumour, It is hard to prove if it is true or false. The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty is also trying to cover it up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white-clothed old woman then continued to list out all the bizarre happenings during this period of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An ancient world that no one has explored before? If that is true, the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty is definitely trying to monopolise it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu nodded while her eyes flashed with contemplation [The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty is an existence with a long history. A famous Immortal Force in the Upper Realm. Their strength is as immense as they are mysterious. If they really discovered traces of a new ancient world, they certainly have the ability to monopolise it. If they willed it to be, it wouldn&#8217;t be hard for them to hide this from the whole Upper Realm.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Jiang Chuchu’s eyes, there was a great possibility that the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was trying to cover this up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An undiscovered ancient world…&#8221; Jiang Chuchu mumbled to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Upper Realm was the centre of the universe, an intersection of all worlds. Since the birth of time, there were still too many mysterious and unknown places. There were definitely ancient worlds that were connected to the Upper Realm, which had existed eras ago but might have been lost or never found. However, there had yet to be an undiscovered ancient world that was opened by space rifts. After all, even if such matters were common, they would not get exposed and discovered by others. People would want to monopolise them for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu wasn&#8217;t surprised if they were trying to hide it. Rather, she was wondering if that ancient world was related to the Eternal Overcast Royal Family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No matter what, I have to personally see it for myself.&#8221; Jiang Chuchu regained her composure and looked outside the hall. It has become a habit. It seemed like she was expecting something. But she gradually drew back her gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, she was stunned. She didn&#8217;t seem to believe her eyes as she blinked a few times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was trying to see if it was an illusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why? It hasn&#8217;t been long but you don&#8217;t recognize me anymore?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white-clothed old woman finally realised there was a white-clothed man that was floating in Mortal Palace, without any sound or presence. His figure was otherworldly and it felt like an immortal king that crossed the world. There was even a hazy and terrifying aura that made her heart shiver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings Young Master Changge.&#8221; Understanding that Gu Changge had another identity in Mortal Palace, the old woman dared not be rude and quickly gave her greetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had Gu Changge not spoken, she wouldn&#8217;t have known when he had entered Mortal Palace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This level of strength was unfathomable and indescribable. Even a True Daoist wouldn&#8217;t be able to achieve this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why&#8230;  why are you here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu never expected Gu Changge to actually come to Mortal Palace. Therefore, she thought she was seeing things. She reviewed a pleasantly surprised expression that she couldn&#8217;t conceal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge walked over and smiled, &#8220;Am I not allowed to come?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white-clothed old woman understood that it was time for her to leave. There were plenty of old ‘masters’ in the Mortal Palace, who had guessed that Gu Changge and Jiang Chuchu had close relationships that must not be spoken about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu looked at him and said, &#8220;You should inform me beforehand so that I can make preparations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her opinion, Gu Changge was here to look for her because he found out that Mortal Palace was facing some issues. It made Jiang Chuchu feel touched. After all, there had truly been something that had been worrying her. Something she didn&#8217;t know how to resolve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge was to help her, things would be easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge laughed and asked, &#8220;What needs to be prepared to see me? Are you not presentable right now?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking, Gu Changge reached out to touch her delicate face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that. Don&#8217;t spout nonsense.&#8221; Jiang Chuchu blushed a little. She was indeed pleasantly surprised and was caught off guard by Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival. But she wasn&#8217;t going to admit it so easily and say such things in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so? Then, it seems like I shouldn&#8217;t be here.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head and acted regretful in a natural manner. &#8220;I originally thought you would be very happy that I came.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu looked at him before rubbing her nose, &#8220;Why should I be happy? Your arrival definitely signifies something bad. Your brain must be thinking of something else.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smiled and grasped her into his embrace, &#8220;When did you learn to quibble and slander others? Let me see what you are thinking of inside your heart&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s face was reddened as she said with a little anger, &#8220;This is the palace hall, let go of me quickly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I travelled across millions of kilometres to look for you, and this is how you treat me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge disregarded her struggle and was still smiling, &#8220;No one will dare to barge in at this moment, what are you flustered for?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your ruffian, let me go&#8230;&#8221; Jiang Chuchu was stuttering and after hearing what Gu Changge said, she got even more flustered. After all, the Eternal Overcast Scourge was breaking out more frequently, and anyone might come in to report about this matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if someone came in to see this scene? Where would she be able to put on her dignity as the Saintess?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that Gu Changge was unmoved, as if he  didn&#8217;t hear her, Jiang Chuchu stared at him and said with grievance, &#8220;Gu Changge, you lied to me and didn&#8217;t keep your promise. You said that you wouldn&#8217;t bully me again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When have I lied to you?&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head and said with a wronged expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then&#8230; go to my palace hall later, I will let you&#8230; for as long as you want&#8230;&#8221; Jiang Chuchu saw Gu Changge&#8217;s rogue-like attitude and had no choice but to negotiate. Still, after finishing that one statement, her face was completely red. Meanwhile, she felt as if Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t let her off so easily now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are the one who said it. But I want to hear the truth. Did you miss me during this period of time?&#8221; Gu Changge put his hand on her hair while smiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu looked at him, embarrassed, as she let out a soft “mhm”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge laughed heartily and no longer made fun of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the shy Jiang Chuchu now, it was truly hard to associate with the first time he met her, with her prideful and cold expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge was rather surprised after thinking carefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over 20 years, Jiang Chuchu had been cultivating in Mortal Palace in seclusion, and hardly got in contact with the outside world. Her disposition was actually not much different from the generations of Mortal Palace Successors. Cold, lonely, righteous, and stern. They had always placed the protection of the entire world as the greatest priority.</span></p>

          family decided to hand over most of the property to Yin Mei all of a
          sudden. Even her grandfather, uncle, and everyone else had no
          objection.</span

          unlike their usual self. The most important thing was that all of this
          happened without her knowledge.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Back then, Yin Mei brought people to the Tang Family Manor and
          announced that she would take over the Tang Family&#8217;s important
          affairs in the Alliance of Thousand Merchants.</span

          >Tang Wan remembered how she thought that it was simply a fool&#8217;s
          dream. Even if Yin Mei had Gu Changge supporting her, the Tang Family
          wouldn&#8217;t just let go and abandon the family&#8217;s interests.
          It might be possible if Gu Changge himself had requested she persuade
          the family, but even that might not work. Tang Wan understood her
          family too well. She knew that it wouldn&#8217;t sit well with them to
          give away the family business they had been working on for so long.
          Such a thing was simply impossible.</span

          >However, Tang Wan was left shocked when her grandfather, uncle and
          others turned pale and agreed dejectedly after seeing the jade
          talisman handed over by Yin Mei. They didn&#8217;t tell Tang Wan what
          was in the talisman, and none of them explained it to her no matter
          how much she probed. All they told her was that the Tang
          Family&#8217;s glory days were over, and they had no choice but to
          agree to Yin Mei&#8217;s request.</span

          after this decision was made. Although many people of the family were
          shocked, confused, and puzzled by this, they would never refuse Old
          Master Tang&#8217;s orders. There were speculations that the
          Nine-Tailed Fox Clan had gotten ahold of the Tang Family&#8217;s
          Achilles heel, or else the Tang Family would not have responded in
          this way.</span

          >The Tang Family&#8217;s decision to entrust the properties to Yin Mei
          was met by the objection of those with other surnames because they
          were the one responsible for managing many of the Tang Family&#8217;s
          properties. Having the properties handed over to Yin Mei would be
          equivalent to having their lifeline cut off.</span

          He knew about the pickle Tang Wan was in this time. It seemed as
          though the Gifted Lady of the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan had gotten hold of
          the Tang Family&#8217;s weakness. He didn&#8217;t know what this
          &#8216;weakeness&#8217; was, but he believed that he would eventually
          have a way to find out for Tang Wan.</span

          In fact, his heart ached for the woman who was his Dao Partner in his
          previous life. He was the one who secretly persuaded those with other
          surnames to come here so that he could put pressure on the Tang Family
          and make things difficult for Yin Mei.

          >Fortunately, things went well. The entrusting of the property to the
          Tang Family was temporarily delayed like he had planned. He would have
          had no choice but to think of another way if his plan was
          unsuccessful. He would either have to find a chance to kill Yin Mei,
          or force her to tell the truth about why everyone in the Tang Family
          was so wary of and respectful to her.</span

          couldn&#8217;t help asking Qin Wuya who was behind her when confusion
          hit her. &#8220;Qin Ya, why do you think my grandfather is so obedient

          >Tang Wan could only inwardly sigh. She had a feeling this was the
          case, but no one in the Tang Family explained anything to her.
          Furthermore, she knew that Yin Mei was one of Gu Changge&#8217;s
          people. This was the reason she couldn&#8217;t just stop them. She was
          worried about Gu Changge finding out…</span

          up a fuss by demanding an explanation over the past few days,
          effectively testing Yin Mei&#8217;s patience. However, she
          couldn&#8217;t do anything to them when they still had a lot of
          resources in their hands. Should there be a conflict, it would be a

          Wuya left the hall and did not continue to get involved in this matter
          swiftly after. The only thing she wanted to do now was bring this

          will work out somehow,&#8221; Qin Wuya said. He somewhat guessed what
          Tang Wan was thinking. This made him sure of his plan. With his
          ability, it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult for him to stay hidden.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          feel that he was genuinely concerned about her. However, she found it
          hard to believe things like past lives. She might be disappointed in
          Chu Hao, but that didn&#8217;t mean she was open to accepting Qin
          Wuya. Moreover, Gu Changge had ordered her to monitor Qin Wuya&#8217;s
          actions and whereabouts. All she felt towards him was a sense of
          guilt. Nothing more, nothing less. She started feeling hopeful when

          that Qin Wuya was behind all this. Having to deal with these people
          with other surnames every day had put her in an irritable mood. She
          then informed Gu Changge about this and waited for him on what to do

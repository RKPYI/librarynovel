        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re a grown-up now. I doubt you&#8217;ll listen to my
                warning, but I believe you know what you are doing. Well, as long as you understand the severity of the
                matter. Though, I feel that Her Majesty is merely a pawn in this. The one who truly wants to take Jun
                Bufan down is Gu Changge. So, you must think assiduously about what terrifying consequences may spiral
                out of this, and understand that your involvement may cost you your life.&#8221;</span><span
                id="more-29806"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grand Tutor let out a sigh, knowing that he wouldn&#8217;t be able to
                keep her from leaving, but as her father, he felt obliged to make things clear to her out of concern
                that she might regret her out-of-whim action.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand, father. Rest assured, I know my limits.&#8221; Song
                Youwei nodded with a solemn expression.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since she first met Gu Changge, she felt that the perfection he
                displayed was frankly unrealistic, given that nobody this perfect should exist in this world. Such
                perfection should be nothing but a facade donned to impress others. As for what kind of person Gu
                Changge truly was, none had the faintest idea.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwards, Song Youwei hastily left the capital and hurried to the point of
                rendezvous according to Jun Fan&#8217;s message.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, when she reached the forest outside the capital, her encounter
                with an individual took her aback. She had been taking the most discreet paths to the capital and
                ventured into the woods, yet she managed to bump into someone she was familiar with. Judging by their
                behaviour, they seemed to be hiding something behind that frown of theirs.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, Song Youwei advanced towards the individual and asked,
                &#8220;Sister Jun Yao, why are you here?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That individual was Jun Fan&#8217;s second sister, Jun Yao, who was
                acquainted with Song Youwei.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if she didn&#8217;t expect to meet Song Youwei, Jun Yao seemed surprised,
                after which she revealed an expression of joy and hurriedly replied, &#8220;Youwei, why are you here as
                well? Do you know what is happening in the capital? I&#8217;ve heard news saying that my father and the
                entire family are imprisoned. What is going on?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Song Youwei was stunned for a moment before heaving a sigh. [It
                seems Jun Yao wasn&#8217;t in the capital when the imprisonment took place. So, she managed to evade
                confinement. She must not dare to show herself after hearing about the news in the capital and she could
                only hide in the woods, only to bump into me.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have no idea either, but Her Majesty seems pretty mad about this.
                Though, I don&#8217;t know the details. Right, why are you here?&#8221; Song Youwei said before pointing
                at a pagoda not far away. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go over there?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a gloomy face, Jun Yao painfully claimed, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
                what&#8217;s going on. I left the capital to look for some tea flowers, and on my way back, I heard
                about the news. Everything was fine. How did this happen? And I can&#8217;t help but worry about
                Fan’er.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling sympathetic towards Jun Yao, Song Youwei thought that she was quite
                miserable. Nevertheless, she was hesitating whether to disclose the truth to her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nevermind. I should let her ask Jun Fan herself. I shouldn&#8217;t intervene
                as an outsider.] With that in mind, Song Youwei chose to conceal the truth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Song Youwei told Jun Yao about Jun Fan&#8217;s invitation to her to scour a
                ruin without mentioning any other matter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, upon a moment of hesitation, Jun Yao decided to follow Song
                Youwei to look for Jun Fan. Naturally, Song Youwei did not reject her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, the two swiftly went on their journey.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching as the figures of the two damsels faded away, an individual in black
                garment walked out of the void.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I knew Song Youwei is not irrelevant, given her Fortuity level. Though, how
                she may contribute to the whole plot line remains unknown] Gu Changge was fascinated. He had cast a
                giant, invisible net, and all he needed to do now was haul it back. He made his move on the chessboard,
                called the Demon World, and now it was the Six Demon Overlords&#8217; turn to make a move.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Jun Fan, who was a million kilometres away from the
                capital, was in an isolated area amid towering mountains and solid hills. The nearby aura was strange as
                black gusts swirled amid the air. As the black gusts whirled, dense, endless mists arose, covering the
                sky and darkening everything in sight/ It was so dark colours were no longer discernible.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such black gusts were formed of unknown substance, which might be Principles
                or fractured divinity. Regardless, the aura it emitted was very strange. It was both cold and hot at the
                same time..</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is as Father said. The Principles in front of me have changed, and
                they are different from that of the lands of the Demon World.&#8221; Jun Fan muttered to himself. As he
                took a step forward, blaring sounds erupted from him, deafening noises that were the result of his
                secret treasure resisting the aura.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes that the Land of the Dead must be here. There were many hazardous
                regions across Demon World, and the one he was at now was referred to as the Land of Peril, wherein its
                soils were carrying the shade of crimson blood whereas the skies were filled with grey clouds that would
                strike fear in anyone. There were also rumours stating that it was formed by the dead corpse of a being
                from the mysterious Nine Gloom Desolate Land a long time ago.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Skullflowers only grow in areas with dense death Qi, so it&#8217;s
                most probable that the Gates of Death are here.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Jun Fan did not advance rashly as the land was filled with dangerous
                arrays and runes, which once caused a Sacred King Realm expert, who ventured into the area in an attempt
                to raise their cultivation level, to disappear. Only his dried-up bones were found when he was
                discovered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, he was waiting for Song Youwei to come, given that she was
                knowledgeable about this field as she even received the legacy of a transcendent being of the Demon
                World. It was a being who laid down a spirit array that annihilated invading beings of Quasi-Nirvana
                Realm from the Upper Realm. In fact, not many apart from Jun Fan were aware of such an incident and such
                a powerful existence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Things would go much smoother if Youwei decides to come.&#8221; Jun
                Fan&#8217;s eyes glistened as he already knew where the key Jun Ruoxi mentioned was hidden. It was in
                his Knowledge Sea. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of this life, his father already passed him the Solar
                Heavenly Blade, but his father never mentioned the key given the time had yet to come.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few days, Jun Fan attempted to enter his Knowledge Sea and
                attempted to search for the key, which he expectedly succeeded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You sure trust your sister that much to really think it&#8217;s here,
                huh?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the air, a waft of pitch black smoke drifted before turning into Bai
                Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s figure. As a shapeshifting Demonic Being, her physique had always been composed of
                some sort of smoke-like substance that was ambiguous, ethereal, and untraceable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, she was staring at the crimson land as she blandly
                asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jun Fan took a glance at her before revealing a grin. &#8220;No doubt.&#8221;
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, he omitted the reason behind his statement. Thanks to the key, he
                was able to detect the uniqueness of the land.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, right in that instant, Jun Fan&#8217;s face suddenly changed as
                the Communication Rune in his chest suddenly lit up. He then read the message with his divine sense,
                only to find himself stupefied before speedily growing upset.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er looked at his strange
                expression and asked, pretending to be clueless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jun Fan coldly glared at her and said, &#8220;You betrayed me.&#8221;</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blandly staring back at him, Bai Lian&#8217;er scoffed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
                never been on your side, so what betrayal?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You!&#8221; Feeling a gush of vexation in his heart, Jun Fan clenched
                his fists as he never expected his childhood friend to stab him in the back at such a moment. In fact,
                he wasn&#8217;t even aware of the imprisonment of the Quelling Chaos King and the entire Jun Family
                during his time away. If it weren&#8217;t for the spies he arranged in the capital, he wouldn&#8217;t
                have known of the great matter taking place in the capital.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since his failed assassination, Empress Yao Xi initiated a thorough
                check throughout the capital, eliminating many of his spies, so he wasn&#8217;t informed about the
                incident in the capital right away. Upon the incident, Jun Fan assumed that Empress Yao Xi was now aware
                of his true identity and also possessed sufficient evidence for it. Moreover, no one else could have
                handed her the evidence other than Bai Lian&#8217;er, who was right in front of him.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did Yao Xi give you the order?&#8221; Clearly irritated, Jun Fan was
                highly defensive as he was prepared to cast his protective abilities to kill Bai Lian&#8217;er.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without answering the question, Bai Lian&#8217;er simply shot him a pitying
                gaze and replied, &#8220;Even at this point, you&#8217;re still oblivious as to who gave the order. How
                pathetic!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge…&#8221; Upon realisation, Jun Fan gritted his teeth
                tensely. He bore nothing but immense abhorrence towards the man who had been ruining his plans again and
                again.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So you&#8217;re not a fool after all. Don&#8217;t worry, I have no
                intentions of fighting you, so you may withdraw whatever it is you&#8217;re ready to do. All the things
                you could have done, you went and offended someone you shouldn&#8217;t have. Jun Bufan, I can&#8217;t
                wait to witness your execution by Gu Changge.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thump!* The next moment, following a spine-chilling cackle, Bai
                Lian&#8217;er turned into a cloud of black mists and instantly vanished from the region without leaving
                any trace.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it! I won&#8217;t let you off so easily!&#8221; Jun Fan clenched
                his fists with an annoyed expression.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was ready to pull out the piece of golden paper filled with divine runes
                that harboured unparalleled divine might, which he was hiding underneath his garment. If Bai
                Lian&#8217;er hadn&#8217;t left in time, he would have attacked right away. In fact, the golden paper
                was one of his ultimate cards, which he was confident he could take down Bai Lian&#8217;er with despite
                her immeasurable cultivation level.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bai Lian&#8217;er delivered the brocade bag to me with ill intent. The
                brocade bag might even be fiddled with by Gu Changge. Even if he didn&#8217;t open it, he might have
                imprinted some kind of marking on it, allowing him to find me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly alerted now, Jun Fan then began to think of ways to remove the auras
                around him and used his many secret treasures to conceal his tracks. Now that his identity was exposed,
                Empress Yao Xi would definitely come for him, and once his location was confirmed, she would certainly
                send an army after him. This was something Jun Fan had no doubt about.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Jun Fan turned into a divine rainbow and travelled across the
                crimson land, intending to verify the exact coordinates of the Land of the Dead while he waited for Song
                Youwei&#8217;s arrival. Although he revealed his whereabouts to Song Youwei, he believed that she, given
                her personality, would not expose it. Right now, in the vast Demon World, there were not many people he
                could trust, but Song Youwei was unquestionably one of them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ruoxi is currently in a risky spot. Since Gu Changge is the mastermind
                behind all this, he must have known about the Gates of Life. I can only pray that Ruoxi has enough
                methods to keep herself concealed from Gu Changge.&#8221; Nevertheless, in that instant, Jun Fan was
                still troubled by another matter as he was visibly anxious and concerned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The location of the Gates of Life is indeed unusual. Anyone who steps
                into it would be affected by the Great Shi of the region.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge was standing on top of a mountain, staring at the
                distant scenery; heavenly beams were glowing in his eyes, as though a million runes were evolving
                within.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind him, there were Jiang Luoshen, Tian Ze, as well as a number of
                formidable cultivators he dispatched from the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before them was a borderless, dense ancient forest soaked in thick fogs
                wherein vibrant mists wafted everywhere. The sturdy trees, resembling mountains, covered the sky; spirit
                grass and medicinal fruits could be found all over the place. Ornamented by the dazzling waterfalls and
                vigorous shrubs, the forest appeared spectacular and vast.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was where Jun Bufan&#8217;s sister, Jun Ruoxi, was hiding.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Indeed, something is hidden here. It seems Demon World&#8217;s change
                in Fortuity and the disappearance of the Six Demon Overlords are closely related. All these years,
                they&#8217;ve been trying to trick the world into believing that is not real,&#8221; Jiang Luoshen
                claimed with a scowl as her eyes were also gleaming. At that moment, she was utilising an ability of the
                Godly Illusion Clan to investigate the area.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess, perhaps we can scour the entire region. I doubt we
                can&#8217;t find that mysterious place with a thorough search,&#8221; a formidable expert of the Godly
                Illusion Clan behind Jiang Luoshen stated, seeing no challenge in the ancient, grand mountain
                range.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Luoshen then coldly replied, &#8220;If things were this simple, Gu
                Changge would have done it himself instead of waiting this long.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Changge withdrew his gaze and turned to her. &#8220;Indeed,
                it isn&#8217;t as simple as it seems. Sadly, I should have captured Jiang Chen and things would be much
                more convenient with him here.”</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was speaking the truth, as his current capabilities merely allowed
                him to detect the oddities across the region. Godly Spirit Arrays that harboured tremendous divine might
                were planted in every couple centimetres of the land, where runes possessing absolute power subtly
                twinkled.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, Jiang Chen was now fleeing from death in the Upper Realm, or else, Gu
                Changge would have dragged him over to lead the way.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You expect me to believe that you don&#8217;t have a solution?&#8221;
                Jiang Luoshen shot him a glare and added, &#8220;You&#8217;re just too lazy to do it.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Gu Changge chuckled. &#8220;Oh? Don&#8217;t you know me so well?
                Indeed, I have a solution. Since you&#8217;re already here, I could toss you inside and all the arrays
                will reveal themselves to me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Luoshen coldly glowered at him. If gazes could kill, she would have
                murdered Gu Changge a million times over.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* All of a sudden, waves of disturbances surged in the air and turned
                into a pitch black fog, which Bai Lian&#8217;er then walked out from.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So Jun Bufan already knows,&#8221; Gu Changge looked at her and
                leisurely said.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He does,&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er blandly blurted.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very well. Lead the way.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded. Indeed, he knew of
                a way to find the path.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when Bai Lian&#8217;er followed Jun Bufan into the region, although
                there were countless arrays hindering their progression, making it difficult for them to precisely
                locate the position, as long as they had a general idea of where it was, all he needed to do was
                gradually narrow down the vicinity and he would be able to find the hidden place.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having no interest in mindless chatter, Bai Lian&#8217;er began to advance.
                *Thump!* She turned into a cloud of fog, floating forward along the air.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Gu Changge followed her as the runes in his eyes were still
                gleaming, forming black and white lights that resembled reincarnation, scanning the changes in arrays
                surrounding them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since the well is where the Gates of Life is, the lifeforce there
                should be vigorous, so it won&#8217;t be hard to find.&#8221; In the vision affected by the Power of
                Reincarnation, everything became crystal clear, be it the Principles of the World, the shifting of
                Earthly Shi, the flow of Fortuity, or the intertwining lifeforce. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s steps were rather slow-paced as he followed Bai
                Lian&#8217;er, but he could feel the auras constantly fluctuating along his steps. His enemy must have
                detected his presence and attempted to hold him off while keeping their aura concealed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ll surely get lost if we barge in carelessly.&#8221; Sensing
                the changes in her surroundings, Jiang Luoshen furrowed her brows.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge simply ignored her remark as he detected where the well
                was.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a hill, there were gleaming mists drifting in an ancient well, wherein
                endless lifeforce were gushing as celestial energy vaporised. That was the very Gates of Life of the
                Demon World, an entity that was virtually impossible to find.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, unusual motions were all over the place as traces of light
                surged into the air. Beneath the ancient well, there was a woman, whose white hair was as sparkly as a
                waterfall and face was veiled, sitting. Never moved once, she seemed to bear celestial energy that was
                vague and hollow, as though she was a flawless statue made of the purest tusk. Even her snowy dress was
                unstained by any blemishing shades.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That woman was none other than Jun Ruoxi.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, Jun Ruoxi&#8217;s brows were tense, as though she was about
                to open her eyes, sensing a dreadful aura continuously getting closer. Unable to identify the invaders,
                she could only sense their extreme terror. Such an aura was absolutely unfathomable and chaotic,
                harbouring spine-chilling, compact Principles.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite her brilliance and dignity, she somehow felt like an insignificant
                ant, and it was her first time experiencing such a sensation. No matter how hard she attempted to
                conceal the aura of the region and hold off the invaders, her efforts were futile.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* Her tightly shut eyes finally opened as she tried to discern the
                faces of the invaders.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I travelled an immeasurable distance and came all the way here. Are
                you not going to show yourself, Lady Ruoxi?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a voice suddenly sounded from the opening of the ancient well, upon
                which Jun Ruoxi&#8217;s serene face dramatically changed as she felt an overwhelming chill up her
                spine.</span></p>

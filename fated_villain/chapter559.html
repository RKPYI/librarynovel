          fled from the Great West Holy Land after the disaster. He had passed
          away 80 million years ago, and all his descendants are in the Westwin
          Domain. Brother Chu Wei made it clear that if anyone wishes to obtain
          the Cursed Rock, they must not only take care of his descendants, but
          also pay their respects to his seniors at the ruins of the Great West
          Holy Land… and he promised that all other treasures acquired through
          the exchange would be ours to keep.”</span

          began talking about Chu Wei, who brought Cursed Rock to this very
          place. Despite the passage of time, many still recalled him as the
          Prime Ancestor of the Great West Holy Land. Tragically, after the
          disaster that befell his homeland, he succumbed to madness and
          ultimately passed away on one of the mountains there.</span

          conditions you raised are of no issue for us. With just a single word
          from my Mistress, I am certain that no one in the Upper Realm would
          dare to cause any trouble for the descendants of Chu Wei. Feel free to
          mention any other conditions that you may have.”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          that the demoness was perhaps not as vicious as the rumors had made
          her out to be. The white-bearded old man consulted with his companions
          through Inner Voice Transmission before saying, “In that case, the
          Cursed Rock is yours to take if you are able to produce a hundred
          Immortal Crystals.”</span

          Foetus just now. The group of Ancient Beings pondered the value of the
          Cursed Rock, then concluded that it was as enigmatic as the Immortal
          Foetus and therefore deserved the same price. The other Sect Masters
          and Family Heads present couldn’t help but react to the staggering
          figure.</span

          tension froze for a moment from Devil Mountain after the ancient
          beings stated the price. This caused a sense of unease among many, as
          it was clear that this group of demons was not to be taken lightly.
          Even the Mistress of the Devil Mountain, the demoness in red, had a
          reputation for taking lives after she had just appeared, and many
          supreme experts had fallen at her hands.</span

          they were joking.</span

          believe that Devil Mountain is a pushover, or that I am ignorant of
          the true worth of a hundred Immortal Crystals? I challenge you to find
          anyone in this expansive Upper Realm who can produce a hundred
          Immortal Crystals without batting an eye. I wager you couldn&#8217;t
          even locate someone capable of producing ten Immortal Crystals, let
          alone a hundred.”</span

          >He simply refused to believe that anyone could procure a hundred
          Immortal Crystals at times like this, particularly for the purpose of
          cutting open a rock. Such a notion was preposterous and he even
          harbored suspicions that the True Daoists from Dark Kun City were
          attempting to dupe them.</span

          of politeness as he retorted, “If you think the price is unjust, then
          you are free to decline the offer. We are not forcing your Devil
          Mountain into cutting open the Cursed Rock.”</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The others in the crowd wore a strange look on their faces. They
          previously shared the same mindset as Elder Master Qinglong, believing
          that no one could produce a hundred Immortal Crystals. In the end, Gu
          Changge showed them what it meant to be truly wealthy. Even Yu Feiya,
          the Phoenix Lady and others couldn’t help but gaze at the composed and
          collected Gu Changge in awe. It was possible that even Elder Master
          Qinglong had not anticipated Gu Changge’s ability to fulfill the hefty
          payment.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“My apologies, but I cannot agree with your statement. Young Master
          Changge had spent a hundred Immortal Crystals to cut the Immortal
          Foetus. One of the Seven Divine Rocks. The people of Dark Kun City
          were witnesses to this remarkable feat with their own eyes. How can it
          possibly be false?” the white-bearded old man continued speaking, his
          gaze tinged with a hint of mockery.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What… Gu Changge?” Elder Master Qinglong was taken aback by this
          revelation and looked at Gu Changge in shock and disbelief. He
          recognized the young man, but he had never expected that Gu Changge
          had already spent a hundred Immortal Crystals to cut open the Immortal
          Foetus before their arrival. The expressions of those present only
          served to confirm that this was no mere fabrication.</span

          open the Immortal Foetus?” Elder Master Qinglong was so shocked that
          his breath almost caught in his throat.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Gathering a hundred Immortal Crystals is a challenge, but I can
          still afford it,” Gu Changge cast a glance at him and replied
          nonchalantly. As he spoke, he felt Chan Hongyi’s unwavering gaze
          piercing through the demonic cloud. Despite this, he remained calm and
          collected, avoiding eye contact with her.</span

          if you wish to cut the Cursed Rock.” The white-bearded old man and his
          companions snickered. At this point, they were already certain that
          there were not many supreme experts from Devil Mountain.</span

          the availability of several Dao Artifacts, they had no reason to fear
          those who came from Devil Mountain. Amidst them all stood Gu Changge
          as well. He had a formidable force, whose strength was beyond
          measure.</span

          Master Qinglong and his companions became ugly, as their prior
          arrogance and haughtiness dissipated. They exchanged looks, eyes
          brimming with a fierce resolve.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the past, they were known to cause trouble and would simply take
          what they wanted. Now that they couldn’t afford to part with so many
          Immortal Crystals, perhaps they could resort to robbery.</span

          Crystals.” The white-bearded old man and his companions exchanged
          knowing glances as divine runes emerged on the palms under their
          sleeves. Their Nirvana Realm Principles now condensed as their auras
          radiated with an intense power.</span

          As the atmosphere grew tense, a cold and composed voice rang out from
          the depths of the demonic cloud. The voice was exquisitely beautiful,
          akin to heavenly music. Though it sounded like it belonged to the most
          beautiful woman in the world, it carried a chilling aura that sent
          shivers down the spines of all who heard it. Even the True Daoists
          were left trembling in its wake.</span

          drastically too. The icy voice made their scalp tingle as they felt
          their souls were on the verge of being shattered.</span

          A surge of fresh blood rose in their throats. Their very souls
          trembled and they could barely remain standing. It took them a long
          time to regain their composure, but their faces were still unusually
          pale, as if drained of all color.</span

          elegantly in the carriage, her scarlet dress resembling the hue of
          freshly spilled blood. Her countenance remained as cool as ice, and
          the tone of her question sent shivers down the spines of all who heard
          it.</span

          still left everyone feeling uneasy. For some reason, it felt like Gu
          Changge and the demoness in red shared some hidden secret between
          them.

          continue to speculate.</span

          >As the crowd was speculating about their relationship, Gu Changge
          smiled and produced a sealed jade jar in his palm once again. Those
          who had witnessed him purchase the Immortal Foetus Rock earlier
          couldn&#8217;t help but hold their breath, knowing exactly what the
          jar contained.</span

          hand as if he intended to present it to her personally. The people of
          Devil Mountain were taken aback by this sight. Even Elder Master
          Qinglong, who was standing in front of the carriage, stepped back in
          fear.</span

          knowing full well that despite his own reputation, he was no match for
          this young man. The other great demons also stepped back, creating a
          path for Gu Changge to pass through.</span

          she did not expect Gu Changge to approach her like this. She remained
          quiet, as she watched Gu Changge coming toward her with her cold and
          indifferent eyes.</span

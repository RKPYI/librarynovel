      <h4>
        Chapter 265-1: Prepare a big surprise for Su Qingge, Who is inseparable
        from the inheritor of demonic art (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        It was not difficult for Gu Changge to find Su Qingge's location. In the
        vast Southern Heaven, there were only a few places where the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had eyes all over the place, so it didn't take much effort to keep an
        eye on one person. The main problem now was that Su Qingge did not know
        that Gu Changge had actually noticed her and was suspicious of her true
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, for Gu Changge, what he needed to consider was what kind of face he
        would put on when he would meet Su Qingge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If I let her notice first, I might alert the snake." After that, Gu
        Changge left the place and headed to the place reported by his
        subordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
        He did not intend to go to see Su Qingge directly. That person was very
        smart, she would probably feel something from a little clue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Gu Changge had to prepare a big surprise for her, so that Su
        Qingge would not know that he was planning something.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        And on the other side. Southern Heaven, in the middle of a recently
        emerged absolute Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mountains were lofty, and the ancient trees were barren with a scene
        of exhaustion. The gray fog was constantly diffusing from the high
        altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large number of Heavenly Extinction beings were gathered here. Their
        eyes were scarlet, with their fangs exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of them were human-like in appearance, but most of them couldn't
        show what their original race was, with a heart-pounding aura flowing
        through their bodies, and their strength was mostly at the True God
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, a group of young men and women dressed in gorgeous
        clothes, shrouded in treasure glory, were fighting with this group of
        Heavenly Extinction beings. It was clear that this group of young men
        and women was very extraordinary, dressed in uniform clothing, from a
        supreme sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were dressed in uniform attire and came from a supreme sect. The
        divine light shone in all directions, and the sound was earth-shaking.
        All kinds of divine weapons, carrying various colors of haze, rushed
        over from the high altitude to attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying light contained astonishing divine might as if a star
        exploded, and a large swath of Heavenly Extinction beings was blasted to
        death. Many mountains and peaks were turned into pieces and collapsed
        under this aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this group of young men and women, there were a few people who looked
        extraordinary, their robes were draped with wisps of laws, all sorts of
        divine powers, and treasure techniques, and the list was endless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if it was the Heavenly Extinction beings in the Heavenly God Realm,
        they could handle it with ease. Among these people, an elegant young man
        was dressed in a light blue tunic, and was particularly
        attention-grabbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the aura of a scribe, holding a crystal clear folding fan. With a
        shake of his hand, a brightly glowing rune flew out, turning into a
        multicolored hurricane, attacking in the front.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        This multicolored hurricane was tainted with the power of the laws, even
        if there were many Heavenly Extinction beings in the front it instantly
        engulfed them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this terrifying power, even the True God Realm beings were instantly
        turned into pieces of dust, and both their body and spirit were
        destroyed on the spot. A group of young men and women were standing
        beside him and praising this elegant young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many young disciples were looking at him with reverence and admiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Senior Brother Zhao's strength is becoming more and more unfathomable,
        now that he has stepped into the True God Realm, even those Heavenly
        Gods are not good enough in front of him."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, Senior Brother Zhao is worthy of being the young supreme of my Ru
        Sheng Academy. Even compared to Senior Brother, it's not at all too
        much. Maybe in this trip to the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, Senior
        Brother Zhao should get about the same amount of points as Senior
        Brother."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Maybe in the future, we will have to change and call the Second Senior
        Brother Zhao as Senior Brother‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, seeing this scene, many disciples opened their mouths
        and praised, admiring the elegant young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man named Senior Brother Zhao, could not help but smile slightly
        while hearing these words at this time and then shook his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It‚Äôs just a small tactic, compared to the big senior brother, I‚Äôm still
        far from it. You guys just don't talk nonsense to cheer me up." His
        words were very humble and easygoing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the rest of the disciples once again opened their mouths
        with a burst of flattery and praise, so that senior brother Zhao could
        not stop waving his hands, with a very helpless look.
      </p>

          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        The second senior brother of the Ru Sheng Academy was considered the
        best of the younger generation. And Rui Sheng academy was a sect
        specializing in refining the aura of the Dao with an ancient foundation.
        Powerful people from this sect could easily shatter the stars with a
        mouthful of spiritual energy and crack the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yiyao now had the strength of the True God Realm, although he could
        not be compared to those Ancient freaks from other eras sealed in the
        academy. But his strength in the younger generation still belonged to
        the top.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, he was responsible for leading a team in the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh yes, Miss Su, where is your teacher? I think these divine arts and
        techniques of yours, seem to be quite unfamiliar, although their power
        is quite great, but I always feel it being related to a bit of
        swordsmanship," Zhao Yiyao suddenly said.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked slightly behind the team and asked a woman in white who was
        covering her face with a light veil. When he was fighting with the
        Heavenly Extinction beings just now, he paid attention to the woman in
        white behind him. Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        He was familiar with a lot of the Dao forces and seeing her moves and
        aptitudes, there was something different. So he couldn't help but be a
        little curious.
      </p>
      <p>
        This woman in white, at that time, came in with them from the entrance
        of the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield. He saw that she was alone and
        her strength did not seem very strong, so he felt some compassion and
        invited her to take care of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield was not like the outside
        world, the danger of Heavenly Extinction Aura was part of the danger,
        but Heavenly Extinction beings and secretly lurking inheritors of
        demonic art were more dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
        The woman in white did not have a companion, if she encountered more
        Heavenly Extinction beings, it was estimated that she would not be able
        to cope with it, and it would be very dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention the rest of the crisis‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ But despite this, she still
        dared to come here alone, which made Zhao Yiyao a little impressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, his invitation made many disciples misunderstand, thinking that
        he had some ideas for this white woman. This made Zhao Yiyao a little
        helpless, but he did not overly explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        "My master instructed me that her name can not be easily told, I
        apologize Mr. Zhao." The white-clothed woman smiled and replied in a
        calm voice with a slight apology.
      </p>
      <p>
        "So that's how it is, then it's me being abrupt. I'm sorry, Miss Su."
        Hearing this, Zhao Yiyao couldn't help but smile, "I think you have this
        ability, you shouldn't be a person of no reputation, your master must be
        a reclusive high ranking person."
      </p>
      <p>
        He asked the name of the woman in white, but the other party only said
        the surname Su. He searched but did not find such a young supreme in his
        memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could only give up on this, treating it as a casual cultivator with
        an old monster teaching behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        On hearing this, the woman in white shook her head, her voice as calm as
        ever, "Mr. Zhao overpraised me, I can't make any fame with this skill,
        I'm just a nobody."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Miss Su is really modest, your skills are no weaker than some young
        supreme‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" Zhao Yiyao smiled, as if he was very elegant and easy-going,
        "Maybe we still have to rely on you for this trip to the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield."
      </p>
      <p>
        For this decent talk, stunning posture white woman, honestly, he still
        had some good feelings. Of course, these good feelings developed in the
        Heavenly Extinction Battlefield with their conversations during the past
        few days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other party, no matter who she talked to, kept a distance of more
        than three feet, so she was not the kind of woman who was casual. This
        coincided with the Ru Sheng cultivation practiced by Zhao Yiyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, he felt that this Su girl seemed to have a somewhat special
        physique, which he had seen by chance in the middle of a discipline's
        textbook at first. This gave rise to a strange feeling in Zhao Yiyao's
        heart, that the chance acquaintance between the two seemed to be
        destined to be the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Senior brother Zhao really has a good feeling about this strange Su
        girl‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's a pity that senior brother Zhao is so nice, it's still only the
        third day they've known each other."
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's so good about this mysterious Miss Su that she deserves such
        treatment from Senior Brother Zhao?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this scene, many young girls of the Ru Sheng Academy were envious
        and jealous. The first thing that they wanted to say was that I'm not
        sure if I'm going to be able to get a job.
      </p>
      <p>
        During these years, countless genius girls admired him, but had not been
        answered. But now, this was only the third day of acquaintance, and he
        was so concerned about this Su girl, asking about her from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as she was a discerning person, she could see what Zhao Yiyao
        was thinking. But for these, the woman in white didn't seem to care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe she understood, but she still pretended not to know. This made all
        the female disciples even more envious and jealous. Why couldn't they be
        treated like this by Senior Brother Zhao?
      </p>
      <p>And the woman in white was naturally Su Qingge.</p>
      <p>
        If she wanted to get a place to enter the True Immortal Academy, she
        naturally had to kill these creatures to exchange for points. Su Qingge
        herself planned to be alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But considering the dangers and unpredictable dangers in the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield, it would be much more convenient if there were
        companions around at the critical moment. So she agreed to Zhao Yiyao's
        invitation at the entrance.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        The second senior brother of the Ru Sheng Academy seemed to have a
        favorable impression of her, and Su Qingge could naturally feel this.
        However, she didn't show anything. To her, Zhao Yiyao was not much
        different from a stranger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, their group quickly went deep, and all the Heavenly
        Extinction beings along the way were slaughtered. But when they got to
        the depths, they couldn't help but feel the difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the one hand, the Heavenly Extinction Aura was getting stronger, and
        their body couldn't bear it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, there were the creatures of Heavenly Extinction here,
        many of which had reached the True God Realm, and even the Heavenly God
        Realm. And among them, most of the disciples were only in the False God
        Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there were all kinds of divine weapons and runes to protect
        themselves, they were not the opponents of this group of ghostly
        creatures at all. Zhao Yiyao looked around and said in a deep voice,
      </p>
      <p>"Calculate how many points are left‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"It's not enough, we still need a little more."</p>
      <p>
        "There seems to be a piece of ruins ahead. It seems that it should be
        left by the forces that have been ravaged by the Heavenly Extinction
        creatures. We can go there to rest."
      </p>
      <p>"Then we should rest first."</p>
      <p>
        As he said that, he led all the disciples to go there, Su Qingge
        hesitated, and followed. But at this time, the voice of another soul was
        ringing in her mind.
      </p>
      <p>"You should have also seen Zhao Yiyao's physique, right?"</p>
      <p>
        "I know, it's a sacred body." Su Qingge nodded, with a trace of thought
        in her expression, "This physique doesn't seem to be very useful to me."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's not really big, but it's better than nothing." With an evil voice,
        she said again, "Do you really think you are a good person? You will be
        soft at this time? Su Qingge, there are quite a lot of geniuses who died
        in your hands."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Su Qingge just shook her head, "There are so many people
        here, it's not easy to fight. It's not worth the loss."
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, she followed the group of Ru Sheng Academy to the ruins ahead,
        Zhao Yiyao and others were already calculating their points. Su Qingge
        also calculated her own, and found that she was still far from it. She
        rarely took action along the way, and when she encountered Heavenly
        Extinction beings, they were all dealt with by the disciples of Ru Sheng
        Academy.
      </p>
      <p>So, she actually didn't have many points in her hand.</p>
      <p>
        "Miss Su, do you have enough points?" At this time, seeing Su Qingge
        frown slightly, Zhao Yiyao couldn't help but ask with concern, "If it's
        not enough, I'll give you a little bit. I have plenty on hand."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, many disciples of the Ru Sheng Academy looked over, and
        many disciples who still lacked points were jealous. Brother Zhao did
        not ask them first, but instead cared about such an outsider?
      </p>
      <p>
        And Zhao Yiyao didn't seem to notice the expressions of the younger
        juniors behind him, and still said to Su Qingge,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't be embarrassed, Miss Su, I see that you rarely made a move along
        the way, and gave us a lot of points. That‚Äôs how it should be‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Su Qingge just shook her head, "There‚Äôs no need for that, I
        appreciate Mr. Zhao's kindness. As for the remaining points, I will get
        them myself."
      </p>
      <p>
        After saying that, she turned around and planned to leave this place.
        Seeing this scene, everyone from the Ru Sheng Academy couldn't help but
        breathe a sigh of relief, feeling that it would make them very
        uncomfortable if Su Qingge stayed here.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Miss Su‚Ä¶" But at this time, Zhao Yiyao's complexion changed slightly,
        and he hurriedly chased after her, but Su Qingge's speed was very fast,
        and she soon disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wait for me here, I'll find Miss Su, the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield is way too dangerous, how can I just sit around?" Zhao Yiyao
        said to the group of junior brothers and sisters behind him, and then
        his figure quickly disappeared, chasing in the direction where Su Qingge
        left.
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Zhao really is‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        "What's wrong with this Su girl? She‚Äôs being so indifferent to him,
        apart from being good-looking, what other advantages does she have?"
      </p>
      <p>"I really can't figure it out."</p>
      <p>
        "She‚Äôs mysterious, I can see that she is definitely not a good person at
        first glance‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing Zhao Yiyao chasing after her, the disciples of the Ru Sheng
        Academy couldn't help but mumble. They couldn't figure out why Senior
        Brother Zhao, who was always calm and mature, was acting like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side, Su Qingge, who had left the ruins, was very fast,
        turning into a divine light and rushed to the depths. Between the
        mountain peaks, there was a surging gray fog, as if it was night
        already.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't want Zhao Yiyao to be entangled too much, so she didn't stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It looks like that guy got lost, and he's really a waste. But it's good
        luck for him to be alive."
      </p>
      <p>
        In her mind, another voice sounded. Su Qingge shook her head
        noncommittally and said, "Even if he follows, I can't kill him, since it
        will increase my suspicion."
      </p>
      <p>
        Her words made the voice in her mind silent. At this time, she really
        couldn't attack the guy surnamed Zhao.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 265-2: Prepare a big surprise for Su Qingge, Who is inseparable
        from the inheritor of demonic art (2)
      </h4>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        "Miss Su's speed is so fast, the Heavenly Extinction Aura here is
        already so strong, why is she going even deeper‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        After following her for a long time, Zhao Yiyao, who was lost as a
        result, stopped on a mountain with a bit of depression, and his fists
        could not help clenching.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gray fog in front of him was dense, and many scenes could not be
        clearly seen even if he poked out his consciousness. He couldn't see Su
        Qingge's figure, and naturally didn't know her whereabouts, so he was
        lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made him feel very uncomfortable, a little melancholy, and lost.
        Zhao Yiyao didn't know if he would be able to see Miss Su again in the
        future. After all, this was the first time he had a good impression of a
        woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        He really wanted to take her back to the academy, even if Miss Su didn't
        like him now, he wouldn't care. After all, good feelings could all come
        and be cultivated slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Miss Su couldn't be found, didn't it mean that it would be
        difficult for the two of them to meet again in the future?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why is Miss Su avoiding me?" Zhao Yiyao sighed, feeling a little sad,
        he knew that he should have stopped, even if he used force, he had to
        keep her.
      </p>
      <p>
        What was the use of regretting it now? Going deeper, it would be
        difficult for him to save his life. At this time, he must not proceed at
        will.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It‚Äôs because she thinks that you look like a dog with nothing to do."
        Yet at this moment. In the void, a playful voice suddenly sounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who is it? Come out, don't play tricks in front of me!" Zhao Yiyao was
        stunned for a moment, but when he reacted, his face sank, and he stared
        vigilantly at the void in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sudden sound made him uneasy, and a chill ran down his back. All
        kinds of thoughts flashed in his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        He subconsciously felt that someone was following him. Could it be that
        on the way, their every move was actually being watched?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Come out? I'm behind you." However, in the next moment, the voice
        sounded again, causing Zhao Yiyao's scalp to explode.
      </p>
      <p>
        An unprecedented sense of terror enveloped his entire body! His body
        went cold, and his soul trembled. However, before he could turn around,
        he felt that his eyes were dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying black light poured down instantly, completely drowning
        his whole being. Then he lost consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sure enough, the sayings are never wrong. In this world, no licking dog
        is innocent." You're even making some crooked ideas, that's why you
        can't leave her." Gu Changge's figure appeared in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        The look on his face was slightly intriguing. Now, what he was supposed
        to do was almost done. When Zhao Yiyao died, the disciples of the Ru
        Sheng Academy were bound to be furious. Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on

      </p>
      <p>
        He had already set up this stage for Su Qingge, even if she didn't want
        to go in, it was impossible. However, what surprised Gu Changge was that
        Su Qingge's actions from beginning to end did not look like the
        inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it could be understood that Su Qingge was very clever, and
        her camouflage had no flaws.
      </p>
      <p>"Qingge, I used to love you so much, don't let me down."</p>
      <p>
        Then, with a little deep meaning on the corner of his mouth, Gu
        Changge's figure disappeared again.

      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>In the abandoned ruins, the atmosphere seemed very depressing.</p>
      <p>
        "Brother Zhao has been chasing Miss Su for so long, why hasn't he come
        back? Could it be that he accompanied Miss Su to kill Heavenly
        Extinction creatures‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"But if that's the case, it's time to come back!"</p>
      <p>
        "Probably not. Brother Zhao couldn't have left us here. Could it be that
        there was an accident?"
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been half a day since Zhao Yiyao left to go after Su Qingge.
        However, the disciples of the Ru Sheng Academy who were resting in the
        ruins had not seen Zhao Yiyao come back for a long time, which made them
        feel uneasy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many disciples opened their mouths one after another, with worried
        expressions on their faces, looking outside from time to time, wanting
        to see Zhao Yiyao's figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for the vast gray fog and the roaring creatures, there was no
        movement. This made their hearts sink continuously, and they felt that
        things were getting worse. Logically, no matter what he was doing, Zhao
        Yiyao should come back at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But no, he disappeared without a trace like a cow of mud entering the
        sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that Senior Brother Zhao really had an accident?" Thinking
        of this, the face of a female disciple suddenly turned pale, and it was
        difficult for her to accept this result.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Impossible, Senior Brother Zhao is so powerful and has so many divine
        weapons, how could he have an accident‚Ä¶ Let's wait‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Brother Zhao, he‚Ä¶ will he encounter the inheritor of demonic art?"</p>
      <p>
        Someone's voice couldn't help trembling, thinking of all the rumors
        during this time. The existence of the inheritor of demonic art was not
        a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, although the inheritor of demonic arts was forced to retreat
        by Gu Changge, it was very likely that he had not left the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield, and had been lurking in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, all of them felt that it was actually dangerous. It was not
        impossible for Senior Brother Zhao to encounter the inheritor of demonic
        art.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You said, will that girl Su have something to do with the inheritor of
        demonic art? You see, she doesn't leave early or late, but she leaves at
        this time, leaving Senior Brother Zhao alone to chase her!"
      </p>
      <p>"Yeah, I knew she's not a good person at first glance!"</p>
      <p>
        "I think that she can't get rid of this matter! This time, it's really a
        coincidence."
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment, thinking of this, all the disciples were excited, very
        angry and hated. In any case, this matter was inseparable from that of
        Miss Su. If it wasn't for her, how could Senior Brother Zhao have an
        accident?
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the sudden disappearance of the second senior brother of the Ru
        Sheng Academy caused a huge uproar in this Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this second senior brother from the Ru Sheng Academy was not as
        good as those Ancient freaks. But he was also a well-known young
        supreme, and he was famous for one party, so he disappeared without a
        sound, and not even the slightest ripple was seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was really shocking and disturbing. If it was said that if he
        encountered a powerful and invincible Heavenly Extinction being, it was
        bound to leave traces of battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he didn't, nothing was left, as if he disappeared out of thin air.
        In this way, many people were terrified.

      <p>The inheritor of demonic art!</p>
      <p>
        Almost immediately, many people thought of these five words! Besides the
        inheritor of demonic art, who else had such means?
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, in the narration of the disciples of the Ru Sheng Academy,
        all the signs pointed out that this matter was inseparable from the
        white-clothed woman surnamed Su.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a time, this Heavenly Extinction Battlefield was silent for a long
        time, and another major earthquake occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many young beings, in anger, set off one after another, and
        spontaneously searched for the woman in white, and wanted to give
        justice to Zhao Yiyao of the Ru Sheng Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entrances to this Heavenly Extinction Battlefield were also
        controlled and guarded by many young cultivators to prevent the
        inheritor of demonic art from leaving.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eldest disciple of the Ru Sheng Academy was named Jun Gou. He was a
        handsome, thin young man who looked like a thin scholar. But those who
        knew him would not dare to underestimate him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because at the time of Jun Gou's birth, three spiritual energies
        descended from the heavens, which were gathered in his body, and his
        every move triggered a great Dao power.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brush strokes become mountains, the strokes become seas, and all
        kinds of mysterious methods were jaw-dropping.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Junior brother died and was assassinated by the inheritor of demonic
        art!"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, his expression was very gloomy and angry, with killing
        intent surging.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Senior Brother, you want to get justice for Senior Brother Zhao! If it
        wasn't for the woman in white surnamed Su, Senior Brother Zhao would not
        be like this‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside Jun Gou, a female disciple cried, looking very sad. In her words,
        there was a deep hatred for Su Qingge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that Miss Su is absolutely inseparable from the inheritor of
        demonic art!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Senior brother, we have to find her quickly, and we might find some
        clues! Find the clues of Senior Brother Zhao‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, Senior Brother, if the teacher blames us, we will have an
        explanation!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the disciples also opened their mouths one after another,
        asking the elder brother Jun Gou to call the shots for Zhao Yiyao, who
        was assassinated. All of them would be punished if they didn't explain
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if this matter had nothing to do with Miss Su, she must be arrested
        to explain.
      </p>
      <p>"I understand, the enmity of the junior brother must be explained."</p>
      <p>
        "Whether it was the work of the inheritor of demonic arts, this matter
        is indeed inseparable from the woman in white!"
      </p>
      <p>
        After a moment of silence, Jun Gou couldn't help but nod with a cold
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time. A disciple from Ru Sheng Academy suddenly came to report
        and said excitedly, "Senior Brother, we have found that woman in white,
        she is at the exit of the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, and is now
        intercepted by us."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, all the disciples here could not help but reveal their
        hatred, but more or less they also breathed a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p>"That's just right!"</p>
      <p>"Let's go! I think it's hard for her to escape now!"</p>
      <p>
        Jun Gou took the lead and got up with an icy cold look and a killing
        aura, leading a group of disciples and going away in a mighty manner to
        give justice to his dead senior disciple.

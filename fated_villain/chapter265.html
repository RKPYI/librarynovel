          Battlefield had just appeared, grey fog billowed from the sky. Eternal
          Overcast creatures gathered below, eyes red and fangs protruding from
          their mouths. Many resemble humans, but for most of them, their
          original races were no longer discernible. Terrifying energy flowed
          through their bodies; most of them were in the True Enlightened
          Realm.</span

          glittering jewellery, were fighting with the group. They looked
          unique, wearing similar outfits since they belonged to a certain great
          sect.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As they fought, lights flashed and illuminated the sky; the sound of
          it was enough to shake the land. Their godly weapons and artefacts
          glimmered in various colours as they cut through the air toward the
          enemy. The power contained within the light was as powerful as that
          released when stars exploded, killing off large swathes of the
          creatures. Mountains collapsed and were reduced to dust under the
          onslaught of power.</span

          Principles of the World seem to dangle from their clothes, and their
          secret techniques came in various forms. This allowed them to easily
          fight off those even in the Enlightened Noble Realm. The most
          eye-catching one out of them was a refined-looking young man clad in a
          pale blue robe. He resembled a scholar, with his shiny clear folding
          fan. As he waved it, runes flew from between its folds and transformed
          into colourful winds which rushed forward towards the enemy.</span

          large groups of Eternal Overcast creatures standing in its way were
          immediately consumed. The youths standing beside the man started
          praising him, and several female disciples sent him respectful and
          admiring glances.</span

          Saint School. His power is comparable to Big Brother, and they may get
          a similar number of points in the Eternal Overcast

          couldn&#8217;t help their reverence. The man they called Brother Zhao
          barely hid a smile at this and shook his head.

          level. Please don&#8217;t flatter me so much.&#8221; His tone was
          humble and easygoing, eliciting another wave of praise which he waved
          off helplessly. The man was Zhao Xiaoyao, the second highest-ranking
          disciple in the Confucian Saint School and considered a genius among
          the younger generation.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Confucian Saint School was an extremely old sect which focused on
          cultivating the Qi of scholars. Their most powerful could easily
          shatter the heavens with a breath of Scholarly Qi. Even if Zhao
          Xiaoyao was in the True Enlightenment Realm and not as great as those
          ancient monstrosities preserved within the sect, his power was still
          considered top among his peers. So, he was tasked with leading his
          group inside the Eternal Overcast Battlefield.</span

      <p>

          >&#8220;Oh yes, Lady Su. Where did you learn your techniques from?
          Your techniques look foreign to me. Even though they seem powerful,
          they feel a little guerilla-like,&#8221; Zhao Xiaoyao asked curiously,
          looking towards a veiled woman in white who was standing near the back
          of the crowd. He had noticed her when they fought against the Eternal
          Overcast creatures and thus observed her unusual techniques. Since
          they differed from the ones used by the forces he knew of, this piqued
          his interest.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had followed his group into the Eternal Overcast Battlefield, and
          he had invited her to join them as she was alone and didn&#8217;t look
          strong enough. That was because he had pitied her, and also they could
          look out for each other as well. After all, the Eternal Overcast
          Battlefield was dangerous compared to the outside world, the extremely
          strong Yin Energy from the Eternal Overcast being part of the reason.
          Not to mention, the Eternal Overcast creatures and the hidden
          Successor of Demonic Arts, who were far more dangerous.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This woman did not have a partner, and she might not be able to deal
          with a bigger group of Eternal Overcast creatures in an encounter.
          There were also many other dangers here too, yet she had dared to come
          here all alone. This changed his view of her a little.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many other disciples, though, misunderstood his intentions. They
          thought he had invited her to join them just because he was interested
          in her. Zhao Xiaoyao felt helpless, but he did not argue with
          them.</span

          Xiaoyao smiled at that. “With your superior techniques, you should be

          expert.”</span

          casual disciple of some old master, who taught her a few things and
          left.</span

          came from their conversations in the battlefield, as she seemed
          dignified and always maintained a distance of at least one metre from
          anyone she spoke to. This practice was similar to that in
          Confucianism. Besides, he sensed that her physicality was unique,

          Zhao Xiaoyao&#8217;s life philosophy, character, and behaviour were
          considered extremely proper. So many prodigal damsels had gone after
          him but had never had their feelings returned. Yet, here, he was,
          paying this much attention to Lady Su just after three days of knowing
          her. Any observant person would know what he thought about her.
          However, the woman didn&#8217;t seem to mind it, feigning ignorance
          although she already knew this. This made them more jealous. [Why

          alone, but considering the incalculable danger in the Eternal Overcast
          Battlefield, it might be more convenient to go with some company. That
          was why she had accepted his invitation. She could naturally sense his
          liking towards her yet did not say anything about it. After all, Zhao

          pace, massacring all the surrounding Eternal Overcast creatures.
          Towards the end, however, they were already tiring. It was partly due
          to the more concentrated Yin Energy wearing them out, and partly since
          the Eternal Overcast creatures were already in the Enlightened Noble
          or even Enlightened King Realm. Meanwhile, many in the group were only
          in the Partial-Enlightened Realm and were much weaker even with their

          spectacle. Many of them knew that the second-highest ranking disciple
          of the School had been killed by the Successor of Demonic Arts, and
          the incident might be linked to this woman. He had disappeared when

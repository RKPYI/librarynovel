          &#8220;I wonder from which force they are from. Looks like it&#8217;ll
          be harder to obtain the Tower of World Domination.&#8221;</span

          her brother&#8217;s words. What she worried most now was what their
          families would do if this mystery group swooped in after the Tower of
          World Domination emerged. After all, judging from this display, it was
          obvious that they were from a force that was far from average, and it
          troubled the Ji siblings.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Tower of World Domination was linked to the Immortal Palace
          Treasury, and if their family wanted to regain its former glory, they
          had to find it. Naturally, they wouldn&#8217;t be willing to hand the
          keys to the Immortal Palace Treasury to someone else so easily.</span

          curiosity. She had a different opinion. To her, the Tower of World
          Domination was indeed important, but it was just another artifact.
          Even if it had to do with the Immortal Palace Treasury, one had to
          gather all Seven Tools of World Domination first, and that would be
          tantamount to finding a needle in a haystack. It was an indescribably
          difficult task.</span

          having heard what was going on outside, asked with great interest as
          he put his teacup down.</span

      <p>

          >&#8220;Not interested.&#8221; Yue Mingkong shook her head, looking
          somewhat lazy as she leaned towards one side of the sofa. The fringe
          hanging in front of her forehead made her less impassive and more
          aloof and at peace with the world.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Actually, he had Yin Mei look into the Hidden Ji Family some time
          ago, and the main reason was that he believed Ji Qingxuan was
          ambitious by nature. She had the goal to never allow the Hidden Ji
          Family to threaten her ever again.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, he helped plant a seed of ambition, just waiting for the right
          time for it to sprout. At that time, he expected Ji Qingxuan would
          never let go of a perfect opportunity he provided. Not when she was so
          power-hungry.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Coincidentally, the chance to control the Hidden Ji Family had
          presented itself, and it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be bad to obtain
          another pawn, either.</span

          >After Gu Changge stepped out of the palace, Ji Yaoxing and the others
          turned grim as their pupils shrank, aghast. &#8220;Gu Changge… How can
          it be him out of all people!? What is he doing here!?&#8221;

          incredulity. It was precisely because everyone knew who the young man
          was that they were shocked.</span

          >&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge. I&#8217;m Ji Chuyue.&#8221;
          The young woman, whose gaze was brightly lit, also hurriedly
          introduced herself after coming to her senses.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >None of them had expected to see Gu Changge here. After all, they had
          all heard he had returned to the Immortal Academy after just having
          obliterated Purple Mansion.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          with some influence would have seen his portrait even if they had
          never seen him in person, all to avoid crossing him by accident.
          Needless to say, after the obliterating Purple Mansion, Gu
          Changge&#8217;s reputation in the Upper Realm had reached an
          unprecedented peak. Not even the Sky Emperors, Buddha, or Supreme
          Beings had ever reached such influence when they were young.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the other hand, Chen Ning&#8217;er forced her thumping heart to
          calm down, then pulled the sweetest smile she could. Or at least she
          thought she did, and greeted Gu Changge gracefully, &#8220;Greetings,
          Young Master Changge.&#8221;</span

          >If there was any household name amongst the young prodigies in the
          Upper Realm, it would be Gu Changge. Thus, Chen Ning&#8217;er was so
          stoked that her voice quivered involuntarily when she saw the man in
          question standing before her. In the past, she had only ever seen him
          in portraits and photographic stones, never like this in person. It
          was no exaggeration to say that he was the perfect husband to many
          prodigal damsels in the Upper Realm. Be it looks, temperament,
          prowess, talent, influence, or background, none was flawed, and there
          was no other man who could match him. Of course, they all knew just
          where they stood and only dared dream about it, knowing well that they
          were far from deserving to be his other half.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >&#8220;So, you have come too, Young Master Changge. I knew it
          wouldn&#8217;t be some average man when there was such a grand display
          around.&#8221; Ji Yaoxing smiled bitterly within, feeling the chances
          of seizing the Tower of World Domination slipping away. Of course, he
          would not give up just because Gu Changge was here. Nonetheless, when
          compared to the latter, he knew he paled in comparison. Furthermore,
          Gu Changge had so many powerful followers with him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now, he could only hope to find the Tower&#8217;s location before it
          emerged. That way, Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t gain much of an upper
          hand and snatch it from him. Nonetheless, if he could not do so, he
          also had another plan. If Gu Changge was truly hell-bent on obtaining
          the Tower of World Domination, he could also make it a gift to
          him.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Yaoxing was just, not dumb. It hardly needed to be said just how
          horrifically powerful Gu Changge had become at this point when he
          could even obliterate Purple Mansion.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Head of Heavenly Ruin Gate and the others were gobsmacked as
          well. They were having a hard time believing what they were seeing,
          thinking this was all a dream. Even though they were provincial, it
          didn&#8217;t mean that they didn&#8217;t know who Gu Changge was. But
          someone like him only lived in legends to people like them.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even now, their heads were buzzing, unable to calm down. Their
          attitude was also servile to the T, for they were even beneath a
          speckle of dust to great characters like Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >&#8220;Are all of you also here for the Tower of World
          Domination?&#8221; asked Gu Changge with a smile.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ll be honest with you, Young Master Changge, we have
          indeed come for the Tower. It&#8217;s just that we don&#8217;t know
          where it is even until now,&#8221; verified Ji Yaoxing with a wry
          smile.</span

          would you mind telling me? I&#8217;m willing to pay with a handsome
          reward,&#8221; offered Gu Changge with a smile still, his figure tall
          and slender, and his robe fluttering, making him look saintly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >&#8220;We will most certainly let you know if we find anything, Young
          Master Changge,&#8221; Ji Chuyue spoke up then, sizing the man up with
          brightly lit eyes. And to leave a good impression on Gu Changge, she
          even revealed her true facial features. Her small face, fair and
          flawless; eyes, big and bright; lashes, long; brows, attractively
          thin. She was like a free elf in the woods, looking like a gift from
          the world.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I shall give you my thanks then,&#8221; said Gu Changge
          casually with a smile, not behaving lofty at all. Yet, everyone could
          sense the stark differences in their status, as such otherworldly
          mannerisms and innate holiness and nobility couldn&#8217;t be fostered
          without deep, horrific hidden power.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Rest assured, Young Master Changge. I will inform you as soon
          as I receive any news or clues,&#8221; Chen Ning&#8217;er hurriedly
          promised against her wildly thumping heart. &#8220;Since you&#8217;re
          also searching for the Tower of World Domination, Young Master
          Changge, I shall order my men to search it for you as well.

          and flawless skin, and her eyes were clear like the autumn river in
          contrast to her red lips. A stunning woman. And a shrewd one, too, for
          she instantly expressed her thoughts and made her stance clear.</span

          Hidden Ji Family. With insufficient might, Chen Ning&#8217;er

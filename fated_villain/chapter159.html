        <h4>Chapter 159: Not A Human; Dare To Calculate The Ancient Deity.</h4>
        <p> Gu Changge was intrigued. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Even after cutting ties with Chi Ling, Ye Ling still has more than 5,000 Fortune Value?’</i> </p>
        <p> Truth be told, he hadn’t expected this. </p>
        <p> However, back when he killed Long Teng, he had already experimented with the Fortune Plundering Card, which
            turned out to be quite the success. </p>
        <p> Naturally, he was planning to replicate this success. </p>
        <p> Although Gu Changge still had many methods to attack Ye Ling and decrease his Fortune Value, it was no
            longer necessary. </p>
        <p> Such methods were far too complicated than they needed to be. </p>
        <p> <strong>[Kill the Favoured Son of Heaven, Ye Ling. Rewards: 3,000 Fortune Value and 15,000 Destiny Points.
                Additional rewards will be settled separately.]</strong> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge looked at the system prompt message. </p>
        <p> <i>‘In addition to the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation’s Inheritance, it seems I’ll also get a large amount
                of Fortune Value.’</i> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was already counting the money he’d make off killing Ye Ling. </p>
        <p> The thought of Ye Ling’s escape didn’t even occur to him. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Gu Changge, you liar!”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“I won’t go down without a fight!”</strong> </p>
        <p> As he heard Gu Changge’s words, Ye Ling was taken aback. He didn’t expect Gu Changge to say such words as he
            furiously responded. </p>
        <p> <i>‘I’ll carry the black pot even in death?’</i> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling felt a chill on his back. </p>
        <p> But then… anger, boundless anger and hatred overcame the chill right after. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Damn it all! Gu Changge is too vicious. Even if I tore him apart with a thousand swords and broke his
                body into pieces, it wouldn’t be enough to resolve this grievance.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Can’t he just let me off if I die?’</i> </p>
        <p> At that moment, Ye Ling’s body was filled with a monstrous black-divine light, rising out of thin air and
            taking the form of a dragon. </p>
        <p> It radiated a great might that took on the form of dense iron scales and intertwining divine runes that held
            a profound meaning. </p>
        <p> At the same time, a brilliant white light intertwined, taking the form of a divine phoenix about to take
            flight as it opened its mouth to let out a scream! </p>
        <p> <strong>Roar!</strong> </p>
        <p> The black dragon also stood with its head high, letting out an earth-shattering roar that shook the four
            directions! </p>
        <p> This was the true face of Reincarnation. Black and white, life and death alternating with one another… this
            was the cycle, and it contained immense power. </p>
        <p> Even those in the Heavenly God Realm would not dare face it so casually. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Why do you people like that line so much? What about me makes me a liar?”</strong> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s expression remained unchanged as he indifferently smiled, <strong>“But perhaps the only way to
                make you believe is to convince you with force?”</strong> </p>
        <p> With a wave of his sleeves, he stood in the air. </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!</strong> </p>
        <p> He lifted his palm and pressed downward! </p>
        <p> A giant palm suddenly covered the sky. </p>
        <p> In the middle of the fog were runes rising and falling with the weight of millions. Like a palm that came
            from the very heavens, the void began to distort as if threatening to break at any moment. </p>
        <p> Such terrible power made Ye Ling’s heart throb, his complexion changing drastically. </p>
        <p> It was simply an absurd number of runes. </p>
        <p> Its wielder would’ve required a deep and profound understanding of various methods and techniques, among
            which were the great powers of heaven and earth as they gathered in the blink of an eye. </p>
        <p> But most importantly, the very laws of the world seemed to have been embedded within! </p>
        <p> <strong>Puff!</strong> </p>
        <p> Regardless of the might possessed by the Power of Reincarnation, it was instantly shattered by these laws.
        </p>
        <p> The divine phoenix and the black dragon let out a sudden scream as they were instantly crushed by Gu
            Changge’s palm! </p>
        <p> <strong>“We’ve never even met before, so why?”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling’s face turned pale as he desperately tried to escape the range of this palm… only to find that the
            void had long since stagnated. It was like sinking into a puddle of mud. </p>
        <p> The chill on his back intensified. </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <p> At such a crucial moment, Ye Ling crushed a rune as the power of the Sacred Realm suddenly appeared. The
            natural laws and order of the world[1] intertwined as an explosion swept Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> <i>[1. Power of Rules and Power of Order respectively.]</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Boring.”</strong> </p>
        <p> At this moment, Gu Changge’s smile began to dim as his eyes grew colder. </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!</strong> </p>
        <p> Accompanied by a vast and terrifying demonic energy, the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd appeared in his palm
            like a wicked demon beyond compare that had just broken through the gates of hell. </p>
        <p> It conveyed joy… even excitement. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge indifferently gazed at Ye Ling. </p>
        <p> <strong>Whoosh!</strong> </p>
        <p> With a sweep of his halberd, a horrifying demonic light surged, entangled with the strands of jet-black
            chains of law. </p>
        <p> <strong>“This is….”</strong> </p>
        <p> The Old Turtle in the pendant became horrified as he even trembled a bit. He knew what this peerless weapon
            was. </p>
        <p> He did not expect it to fall into the hands of Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> <strong>Puff!</strong> </p>
        <p> In an instant, the void in front of Ye Ling exploded. He let out a miserable scream as the rune he used was
            completely annihilated. </p>
        <p> The terrifying Qi released by this weapon had crushed his bones as they burst into nothing but bloody ashes.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>“This power exceeds that of an ordinary being in the Sacred Realm.” </strong>The Old Turtle’s voice
            trembled. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Ye Ling, use that! If you hesitate, you will die here today!”</strong>
        </p>
        <p> Ye Ling had never heard the Old Turtle so scared out of its wits. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge wasn’t surprised that the halberd wasn’t enough to kill Ye Ling. </p>
        <p> For a Favoured Son of Heaven, it was only natural for him to have so many life-saving treasures. </p>
        <p> However, today… Ye Ling won’t be able to escape his death </p>
        <p> Gu Changge giggled maniacally. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Let’s see how much you can take…”</strong> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge radiated devilish energy as his eyes darkened. </p>
        <p> His power surged like a great demonic sun as the stars trembled. </p>
        <p> He swept down again as the space in front of him tore apart as easily as paper. </p>
        <p> <strong>“How?!”</strong> Ye Ling felt desperate as he panicked, covered in his own blood. </p>
        <p> His entire body was engulfed by the halberd’s light as the Seven-Colored Divine Armor was smashed to bits in
            an instant. </p>
        <p> That armour could withstand the strikes of most beings in the Sacred Realm! </p>
        <p> In other words, the strike that Gu Changge had just demonstrated was at the level of the Great Sacred Realm.
        </p>
        <p> When he thought of this, Ye Ling’s soul had nearly left his body as the very idea of resistance seemed
            futile. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was part of the younger generation, just like he was, and yet… he held such unfathomable power.
        </p>
        <p> <i>‘Could this be the true terror of the Forbidden Demonic Arts?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘It is far too unbelievable… and far too sinister.’</i> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling paled, unable to believe what he was witnessing. </p>
        <p> But he heard the Old Turtle’s words. </p>
        <p> Ye Ling didn’t want to die. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Master, save me!”</strong> </p>
        <p> He roared and tried his best to spur an ancient golden rune, even going as far as to burn up Blood Essence!
        </p>
        <p> Near his Sea of Consciousness, there was an apparent bright light coming from his soul. </p>
        <p> This was the strongest life-saving method that the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation had left for him. </p>
        <p> But at this moment, Ye Ling couldn’t care less. </p>
        <p> If he doesn’t use it, his death at the hands of Gu Changge would be set in stone. </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!</strong> </p>
        <p> The golden rune ignited by Ye Ling spewed out a terrifying brilliance… as if something within had been
            brought back to life. </p>
        <p> At this moment, the Immortal Cave and the abode within shook as a strange noise was heard. </p>
        <p> As the golden rune ignited, there was a twist in the void. </p>
        <p> A monstrous black-divine light spread as though a black sun had begun to rise. </p>
        <p> A tall hazy figure appeared as if walking across the ages. </p>
        <p> His eyes were terrifying, taking forms similar to a black sun and white moon… as if an ancient being had
            descended. </p>
        <p> The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation appeared. </p>
        <p> Though it was but a mere phantom who did not know how many years had passed, his eyes had a profound depth.
        </p>
        <p> His breath rose and fell, enough to blur the void to make it seem like it was about to collapse. </p>
        <p> A monstrous pressure descended. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge estimates that the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation was an ancient existence that was on a whole
            different level! </p>
        <p> How wonderful! </p>
        <p> Though it was but a mere phantom, it was tyrannical to the point of being able to sweep away even those in
            the Great Sacred Realm! </p>
        <p> <strong>“Master, save me!”</strong> </p>
        <p> The moment he saw this tall figure, Ye Ling couldn’t help but smile as he shouted excitedly. </p>
        <p> Hope had been restored. </p>
        <p> <strong>“My Lord!” </strong> </p>
        <p> The Old Turtle in the pendant shouted excitedly as well. </p>
        <p> “The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation…” Yin Mei’s expression changed slightly, glancing at Gu Changge with a
            bit of worry. </p>
        <p> After all, this was a being that had existed since the Immortal Period. His name was part of history. It was
            even said that the one who controls Reincarnation, the one who understands it, will become immortal. </p>
        <p> However, Gu Changge showed not even the slightest change of expression, making her breathe a sigh of relief.
        </p>
        <p> “Fool…” </p>
        <p> The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation snorted with disgust. </p>
        <p> Ye Ling was the first to see the immeasurable disappointment that this figure had the moment he appeared.
        </p>
        <p> Even if it was but a shadow of his former self, he quickly understood the current situation. </p>
        <p> The current heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation had used this last resort against a young man of the
            same generation. </p>
        <p> To be honest, he was very disappointed. </p>
        <p> “Little turtle, you disappoint me too much.” </p>
        <p> He looked at the Old Turtle in the pendant and spoke, without paying attention to Gu Changge on the other
            side. </p>
        <p> He was a shadow of his former self, and though he was not the real body, to kill a junior was… humiliating.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>“My Lord…”</strong> Old Turtle guiltily replied, knowing why it was that he was so disappointed.
        </p>
        <p> However, this was a complicated matter, and Gu Changge’s strength was not what it seemed. </p>
        <p> The most important thing was that the Ancient Deity had yet to notice the true identity of the Gu Changge in
            front of him. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Master…”</strong> Ye Ling’s teeth were chattering. </p>
        <p> However, he was confident. </p>
        <p> No matter how powerful Gu Changge was, can he fight against the legendary figures of the Immortal Period?
        </p>
        <p> Even he didn’t know that the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation had left such a phantom in that golden rune.
        </p>
        <p> If he knew, he would’ve never been so humiliated. </p>
        <p> <i>‘But the tables have turned, now…’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘It’s Gu Changge’s turn to taste dispair.’</i> </p>
        <p> However, Ye Ling couldn’t believe it… Gu Changge didn’t even blink. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Does he not care?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Is he just pretending, or is he truly as confident as he appears?’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation… a pity that it’s just an illusion.”</strong> </p>
        <p> At this moment, Gu Changge spoke up and inspected the phantom in front of him with a bit of regret. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Huh? Junior, you dare test me?”</strong> </p>
        <p> When he heard this, the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation’s deeply profound eyes turned indifferent as he
            stared at Gu Changge. His majestic and terrifying breath threatened to break free of its restraints and
            crush all living beings. </p>
        <p> In the outside world, there were hardly anyone with the ability to put up any form of meaningful resistance.
        </p>
        <p> And in this space, he was the absolute master. </p>
        <p> And yet, Gu Changge continued to have such an indifferent attitude. He smiled and replied,<strong> “Test
                you? No, I’m afraid you overestimate yourself.”</strong> </p>
        <p> It was only natural that he had already considered every possibility beforehand. </p>
        <p> The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation keeping such a hand for Ye Ling was well within his expectation. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was in no hurry. </p>
        <p> After all, everything was well under control. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Junior…”</strong> </p>
        <p> The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation showed a gloomy face. Never before had he ever been looked down upon.
        </p>
        <p> Moreover, the person was a mere junior. Although he was meant to be nothing more than an aloof phantom, he
            too contained emotions. </p>
        <p> As he raised his hand to destroy Gu Changge… he saw the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd in Gu Changge’s hand.
            His pupils suddenly shrank. </p>
        <p> The more powerful one was, the more they learned about this ominous object. </p>
        <p> Such origins were too shocking! </p>
        <p> He hadn’t noticed until now, but he couldn’t help it. </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!</strong> </p>
        <p> At that moment, the void in front of him blurred as the very space began to fill with the power of the
            rules. </p>
        <p> The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation was taken aback, surprised at the realisation that – at this moment… he
            was imprisoned. </p>
        <p> <strong>“You’re quite the optimistic one, aren’t you?”</strong> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge asked with a faint smile as he vanished. </p>
        <p> The next moment, his figure reappeared in front of Ye Ling. </p>
        <p> The Eight Desolate Demon Halberd fell, its peerless edge and surging demonic energy enough to drown out
            every inch of the void. </p>
        <p> <strong>“What-”</strong> </p>
        <p> Ye Ling’s relieved face suddenly went pale as his eyes widened. He was frightened. </p>
        <p> At this moment, his soul had practically frozen over. </p>
        <p> Ye Ling shouted, his face grim and desperate. </p>
        <p> <strong>“MASTER, PLEASE SAVE ME! I DON’T WANT TO DIE!”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“I’M NOT READY, THERE’S STILL SO MUCH FOR ME TO DO, I-”</strong> </p>
        <p> But Gu Changge didn’t even give him a chance to react. </p>
        <p> In the next moment, the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd fell, shattering the void. </p>
        <p> With a chuckle, the despairing and unwilling Ye Ling was reduced to a mere mist of blood, body and soul
            obliterated! </p>
        <p> <strong>“Your heir is vulnerable.”</strong> Gu Changge looked at the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation with a
            faint smile. </p>
        <p> <strong>“You dare, Junior?! You must be </strong><strong><i>COURTING DEATH!”</i></strong> </p>
        <p> The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation finally reacted, and he was furious. </p>
        <p> To kill his heir right in front of him, such courage was simply unmatched. </p>
        <p> <i>‘This junior is </i><strong><i>COURTING DEATH</i></strong><i>!’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Even though he is the master of such an ominous weapon, such a thing is unacceptable!’</i> </p>
        <p> A vast and ferocious Qi, like the blue sky, fell as he attacked Gu Changge with murderous intent. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Please do not worry, Ancient Deity. I will make sure you accompany your beloved heir.”</strong> Gu
            Changge still faintly smiled. </p>
        <p> From within his sleeves emerged a black bottle the size of his palm. </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!</strong> </p>
        <p> At the same time, he thought something in his mind. </p>
        <p> In the void, a lacquer black rune suddenly flickered as if it were branded with hot iron, firmly sealing the
            void where the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation was located. </p>
        <p> These black runes contained a strange power, shackles that permeated every inch of the void. </p>
        <p> A black mist gradually rose. </p>
        <p> <strong>“The Immortal Devouring Demonic Arts…”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“You are…”</strong> </p>
        <p> At that moment, the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation looked like he had been hit. </p>
        <p> He couldn’t believe it, especially when he saw the black bottle emerge from Gu Changge’s sleeves. </p>
        <p> He didn’t dare look down on Gu Changge anymore. </p>
        <p> <i>‘He is the Inheritor of the Immortal-Devouring Demonic Arts!’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Is this guy still human? He even considered Ancient Deity’s phantom in his plan… how
                horrible.”</strong> </p>
        <p> The Old Turtle in the pendant was not dead. It couldn’t help but shake uncontrollably as it watched this
            scene. </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!</strong> </p>
        <p> Soon, in the void ahead, dense black runes spread. </p>
        <p> The black haze rose and turned pitch black, covering all directions! </p>
        <p> Gu Changge held the Black Dao Bottle as his figure was engulfed by it! </p>
        <p> Strange emotions came forth… anger, regret, and disbelief as the Old Turtle’s heart trembled! </p>
        <p> The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation, his once invincibile master! </p>
        <p> Even the slightest wisp of a phantom was so powerful and terrifying that it could destroy entire galaxies
            with a thought! Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)</p>
        <p> And yet, such a horrifying being that went beyond heaven and earth was being toyed with by a member of the
            younger generation as it screamed with desperation. </p>
        <p> So shocking and so terrifying… if this matter were to spread, it was bound to cause disastrous waves! </p>
        <p> And soon, the fluctuations disappeared as the black fog and frost covering the square disappeared. </p>
        <p> The large Dao Rune disappeared. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge calmly walked out. From underneath his sleeves, the Black Dao Bottle disappeared with a flash,
            revealing no signs of abnormality. </p>
        <p> As for the phantom of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation… it too disappeared.</p>

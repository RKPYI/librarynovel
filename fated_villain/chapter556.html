          >Silence fell over everyone as the scene unfolded before them. Even
          people from the An Clan, who had a history with Gu Changge, did not
          dare to stand up for Jiang Chen. His recent actions were simply too
          rash, foolish, and ambitious.</span

          >Despite having limited authority and influence as a mere Successor of
          a Divine Source Master, he tried to convince everyone to covet Gu
          Changge’s Heavenly Tome. How else could his action be described if not
          foolish?</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The others were not stupid either. Who would risk offending Gu
          Changge by siding with Jiang Chen at this time? Such a notion of
          righteousness was no different than stupidity.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Are you alright, Ah’Chen?” Niu Tian rushed to help Jiang Chen up and
          asked with concern. He couldn’t comprehend why Jiang Chen had spoken
          those words to Gu Changge just now, as it was a stark contrast to the
          composed and collected Jiang Chen he knew.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Niu Tian was unaware of the situation between Jiang Chen and Xiao
          Ruoyin. Jiang Chen felt deeply humiliated by the event and never
          mentioned it to Niu Tian. Thus, Niu Tian believed that it was merely
          Jiang Chen’s anger that had clouded his judgment, prompting him to
          speak out.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I’m fine.” Jiang Chen struggled to stand up from the ground, his
          body wracked with pain. He looked pitiful as he wiped the blood from
          the corner of his mouth and shook his head, feeling deeply
          humiliated.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen tightly clenched his fists, watching Gu Changge walk away
          with a disdainful and indifferent attitude. His face contorted in
          frustration as the situation was completely out of his
          expectation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Initially, his intention was to irritate Gu Changge, seeking revenge
          for his lost love. However, the response he received from everyone was
          entirely different from what he had anticipated. With his mind clouded
          by jealousy, he was thinking too naively about this world’s morality.
          The extent of people’s fear toward Gu Changge far surpassed his
          expectations.</span

          >“Go take a break, the other Seven Divine Rocks have not appeared yet.
          Not to mention, the Cursed Rock” An Xi, the Young War Immortal and the
          others approached Jiang Chen, expressing their concern.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >An Xi was there the whole time but did not intervene because she was
          fully aware that any attempt to do so could result in a similar
          outcome as what happened to her deceased Uncle. Lecturing Gu Changge?
          She had no idea where Jiang Chen found the courage to do that just
          now. No one probably dared to speak to Gu Changge in such a manner
          except Jiang Chen.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She couldn’t really call Jiang Chen naive. It was clear that he had
          some sort of scheme when he took the moral high ground and irritated
          Gu Changge. It was an attempt that not many would dare to even
          consider.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He totally deserved that.”</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a fool.”</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Phoenix Lady, the King with Six Crowns and other young prodigies
          glanced at Jiang Chen, unimpressed. They even expressed their contempt
          through subtle head shakes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >From the very beginning, they had doubts about this ‘Divine Source
          Master’. Witnessing the incident today only solidified their belief
          that Jiang Chen’s reputation did not align with his behavior. Other
          than stupid, they had no other words for his recent behavior. Even if
          he was blinded by jealousy, he should not have said such words.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To many, what had just occurred was a minor incident. Even so, it had
          caused a significant decrease in Jiang Chen&#8217;s reputation as the
          Divine Source Master. This was particularly true for those who
          believed that Jiang Chen’s actions had offended Gu Changge.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Offending Gu Changge meant it would be difficult for Jiang Chen to
          gain a foothold in the Upper Realm as he would face many restrictions.
          The Forces that previously considered collaborating with Jiang Chen
          now had doubts.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Compared to the Immortal Foetus of the Seven Divine Rocks being cut
          open, news of the birth of the enigmatic Heavenly Tome spread even
          more rapidly, causing a commotion throughout the Upper Realm.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was impossible for the Heavenly Tome, which was extracted from a
          rock worth a hundred Immortal Crystals, to be an ordinary book. If the
          Heavenly Tome was in someone other than Gu Changge’s possession, a
          never-ending bloodbath would have already started.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was at this time, some cultivators noticed a group of ominous
          black clouds that spanned nearly ten thousand miles. These clouds
          originated from the sea near Devil Mountain and traveled towards Dark
          Kun City, covering the sky and blocking out the sun. The clouds were
          accompanied by frequent black lightning that pierced through them,
          causing Chaos Qi to spread. Various terrifying winged-monsters covered
          with scales appeared.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ever since Devil Mountain emerged, it drew in monsters from all
          corners of the world, making it a formidable force in the eyes of many
          other Forces. Its Mistress was none other than the demoness in red,
          who came out of the Demon-Burying Abyss and had once annihilated many
          masters in Divine City.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her power was so immense that it was hard to find anyone who could
          match her even in the Upper Realm today. This was why people’s
          expressions contorted with fear when talking about Devil
          Mountain.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sight of the demonic clouds approaching Dark Kun City with great
          force startled numerous Forces, leading them to suspect that Devil
          Mountain was going to get involved in the matter.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, the Ji family was going to join forces with several Forces
          after the Divine Rock Conference to launch a united invasion into Kun
          Mountain to rescue their Prime Ancestor, Ji Shengchu.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!!* As the major Forces were pondering over this matter, a deep
          rumbling suddenly rang out from the depths of Kun Mountain, located
          not far from Dark Kun City. The sound resembled that of a massive
          drum, resonating across time and space. It also resembled the sound of
          a beating heart that shook cultivators to their core, nearly causing
          their souls to depart their bodies.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >A strange movement occurred in Kun Mountain as a dark light shot up
          into the sky, instantly covering the entire sky. From a distance, it
          appeared as though night had suddenly fallen.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, a dreadful black mist seeped through the surface of
          the Cursed Rock, which the Prime Ancestor of the Great West Holy Land
          had extracted from Kun Mountain. With demonic mist surrounding the
          rock, even the most skilled cultivators refrained from approaching it
          recklessly.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Cursed Rock was the most highly guarded rock among the Seven
          Divine Rocks. It had not appeared in the world yet due to being
          restrained by Dao Artifacts, but currently, it appeared that even the
          Dao Artifacts were reaching their limit.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Countless strands of black demonic energy permeated and intertwined
          on the surface of the stone. The energy was so dense that it blanketed
          everything within a hundred-mile radius in darkness, creating an eerie
          sight. The ancient beings in charge of guarding the rock were
          extremely careful and did not dare to be careless.</span

          on a cushion in a magnificent chamber belonging to Skyward Schloss.
          Her eyes were shut tight and her eyebrows were knitted together. She
          appeared to be in agony.</span

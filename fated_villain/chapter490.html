          nervous. His reputation preceded him, and she was certain not many

          had thought she would try to defend herself a little. [It&#8217;s
          good. It&#8217;s clear that she&#8217;s a smart one, not gullible like
          everyone says. No doubt, harmlessness is her main facade.]

          prudent in the last twenty-plus years. Born into the Hidden An Clan,
          the eldest daughter born of the wife at that. Her mother died for an
          unknown reason, her father cares for nothing but his cultivation, and
          she&#8217;s constantly bullied by a mean older sister. Hmm, such a

          >&#8220;Yes, Young Master Changge. The main reason I approached Xianer
          is to get to you. I seek something from you. Like many other girls, I
          want to give myself to the rich and powerful so that I can obtain even
          bigger power,&#8221; said An Yan as she lifted her gaze to look
          straight at Gu Changge&#8217;s back.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was shrewd. Over the years, she had constantly kept an eye open,
          made herself invisible, and even put on a gullible facade to lower her
          intimidation in others&#8217; eyes. Hence, An Yan could also tell,
          lying to Gu Changge would only displease him. The best thing to do was
          to be entirely honest with him.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >An Yan, on the other hand, wasn&#8217;t surprised Gu Changge would
          say that, but she wasn&#8217;t giving up. How could she when this
          once-in-a-lifetime opportunity had presented itself to her? At that,
          she gritted her teeth and continued, &#8220;I know nothing I have now

          quirked a brow and finally turned around, scrutinising her.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Followingly, he identified An Yan&#8217;s Fortuity, which looked
          common. She couldn&#8217;t even be considered fortunate, let alone be
          a Fortuitous Lady.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >&#8220;If I don&#8217;t even at least try, I will never be able to
          turn the tides around,&#8221; An Yan attested. In contrast to her
          slightly dim countenance, her gaze overflowed with determination.
          Before this, she had imagined many scenarios of buttering up to Gu
          Change, but little did she think the reality would be as such—being
          absolutely truthful to him. It could be said that all her preparations
          were for nothing.</span

          >&#8220;You have a good Dao Heart, I&#8217;ll give you that…&#8221; Gu
          Changge looked at An Yan with great interest. Just now, he witnessed
          the young woman&#8217;s Fortuity shoot up for some reason. [So,
          she&#8217;s actually the type whose Fortuity has yet to take shape and
          is currently accumulating.]</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          isn&#8217;t firm.&#8221; An Yan smiled wryly, then adjusted her mood
          and said somewhat gravely, &#8220;Actually, there&#8217;s something I
          believe you should know.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After one reached his cultivation level, which was so powerful that
          it was beyond measurement, one could sense some vague threads of cause
          and effect in a split second, and it seemed that what An Yan was about
          to say had something to do with him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s about my sister, An Xi. Some time ago, she saved a
          man around her retreat, and I happened to overhear her conversation
          with the stranger one day…&#8221; An Yan had regained her composure at
          this point and honestly disclosed everything she knew about the
          incident to Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It actually happened not too long ago, when the Upper Realm still
          hadn&#8217;t invaded the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, and news of
          the Boundary Marker Sea drying up still hadn&#8217;t travelled.
          Because of An Xi’s cultivation technique, An Xi&#8217;s common place
          of cultivation wasn&#8217;t located within the clan but in a Peach
          Blossom Village, of a small nation. The Peach Blossom Village was so
          secluded that it had been ten thousand years since it last contacted
          the outside world.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To a cultivator, ten thousand years was like the blink of an eye, but
          to a mortal, it meant hundreds of generations. Thus, Peach Blossom
          Village was serene, undisturbed by the outside world. There was only
          one river that came from far away and branched out to various
          places.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >One day, An Xi&#8217;s handmaiden found an unconscious man streaming
          down the very river. He seemed to have sustained severe injuries as he
          had drifted alone in the river for a long time and remained
          unconscious the whole time.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Oddly though, there weren&#8217;t any wounds on him, or more
          accurately, the injuries he sustained some time ago had healed on
          their own. Moreover, many beasts roamed around in these rivers. Not
          even cultivators dared to wander these places alone for the sake of
          their lives.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, no beasts dared approach the man who had no cultivation at
          all, and the discovery led An Xi to save him, assuming he possessed
          some kind of treasure or had a unique constitution.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge had a good idea who the man was. Back then, outside of
          Vermilion Bird Empire, he sent his men to hunt down Jiang Chen, Niu
          Tian, and others who teleported over from the Lower Realm. In the end,
          only Jiang Chen and Niu Tian escaped.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >Though he had done it intentionally, he didn&#8217;t think Niu Tian
          would give him such a surprise. [Forget about Jiang Chen, the
          Fortuitous One, reincarnation of the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial
          Boat of Creation. Looks like his friend also has a unique constitution
          or bloodline.]</span

          >&#8220;That man never woke up. After my sister took him back to the
          clan, she sought a doctor to give him medical attention, only to
          discover that he has Hidden Celestial Bloodline. Later, she learned of
          the stranger&#8217;s feud with you,&#8221; said An Yan, then glanced
          at Gu Change, feeling apprehensive seeing that the man wore no
          expressions on his face.</span

          >The issue wasn&#8217;t significant, but at the same time, it
          wasn&#8217;t minor either. Either way, the thing that had her
          genuinely feeling her sister was digging her own grave was that she
          helped the stranger with his cultivation, to have him at her disposal
          in the future. She did not seize him even after knowing his feud with
          Gu Changge.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Hidden Celestial Bloodline was no simple bloodline but a
          mysterious one. However, no one was certain just what kind of
          constitution it holds. That said, there were many myths revolving
          around the Hidden Celestial Bloodlines in the Upper Realm. For
          example, those with the constitution would obtain the powers of an
          Immortal. Though it wasn&#8217;t to the level of a genuine Immortal,
          it should be enough to fight one. Hence, it was only named Hidden
          Celestial Bloodline.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, there were far too few cultivators with the bloodline, for
          the consequences of nurturing them were too terrifying, beyond
          one&#8217;s imagination. In fact, only a handful with the Hidden
          Celestial Bloodline had ever appeared in the Upper Realm in the past
          aeon.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for why the An Clan would have such an in-depth understanding, it
          was because an Ancestor was one of those who had a Hidden Celestial
          Bloodline.</span

          unbothered. If anything, he was a little surprised at how blind he had
          been not to notice Niu Tian&#8217;s bloodline.</span

          positions in powerful families like the Hidden An Clan was a grave
          one, and An Yan&#8217;s current position in the clan was very
          sensitive. If she wanted to reign victorious, then she would need

          to her demise with him as she still saved Niu Tian despite knowing she

          expression. If the man could side with her, then her position within
          the clan would certainly shift greatly. Not only wouldn&#8217;t the
          Elders dare belittle her and make nothing of her anymore. She would
          gradually have a voice in the Hidden An Clan. With time, she&#8217;d
          be able to reclaim everything that was hers.</span

          sister&#8217;s ability? Do you think the Hidden An Clan will dare
          cross me for a stranger? Especially when he&#8217;s just someone with
          an undeveloped Hidden Celestial Bloodline. Who knows how many
          resources your clan will have to invest in him for him to grow? Do you
          think they&#8217;ll find the gamble worth it?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled
          plainly, certain the Hidden An Clan wouldn&#8217;t cross him for Niu
          Tian.</span

          course. However, the Hidden An Clan was now under An Xi&#8217;s reign,
          and a lot of times, she had the final say in the clan&#8217;s
          decisions. That said, not even her sister could convince the clan to

          the Hidden An Clan would likely hand Niu Tian to him on a silver
          platter. He wouldn&#8217;t even need to get himself involved in her
          feud with An Xi at all.</span

          An Yan&#8217;s ears just when the young woman was downcast, causing

          &#8220;I know I&#8217;m nothing to you right now, Young Master
          Changge. But if I can become the head of my clan, then all of the

          planted by An Xi&#8217;s side. I even know she would head towards the

          three drops of True Blood were very precious to the clan. Even An Xi
          spent a lot of time and effort convincing the elders before being
          permitted to retrieve one of them from the ancestral planet. However,
          since Gu Changge wanted her to show her worth, she would seize the
          blood if it even risked exposing her years of disguise.</span

          successfully seizing the opportunity right before her eyes. As long as

          or how could she not regain her memories when she was the High
          Priestess of Destiny who controlled the Celestial Boat of Creation.

          her choice to be at Gu Changge&#8217;s disposal was tantamount to
          doing the impossible. Hence, there would be nothing she could do if Gu

          also done all she could to show Gu Changge her commitment. She took
          part and played a significant role in obliterating the Nine Great
          Mountains and the defeat of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains Army
          at the Aether Abyss. However, she wasn&#8217;t sure what Gu Changge
          made of it. Thus, she could only gamble that the man would eventually
          be moved by her.</span

          bloodbath? I assure you, this is more useful than any other

          Deer City isn&#8217;t the only city in the Eight Wastelands and Ten

          and she could actually return to Sky Deer City if she wanted to.
          However, she didn&#8217;t, for if she did, all the efforts she had
          made before this would be for nothing. Besides, there was nothing she

          &#8220;I&#8217;m just worried for your future. Unless you want to live
          in the shadows forever. You&#8217;ll have to reemerge into the world

          all. She had an incredibly noble status and was well-respected by all.
          If she showed up before the Sky Deer City had been infiltrated, it
          would be a massive blow to the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.

          highly noble and well-respected in the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. She was the guardian of the Sky Deer City, a True Daoist who,
          back in the day, had slaughtered an Ancient Royal Family member to
          oppose the Upper Realm just in front of Sky Deer City. Her powers were
          beyond terrifying.

          mountains spectacularly stood, covered in ambiguous purple gleams.
          From time to time, terrifying sounds would come from within, as though
          it was the thundering noise giant boulders were rolling.</span

          lowered their heads in silence, not daring to speak a word, including
          the nervous Chen Ning&#8217;er whose face slightly paled. Although Gu
          Changge wasn&#8217;t questioning her, the soul-trembling, suffocating
          sensation surrounded her like a nightmare.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Eventually, as Gu Changge withdrew his gaze and revealed a smile, the
          pressuring aura finally faded away in their heads. As if they were
          just dragged out of an icy lake, their hands and legs were shaking as
          their garments were soaked in cold sweat.</span

          if Ji Yaoxing would have met his death if he were to get one word
          wrong earlier. Given Gu Changge&#8217;s strength—even according to the
          rumours—he was able to take on those in the Sacred King Realm in a
          fight. Thus, to him, killing Ji Yaoxing was as easy as pinching a bug
          to death.</span

          manage to secure the Tower of World Domination today, I&#8217;ve
          informed the Ji Family, and they&#8217;ll deliver the Wheel of World
          Domination shortly. It will be as a token of apology. I hope that
          you&#8217;d show us mercy by forgiving me and my sister&#8217;s
          negligence tonight,&#8221; Heaving a sigh of relief, Ji Yaoxing put
          his fists together and respectfully stated.</span

          shall gladly accept your offering.&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Changge
          retained his usual, casual smile.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Without a doubt, he was aware of others&#8217; thoughts, but he
          wasn&#8217;t affected by them. Even if Ji Yaoxing didn&#8217;t offer
          the Wheel of World Domination, he would eventually find a way to force
          the Ji Family into giving it up. Though, thanks to Ji Yaoxing&#8217;s
          tactfulness, he had saved some time and energy.</span

          >On the other hand, Jiyue Chu fearfully glanced at Gu Changge before
          lowering her head. Ever since her first encounter with Gu Changge, she
          grew curious about what kind of being the greatest of the young
          generation was. Especially so after so many rumours. It would make
          anyone wonder what kind of person he was, who held frightening power
          and could cause the whole Upper Realm to tremble.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, she finally got to thoroughly experience his terror, and she
          could barely stand still. She began to doubt that even her father, the
          leader of the Hidden Ji Family, would do any better than them were he
          to face Gu Changge.</span

          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, how do you wish to deal with Jiang
          Chen?&#8221; Upon Gu Changge&#8217;s reply of gratitude, the weight in
          Ji Yaoxing&#8217;s heart was finally relieved as he now felt much at
          ease. Suddenly, a glow flashed across his composed face as he turned
          around to look at Jiang Chen, who was constantly in daze and had a
          blanched face, and asked.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen had yet to recover from the shock, and now that Ji Yaoxing
          was proposing to deal with him, he grew even more dumbfounded. Without
          much time to think, he quickly asked the Artifact Spirit of the
          Celestial Boat of Creation in his mind how to survive the night.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;Your only choice now is retreat to the purple mountains behind
          you as fast as you can. Once you get in there, we&#8217;ll be able to
          manipulate the Earthly Shi within. You’d be able to use that power to
          defend ourselves. That is your only way to survive, since the siblings
          of the Ji Family turned on you. Their actions also caught me by
          surprise. I overestimated their courage and valour, and I also
          underestimated Gu Changge&#8217;s dominance.&gt; The Artifact Spirit
          of the Celestial Boat of Creation sounded unusually solemn.</span

          >[But how can I escape them? They&#8217;ll catch up to me in an
          instant!] Jiang Chen tensed his brows, obviously still distressed. He
          already intended to run away earlier, but with Ji Yaoxing&#8217;s
          trustworthy servants and Chen Ning&#8217;er&#8217;s men staring at
          him, he didn&#8217;t even dare to make a move.</span

          a bit to allow you the opportunity to flee. You must not miss your
          one-and-only chance!&gt; the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of
          Creation solemnly warned.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nodding, Jiang Chen was on edge as one minor mistake would cause him
          to be slaughtered. In that instant, he couldn&#8217;t be more anxious
          as his palms and back were completely drenched in cold sweat.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Jiang Chen? The name sounds familiar.&#8221; In response, Gu
          Changge seemingly pondered for a bit, revealing a look of
          contemplation. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t recall any memory of this
          visage.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >&#8220;Jiang Chen carries the legacy of a Divine Source Master, Young
          Master Changge. He claimed to share a feud with you, and his current
          look is not his original one. His disguise was made in concern that
          you might detect his presence,&#8221; Ji Yaoxing clarified with a low
          voice.</span

          Chen claimed this himself.&#8221; Ji Yaoxing continued to explain as
          his cold stare towards Jiang Chen persisted, &#8220;As vile as he is,
          he tried to talk me and my sister into going against you numerous
          times in an attempt to push the Ji Family towards the eternal
          abyss.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Chen Ning&#8217;er and the rest were dumbstruck as they
          never expected the young Divine Source Master to be this daring.
          Essentially, it would take someone tremendous courage and boldness to
          plot against Gu Changge.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, Gu Changge simply smiled upon those words. However, he
          didn&#8217;t withdraw his gaze, which grew even more playful.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, Jiang Chen was convinced that Gu Changge was aware of
          his identity, and the latter simply didn&#8217;t expose him. At once,
          with an icy expression, he stated, &#8220;Gu Changge, as forgetful as
          an important figure such as you may be, the vengeance for me and my
          friends are still deeply etched in my mind.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As he was speaking, there was a noticeable change in his face.
          Following the instruction Ji Chuyue gave him, he revealed his true
          appearance. Instantly, Jiang Chen reverted from a teenager to a young
          man, and the drastic change left others stupefied.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that, Gu Changge nodded his head as though he just realised
          it, after which he replied with an enthralling look, &#8220;Ah,
          it&#8217;s you. But I can&#8217;t comprehend what you just said. Back
          then, I was kind enough to release all of you, and now you&#8217;re
          here blaming me? Aren&#8217;t you a little too ungrateful? Even a
          treacherous man wouldn&#8217;t behave this way, don&#8217;t you
          think?&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon his leisurely, indifferent tone, Jiang Chen could only feel the
          fiery rage gushing into his mind. Yet, he forced himself to remain
          composed and coldly stated, &#8220;Not admitting to your misdeeds, how
          brazen can you be, Gu Changge? Sure, it seemed like you released us,
          but the truth is that you sent your men to murder all of us promptly
          after that.&#8221;</span

          so deeply, yet she couldn&#8217;t see through your true colour.&#8221;
          As soon as he mentioned Xiao Ruoyin, he could feel the detestation and
          agony in his heart eating away at him. It was as though his emotions
          could tear him apart.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Mingkong took a glance at Gu Changge, seemingly contemplating as she
          wondered who the woman named Ruoyin mentioned by Jiang Chen was. She
          then soon realised that it was some other woman that fell into Gu
          Changge&#8217;s grasp during her absence, which resulted in the bad
          blood between Jiang Chen and Gu Changge.</span

          >&#8220;Ah, so that&#8217;s what you were referring to. Xiao Ruoyin
          possesses a legendary physique, and that already makes her out of your
          league. Forcing yourself to commit to her won&#8217;t do you any good,
          do you not realise that?&#8221; Seemingly losing his interest, Gu
          Changge leisurely stated.</span

          excuses and you know it. Ruoyin came to this world as clueless as an
          infant, and thanks to your manipulation and deception, she was turned
          blind to your true colour.&#8221; Jiang Chen was exasperated, and his
          expression looked as though he desired to skin Gu Changge alive.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, even saying all that, Gu Changge no longer had the
          intention to entertain Jiang Chen. His eyes grew faint and he
          didn&#8217;t even bother to look at him.</span

          him? Young Master was only feigning kindness as he decided not to meet
          you at your standard. If you continue to be this blatant, I&#8217;ll
          teach you a lesson! If Young Master wishes to kill you, no place in
          the entire Upper Realm would dare to welcome you, and I doubt
          you&#8217;d have the capabilities to survive.&#8221; In the meantime,
          the person speaking was one of his followers, who bore the semblance
          of a murderous, intimidating Yaksha. His words startled the crowd, and
          although he sounded overbearing and rampant, he was right.</span

          Sacred Realm was wafting around his body. At a swing of an arm, he
          blocked off the plunging palm and grabbed Jiang Chen, whose face was
          pale and hopeless, at the same time before speedily retreating to the

          how the elderly man in black robes showed up to rescue him at his
          lowest point. In that instant, he was extremely excited and he
          couldn&#8217;t be any more moved.</span

          tone, as if he was holding back his urge to slap Jiang Chen to death.
          Despite saying that, he sure moved swiftly as he grabbed Jiang Chen
          and fled to the purple mountains, turning into a black beam and
          instantly disappeared without leaving any traces behind.</span

          wonder he was daring to say those words to us. But what was the
          purpose of him entering Heavenly Ruin Gate then? Did he come here
          because he knew where the Tower of World Domination is located? And
          everything he did was nothing but a distraction?]</span

          forgiveness. If it weren&#8217;t for his carelessness, the elderly man
          in black robes wouldn&#8217;t have had the chance to appear and rescue
          Jiang Chen.</span

          >Waving his hand, Gu Changge regained his naturalness and replied,
          &#8220;It&#8217;s not your fault. Jiang Chen only dared to speak those
          words with such a card up his sleeve.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[With a formidable cultivator in the Sacred Lord Realm assisting him,
          he must have encountered quite a number of opportunities along the
          way.] Hearing that, Yue Mingkong glanced at Gu Changge as she felt
          that there was a deeper meaning behind his words.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Back when the elderly man in black robes surfaced, he wasn&#8217;t
          affected at all as his face remained unchanged. He must have predicted
          the arrival of the elderly man in black robes. Therefore, Yue Mingkong
          instinctively came to an inference. [Since Jiang Chen was a pawn
          pre-arranged by Gu Changge, the elderly man in black must be
          that…]</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that in mind, she felt a chilly sensation overtaking her. As
          expected, if an individual was targeted by Gu Changge, they would be
          living their whole life in the most terrifying nightmare until they
          took their very last breath, and that was an unremovable curse.</span

          him…] After a while, Ji Chuyue finally regained her senses, and for
          some reason, she felt a chill up her spine. At that moment she
          couldn&#8217;t fathom why Jiang Chen entered Heavenly Ruin Gate.
          Regardless, judging by the interaction earlier, the elderly man in
          black robes seemed to be his guardian or some sort.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The hazards in the purple mountains are abnormal. Even if
          Jiang Chen manages to get in, it&#8217;s most likely that he ends up
          dead. I reckon that there won&#8217;t be any way to survive behind the
          purple mountains as the only way out is where we are right now. Even
          if he luckily gets out of the mountains, he would still have to leave
          through this way.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, Chen Ning&#8217;er thought out loud, certain that
          Jiang Chen wouldn&#8217;t be able to escape. Hence, all they had to do
          now was guard the entrance to those purple mountains and wait for
          Jiang Chen to walk right into their traps.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, in response, Ji Yaoxing shook his head and calmly
          stated, &#8220;There are undoubtedly dangers lying around those purple
          mountains as it even has its own dimension, but despite that, Jiang
          Chen is a Divine Source Master who possesses countless mysterious
          methods that may allow him to find a way to survive. Even just now,
          when I entered the purple mountains to investigate the area, I noticed
          some ancient living beings subdued within, and the closer I got to the
          centre region, the stronger those beings were. There are even beings
          above the Sacred Realm in those mountains.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unlike Chen Ning&#8217;er, Ji Yaoxing didn&#8217;t think Jiang Chen
          would get himself killed in the purple mountains. After all, if it
          weren&#8217;t for Jiang Chen, they wouldn&#8217;t have located the
          position of the Tower of World Domination even until now. Therefore,
          he figured that Jiang Chen must hold some sort of card in hand that
          could allow him to walk out of the purple mountains safely.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Since the Tower of World Domination is in those purple
          mountains, I must find it even if it means digging to the core of the
          world. Jiang Chen alone is not of any concern.&#8221; Hearing that, Gu
          Changge casually smiled. As soon as he spoke, the followers behind him
          became divine rainbows and soared to the skies towards the purple
          mountains without wasting any time lurking around.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;In that case, I shall send my men to explore those mountains
          and capture Jiang Chen for you, Young Master Changge.&#8221; At once,
          Chen Ning&#8217;er revealed a stern face and hastily spoke, after
          which she began to order her servants.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then, Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue peered at each other. Without wasting
          any time, they, too, gave instructions to their trustworthy servants,
          intending to venture into the purple mountains to find the Tower of
          World Domination and take Jiang Chen down at the same time.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, blinding, stunning lights filled the area. Although the
          cultivators were aware of the threats the purple mountains might hold,
          they didn&#8217;t dare to disobey Gu Changge. And so, they hurried
          into the depths without delay. At that moment, they no longer cared
          about being ordered around like puppets.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, only Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong remained in the region as
          even the siblings of the Ji Family were on their hurried way instead
          of choosing to stay outside.</span

          >&#8220;How confident are you that Jiang Chen is able to find the
          Tower of World Domination?&#8221; Somewhat curious, Yue Mingkong
          stared at Gu Changge. Rather than questioning his plans, she was more
          eager to know why he was so certain that Jiang Chen would be able to
          find the Tower of World Domination.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Absolutely confident.&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Changge
          smilingly answered with a subtle grin, as though his vision penetrated
          all the purple mountains, which allowed him to perceive everything
          that was happening inside.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As a matter of fact, he did not trust Jiang Chen. Rather, what he
          trusted was Jiang Chen&#8217;s Fortituity. Otherwise, Jiang Chen
          wouldn&#8217;t have been the Fortuitous One. He also carrying another
          Artifact with him, the Celestial Boat of Creation. With the assistance
          of the Celestial Boat of Creation, Jiang Chen finding the Tower of
          World Domination would be as effortless as turning his palm
          around.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >On the other hand, the two siblings of the Ji Family and Chen
          Ning&#8217;er were nothing more than an obstacle for Jiang Chen.</span

          Yue Mingkong looked at him with her unusually calm eyes. [Describing
          him to be a monster wouldn&#8217;t even be an overstatement.]</span

          the Wheel of World Domination finding its way to our hands is indeed a
          surprise. And now all we have to do is wait for Jiang Chen to help us

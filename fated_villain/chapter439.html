        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As a matter of fact, she was the Successor of the Killing Emperor,
          hence she tended to encounter all sorts of assassination techniques.
          Yet, the ancient book somehow instilled fear in her.</span

          pass this on to them,&#8221; Gu Changge ordered without giving any
          explanation.</span

          >Although Bai Lian&#8217;er was confused by his order, she knew better
          than to question him. She believed that it was a unique Secret
          Technique that could either grant major improvement to assassins or
          grant Gu Changge easy control over their lives and deaths.</span

          >&#8220;Hold on. This is for you.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head as
          he took out a white jade flask. It wasn&#8217;t open, yet a thick
          aroma of herbs could be smelled wafting from within. Even shining
          strange scenes surged in the air, taking the form of divine palaces
          and pavilions, as well as the rotations of astral wonders. It was a
          stupendous sight.</span

          >&#8220;This is…&#8221; Bai Lianer was somewhat taken aback. She then
          warily glanced at Gu Changge, trying to figure out whether he was
          fooling around.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Naturally, she detected the extraordinariness contained within the
          white jade flask and guessed that it was most likely a rare godly pill
          that could help her breakthrough the bottleneck of Peak Sacred King
          Realm. In fact, given her current cultivation level, pills were pretty
          much ineffective for her now. Otherwise, with her position and power,
          she would have gotten all the pills of her desire.</span

          spent quite some time being stuck at Peak Sacred King Realm. Who knows
          how long it will take you to break through to the next level by
          yourself. Since you&#8217;re serving me, I can&#8217;t afford to have

          >The terrain of the purple mountains was wide and flat, unlike the
          dangerous mountains seen in the outside world. The intersecting paths
          within glimmered with different-coloured light which led to many
          different places. Beams of faint purple shone from the sky, exerting
          an unknown pressure. It was like a mountain was also hanging from
          above. Many rocks could be seen, with leftover marks from weapons and
          scratches on their faces. These markings seemed to tell the story of
          the battle from times long past.</span

          >Jiang Chen, led by the elderly man in black, could feel terrifyingly
          strong pressure from above as soon as they fled inside, which could
          crush them at any second.</span

          mountains?&#8221; The elderly man frowned and chose a random path. He
          then cursed a little and threw Jiang Chen on the ground irritatedly.

          >&#8220;Thank you so much for saving my life again. I will never
          forget your kindness.&#8221; Jiang Chen quickly got up and bowed to
          him gratefully and respectfully instead of complaining about the
          man&#8217;s rough actions.

          The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation couldn&#8217;t
          save him in time either. He hadn&#8217;t expected that the elderly man
          had been following him in secret and rescued him once again. He felt
          extremely touched and thankful since he had managed to survive. He had
          been so afraid back there.</span

          >&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. The best way you can repay me is by making
          me worry less about you.&#8221; The elderly man snorted in annoyance.
          &#8220;You should have continued cultivating at the Heavenly Ruin Gate
          until you achieved great results before thinking of revenge. However,
          you didn&#8217;t listen to me, thinking you were strong enough and
          poking your nose into everything. I may have saved you once but I
          can&#8217;t do that forever. It&#8217;s not like you don&#8217;t know
          how dangerous Gu Changge is, yet you still cross him. If you do that
          again, I will never save you.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The elderly man seemed to be reprimanding him in a long-winded way,
          but Jiang Chen knew he had been anxious. Jiang Chen couldn&#8217;t
          help the warmth flowing through him at that thought. The elderly man
          might not be a good person but had already saved him many times,
          unlike Gu Changge and Ji Yaoxing, who looked like they were on the
          good side but acted with more cruelty than the elderly man.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Okay, sir. I will find a place to cultivate the Everchanging
          Demonic Arts when all this is resolved and come out only when I have
          gained good results,&#8221; Jiang Chen promised determinedly. He had
          already understood deeply how important strength was in this world.
          The reason Gu Changge could force Ji Chuyue and Ji Yaoxing into
          submission and respectfulness was that he was more powerful than
          them.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s no use saying that now. Gu Changge will never let
          you go free. These purple mountains are extremely mysterious and my
          strength is limited here, so I cannot help you. If you cannot find a
          way out, you will die. As for your revengeâ€¦&#8221; The man snorted
          with disdain.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen knew the importance of the issue too. There was no escape
          path before him and there were pursuers after him, so he quickly
          mentally contacted the Artifact Spirit for the Celestial Boat of
          Creation. It had already said that it could counter their other
          enemies after entering purple mountains, which gave him some
          hope.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;No need to worry. I can feel a familiar aura here; it feels like
          it has been left behind by someone we know from the Immortal Palace.
          Since I am the Artifact Spirit and you are the vessel for the
          Celestial Boat of Creation, we will not encounter any danger here&gt;
          The Artifact Spirit said confidently.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen became delighted at the news and did not doubt the
          Artifact Spirit. It might be unreliable on occasion, but at this time,
          their fates were tightly linked, so it would never joke about
          this.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh, dear. Someone has barged in from the outside. Get further
          into the area while I help block their way.&#8221; The elderly man in
          black seemed to have sensed something, expression becoming stricken
          then anxious.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;They&#8217;ve caught up to us.&#8221; Jiang Chen&#8217;s
          expression shifted as well as he realised the situation&#8217;s
          urgency. He would only become a burden to the elderly man if he stayed
          here.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He did not run immediately, though. &#8220;What about you,
          sir?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I will find a way to extract myself and
          meet with you as soon as I have blocked their way. You must find a way
          to survive before then, or we&#8217;ll both die if Gu Changge catches
          up to us.&#8221; The man looked more grave than he had ever been,
          walking back using the path they had used to escape.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A terrifying aura swept through the air as a sword appeared in his
          hand which he sliced towards the group of pursuing cultivators. It
          seemed to cut through the void with how powerful it was, and the
          pursuers all retreated while coughing up blood. They could never
          compete with someone in the Sacred Lord Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Be careful, sir. I will use the technique you have taught me
          to mark my path, so you should follow after me.&#8221; Jiang Chen
          gritted his teeth, not daring to linger any longer. He fled deeper
          into the purple mountains as soon as he had finished speaking. He did
          not care about the heavy and frighteningly powerful aura which could
          fall at any time and crush everyone, trusting the words of the
          Artifact Spirit.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The chilling sounds of battle soon resonated in the mountain,
          awakening many slumbering mysterious beings from every corner who
          headed towards the source of the fighting.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen&#8217;s journey was smooth; the deeper he went, the more
          acutely he sensed how frightening it was. Purple mist emitted from
          between several rocks, mysterious yet dangerous. He had already seen a
          mysterious beast turn into a bloody mist as soon as it came into
          contact with that purple mist. The sight terrified him but thanks to
          assistance from the Artifact Spirit, he managed to manipulate the
          terrain of the area and enter the depths of the mountain unharmed.
          Some terrifying-looking beings did not attack him when they saw him
          either, only glancing at him like he was one of them. This made him
          sigh with relief and finally relax.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;Continue forward. I can sense the location of the Tower now. If I
          am not mistaken, we&#8217;re about to succeed.&gt; The Artifact Spirit
          of the Celestial Boat of Creation sounded excited as if already
          sensing a treasure cave opening for them. Jiang Chen nodded and did
          not pause, moving forward as suggested by the Artifact Spirit.
          However, his face paled at once when he arrived at the cave.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Blood covered the walls of the cave, making the scene gory and
          shocking. He didn&#8217;t know what had happened here, for he could
          see pale skeletons under his feet of different races, including humans
          and non-humans. Some glimmered like jade but some which were as
          enormous as hills were as dark as ink.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The road ended there, not because it had been destroyed but because
          an immovable stone wall was blocking his way. It resembled the purple
          mountains in terms of glow and material, so he couldn&#8217;t blast it
          open. It was a unique material which had been difficult to destroy
          even in a battle between cultivators.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Is this a dead end?] Jiang Chen frowned deeply, not expecting the
          Artifact Spirit&#8217;s instructions to lead him to a place where his
          path was hindered.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;Don&#8217;t panic. There has to be a way out. Let me look for
          it,&gt; The Artifact Spirit said.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen nodded, and soon after the silhouette of a bronze flying
          ship appeared from between his eyebrows. It melted into the stone wall
          before them like it was trying to pass through the wall to the other
          side.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Really?] Jiang Chen became pleased as well.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;I&#8217;m going to open it now. No one else can open it. The
          hardness of the mountains here is more than I expected. I suspect that
          it&#8217;s not something from this world and not even Gu Changge can
          pass through it,&gt; The Artifact Spirit replied confidently. A faint
          glow appeared, looking like intertwining stars, appearing on the stone
          wall and finally connecting. Loud sounds of rumbling could be heard as
          the stone wall gave way and opened up, sounding like the sky had
          opened.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, Chen Ning&#8217;er, Ji Chuyue, and Ji Yaoxing, who had
          been tracking Jiang Chen and the elderly man in black robes, did not
          move together. It would have been impossible to find Jiang Chen if
          they hadn&#8217;t gone in different directions because of the many
          paths along the purple mountains. It would be like finding a needle in
          a haystack. As for where the Tower of World Domination was, they had
          no clues at all.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Do you blame me, Chuyue?&#8221; Ji Yaoxing finally spoke,
          looking at his silent sister.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She shook her head although her expression was still dull. She was a
          kind person after all and had always thought her brother was the same,
          with a just and sensible personality. That was why the events that she
          had seen today were hard to swallow, especially Jiang Chen&#8217;s
          cold expression. It was like a knife stabbing into her heart since
          they had brought Jiang Chen into this. While they managed to escape
          unharmed, all the troubles landed on Jiang Chen. That, coupled with
          the fact that they had to send someone to kill him, made her feel
          uncomfortable.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You are still too innocent. Jiang Chen already had ulterior
          motives when he went to see you. Someone in the Sacred Lord Realm is
          backing him secretly, so why did he study with the Heavenly Ruin Gate?
          Have you thought of that? Besides, he was leading us to offend Gu
          Changge; did you think he had no other motive? You think too kindly of
          him.&#8221; Ji Yaoxing sighed, voice not wavering whatsoever.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Chuyue&#8217;s eyes widened at that. There was nothing wrong with
          the statement the more she thought about it since Jiang Chen seemed to
          have other motivations for approaching her before this. That made her
          feel better.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, she suddenly recalled something, saying unwillingly,
          &#8220;Brother, are we really offering Gu Changge the Wheel of World
          Domination which we worked so hard to acquire it?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They both knew how high the price the Hidden Ji Family had paid for
          getting the Wheel, but now they had no choice but to give it to
          someone else. It was something which Ji Yaoxing was unwilling to hear,
          and he smiled bitterly.

          >&#8220;We have no choice in this. If we don&#8217;t do so, Gu Changge
          will never give up on getting it. Do you think this man from the
          rumours is actually a good person? Take Purple Mansion for example. If
          he was really kind and mild-mannered, why would he cripple Sky King
          Zhi Yang? As I see it, all of that was just an excuse for attacking
          Purple Mansion.&#8221;</span

          >They didn&#8217;t get far as they saw many powerful and mysterious
          beings rushing towards them from the opposite direction. Black clouds
          billowed from them as they emitted a strong aura. These beings bore a
          resemblance to the Ancient Immortal Races yet exuded a completely
          different auras. Beams of light soon shot towards them, slicing
          through the air like blades with a frighteningly intense force.</span

          >&#8220;Dammit! I encountered these types of beings back then. Retreat
          quickly; Jiang Chen can&#8217;t possibly survive even if he managed to
          hide from us tracking him down.&#8221; Ji Yaoxing became pale and
          immediately led them backwards. He had already noticed that the
          elderly man in black robes had stayed to stall them and prevent them
          from pursuing him; that meant that they were fleeing separately.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Could Jiang Chen survive an encounter with these beings using
          whatever capabilities he had? Ji Chuyue pursed her lips, not daring to
          stay here longer and quickly retreating in the direction from which
          they had come. As Ji Yaoxing said, Jiang Chen would never survive an
          encounter with these mysterious beings after separating from that
          elderly man unless he had extraordinary abilities.</span

          >Soon, they retreated outside of the mountains. They were shocked to
          see that Chen Ning&#8217;er had already come out before them. However,
          she didn&#8217;t look well at all, with a pale and terrified face as
          well as a weak aura. The lackeys she had taken with her were reduced
          to just two or three, who were all seriously injured. It seemed that
          she had run into grave danger after entering the purple mountains, and
          had been lucky enough to escape with her life. The expressions of the
          two Ji siblings became grim.

          interrupted by a wave of his hand.

          >&#8220;It looks like there&#8217;s plenty of danger lingering inside.
          Everyone who entered has been harmed in some way.&#8221; He closed his
          eyes briefly, sounding like he was muttering to himself.</span

          >&#8220;There&#8217;re so many intersecting paths there, all of them
          go in different directions, so we don&#8217;t know which one can take
          us into the depths. Jiang Chen and the elderly man in black robes are
          separated. I think Jiang Chen has no chance of surviving. Those
          mysterious beings are extremely strong. He will be torn to pieces
          without anyone protecting him,&#8221; Chen Ning&#8217;er said quickly,
          her expression still traumatised. She hadn&#8217;t expected the purple
          mountains to be so dangerous and would have died there without her
          strong protective amulet.</span

          >&#8220;Oh. I am confident in getting the Tower of World Domination.
          Though, I may need to pay a visit to it in person.&#8221; He raised
          his eyebrows with interest.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; Yue Mingkong said without
          hesitation.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No need for that. Remain outside instead; I will be more
          reassured if anything happens.&#8221; Gu Changge waved his hand and
          smiled</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He did not wait for her reply. Space seemed to blur as he stepped
          out, and a broad golden path appeared before him which led straight
          into the purple mountains. The chilling sound of rumbling could be
          heard in that instant as the mountains shook and the ground collapsed.
          The sight was terrifying.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Chuyue, Ji Yaoxing, Chen Ning&#8217;er, and the rest looked on in
          shock, not expecting him to act personally. However, these mysterious
          beings might be inferior to him no matter how strong they were judging
          by his abilities. The danger within the mountain wasn&#8217;t just
          because of the beings, though.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Gu Changge may be powerful, but there are many powerful beings in
          the purple mountains. The many intersecting paths can make one become
          lost very easily. Besides, there are also many natural array seals
          which can be death traps.] Ji Yaoxing frowned slightly in thought. He
          glanced at Yue Mingkong, watching as her expression remained cool
          throughout the entire situation. She seemed extremely confident in Gu
          Changge and didn&#8217;t seem worried about him at all.</span

          >Beings howled within the purple mountains. They coldly glared as they
          tore apart the cultivators still within the mountains. They rushed
          from different caves in immeasurable numbers like rising tides. But as
          Gu Changge stepped into the place, a strange sound rang within the
          void which sounded like a bell or gong and echoed within the
          mountain</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[This must be the Seven Tools of World Domination sensing each other.
          The Tower of World Domination is definitely here but without Jiang
          Chen, we may have to exert some effort in finding it.] Gu Changge
          could sense Jiang Chen&#8217;s location and deduced that he
          wasn&#8217;t that far away. He just needed to pass through numerous
          obstacles and arrays. At least he could just follow Jiang Chen&#8217;s
          tracks and pass unhindered by concealing himself in the void. The
          other man would never anticipate that the path he had left for the
          elderly man in black robes was eventually used by Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Mmmmm!* Gu Changge marched within the mountain, the void shaking as
          he raised his hand. An ancient yet terrifying energy exploded, turning
          into a giant star and dropping down with the weight of a million
          tonnes. All the beings going near him immediately exploded and
          evaporated into ash. The crowd of beings all retreated involuntarily
          from him even if they did not know pain or fear.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[This energy vibrationâ€¦ Jiang Chen probably has found the Tower of
          World Domination.] Gu Changge walked forward at an unhurried pace, his
          expression faintly surprised when he sensed something.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[He sure didn&#8217;t disappoint me.] He smiled and his figure
          blurred as he marched forward, ready to harvest a ripened fruit.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The purple mountains were truly astounding as there was a unique
          force field encompassing every corner of the place. Every rock in this
          mountain range was enclosed in this energy, which could affect the
          judgement of cultivators and suppress their divine sense. It was
          extremely tough so no normal person could destroy it. Without Jiang
          Chen exploring, it would be hard for even Gu Changge to find the Tower
          of World Domination.</span

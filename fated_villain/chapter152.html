      <h4>
        Chapter 152: What Are You Thinking?; Was Changge Trying To Protect Me?
      </h4>
      <p>Buzz!</p>
      <p>In the void three thousand miles away from the ancient city…</p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s figure materialised.</p>
      <p>
        He looked back at the chaotic city with a smile on his face, not a
        single sign of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Don’t the various races of the Ancient Immortal Continent want to
        retaliate against me?’
      </p>
      <p>‘Then let’s see who moves faster.’</p>
      <p>
        Of course, his primary motive was that Gu Changge wanted to solve the
        hidden danger that may expose how Long Teng’s corpse was in fact in
        Mingkong’s hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, he would gladly bear the suspicions of all the people of
        the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, such an act would merely increase the friction between the
        Ancient Immortal Races and the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s plan was vicious.</p>
      <p>
        He was determined to hit more than one target with just a single arrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time comes, the Ancient Immortal Continent will become even
        more turbulent, making it all the better for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Master, we have successfully dealt with all suspicious individuals.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, from all directions, followers of Gu Changge respectfully came and
        gave their reports.
      </p>
      <p>
        They obeyed Gu Changge’s orders and stopped any and all suspicious
        creatures nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he heard this, Gu Changge nodded and said, “Very well, let’s go.”
      </p>
      <p>
        By doing this, he had successfully dealt with all those who had
        witnessed his entry into the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, he cleverly judged the timing and killed everyone shortly
        after he was discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, his actions would be seen as deliberate, counter to his goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge planned to make Yue Mingkong faintly guess that he was
        protecting her.
      </p>
      <p>But it can’t be too obvious.</p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, Yue Mingkong and her sharp mind would easily guess his plan
        and doubt him once more, which would be quite bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge naturally didn’t like doing “good things”, and – if his
        involvement was still unknown even after all this – it would undoubtedly
        leave a bad taste in his mouth. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on
        nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If others don’t even know you did something good, what is the point of
        doing “good deeds”?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was someone who spent one point on the effort to do good and
        spent ten points on its publicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, how else could he quickly move Mingkong’s heart, letting her
        understand just how good her dear husband was to her?
      </p>
      <p>
        As he thought of this, Gu Changge also left with his followers, not
        intending to stay any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, many Young Supremes of the various races of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent were attacked and killed by Young Supremes of the
        human race during the gathering, shocking the entirety of the Ancient
        Immortal Races.
      </p>
      <p>The Tiangou[1] Clan and Golden Crow Clan were extremely angry.</p>
      <p>[1. Tiangou = “Sky Dog”]</p>
      <p>
        Young Supremes from both sides suffered casualties, both their face and
        will were trampled on in that banquet.
      </p>
      <p>Not even scraps were left.</p>
      <p>
        And among them, a Heavenly God Realm cultivator of the Golden Crow Clan
        was also killed, causing shock.
      </p>
      <p>Such an act was no longer possible for the younger generation.</p>
      <p>
        They either relied on external forces such as Divine Artifacts and
        Treasures, or… their strength was so terrifying that they could kill
        even those in the Heavenly God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time, no large fluctuations could be felt. Otherwise, it wouldn’t
        have been possible for only experts to have discovered it, and they only
        discovered it after there was no one left at the “crime” scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        This incident brought shame to the various races in the Ancient Immortal
        Continent, agitating them as they furiously searched everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, many races of the Ancient Immortal Continent wondered just
        who would do such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the person in question could quietly sneak into the ancient
        city, avoiding everyone and discretely killing people before safely
        retreating.
      </p>
      <p>‘Such methods are beyond the means of any ordinary Young Supreme.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Except for a few Young Supremes with extreme speed, there are few who
        could do such a thing.’
      </p>
      <p>‘But why?’</p>
      <p>‘Why did he do this?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘It’s a pity that everyone there is dead, and everything is gone. Even
        if we wanted to investigate, it would be a difficult task.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, many creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent narrowed
        the scope of their guesses, fixating on a few Young Supremes of the
        outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, Gu Changge was both the biggest suspect and the most likely.
      </p>
      <p>However, there was simply no way to prove his involvement.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge naturally acted as if he didn’t know what was going on and
        looked as if saying, “I don’t know, it wasn’t me”.
      </p>
      <p>
        This angered many natives of the Ancient Immortal Continent, who were
        determined to find Gu Changge guilty.
      </p>
      <p>But even if they were determined, they could not produce evidence.</p>
      <p>
        Since Long Teng’s death, the various clans of the Ancient Immortal
        Continent caused trouble yet again as many natives of the younger
        generation had spontaneously gathered, planning to attack Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This action will inevitably hurt the rest of the young generation in the
        crossfire, and the differences and hatred between the outside world and
        the Ancient Races will only constantly increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, one can often see cultivators of both sides
        being killed. They were fighting every chance they could get, painting
        many lands in red.
      </p>
      <p>
        The True Dragon Clan also sent out word, demanding that Gu Changge
        either hand over Long Teng’s corpse or face the consequences of his own
        actions.
      </p>
      <p>For a time, these words caused a sensation.</p>
      <p>
        In this regard, Gu Changge’s answer was only one word, “Preposterous”.
      </p>
      <p>
        He even told the younger generation of the True Dragon Clan to willingly
        deliver themselves to him, to gather their forces. Otherwise… he would
        kill them one by one, like plucking the petals of a flower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, these weren’t just passing remarks, the day after they were
        said…
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge took his mighty followers, searched for Young Creatures
        related to the True Dragon Clan, and relentlessly hunted them down!
      </p>
      <p>
        His strength shocked the various races of the Ancient Immortal Continent
        and the many sects of the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>A bloody storm engulfed the Ancient Immortal Continent.</p>
      <p>
        However, the True Dragon Clan really didn’t dare to let the younger
        generation compete with Gu Changge, and the faces of the high-level clan
        elders were a sight to behold.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were so enraged that, during their meeting, the clan elders
        couldn’t help but smash the jade table to bits!
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>The Baiheng Mountain Range is a magnificent relic.</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong took a group of followers to occupy this place as if
        waiting for something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from her, only a few cultivators and creatures currently resided
        in this area.
      </p>
      <p>As Gu Changge expected, she naturally learned of these days’ news.</p>
      <p>
        ‘It seems that, after he disappeared, he went to hunt down the expert
        who hid in the void back then.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Standing atop the mountain, Yue Mingkong had a calm and profound
        expression. She wore her hunting dress. Her bare feet were like snow,
        and her hair fluttered as she observed the vast ruins shrouded in the
        mist ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was busy thinking at the moment, recalling the direction Gu Changge
        had left in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others may not know why Gu Changge killed the Golden Crow Clan’s
        Heavenly God Realm expert, but her sharp mind could easily guess why.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘When Changge gave me Long Teng’s corpse, was it seen by the Golden Crow
        Clan’s expert from the shadows?’
      </p>
      <p>‘Is this why Gu Changge went to chase after the expert?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘This way, only I and Changge would know that I have Long Teng’s corpse
        with me.’
      </p>
      <p>‘Was Changge trying to protect me?’</p>
      <p>“Changge, just what are you thinking?” Yue Mingkong mumbled.</p>
      <p>
        Her eyes had suddenly blurred as her nose ran a bit sour with rampant
        emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her previous life, Gu Changge would never do this and would gladly
        let the whole world know that Long Teng’s corpse was in her hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        He would have never protected her like this…giving her Long Teng’s
        corpse and even taking on the wrath of the True Dragon Clan for her.
      </p>
      <p>In all honesty, she could not have been more moved at this moment.</p>
      <p>
        ‘It seems that when he was trying to get rid of the expert, he was
        noticed by the rest of the Ancient Immortal Races. In this way, he not
        only attracted the anger of the True Dragon Clan but also attracted the
        anger of the other races.’
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong frowned.</p>
      <p>She suddenly wanted to set off to find Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Even if she was as strong as Gu Changge, she still wouldn’t feel
        comfortable with having the entirety of the Ancient Immortal Races
        bearing down on her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wanted to avenge herself for her previous life, but she wouldn’t let
        the others hurt Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a private matter between her and Gu Changge, so it was
        impossible for her to see Gu Changge in such a dangerous position and
        fail to act.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘However, after the Fairy Spirit is born, many of the older generations
        will come, and the various clans of the Ancient Immortal Continent will
        most definitely unite. As of now, it would be best if I were to stay
        here. There is a hidden Immortal Road[2] in the Baiheng Mountain Range;
        when it opens, I can be the first to enter.’
      </p>
      <p>
        [2. Quick recap: Immortal Road was the portal through which Changge and
        company came to the Ancient Immortal Continent, but it is not the only
        one.]
      </p>
      <p>
        After Yue Mingkong seriously thought about it, she felt it was best to
        stay here.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her previous life, Gu Changge was able to steal the Fairy Spirit from
        the hands of the older generation. She obviously had many ways to save
        her life, but she was still worried, almost too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the current events… even if the various clans in the Ancient
        Immortal Continent hated Gu Changge, they would not dare send one of the
        older generations to personally intervene.
      </p>
      <p>As she thought of this, she breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p>
        ‘I might just be hesitating… but should I tell Gu Changge about the
        Fairy Spirit in advance? After all, many things have proven that the Gu
        Changge of this life is vastly different.’
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, in a remote courtyard in the Black Heavenly Eagle
        Clan…
      </p>
      <p>
        A young man named Hei Ming sat in a lotus position, strands of black
        mist lingered on his face like silk threads, floating as they gave off a
        strange aura.
      </p>
      <p>Then, he opened his eyes with a flash of excitement.</p>
      <p>
        “How long has it been? I’ve broken through to the Saint Realm in less
        than a month. I was only at the Transcendent Realm before! At this rate,
        I can break through to the Conferred King Realm in half a year at most,
        surpassing even my sister and becoming the absolute genius of the Black
        Heavenly Eagle Clan!”
      </p>
      <p>
        [PR/N: After a recent review, we have discovered that chapter 140 is
        incorrect. Hei Ming only had the strength and was only previously on the
        Transcendent Realm, not at the Conferred King Realm.]
      </p>
      <p>Hei Ming spoke with much excitement.</p>
      <p>
        If it had been more than a month ago, he would definitely not dare to
        think so.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, not only did he achieve it, his cultivation even broke through
        two major realms in one go and was still increasing by the day.
      </p>
      <p>The speed was simply incredible.</p>
      <p>
        ‘The Immortal Binding Technique is simply too terrifying and
        heaven-defying.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Some time ago, his Big Sis Hei Yanyu provided the Cultivation Technique
        of the Binding Immortal to a group of elders, shocking the whole family
        for a while and causing a big sensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        After much study by the clan elders, they concluded that this was
        definitely an Ancient Technique that contained the mystery of the Truth
        of the Dao.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shocked everyone in the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan and was regarded
        as a treasure for a while. Elders and many high-level officials were
        cultivating and found that their Cultivation Bases, which had been stuck
        for a long time, showed signs of faint loosening.
      </p>
      <p>This surprised them even more.</p>
      <p>
        Everyone believed that this was a good opportunity for the Black
        Heavenly Eagle Clan to rise up, annex the remaining four major clans in
        one fell swoop, and then dominate the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>The Immortal Law!</p>
      <p>
        This was the supreme law that can be passed down through the ages, as
        the Dao method of suppressing the foundation!
      </p>
      <p>
        Hei Yanyu’s status had also risen because of the Immortal Law, making it
        even more impressive than it was before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, she didn’t forget to mention Hei Ming, saying that Hei Ming
        got it accidentally at a stall and then volunteered to provide it for
        the family to cultivate and become stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Elder sighed at his innocence, bluntly stating that Hei Ming was
        truly a good child.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to this, Hei Ming had naturally become the leader of the family’s
        younger generation, and his status was second only to the being that was
        his Big Sis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, an even greater shock came upon all the Elders. Hei Ming’s
        Cultivation Base was also increasing, perhaps because of the cultivation
        of that Immortal Law.
      </p>
      <p>
        And according to what he said, he felt that his own talent was getting
        stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement shocked both the crowd and the Black Heavenly Eagle’s
        Elder with great delight as they focused ever more on the cultivation of
        this Immortal Law.
      </p>
      <p>Though Hei Ming held a face of respect, he sneered inwardly.</p>
      <p>
        As long as more people cultivate this Ancient Technique… the stronger
        these people got, the greater the rewards he would receive.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, he would even surpass the Elder and the others, becoming
        the true master of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan in one fell swoop.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Hei Ming also taught this Immortal Law to the rest of his
        family.
      </p>
      <p>
        His ambition was vast, not limited to just one Black Heavenly Eagle
        Clan… no, all of the major races will become resources to fuel his
        growth!
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘As of now, basically, all of the elders in the clan and several
        talented individuals have already practised this Immortal Law. Even two
        ancestors woke up and began to cultivate it!’
      </p>
      <p>
        As he thought of this, Hei Ming became even more excited, trembling
        slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, those two ancestors were the oldest and most terrifying
        existences of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan, and they hadn’t awakened
        for nearly tens of millions of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was precisely because of the Immortal Law that they were now
        awakened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the two ancestors have practised this Immortal Law, his talent
        would become even greater by a significant margin.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It would be great if I could see the Supreme Being again. Without him,
        I guess I still would’ve been nothing but waste wood, waiting for
        death!’
      </p>
      <p>
        For that supreme being, Hei Ming had a reverent belief in his heart, and
        he couldn’t wait to see him again and be given an even stronger
        Cultivation Technique and Talents.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Little Brother, the two ancestors want to see you and ask you
        something.”
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, a voice suddenly came from outside the courtyard.</p>
      <p>It was Hei Ming’s Big Sis, Hei Yanyu.</p>
      <p>
        She looked only about 17 or 18 years old. She was dressed in white with
        exquisite features as clouds and mist surged all over her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her black hair was like a cloud, with nine phoenix hairpins inserted on
        it, wearing a splendid river and mountain jade dress, as holy as a
        divine lotus, with unparalleled beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she spoke gently with Hei Ming, wishing to discuss
        something with him.
      </p>
      <p>“Big Sis…”</p>
      <p>Hei Ming also reacted, got up and went over.</p>
      <p>
        He knew that these two ancestors wanted to verify his story and ask him
        some questions.
      </p>
      <p>To be honest, he still felt a bit nervous.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the origin of this Cultivation Technique was a great mystery.
        Using ‘picked from a stall’ as an excuse may have been able to fool them
        for a while, but he can’t hide it forever.
      </p>
      <p>One way or another, it will blow up eventually.</p>
      <p>
        Now the two ancestors were thinking about asking him about this matter.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, it was likely to be a soul search.</p>
      <p>
        After all, people are greedy, and after learning such a heaven-defying
        Immortal Law, they were afraid that he might be hiding other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, Hei Ming also felt a little nervous at this time, his palms full of
        cold sweat.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, if the two ancestors notice the existence of the Supreme
        Being, what would happen?
      </p>
      <p>Truthfully, Hei Ming was incredibly worried.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he prayed in his heart that the Supreme Being could hear
        him and help him through this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Hei Ming suddenly felt a slight shock in his mind, as if
        a mighty force suddenly came.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ancient and terrifying deity appeared in it, with six heads and eight
        arms, staring at him indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, he felt like a hazy mist appear in his mind.</p>
      <p>‘Has the Supreme Being heard my prayer?’</p>
      <p>Hei Ming was shocked and then became extremely excited.</p>
      <p>
        Hei Yanyu noticed his abnormality and couldn’t help but ask, “What’s
        wrong, Little Brother?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Hei Ming hurriedly shook his head and said, “It’s okay. It’s just that…
        I’m very excited to see the ancestors.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “When you see them, just calm down and don’t be too cautious. The
        ancestors are all very good.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Hei Yanyu accepted his words without doubt when she heard them. After
        all, the two ancestors of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan were suspected
        to be either in the Quasi-Supreme Realm or even above it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It could be said that there were none among the younger generation who
        did not share Hei Ming’s thrill and excitement.
      </p>
      <p>After all, even Hei Yanyu herself was no exception.</p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>At the same time, in a ruin thousands of miles away…</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had a faint smile as the brilliant-gold lines in his eyes
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>The scene Hei Ming saw quickly disappeared from his vision.</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, Hei Ming did not disappoint him at all,
        infiltrating almost the entirety of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan.
      </p>
      <p>‘His acting skills are quite impressive indeed.’</p>
      <p>‘Of course, his skills are still incomparable to Yin Mei.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘The two ancestors of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan… I’m a little
        worried they’ll notice the abnormality present in the Immortal Binding
        Technique. That is, of course, assuming that they are in the Emperor
        Realm. If they are, it would be highly likely that this carriage will be
        overturned as my plans are revealed.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If the plan fails, then the entire Black Heavenly Eagle Clan might end
        up a threat. I’m not sure whether these ancestors would willingly submit
        themselves to the technique.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If they have yet to even reach the Supreme Realm, then they shouldn’t
        notice any problems, in which case I can rest assured.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge stood with his hands behind him, looking at the vast and
        majestic cities in the distance.
      </p>
      <p>He was alone, with no followers around him.</p>
      <p>
        After all, planning this kind of thing… the fewer people who know about
        it, the better it is for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, Gu Changge took great care to ensure that his Demonic Arts
        were not exposed.
      </p>
      <p>It was simply too foolhardy to make an enemy of the entire world.</p>
      <p>
        In any case, he was now in a most favourable situation. Even if their
        ancestors discovered Hei Ming’s abnormality, no one could discover that
        all of this was secretly planned by him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like the Immortal Devouring Demonic Arts, the Immortal Binding
        Technique was also lost in the river of time, not to say that it hadn’t
        appeared before.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one happens to meet a group of the older generation who have some
        understanding of this technique, it would be bad, to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The probability of such an event should be exceptionally small. To
        understand the methods behind the Immortal Binding Technique, one needs
        to be at least at the Emperor Realm, but I’m probably thinking too
        much.’ [3]
      </p>
      <p>
        [3: For people thinking why are we fluctuating between Supreme and
        Emperor Realm: If they are Supreme Realm, they can see the abnormality,
        and if they are Emperor Realm, they can understand that it is related to
        the Forbidden Demonic Arts probably, because it was not clarified by the
        author which one of the Realms, Emperor and Supreme, is above the
        other.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge squinted his eyes. As much as possible, he should be in
        complete control, leaving no room for any leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Once these two ancestors are under my control, the entire Black
        Heavenly Eagle Clan will also fall effortlessly into my hands.’
      </p>
      <p>As he thought of this, he chuckled.</p>
      <p>
        But at the same time, Gu Changge intended to push his strength to new
        heights just before that happens..
      </p>
      <p>
        And it just so happened that he recently got both Fortune Value and
        Destiny Points.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also obtained much from the two Favoured Daughters of Heaven, from Gu
        Xian’er and Yue Mingkong.

      <p>He opened his attribute panel.</p>

        Gu Changge couldn’t help but express his satisfaction upon seeing his

      <p>“System, exchange for four pieces of transcendent bones.”</p>
      <p>After Gu Changge ordered, 12,000 Fortune Value was consumed.</p>
      <p>Soon, a familiar yet mysterious breath came.</p>
      <p>
        This time, he exchanged for the spinal bones, palm bones, leg bones, and
        skull bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way, every large area of ??his body now had a piece of transcendent
        bone…

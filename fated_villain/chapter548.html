          attracted many Upper Realm forces, was held as scheduled. Dark Kun
          City was even more animated than usual, filled with noise from crowds
          of people while rainbow beams and flying boats flew over it from
          multiple directions to gather here.</span

          specifically displaying the precious rare rocks they had acquired over
          the years, including various divine rocks. The markets were packed to
          the brim and people could be seen within the various palaces and
          pavilions. Not just beings and cultivators from different families had
          joined in the occasion; several lone cultivators from the older
          generation had come here from different locations to pick out any
          unique stones.

          the elite in the Upper Realm in terms of seniority and status, with
          even the Sect Masters and Heads of Families having a lower position
          than them. The Immortal Gu Family, the Immortal Wang Family, Sky

          Hidden An Clan, the Lake of Reincarnation, Primordial Temple, and

          resemble a young emperor. He marched confidently and proudly, while
          exuding an untamed aura. His life force was like a small true dragon

          located in Glorious Sky Domain which had prospered for eons. As
          mountains collapsed and rivers dried over the long passage of time,
          everything else in Glorious Sky Domain had rotted away or became old
          yet it remained incorrupt. There were even stories that the first
          emperor had cut out the Great Yu Immortal Scripture from a rock before
          eventually founding the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span

          present during the war in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, yet
          they had unexpectedly sent someone to the Divine Rock Conference. The
          shock from this occurrence was great, with many cultivators observing

          lightly. Her steps were light and elegant, resembling the beginning of
          the sunrise or even the moonlight. She looked refined and noble, and
          many cultivators unconsciously made way for her. She was Yu Feiya,

          not wish to act conspicuously. Even the Great Yu Immortal Scripture,
          the most mysterious item in the dynasty, had materialised during the
          birth of his sister and gifted her with divine talent. Many Ancestors
          had even claimed that she was a prodigy with the most mysterious
          prodigy they had ever seen.

          mysterious, those ancient beings in their family couldn&#8217;t decide
          at which stage her cultivation was. It was to the point Yu Ming
          considered those new Sacred Emperor Realm experts to be weaker than
          advertised, since they were inferior compared to his sister.</span

          springs, bridges, and mansions. Many stones were placed everywhere

          Some were even too precious for their value to be determined by

          generation, especially those close to their deaths, it was a
          miraculous medicine which could lengthen their lifespan and was far
          more valuable than any other herbs for longevity. Many even ended up
          fighting over it since the Spring had no medicinal properties, meaning
          that the life-extending effects didn&#8217;t diminish no matter how
          much one consumed. If it ever appeared in an auction, a bloodbath

          Spring of Life as big as a fist, exuding the thick aura of life. It
          resembled a lake which reflected light and brightly illuminated the

          to your condition. Are you done being angry now?&#8221; Gu Changge did
          not care about the feelings of everyone around them and smiled lightly
          at her pleased expression.</span

          >&#8220;In your dreams. This isn&#8217;t over yet. Why did you bully
          me three days back, huh?&#8221; She was immediately enraged at his
          mention of the event and a blush appeared on her pale face.</span

          enough?&#8221; He shook his head gently and helplessly.</span

          >&#8220;You wish. I will never let you off that easily.&#8221; She
          glared at him.</span

          for three days?&#8221;</span

          >He had taken the opportunity to teach her a lesson three days ago,
          which infuriated her to the point she refused to acknowledge him. Her
          expression had become stiff, cold, and distant. He had originally been
          too unbothered to pay any attention to this since he had gotten used
          to such occurrences and knew she was merely feeling humiliated and
          would get over it soon. However, considering that he needed to borrow
          her big red bird during the Divine Rock Conference, this
          couldn&#8217;t go on.</span

          >He had gambled with her to place a bet on a rock based on her
          abilities, where he would lose if she gained anything good. He had to
          agree to one condition from her if he lost, while she wasn&#8217;t
          allowed to be angry if he won. At the suggestion of such a sure win
          without any losses from her end, she couldn&#8217;t control herself
          and immediately agreed to it since she considered it a chance to
          finally redeem and avenge herself. That was what had led to the
          current situation.</span

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, in a majestic manor, Tang Wan was still clueless that Chu
                Hao was going to look for her to have her beg Gu Changge to forgive the Vermilion Bird
                Empire.</span><span id="more-29179"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did the family lose so much money recently? This is so
                stupid!&#8221; Sitting before a stone table, Tang Wan was checking the message sent by the Tang Family
                with a scowl. Donning a plain-coloured robe on her glamorous body, she was blessed with beautiful
                eyebrows and pearly white teeth. Even when upset, she still appeared gentle and classy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, she was planning to stay behind in the Vermilion Bird Empire to
                wait for Qin Wuya, her so-called Dao Partner in her previous life, to arrive, as instructed by Gu
                Changge. However, she unexpectedly received a message from the Tang Family.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time ago, her spoiled brother, Tang Tian, found a mysterious scripture.
                It was of an ancient, mythical origin, and after verifying it, Elders of the family inferred it to be an
                Immortal Scripture.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the news left the entire Tang Merchants Family stupefied, but they
                quickly regained their senses and prevented the news from spreading out. Accordingly, the family members
                who cultivated the scripture experienced breakthroughs in their cultivation levels, including those who
                were stuck at a bottleneck for years, and that, naturally, greatly benefited the Tang Family.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, that led to the family members focusing on cultivation instead
                of tending to the family&#8217;s businesses, hence causing a tremendous loss in a short time. Because of
                that, the Old Master of the Tang Family finally thought of her, and summoned her back to the Tang Family
                Manor to have her take over many of the family&#8217;s enterprises.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was supposedly good for Tang Wan, but due to Gu Changge&#8217;s order,
                she was unable to leave the Vermilion Bird Empire for now. As such, she obviously grew perturbed,
                intending to come up with an excuse to tell her family that she couldn&#8217;t return just yet.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Tang, is something troubling you? You look rather tense.&#8221;
                All of a sudden, the voice of a man in grey entered her ears and pulled her back from her daze.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, nothing. It&#8217;s just that my family is caught in between a
                rock and a hard place.&#8221; Tang Wan said with a smile as the gloom on her face instantly
                waned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man in grey that was standing in front of her, although not quite tall,
                he seemed rather chivalric and he gave off the impression that he was an accomplished but amicable
                man.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That man was none other than Qin Wuya, who managed to get close to Tang Wan
                under a disguise.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was unable to find where Sky King Zhi Yang was confined, so he gave up and
                instead, he decided to proceed and fish in troubled waters, while the armies of Purple Mansion and Gu
                Changge were at war.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, considering that he would have to remain in the Vermilion Bird
                Empire for a few days, he came up with numerous ways to approach Tang Wan and stay by her side. As Tang
                Wan was coincidentally recruiting guardians, he took the opportunity and became her guardian. From then
                on, he grew rather close to her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How may I help you, Guardian Qin Ya?&#8221; After withdrawing the
                message in her hands, Tang Wan turned to the man in grey and softly asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unquestionably, she could discern that the person before her eyes was none
                other than Qin Wuya, one of the people who offended Gu Changge, as he was simply in disguise and changed
                his name to &#8216;Qin Ya.&#8217; After all, the familiar sensation that came from the bottom of her
                soul confirmed it. After knowing that Qin Wuya would come looking for her, she, as instructed by Gu
                Changge, made it easy for him to approach her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, nothing, nothing. I was patrolling outside the courtyard and
                happened to catch your grimace. Out of curiosity, I came up to check on you. Please forgive me if I was
                rude to you, Lady Tang.&#8221; Revealing a friendly smile, Qin Wuya apologised.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. Thank you for your concern, Guardian Wu Ya.&#8221; Tang Wan
                nodded as she calmly replied.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyway, Lady Tang, would you care to entertain me with your problems?
                I may be able to lend a hand,&#8221; Qin Wuya then asked, feeling somewhat saddened by Tang Wan&#8217;s
                look of despair.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Tang Wan stared at him as she was taken aback by his offer.
                After a moment of hesitation, since there was nothing to hide, she nodded and confessed,
                &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing huge, to be honest. My family just sent me a message, claiming to be troubled.
                They need me to return promptly, but due to certain reasons, I am unable to leave the Vermilion Bird
                Empire just yet.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see.&#8221; Qin Wuya had a realisation, though his eyes grew
                somewhat dull.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truthfully, he was aware of Tang Wan&#8217;s relationship with Chu Hao.
                Essentially, during their first encounter at the port, the man who was standing by her side was
                precisely the Third Prince of the Vermilion Bird Empire, Chu Hao. And after looking into it, Qin Wuya
                eventually knew about Tang Wan&#8217;s relationship with Chu Hao.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, they had known each other since they were kids, and since then,
                they grew up as each other&#8217;s closest childhood friends. Obviously, Tang Wan carried affection
                towards Chu Hao, and the feeling was reciprocal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Qin Wuya&#8217;s opinion, the &#8216;certain reason&#8217; Tang Wan
                mentioned, which forbade her from leaving the Vermilion Bird Empire must be related to Chu Hao.
                Essentially, the Vermilion Bird Empire was about to fall. It was an outcome even the blind could
                perceive. After all an Immortal War between millions of cultivators would instantaneously obliterate
                something as tiny as the Vermilion Bird Empire.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qin Wuya believes that Chu Hao hoped Tang Wan could use the forces behind her
                to assist him, but Tang Wan&#8217;s family wasn&#8217;t so foolish as to help the Vermilion Bird Empire
                at such a moment. Thus, Tang Wan, unable to forgo Chu Hao, chose not to leave the Vermilion Bird
                Empire.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the truth, those were only Qin Wuya&#8217;s opinions. In that
                instant, he even felt somewhat grateful to Gu Changge. In fact, he never had any fondness towards Chu
                Hao, and the ruination of Vermilion Bird Empire was something he couldn&#8217;t wait to be actualised.
                Besides, he assumed that Chu Hao was the direct, sole reason for Tang Wan&#8217;s agony.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To be frank, Lady Tang, I think you should put family first at such a
                moment, since none could stop the fall of the Vermilion Bird Empire…&#8221; Qin Wuya hesitantly spoke,
                intending to persuade Tang Wan into leaving the region and refrain her from getting involved in the
                matter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before he could finish his sentence, a maid hastily dashed into the
                courtyard and reported, &#8220;Lady Wan, Prince Chu Hao wishes to see you…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chu Hao? Why is he here? No. I&#8217;m not going to see him!&#8221;
                Hearing that, Tang Wan furrowed her brows and immediately rejected. Clearly, she had yet to get over
                with Chu Hao&#8217;s vexing attitude.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not wanting to see him, she had been deliberately avoiding him for days. To
                her, Chu Hao&#8217;s stupidity was incurable, and if he were to go up against Gu Changge, he would only
                be killing himself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wan’er, I came with an urgent matter, and only you alone can save
                me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, before Tang Wan could finish, Chu Hao appeared outside the
                courtyard and barged in through the guards with anxiety all over his face. Due to the graveness of the
                matter, he wouldn&#8217;t have barged in regardless of Tang Wan&#8217;s desire to meet him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chu Hao, I specifically said that I don&#8217;t want to see you, yet
                you stormed in against my will. Are you disrespecting me right in front of my face?&#8221; There was
                nothing but coldness in Tang Wan&#8217;s eyes as she furiously rebuked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wan’er, please calm down and listen to me. I didn&#8217;t barge in
                without a good reason. Right now, you are the only person who can save me and the Vermilion Bird Empire.
                I know you&#8217;re still angry at me. What happened back then was my fault, and I apologise, and I
                swear I&#8217;ll listen to you from now on should any issue arise.&#8221; Knowing that his irrationality
                was the root of the problem, Chu Hao quickly explained himself upon his arrival and blamed everything on
                himself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you really mean it?&#8221; Upon those words, Tang Wan&#8217;s rage
                slightly faded as she assumed that Chu Hao thought things through and intended to compromise with Gu
                Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every word. No lies.&#8221; Chu Hao sincerely nodded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chu Hao?&#8221; Coldness flashed across Qin Wuya’s eyes, who had been
                observing the exchange from the side. He was surprised by Chu Hao&#8217;s disregard of the rules and
                trespass, which made him even more disgusted by Chu Hao.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, as his body flickered, he blinked to the front of Tang Wan and
                coldly reprimanded, &#8220;How dare you barge in against the will of Lady Tang! Are you challenging
                us!?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Chu Hao questioned with an icy frown on his
                dashing face, revealing hostile intent, wondering why such a stranger was by Tang Wan&#8217;s side in
                the courtyard. Prior to that, he had never met Qin Wuya, but he could sense that the latter was only in
                the Enlightened Noble Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;s my guardian who&#8217;s in charge of protecting my
                life.&#8221; Fearing that the two might start a fight, Tang Wan hastily explained.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Chu Hao visibly calmed down as he swiftly disregarded Qin Wuya.
                Due to the urgency at hand, he reckoned it was best to have Tang Wan plead for mercy from Gu
                Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Qin Wuya let out a snicker and refrained from engaging Chu Hao
                out of courtesy for Tang Wan.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Speak. Why do you come for me? What did you mean by saving you and the
                Vermilion Bird Empire?&#8221; After heaving a sigh of relief, Tang Wan turned to Chu Hao and asked. At
                the end of the day, she couldn&#8217;t bring herself to ignore Chu Hao&#8217;s safety.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Purple Mansion&#8217;s army is now approaching the Vermilion Bird
                Empire from the sky, and they will be commencing a war with Gu Changge anytime now. And once the war
                breaks out, the Vermilion Bird Empire would surely be turned into dust. Wan’er, I&#8217;m sure you
                don&#8217;t want the Vermilion Bird Empire to fall, right? You must help me! Please!&#8221; Chu Hao took
                a deep breath as he forced himself to calm down and cut to the chase.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t want the Vermilion Bird Empire to fall, but
                why do you think I can stop all of this?&#8221; Hearing that, Tang Wan subconsciously tensed her brows
                as the matter at hand was certainly a difficult one, since the Tang Merchants Family wouldn&#8217;t dare
                to upset Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge insisted on dealing with Chu Hao on purpose, he wouldn&#8217;t
                need to go through such lengths. In Tang Wan&#8217;s opinion, the war was simply a minor payback from Gu
                Changge, after knowing that Chu Hao intended to take his revenge on him. Either way, Chu Hao must also
                be aware of this. If he had let go of his grudge earlier, things wouldn&#8217;t have escalated this
                way.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sure you have a way. If you were to beg Gu Changge, he
                may forgive the Vermilion Bird Empire. And if he wants me to stand down, as long as he lets Vermilion
                Bird Empire go, the bad blood between him and I shall disperse like smoke…&#8221; After saying that, Chu
                Hao gritted his teeth, and it was apparent how frustrating it was for him to speak those words.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was a prideful man, there was not a chance he would beg and compromise
                with Gu Changge in the past, but given the circumstances, he no longer had a choice.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why did you commit to vengeance if you knew about this…&#8221; Tang
                Wan sighed as she was at a loss for words. Sadly, there was no medicine for remorse.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wan’er, please, you must help me! You are the only one who can help me
                now!&#8221; Chu Hao clenched his teeth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You want me to beg Gu Changge? But, why would he want to see me? Even
                if he agrees to see me, what gives me the right to convince him?&#8221; Tang Wan bitterly smiled out of
                helplessness. Judging by Gu Changge&#8217;s personality, forget his indifference towards her, even if he
                bore any intentions against her, he would never listen to her. At the very least, Tang Wan was aware of
                that.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wan’er, I know that you are close with Gu Changge. He may even
                consider it if it was you who talked to him…&#8221; As Chu Hao said those words, he almost crushed his
                teeth from clenching them. Despite being absolutely humiliated, he was left with no choice but to
                confess everything he saw back then. He always prayed that he didn&#8217;t have to come to this, but
                little did he expect, this was the very day that he had to spill everything he knew right in front of
                Tang Wan.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Back then, after you left the palace, I actually followed you in the
                dark, and I saw what happened between you and Gu Changge. And I knew you must have done that out of
                frustration…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What…&#8221; Upon Chu Hao&#8217;s shameless confession, everyone in
                the courtyard, including Tang Wan and Qin Wuya, were dumbfounded as they couldn&#8217;t believe their
                own ears, especially Tang Wan, who was so impacted that her body trembled and her face turned completely
                pale.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secret she desired to hide from Chu Hao the most, was in fact, known by
                him, and he even knew it all along. And she didn&#8217;t expect that Chu Hao was actually hiding in the
                dark back then, witnessing her every interaction with Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this time, Chu Hao, despite being aware of everything, pretended as if he
                was oblivious, and everything she had done must have been pretentious and ridiculous to him. In that
                instant, unbearable embarrassment took over Tang Wan.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So you have known all along…&#8221; With that in mind, Tang Wan
                revealed a cold smile, which would grow into an incredibly icy grin.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, I&#8217;ve always been this sycophantic bitch in your
                eyes, huh? Yes, you are right. I did visit Gu Changge just to ingratiate him that day, and as long as I
                gain his favour, not only I, but the whole Tang Family, will get to enjoy eternal prosperity and wealth.
                As for you, a mere prince of an insignificant empire, what can you offer me? You couldn&#8217;t enter
                the Tang Family even if you wanted to…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wan’er… I know that isn&#8217;t the real you! I know you didn&#8217;t
                do it for good reasons!&#8221; Chu Hao was dazed. He didn&#8217;t expect Tang Wan to react so
                dramatically to his confession.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he wished to explain himself, Tang Wan&#8217;s stone cold eyes were
                glaring at him as if he was a total stranger, and her words were especially piercing to Chu Hao&#8217;s
                ears. Such a scenario, in addition to those words, was the very situation the Vermilion Bird Empire was
                facing.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chu Hao, shut your mouth! Do you still think you qualify as a
                man?&#8221; At that moment, Qin Wuya&#8217;s eyes also reddened as he gazed at Chu Hao, and he
                didn&#8217;t expect he would ever get to hear those words.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Chu Hao is undeserving of Tang Wan&#8217;s feelings for him. Despite knowing
                her agony and frustration, he is now asking her to beg Gu Changge for mercy?] From Chu Hao&#8217;s
                words, Qin Wuya figured out that Gu Changge must be threatening Tang Wan with her family in order to
                coerce her into obeying him. Even so, from the way Chu Hao was speaking, it seems as though there was
                intimate interaction between Tang Wan and Gu Changge! Intimate enough for Gu Changge to move for Tang
                Wan.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking that, Qin Wuya grew even more furious. He had not been there to
                protect Tang Wan, and now, Chu Hao even came to break her heart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* In that instant, a terrifying aura erupted as Qin Wuya immediately
                attacked Chu Hao. An overbearing divine ability that covered the sky turned into a golden giant bell and
                plummeted down, like the current of a waterfall. His strength undoubtedly rivalled that of an Sacred
                Emperor Realm expert, and he was confident that he could take on Chu Hao without any issue.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Argh…&#8221; Having been assaulted when his guards were down, Chu Hao
                took a clean blow and was sent flying away, his body almost exploding to pieces. It now appeared
                incomparably miserable. The buildings and pavilions nearby all instantly exploded and
                disintegrated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qin Wuya&#8217;s strike of fury could not be dealt with by an ordinary expert
                in the Sacred King Realm. If it weren&#8217;t for his reluctance to destroy the area, the entire
                Vermilion Bird Empire would have been completely wiped out.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sacred King Realm!? Damn it, who are you! There shouldn&#8217;t be
                such a strong cultivator by Wan’er&#8217;s side!&#8221; Chu Hao strenuously got back on his feet as he
                was drenched in blood. Clenching his teeth and shooting Qin Wuya a death stare, he was infuriated. After
                all, how could he forgive such a sneak attack aimed to kill him?</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, Chu Hao, too, retaliated, displaying formidable abilities. The might
                of the Sacred King Realm gushed into the air and aggressively charged towards Qin Wuya. The two
                Fortuitous Ones ultimately started a brawl, and their abilities were truly frightening and
                spine-chilling.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speechless, Tang Wan wordlessly peered at the fight, not knowing what to
                do.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right as Chu Hao and Qin Wuya were beginning to fight, an alarming shockwave
                came from the distant sky. A shocking aura suddenly plunged downwards, causing stars to tremble, as
                though they were about to fall. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The universe quaked as worlds twisted, and endless battlecries could be heard
                coming from that direction. None could imagine what kind of war was taking place there as
                &#8216;absolute chaos&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t even be an overstatement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A figure with a hazy face could be seen standing on an ancient battleship.
                With vibrant lights wafting around its swaying, snowy garment, the figure appeared abnormally
                extraordinary.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tang Wan sure didn&#8217;t let me down…&#8221; Gu Changge revealed an
                enthralling grin. After receiving a hint from the System, he waved his hand, and at once, the army of
                million behind him charged towards Purple Mansion&#8217;s army.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great war finally commenced, and it was a fine opportunity to witness the
                result of Hei Yanyu&#8217;s training after all this time. Nonetheless, the Fortuity of the Fortuitous
                Ones, which were diminishing by fighting against each other, fell into Gu Changge&#8217;s possession,
                and that was rather convenient since he did not expect that to happen.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* The army of cultivators stormed out like raging waters, and the
                weakest among them were training-hardened beings in the Partial-Enlightened Realm. Charging out of
                ancient battleships, they aggressively charged forward with ancient weapons in hand. As heavenly lights
                and murderous auras engulfed the sky, it was as if the cultivators were beings that returned from
                hell.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every mount on the battlefield were pure-blooded creatures bred by various
                Celestial Ancient Races since they were young, and there were massive runes with godly gleams on their
                incomparably sturdy armours.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the cultivators were charging, they conjured out all kinds of arrays. As
                they were working with one another, their intimidating aura rose to the sky, and even beings of higher
                cultivation level would be too afraid to fight them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Purple Mansion&#8217;s army was surprised by how
                domineering Gu Changge&#8217;s forces were. He didn&#8217;t even give them the chance to react as he
                commanded his army to charge right away. Their plans of rescuing Sky King Zhi Yang was completely foiled
                as their whole army was completely overwhelmed by Gu Changge’s forces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Chu Hao, who was battling Qin Wuya, lost all hope, stunned by
                how Gu Changge didn&#8217;t spare him the chance to save his empire.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No…&#8221; He instinctively roared. His eyes reddened as if he was a
                beast facing its death.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Get Sky King Zhi Yang.&#8221; Gu Changge stood on the front deck of
                the ancient battleship with his arms behind his back. Upon his order, a prison cage was swiftly pushed
                out to the open, and inside it was an unconscious Sky King Zhi Yang, whose entire body was covered in
                blood.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you wish to save him, you may try,&#8221; Gu Changge leisurely
                stated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu is extremely frightening at moments like this. He can
                subdue all souls just by sheer will alone…&#8221; Standing far away on the ancient battleship and
                observing the scene, Xiao Ruoyin felt a chill up her spine as her face turned pale. It was her first
                time witnessing such a massive, terrifying war. The young man in front of her decided the fate of
                countless beings, so casually without the slightest change in his eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!*</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon Gu Changge&#8217;s words, ancient battleships began to tremble as
                ancient heavenly arrays emitted vibrant lights. Innumerable intertwining beams that resembled stars form
                a blinding sword, overflowing with a murderous intent, which would engulf all directions and tear the
                world apart. He then struck the sword towards Purple Mansion&#8217;s army.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a sight was truly astounding.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blinding sword harboured power exceeding the Sacred Realm. It could even
                disintegrate those in the Sacred King Realm that dared to get close, and all around it would be affected
                by its might. The Chaos Energy in front of the blinding sword started to billow as the world was split,
                almost breaking apart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, Purple Mansion&#8217;s army was annihilated as thousands of
                cultivators instantaneously disintegrated, turning into ashes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shockwave spread out, and countless territories of the Vermilion Bird
                Empire were quickly broken into pieces, as though they were porcelains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No…&#8221; Seeing that, the Vermilion Bird Emperor, thoroughly
                devastated, immediately passed out. Countless cultivators in the distant empires were also dumbstruck by
                what they saw, falling to their knees.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Out of nowhere, a daunting aura could be sensed coming towards this
                direction as a stupefying aura suddenly surged amid the vast army of Purple Mansion.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Sacred Emperor Realm experts had appeared.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Family&#8217;s brat, don&#8217;t you get ahead of yourself!&#8221;
                From the depths, a menacing sword energy as gigantic as mountains and seas appeared, destroying stars in
                the distant sky with just a trace of its energy. The sword energy was followed by the appearance of a
                grand figure, whose cultivation level was shockingly in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm!</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Quasi-Nirvana Realm Master was the very last hope of Purple Mansion to
                save themselves. He was their strongest and ultimate force.</span></p>

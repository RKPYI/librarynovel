        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, Gu Qingyi left along with the little Wang Yue.</span><span id="more-34832"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except for Gu Changge and a few members of the Gu Family, no one knew where she was headed to. But of course, in the Gu Family, most of the members had always been unaware of her existence, so there was no way they could even care about her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is this best? Why can&#8217;t I remember it?] Gu Changge constantly pondered about the matter with a frown on his way back to the Gu Family Residence. He had an intuition that it was something great, as it was hinted that a secret of the world was involved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Gu Qingyi didn&#8217;t go through the details and simply left after she briefly brought it up. Her body turned into a drizzle of light and scattered away along the wind, as if she had never existed at all. In that instant, she even erased all the tracks of her existence in this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, to Gu Changge, it felt as though she was merely saying those words out of whim without any actual meaning behind it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;ll remember eventually? Was she referring to the memory of when I was the Demon Lord?] Shaking his head, Gu Changge quickly tossed the matter aside without dwelling on it. Since fate was inevitable, there was no point in stressing himself over it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Gu Qingyi&#8217;s warning regarding the turmoil that would soon arise in the Upper Realm as well as the emergence of the Immortal Domain, those were what piqued his interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one hand, the Epoch Dao Fruit he had obtained would mature soon, which would allow him to set up a world-shocking situation and draw powerful figures of Forces of the Upper Realm to go to him and help him enter the Immortal Domain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the turmoil in the Upper Realm would make a rare and fine opportunity for the manifestation of Dark Heaven.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The opportunity to achieve Immortality in the Upper Realm lies within the Epoch Dao Fruit. Without my permission, how can anyone actually become an Immortal?] Numerous thoughts flashed across Gu Changge&#8217;s mind, but he wasn&#8217;t worried about them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the Tree of Epoch, which the forces and factions of the Upper Realm were seeking for, which sparked the war against the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, was now resting in his Inner Universe, growing amid dense Chaos Qi and condensing essence of black and yellow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, within the Epoch Dao Fruit of that spectacular unwavering tree also contained the World Principles that the Upper Realm had lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was confident that an enormous disturbance would break out in the Upper Realm if he were to spread the news regarding the Tree of Epoch, which would result in endless storms of blood. Hence, before that, he would have to make his preparations meticulously to combat any potential threat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As of now, although the path to Immortality has yet to open up, some powers that have reached the Immortal Realm must be lying within the Immortal Forces. They must be Forces that have a significant connection to the Immortal Domain. Naturally, they must possess plenty of  Immortal Grade Artifacts.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[According to the ancient books, the Upper Realm was also known as the Ancestral Land. Even after the Forbidden Epoch, the Upper Realm remained tightly connected to the Immortal Domain, but after so long, numerous beings from the Upper Realm must have found various methods to enter the Immortal Domain. So, these two places always preserve a connection to each other, even after the Forbidden Epoch] With that in mind, Gu Changge slightly tensed his brows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the depth of the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s power and secrets were beyond imagination, since they also bore countless connections to the Immortal Domain, making them the most difficult Force to see through, that didn&#8217;t mean that they also possessed the strength to antagonise the entire Upper Realm, since that would be completely unrealistic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning to the Immortal Gu Family Residence, Gu Changge headed to the Hidden Ancient Library to read through some ancient text, intending to find fragments of information regarding the Immortal Domain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, he came across a fascinating secret—eighty million years ago, the Immortal Domain had once invited the Immortal Gu Family into it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the World Principles back then were not complete, hence their entrance into the Immortal Domain failed as the Immortal Path had been fractured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such an incident was clearly recorded. Back then, the Immortal Gate even appeared to lead the many elites and new blood of the Gu Family to the Immortal Domain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In that case, perhaps some accident had occurred within the Immortal Domain?&#8221; Gu Changge subtly scowled. From what he read, it seems like reaching the Immortal Domain depended on someone else. It would be rather difficult for him to get there by himself. It was clear that it would be hard to do it himself, owing to the fact that there were basically no clues to it in this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Remnant Immortals could only remain frustrated as they had no way to locate the position of the Immortal Domain. Some of the ancient beings that mastered Dao of Deduction didn&#8217;t even dare to risk their lives to get a glimpse of information related to the Immortal Domain. After all, since ancient times, there had been countless cultivators who were struck by lightning as a result of revealing Heavenly Secrets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s father, Bai Kun, and her junior, Bai Hua, are quite proficient in the Dao of Deduction. Perhaps I could have them try it.] Gu Changge remembered the method he had used to threaten Bai Lian&#8217;er back when he was heading to the Demon World back then.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he remembered correctly, Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s father, Bai Kun, was someone who possessed the Talent to glimpse at Heavenly Secrets. Back in the Chaos Star Territory, Bai Kun even ordered Bandit Thirteen to acquire his Chaos Purple Scripture.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Bai Hua possessed the highly mysterious Heaven&#8217;s Physique, meaning she could shatter all illusions that kept Heavenly Secrets from being known. Furthermore, she had inherited Bai Kun&#8217;s mantle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge was using those two as functional hostages against Bai Lian&#8217;er, he refrained from killing them. Although she showed no resistance, he, being a cautious man, ordered his men to keep the two men under surveillance at all times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As for Mirror of Wonders and Spacetime Stone, I wonder if I could use them to find the Spacetime Coordinate and return back in time. No… that should be avoided] Since he was thinking about methods, he was reminded of the two Artifacts he obtained after killing the Fortuitous Ones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, in order to activate these Artifacts and travel through the River of Time, not only would it require immense strength, but a precise Spacetime Coordinate was also necessary. Otherwise, he would be lost in the River of Time, unable to return to his current time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, even if he were to return in time, his actions wouldn&#8217;t be able to alter anything in the past as he would only be a passerby that could only witness history set in stone. Or else, a minor action would lead to an reaction as massive as a disaster, causing the Great Dao  to be affected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There&#8217;s no need to rush since I&#8217;ve yet to achieve the Peak of the Nirvana Realm. Besides, I&#8217;ll need to at least reach the Immortal Realm by the time I try to go through the Immortal Gate.] Gu Changge shook his head and temporarily set the matter aside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he was finished with certain arrangements, he began contemplating another matter. After entering Immortal Realm, he would definitely advance towards Immortal Domain, so the Forces and power he left behind in the Upper Realm would have to be tended to by someone else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unquestionably, Jiang Chuchu would be in charge of Mortal Palace, while Yin Mei would take responsibility for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Alliance of Thousand Merchants and the Celestial Ancient Continent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest would probably have to be handed to Yue Mingkong, who would soon officially become the true ruler of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time ago, Emperor Yue of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty sent his men to inquire about the date of his and Yue Mingkong&#8217;s marriage. Gu Changge had promised Yue Mingkong that he would discuss their marriage with her after he was done dealing with the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. However, given the current circumstances, there were some things else Gu Changge had to tend to, so he might have to defer the discussion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had to visit the Eternal Overcast Kingdom since the Eternal Overcast Sources were entities even rarer than the World Sources, that could help him enhance his Grand Flask. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, there was news regarding the recipe for Violet Supreme Alchemy Pill, which he had Lin Qiuhan look into.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Violet Supreme Alchemy Pill, as an Immortal Pill that existed within legends, had limitless uses and inexplicable effects, and it was even said to be able to help cultivators grow exponentially. Even though that was merely a rumour, its wonders were evident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Upper Realm, there were Nine Great Immortal Pills. The recipes for them had once drawn the jealousy of gods hence were struck by lightning into ashes, and their existence faded away in the River of Time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, those who possessed unequalled divine abilities came up with every way to gather those recipes, only to lose them in the end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge himself might not need such pills, there was no telling when he might leave the Upper Realm and enter the Immortal Domain. So, for the women he had &#8216;gathered&#8217;, they might be able to use them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, he remained interested in the Violet Supreme Alchemy Pill. After receiving Lin Qiuhan&#8217;s news from Violet Supreme Alchemy Sect, he immediately ordered his men to search for the recipes&#8217; whereabouts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, after delegating the many tasks to his subordinates, Gu Changge began moving towards the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when he was still in Profound Sword World, he had his men deliver the Seven Tools of World Domination to Yue Mingkong and asked her to forge the key. Currently, he had no clue how far Yue Mingkong had progressed in this matter.</span></p>

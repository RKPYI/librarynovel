          slightly and said, “Should the opportunity arises, of course I would
          do that.” After saying that, he tilted his head back and downed the
          entire cup of wine in one gulp.</span

          >The Sky Deer Goddess was seated next to him. Her lustrous black hair
          cascaded down her back, framing her immaculate porcelain face, while
          her long, slender legs peeked through the slit of her full-length
          skirt.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Noticing that Gu Changge’s wine cup was empty, she gracefully
          refilled it, like a loving and gentle wife. From time to time, she
          would delicately lift her jade chopsticks and carefully select a piece
          of glowing meat before offering it to Gu Changge’s waiting
          mouth.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even the Third Mountain Elder couldn’t help but feel a tinge of envy
          as he watched. The Sky Deer Goddess was a True Daoist with
          unparalleled abilities, and her power was on par with his own.
          Millions of cultivators from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were
          not even worthy enough to catch a glimpse of her divine
          presence.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Sky Deer Goddess covered her lips, smiling shyly as she said, “I
          feel the same way.”</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She then turned to look at Gu Changge with her glowing eyes and
          asked, “Don’t you think so too, my dear?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge knew where she was going with this, but he had no interest
          in dealing with her until he had the Celestial Seal of the Nine
          Mountains in his possession. Despite his reservations, he wore a
          gentle expression on his face and replied, “Of course, but only if you
          continue to behave and not try anything funny.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What do you mean by that, my dear? Do you still doubt me after all
          this time?” The Sky Deer Goddess gave him a hurtful look.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Why would I doubt you?” Gu Changge chuckled, but his expression did
          not change much.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Third Mountain Elder felt as though he had stumbled upon a secret
          shared between the two. He refrained from asking any questions, but
          there was a look of embarrassment on his face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >While the Third Mountain was full of life and joy, the Second
          Mountain was bleak and somber. Upon returning to the Second Mountain
          with Xiao Yang, the Second Mountain Elder returned to the chamber
          where he usually cultivated</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All the disciples of the Second Mountain were aware of what had gone
          down earlier today but none dared to ask a single question about
          it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The mountain range was pretty quiet, even the usual sounds of animals
          and birds had vanished. Clouds gently floated among the sea of stars
          that twinkled dimly in the sky, revealing magnificent galaxies in the
          distance.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Dressed in plain clothes, Xiao Yang stood in front of a grave
          situated at the back of the mountain with a pained expression on his
          face. Gu Changge killed Chen Suyun with a single blow of his spear. He
          had completely destroyed both her body and spirit, leaving nothing
          behind. Even the Quasi-Nirvana Grade artifact she usually carried with
          her was shattered into fragments during the battle. He had nothing but
          the clothes she used to wear to put into her grave.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although he had regained his composure, it was difficult to conceal
          the sorrow and hatred he felt within. “Rest assured, Eldest Senior
          Sister, I’ll definitely avenge you. If I, Xiao Yang, fail to do so in
          this lifetime, I would consider myself unworthy of being called a
          human,” he swore under his breath and clenched his fists so tightly
          that the sound of his knuckles cracking echoed in the air.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even now in his mind, he could still see the tragic look on his
          Eldest Senior Sister’s face and the indifference on Gu Changge’s face
          as he killed her like he was trampling on an ant. It was just
          difficult for him to calm down.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!!* It was at this moment, Xiao Yang detected a fluctuation
          behind him. The Second Mountain Elder showed up, gazing at the grave
          in front of him with a mixture of emotions on his face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Master.” Xiao Yang turned his head around to glance at the Second
          Mountain Elder. Although he knew there was a reason behind the Elder’s
          decision to withdraw earlier today, he couldn&#8217;t help feeling
          disappointed. He had thought that his Master, the Second Mountain
          Elder, would avenge his Eldest Senior Sister. Yet his Master chose to
          withdraw instead of fighting Gu Changge. His decision had led to
          rumors among the Nine Great Mountains that many disciples believed
          that the Second Mountain Elder was scared of Gu Changgge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I know what you’re thinking, but you should know that you must not
          seek revenge until you become a True Daoist. That young man is
          extremely powerful. Even I perceive him as a threat.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Second Mountain Elder knew what Xiao Yang was thinking. He
          produced a silver battle suit from his sleeve and handed it to him.
          The ancient silver battle suit was adorned with intricate runes that
          shimmered like a radiant moon in the dark sky.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I understand, Master, but what is this?” Xiao Yang nodded and
          accepted the silver battle suit. He couldn’t help but feel a little
          perplexed as to why his Master would give him such an armor at this
          particular moment. Up until now, he had given him quite a few
          treasures and artifacts.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“This is the Silver Moon Battle Suit, which I crafted after defeating
          a mighty Silver Moon Wolf God that was as strong as a True Daoist.
          While you may not be able to fully take advantage of it at your
          current strength, it should provide ample protection against most
          attacks.” the Second Mountain Elder explained.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Thank you very much, Master.” Xiao Yang quickly put on the Silver
          Moon Battle Suit. With his robe covering it, no one could tell that he
          was wearing a Nirvana Grade battle suit under it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I was deducing the match between you and Gu Wudi the day after
          tomorrow. An unexpected anomaly has shown up, causing destiny to be
          unclear. It made me a little worried, so I figured that providing you
          additional protection might increase your chances of winning.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Second Mountain Elder nodded with satisfaction before speaking in
          a serious tone, “I have a feeling that the young man we encountered
          today will meddle in this affair. His reasons for coming to the Nine
          Great Mountains are likely not so simple.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Master, you can rest assured that I won&#8217;t lose. If Gu Wudi is
          suppressed to the same realm as me, I have the confidence to defeat
          him, not to mention withstand three strikes from him.” Xiao Yang was
          brimming with confidence, and his words were resonating with
          power.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Second Mountain Elder breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing this
          and handed a few more powerful artifacts to Xiao Yang. “Your bloodline
          holds immense power, but it&#8217;s crucial that you locate your blood
          related clansmen without delay. With their support, you can harness
          the full potential of your bloodline&#8217;s abilities. As for me,
          I&#8217;ve only limited knowledge on this matter and won&#8217;t be of
          much assistance to you… It would be ideal if you can locate the
          Supreme Mountain Elder, but even I am unaware of his whereabouts after
          all these years.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He then began telling Xiao Yang other matters in a serious manner.
          Xiao Yang nodded as he listened, recognizing the importance of the
          matter at hand.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the Second Mountain Elder briefed Xiao Yang, Gu Changge was also
          briefing Gu Wudi in a grand hall on the Third Mountain. “Rest assured,
          Young Master. Xiao Yang is merely in the Saint Realm. Even if I
          suppress my cultivation realm to match his, he still won’t be a match
          for me.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Wudi wore a golden battle suit that radiated a divine glow, making
          him shone like a brilliant golden sun that was impossible to miss.
          Though he could not compare himself to Gu Changge, dealing with
          someone like Xiao Yang was no challenge for him. Hence, he wasn’t sure
          why Gu Changge wanted to have a private conversation with him over
          this. Nevertheless, he remained respectful toward him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You’re no match for him.” Gu Changge shook his head, a strange light
          glowed in his eyes as he appeared to be deep in thought.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains played a big part in his
          mission to destroy the Nine Great Mountains. If it fell into the
          possession of the Second Mountain Elder, it would undoubtedly cause
          him more trouble.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If that wasn’t the case, he wouldn’t even be interested in the
          contest between Gu Wuyi and Xiao Yang. This was why he needed to make
          sure that Gu Wudi would win and keep the Celestial Seal of the Nine
          Mountains away from the Second Mountain Elder.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge’s unexpected remark left Gu Wudi momentarily speechless,
          but he quickly recovered and responded with a sharp retort. “Young
          Master, I’m in the Sacred King Realm. Even if I&#8217;m suppressed to
          the Saint Realm, my comprehension on techniques and Principles are
          still superior to Xiao Yang’s. Why did you say that I am no match for
          him?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was a proud man. Although Gu Changge had control over his life and
          death, he refused to acknowledge the fact that he was inferior to Xiao
          Yang.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge shot him a look of indifference and said, “If you don’t
          believe me, then you can try the day after tomorrow. But if you fail
          to obtain the Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains, you’re as good as
          dead.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Wudi&#8217;s face contorted with fear and he felt a chill down his
          spine, as he realized the gravity of this matter to Gu Changge. “Of
          course not, I’ll do everything in my power to obtain the Celestial
          Seal of the Nine Mountains for you,” he hurriedly added.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge nodded, then proceeded to draw something in the air. A
          glowing Grand Rune appeared, exuding an indescribably formidable
          energy.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A tiny golden figure, fierce and powerful, seemed to traverse through
          the layers of space. Despite being blurry, the figure emanated an aura
          of immense strength. The space around it became distorted and almost
          collapsed under its presence.</span

          was almost compelled to kneel and bow before the tiny figure in front
          of him. Its unparalleled power shook him to his core.</span

          >Gu Changge saw the terror that Gu Wudi failed to conceal and said
          indifferently, “I’ll take control of your body when you fight Xiao
          Yang the day after tomorrow.”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Alright.” Gu Wudi nodded, his expression returning to normal. Upon
          further inspection, he found nothing unusual with his body. Even so,
          Gu Changge’s mysterious ability frightened him. Out of all the
          abilities he had heard of, he had never witnessed anyone who could
          control another person’s body solely through their thoughts.</span

          >Two days passed quickly. A large crowd had gathered once again at the
          peak of an incredibly high mountain among the Nine Great
          Mountains.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unlike the battle between the Sky Deer Goddess and Chen Suyun which
          took place three days ago, this was an internal contest to decide
          ownership of the Celestial Seal of Nine Mountains.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Standing on opposite sides were Xiao Yang, the last disciple of the
          Second Mountain Elder, and Gu Wudi, the Third Mountain Elder’s
          favorite disciple who was also known as the Chosen One.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The two would be fighting for the right to the Celestial Seal of the
          Nine Mountains. To make this a fair battle, Gu Wudi had to suppress
          his cultivation realm to match Xiao Yang’s. If Xiao Yang could
          withstand three strikes from him, then he would have to give up the
          Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Almost all the Mountain Elders had gathered in their true appearance
          to observe the fight, demonstrating the significant value they placed
          on this matter.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many disciples had gathered around the peak. Divine rainbows
          continued to appear in the sky as disciples who had missed the battle
          three days also came to spectate.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Today marked the most important day in this era for the Nine Great
          Mountains.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Celestial Seal represented the fortuity and destiny of the Nine
          Great Mountains. It was believed that within the confines of these
          mountains, one could receive blessings of this place and become
          invincible.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before long, many disciples from the Second Mountain arrived. Among
          them was Xiao Yang, who was dressed in a green robe, standing tall
          with a composed demeanor. It was clear that the incident three days
          had affected him greatly. Despite his composure, a trace of coldness
          still flickered in his eyes whenever he gazed at the Third
          Mountain.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite Gu Changge’s murder of his Eldest Senior Sister, the Third
          Mountain Elder showed no concern and even went as far as to host a
          celebratory banquet for the Sky Deer Goddess. The news had spread
          throughout the Nine Great Mountains in the past two days, upsetting
          many disciples from the Second Mountain.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Therefore, Xiao Yang was determined to teach Gu Wudi an unforgettable
          lesson today, so that the Third Mountain would regret their
          actions.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Standing behind Xiao Yang was the Second Mountain Elder, dressed in
          elegant white robes with wide sleeves that added a touch of grandeur
          to his appearance. However, his facial expression remained tense and
          uneasy.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Rest assured, Master. I know exactly what I must do.” Xiao Yang
          nodded before his figure vanished and reappeared in the arena.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          from the Third Mountain also arrived in the vicinity.</span

          the arena, with the Third Mountain Elder and the others following
          closely behind them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All the other disciples and Mountain Elders gazed at them with
          varying expressions on their faces. Some looked angry, others had
          darkened expressions, some were fearful, but most of them had
          conflicted looks.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Third Mountain Elder&#8217;s close relationship with Gu Changge
          and the others came as a surprise to all of them. It was definitely
          not a good sign.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge scanned the Mountain Elders from his elevated position and
          noticed that they had all assembled. A smile crept onto his face as he
          waited for the final moment.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Youngest Junior Brother, I hope you won’t regret this
          decision.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After landing on the arena, Gu Wudi’s face broke into a cold smile.
          His armor was magnificent, radiating a dazzling golden light that made
          him appear god-like. He exuded a sense of power and invincibility that
          left everyone in awe.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          he would emerge victorious today.</span

          >“Cut the crap, let&#8217;s begin.” Xiao Yang&#8217;s tone was icy as
          he glanced up at Gu Changge on the elevated platform. His eyes were
          frigid, and he shared the same sentiments as Gu Wudi.</span

      <h4>
        Chapter 240: Not Human Ancestor but such a person, as if it was left for
        her
      </h4>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu was stunned, looking at Gu Changge's gesture
        of helping pin her hair, her expression was even more complicated.
      </p>
      <p>She didn't expect Gu Changge to act so gently.</p>
      <p>
        For a while, she was a little flattered, because Gu Changge was usually
        a cold and heartless person, and she could never see the slightest
        warmth in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>"What can you do?"</p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu looked at him with sparkling eyes.</p>
      <p>
        She didn't know why, but her voice lowered, and it was not as cold and
        hard as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge smiled slightly and said, "The method is very
        simple."
      </p>
      <p>"Isn't it the Human Ancestor? The world needs such a belief."</p>
      <p>
        "Now, apart from you and me, who knows that he has been killed by me? As
        for the Human Ancestor Hall behind you, they won't know about it. You
        can rest assured about my methods."
      </p>
      <p>
        "So, no one other than you and me will know that Human Ancestor is
        dead."
      </p>
      <p>
        "What all creatures in the world need is not the Human Ancestor himself,
        but a person like Human Ancestor."
      </p>
      <p>With a smile, he was persuasive.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, if he hadn't killed Human Ancestor, there wouldn't be so many
        things.
      </p>
      <p>However, he murdered her Human Ancestor on the one hand.</p>
      <p>But now, he was kindly helping Jiang Chuchu.</p>
      <p>
        If there were still outsiders at this moment, they would be horrified to
        hear this, their eyes would widen, and a terrifying chill would appear,
        thinking that Gu Changge must be crazy.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu was also stunned, and her eyes widened.</p>
      <p>She quickly shook her head.</p>
      <p>
        "No… how can this be… Human Ancestor is irreplaceable, how can you find
        someone to disguise him?"
      </p>
      <p>"In this way, what's the difference between me and a traitor?"</p>
      <p>
        She gritted her teeth, rejected Gu Changge's statement, and disagreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's interruption was to find someone to act as Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was as if he had now found someone who was pretending to be a
        descendant from the Human Ancestor hall, walking the world, and
        deceiving every creature.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of thing made Jiang Chuchu uneasy, not only betraying her
        sect, but it was more like she and Gu Changge were in the same boat and
        went down the wrong path together.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was more likely that she and Gu Changge murdered the Human Ancestor
        and replaced him.
      </p>
      <p>This was something she didn't want to accept.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing that Gu Changge was not surprised. If Jiang Chuchu agreed like
        this, then he would be really surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't change his smile and continued, "I just thought of a way for
        you. As for whether you accept it or not, that's your problem."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And it's a good thing for me that the Human Ancestor Hall is falling
        apart. I can just let it go. So, don't try to make me accommodate you."
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu went silent with a complicated expression.</p>
      <p>
        She knew what Gu Changge meant, what did the existence of the Human
        Ancestor Hall have to do with Gu Changge?
      </p>
      <p>He just killed him with his hands.</p>
      <p>
        At that time, who would know that he killed the Human Ancestor, and who
        would know that he was the inheritor of demonic art?
      </p>
      <p>In this case, why would Gu Changge ask for trouble?</p>
      <p>
        For a while, Jiang Chuchu was a little stunned that Gu Changge said this
        because of her relationship.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Speaking of which, Gu Changge didn't do anything after that, except that
        he treated her badly at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        She did have deep malice towards Gu Changge from the very beginning, not
        believing that he would be a good person.
      </p>
      <p>In fact, in some ways, he was still bad in the end.</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Jiang Chuchu's expression was extremely complicated,
        and so was his mood.
      </p>
      <p>
        But… she really couldn't do this kind of betrayal to her sect and join
        forces with this demon.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, you should kill me!"</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, after thinking about it for a long time, Jiang Chuchu decided
        and planned to die.
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, Gu Changge frowned.</p>
      <p>
        The smile on his face also disappeared, and he became indifferent,
        "Jiang Chuchu, don't try to challenge my patience."
      </p>
      <p>This time, he directly addressed Jiang Chuchu by her full name.</p>
      <p>Before that, he always called her Holy Maiden Chuchu.</p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu's expression had returned to calm, but changed again.</p>
      <p>
        She naturally felt the difference in this title, and it was obvious that
        her disrespect made Gu Changge a little angry.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, she couldn't tell whether it was Gu Changge's kindness or
        something.
      </p>
      <p>Then, Jiang Chuchu gritted her teeth slightly,</p>
      <p>
        "Don't force me, Gu Changge, I'd rather die of old age than betray my
        Master. You killed the Human Ancestor, and I didn't take action against
        you…"
      </p>
      <p>"Speak like this if you dare to attack me."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge interrupted her indifferently, and then said lightly, "You
        want to die, but I wouldn't kill you. In other words, you used to be
        dead, and now this life is given to you by me."
      </p>
      <p>"What do you want to use it for? Without my permission?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu's eyes suddenly widened, and she was
        obviously stunned.
      </p>
      <p>Why did it sound like it made sense?</p>
      <p>But this was obviously because it was Gu Changge's words.</p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, Gu Changge waved his sleeves, and the portal to his
        Inner Universe suddenly opened, and he casually threw Jiang Chuchu in.
      </p>
      <p>Then, he also walked in.</p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, you are despicable and shameless…"</p>
      <p>
        And soon, in the Inner Universe, Jiang Chuchu was so angry that she
        couldn't help shouting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The calm state of mind that she practiced in the past was completely
        useless in front of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>In the deepest part of the Netherland Heavenly Pond.</p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi, who has been protecting Jiang Yang, looked a little tired. At
        this moment, she suddenly felt the chaotic mist in front of her
        disperse, and she couldn't help showing joy.
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Yang, you succeeded…"</p>
      <p>
        However, before she could finish her words, she froze there and was
        extremely horrified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her eyes widened, and she stared at Gu Changge who came out of it in
        astonishment. She couldn't believe that this scene would be real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wasn't this Immortal already rumored to have fallen into the Netherland
        Heavenly Pond and was trapped to death by Jiang Yang?
      </p>
      <p>But now, how could he suddenly come out of it?</p>
      <p>What about Jiang Yang?</p>
      <p>Nine times out of ten, the odds were worse.</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"Not good……"</p>
      <p>
        Zhao Yi's expression was so horrified that she subconsciously planned to
        deal with Gu Changge by using the method taught by Jiang Yang to
        activate the Immortal Lun Seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the next moment, before she had time to react, her eyes went
        dark, and she felt a giant hand that covered the sky approaching and
        covering her in an instant.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Puff!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, Zhao Yi was desperate and couldn't help begging for
        mercy.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Mr. Immortal, please spare me! All of this was arranged by Jiang Yang,
        and it has nothing to do with me…"
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn't bear the fluctuation, and her body exploded instantly. Gu
        Changge intended to keep her True Spirit alive, just to cause trouble
        for Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Jiang Yang was dead, there was no need for Zhao Yi to stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately, her soul was smashed into ashes, and her body and spirit
        were both destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The artifact spirit in the Immortal Lun Seal also sensed that something
        was wrong, and wanted to take the opportunity to break through the void
        and escape, but Gu Changge had already expected it.
      </p>
      <p>The Golden Divine Weapon Collection unfolded!</p>
      <p>
        The vast world in the middle was like a picture scroll, covering all
        directions, and the heaven and earth hum with a mighty sound, opening up
        the endless brilliance!
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately Immortal Lun Seal was unable to escape, and fell directly
        into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Gu Changge received this Supreme weapon, he was not in a hurry to
        refine it, because now he still had things to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Jiang Chuchu, he was not in a hurry, knowing that she would
        choose sooner or later.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        And soon, the terrifying gray fog over the Netherland Heavenly Pond
        became even more astonishing and monstrous, and could almost break
        through outside the realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a faraway place, many powerful cultivators looked here, their
        expressions still horrified, and it was difficult for them to calm down
        for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, the terrifying aura of the Netherland Heavenly Pond swept
        in all directions like a big wave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, many cultivators who were planning to come to find out were
        stopped, and it was difficult to get close.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were also subordinates dispatched by Yue Mingkong to be in charge
        of guarding in the four directions, but no one dared to break in. Now,
        in this situation, it must be a dead end.
      </p>
      <p>"Jiang Yang's aura disappeared… What happened?"</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong frowned, and then her figure flickered, urging a forbidden
        weapon to resist the residual aura around her, and quickly rushed into
        the Heavenly Pond. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>
        Because she saw that the terrifying figure in the sky seemed to have
        disappeared, and she couldn't even feel the aura.
      </p>
      <p>As if the world had evaporated, which was also too strange.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the aura of Jiang Yang that she noticed couldn't be felt
        suddenly, and she didn't know what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, when Yue Mingkong rushed to the place where the Nirvana Green
        Lotus was, she was stunned, and her doubts deepened in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vitality of this Nirvana Lotus had already disappeared, and it was
        obviously absorbed by someone.
      </p>
      <p>The first thing Yue Mingkong ruled out was Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>
        If Jiang Yang's fusion was successful, he was bound to rush out and seek
        revenge for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        But from the current situation, Jiang Yang failed, and might even have
        died here.
      </p>
      <p>This caused a stormy wave in Yue Mingkong, which was unbelievable.</p>
      <p>
        Who had the means to kill Jiang Yang in this place, or lay it on Jiang
        Yang's tricks?
      </p>
      <p>
        "There are still seeds of Nirvana Green Lotus in this place? Did someone
        forget to take them away?"
      </p>
      <p>Soon after noticing one of them, Yue Mingkong was a little shocked.</p>
      <p>
        She discovered the extremely precious Nirvana Green Lotus seeds.
        Currently, there were still a lot of them but they were not taken away
        and left there in the lotus body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the Immortal spirits and rhythms in it were all there and were
        not affected in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if it was left here and was not taken away… Was it left for her on
        purpose?

      <h4>
        Chapter 261-1: Mingkong, you have really changed, The identity of
        another inheritor of demonic art (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        It was very quiet in the pavilion. Apart from the people from the
        Heavenly Emperor Mountain, Yue Mingkong was the only one seated. At this
        moment, her expression was calm and indifferent, as if she didn‚Äôt care
        about this world, and her entire figure seemed to be carefully crafted
        from the finest jade. LùíÇaTest novùíÜls on (n)ùíêvelbi/ùíè(.)coùíé
      </p>
      <p>
        She was dressed in a wide robe, with a picturesque immortal face without
        any makeup on her face, and her thousands of threads of silky hair were
        like a waterfall, tied with a simple hosta.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even without the presence of the pendants, it was enough to make any
        beautiful girl of heaven pale in front of her. The kind of aura was like
        a peerless female Emperor, so that everyone from the Heavenly Emperor
        Mountain did not dare to have any contempt, and treated her with
        caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Yue Mingkong was Gu Changge's fiancee. He was
        currently a hero on the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield after saving the
        beauty, Ying Yu, which was widely circulated in various places, making
        many beautiful girls envious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Yue Mingkong‚Äôs warning caused everyone from Heavenly Emperor
        Mountain to laugh bitterly, guessing that this matter was related, but
        they also knew that the other party was not unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some things were really not something they should think about. Gu
        Changge was extremely good. If there was no marriage contract on him, it
        might have been alright but with the presence of the marriage contract,
        their young lady should not have any impression on him in the end.
      </p>
      <p>Because this was destined to be impossible.</p>
      <p>
        "What is the meaning behind Princess Mingkong‚Äôs words? Is it because you
        are afraid that I will take away your fianc√©?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Ying Yu also realized the meaning of Yue Mingkong's words.
        She frowned immediately and retorted. She chose tit for tat and didn't
        like the casual attitude of the other party trying to control
        everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was also the daughter of heaven, and she didn't want to bow her head
        in front of the other party at this time. Although she did have a
        certain favorable impression of Gu Changge, but Yue Mingkong words
        didn't give her any face?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yue Mingkong shook her head, her expression was calm,
        beautiful, and lustrous. Her words, as before, did not have any ups and
        downs.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúI'm advising you and doing it for your own good. If you don't want to
        suffer from pain in the future, stay away from Gu Changge. As for taking
        him away?"
      </p>
      <p>Speaking, her tone was slightly mocking and dismissive.</p>
      <p>
        From the beginning to the end, she was not worried that any woman could
        enter Gu Changge's eyes. Her own possessiveness was very strong, but it
        was also necessary to divide people. Some women were destined to be only
        Gu Changge's pawns, and could not threaten her at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing her miserable state, she kindly persuaded her, but she didn't
        care whether the other party appreciated it or not. She had said
        everything that should be said. If Ying Yu went deeper and deeper in the
        future, it would be herself who would be hurt in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prince Ying became the inheritor of demonic art and he was an enemy of
        the entire world, and the siblings turned against each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wouldn't believe that Gu Changge hadn't done anything during this
        time. And it was very likely that all of this was caused by Gu Changge.
        If Ying Yu became aware of the truth in the future, what would happen to
        her?
      </p>
      <p>
        She would probably want to kill Gu Changge. At that time, with Gu
        Changge's temperament, he would not show mercy to Ying Yu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong thought that this calamity could be avoided, so she arrived
        to warn her. As for making Ying Yu feel that she was jealous or
        something, Yue Mingkong didn't really care.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        However, Yue Mingkong didn't know that Ying Shuang had already been
        taken over by a horse-feeding boy and had exchanged identities. For Gu
        Changge, he was not at all afraid that Ying You would find out the
        truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What do you mean by that?" Ying Yu frowned, not understanding why Yue
        Mingkong was seeing her with a little pity.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Yue Mingkong did not continue to speak and did not pay any
        attention. She was as quiet as a female immortal. Her eyes glittered,
        with an inexplicable look. Seeing Yue Mingkong no longer speaking, Ying
        Yu took a deep breath, calmed down.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Young Master Gu is kind to me and the Heavenly Emperor Mountain. I will
        try to repay him. As for other things, Princess Mingkong, you don‚Äôt have
        to worry too much." After that, she decided to say goodbye.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong nodded, "It's good if you know this."</p>
      <p>"Oh, Mingkong, you are here?"</p>
      <p>
        However, at this moment, a slightly surprised voice suddenly sounded
        under the pavilion, followed by footsteps coming up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person was dressed in a moon-white robe, tall and straight, with a
        warm and jade-like smile on his face, followed by many followers with a
        strong aura.
      </p>
      <p>It was Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        During this time, the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield was not at all
        peaceful, so he simply left it, intending to find out the true identity
        of the inheritor of demonic arts first.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Gu Changge knew that Yue Mingkong had come to Southern
        Heaven, and he had something to ask her about. Speaking of which, after
        the last trip to the Lower Realm to eliminate the Human Ancestor, it
        stood to reason that the appearance of the next Child of Luck would not
        be very soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        But according to the system prompts, the appearance of the witch in red
        seems to be unavoidable. So Gu Changge planned to gather some
        information from Yue Mingkong's mouth, maybe she would know something.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, upon hearing this voice, Ying Yu, who had planned to get
        up and leave, was also slightly stunned. Her footsteps could not help
        but stop, a little surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also didn't know if Gu Changge had heard what she and Yue Mingkong
        said just now.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master Gu‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"Young Master Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Everyone from Heavenly Emperor Mountain hurriedly saluted Gu Changge
        with a very respectful expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded slightly, his eyes swept over everyone, and then he
        looked at Yue Mingkong who had been sitting at the back. The smile on
        the corner of his mouth was a little interesting.
      </p>
      <p>Ying Yu didn't know if it was his own delusion.</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong, who had always looked calm and composed, suddenly seemed a
        little flustered and unnatural at this time, as if she was caught doing
        something wrong in front of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this feeling soon disappeared as Yue Mingkong's expression returned
        to calm again.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "Changge, are you looking for me?" She was the first to speak, slightly
        surprised, other than that, there was nothing at all.
      </p>
      <p>She was not surprised at all about Gu Changge's sudden appearance.</p>
      <p>
        Although this was the first time the two have met since the last Gu
        family banquet, Yue Mingkong was very clear that in the Heavenly Star
        Realm, Gu Changge had been paying attention to her whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Gu Changge never showed up. Today, she took the initiative to show
        up to find her because of Ying Yu's affairs. Was he afraid that she
        would destroy his plan?
      </p>
      <p>There was a little doubt in Yue Mingkong's heart.</p>
      <p>"I want to see you, do I need any reason for this?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled casually, walked to her side naturally, and then
        gently held her delicate waist in the eyes of everyone, looking like a
        very loving old couple. This scene made everyone from Heavenly Emperor
        Mountain smile bitterly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu didn't expect Gu Changge to make such a move in public. In her
        opinion, this was no different from Gu Changge telling her that he only
        had Yue Mingkong in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, she was inexplicably disappointed in her heart, but this
        emotion quickly dissipated. Yue Mingkong was stunned for a moment,
        staring at Gu Changge with cold eyes like flawless gems, "Are you afraid
        that I will be jealous of this little girl?"
      </p>
      <p>
        If it was before, she would definitely be ashamed of Gu Changge's
        actions. But knowing that Gu Changge liked to make fun of her, she
        didn't care anymore. Because in front of this guy, the more shy she
        behaved, the more he would tease.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she didn't want to let him succeed. Gu Changge shook his head, and
        his smile continued, "I know you are sensible, you won't care about this
        kind of thing, so don't scare people anymore."
      </p>
      <p>Speaking of which.</p>
      <p>
        He turned his head and smiled at Ying Yu, who had always been puzzled,
        "Mingkong has always been jealous. Whenever there is another woman
        around me, she will always be like this‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong suddenly interrupted him, looking a little annoyed. Gu
        Changge knew that she didn't mean it that way, but did she think it was
        too lively to say that?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Ying Yu couldn't help but laugh and cry at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        She said hastily, "Young Master Gu, please rest assured, I will not take
        this trivial matter to heart. Since you and Princess Mingkong have met,
        I will not join in the fun as an outsider. If I have a chance next time,
        I will definitely invite Master Gu to come to Heavenly Emperor Mountain
        for a talk."
      </p>
      <p>
        "We'll say goodbye first." After all, she took the people from Emperor
        Mountain and left without staying too long.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Miss Ying Yu, be careful on your way back." Gu Changge kept a faint
        smile on his face as he watched them leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        After they all left, the smile on Gu Changge's face gradually subsided,
        and he screened everyone away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, he looked at Yue Mingkong with interest and asked, "Is Mingkong
        worried that I will hurt Ying Yu? In your heart, am I such a heartless
        and cruel person?"
      </p>
      <p>
        He naturally knew that Yue Mingkong couldn't be jealous because of this
        kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        At most, she just did it out of kindness and couldn't help but persuade
        Ying Yu, but for Gu Changge, it was just a trivial matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        To him, Ying Yu was just a pawn that he used at will, and it was
        actually not much different from Ying Shuang.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 261-2: Mingkong, you have really changed, The identity of
        another inheritor of demonic art (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        No matter from which aspect, she was far inferior to Yue Mingkong's
        position in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        "To you, she is just a pawn, but to her, you are her savior and admirer.
        She's also a pitiful person."
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong replied softly, not mentioning Gu Changge's plotting
        towards Ying Shuang, which caused the two brothers and sisters Ying Yu
        and Ying Shuang to turn against each other and break up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she had never witnessed it with her own eyes, she knew that it
        was absolutely inseparable from Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled, "It doesn't matter if the chess piece is not a chess
        piece, I only know that you are jealous‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong stared at him, "So if I was jealous, would you consider my
        feelings?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was very calm. Yue Mingkong gently rolled her eyes and
        ignored him.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the two of them tacitly did not mention the matter of the Lower
        Realm at all. Yue Mingkong's cultivation base had grown a lot because of
        the few Nirvana Lotus seeds left by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in the face of Ancient freaks, she did not need to rely on other
        means, and she had the strength to fight by her cultivation alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that you don‚Äôt want me to be your husband at all?" Then, Gu
        Changge noticed her expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        He suddenly sighed and seemed a little sad, "I am very happy to be your
        husband here in Southern Heaven, but Mingkong, you seem too lazy to be
        with your husband. Do you know how sad it is for your husband?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yue Mingkong stared at him with her eyes so cold that she
        didn't open her mouth, as if she cherished these words like gold. After
        all, she knew Gu Changge's character well and understood that at this
        time, he was just making fun of herself, so she couldn't do what he
        wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge also seemed very helpless at this time, and continued to
        sigh, "Mingkong, you have changed, you don't care about me being your
        husband anymore."
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong's expression was calm, her peerless immortal face did not
        have a trace of waves, her eyes were as clear as water, and she stared
        at Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        That look seemed to be implying her intention of wanting to see the
        duration that he would pretend. But in the next moment, Gu Changge
        suddenly shot, picked her up by the waist, and went directly to the
        depths of the pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>"Changge‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong was startled by his actions and exclaimed softly. It was
        hard to keep calm like just now, after all, it was broad daylight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said calmly, "You know how to call me now, but you forced me.
        If you call me husband, I will let you go!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Husband." At this time, Yue Mingkong was honest, and her appearance was
        still a bit cute. She knew that she was not Gu Changge's opponent, so
        she did not make futile struggles.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You're kidding, you really believe it." Gu Changge couldn't help
        laughing.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong couldn't help grinding her teeth, no matter how good her
        mood was, she was truly angry at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon after that, there was a great battle here, the runes flickered, the
        palace towers glowed, the mountains shook, and many buildings collapsed
        into ruins.
      </p>
      <p>Many cultivators were shocked and wanted to find out.</p>
      <p>
        However, they was blasted away by Gu Changge's followers in the
        distance, breaking out in a cold sweat, knowing that this matter was not
        something they could investigate.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>"The inheritor of demonic art is Prince Ying‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"Is it true? Or is there something wrong‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, in Southern Heaven, in a very remote ancient city.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a quiet mansion. A woman in white was wearing a veil while sitting on
        a stone chair and muttering softly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her facial features were exquisite, her eyes were like spring water, and
        her eyebrows were like distant stars. Although she was wearing a veil,
        it was difficult to conceal her cold and aloof temperament.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How come there is another inheritor of demonic art? According to
        memory, isn't there only one person in each generation?"
      </p>
      <p>
        She seemed to be talking softly to herself, but it looked more like she
        was talking to someone.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that there is something unknown about this generation?
        Impossible."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, a sneering voice suddenly sounded in her mind, revealing a
        terrifying sense of magic and evil spirits.
      </p>
      <p>"Then why?"</p>
      <p>
        The woman in white couldn't help frowning, and it seemed that it was
        still difficult to figure this out, "Could it be that this inheritor of
        demonic art is a fake, but a while ago, there was a lot of uproar."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Whether it is in the Heavenly Dao Ancient City or the Ancient Immortal
        Continent, there are traces of the inheritor of demonic art."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It was the same at Ancient Immortal Gu family not long ago. Did
        something go wrong?"
      </p>
      <p>Her voice was full of doubts, and she couldn't figure it out.</p>
      <p>
        "We don't need to worry about it. Anyway, now that this inheritor of
        demonic art is on the cusp of the storm, it is much more convenient for
        us to do things, and we don't need to be sneaky like before."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the white-clothed woman's mind, the monstrous voice resounded again.

      <p>
        "That's right. Now, if you want to get a quota for the True Immortal
        Academy, you still need a lot of points."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems to be quite chaotic during this time, and it's a good time for
        us."
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of which, a trace of complexity appeared in the eyes of the
        woman in white, as if she had thought of something.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's the matter? Now the inheritor of demonic art has been disclosed
        as Prince Ying, and it has nothing to do with us. As long as we act a
        little bit secretly, no one will be able to find out the abnormality."
      </p>
      <p>
        In her mind, the demonic voice sounded again, as if to comfort her. The
        woman in white nodded, but her expression was still full of complexity.

      </p>
      <p>At this time, after a pause, the demonic voice said again,</p>
      <p>
        "Actually, we just need to be bolder, with Gu Changge's trust in you, as
        long as we devour him, with his talent, we can‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Shut up."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the eyes of the woman in white suddenly turned cold. A
        terrifying power emerged from her body, causing the voice in her head to
        stop abruptly as if she didn't want to conflict with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How many times have I said it, don't mention it, or you will know that
        with my current ability, I can completely devour you."
      </p>
      <p>
        The voice of the woman in white returned to a cold and calm voice, but
        the words she said silenced another voice in her mind, and she was very
        afraid.
      </p>
      <p>But soon, her voice sounded again, and she felt very unwilling.</p>
      <p>
        "You are the inheritor of demonic art, and you are destined to stand on
        the opposite side of everyone in this world. Do you really plan to be in
        front of him all your life, just as a servant girl who pours tea and
        cuts fruits?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "You must know that Gu Changge never treats you as his woman. In his
        eyes, you are just a plaything at best. He will tease you when you are
        in a good mood, and ignore you when you are in a bad mood."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Su Qingge, you are such a smart person. You should know what Gu Changge
        has done during this time. If you let him know that you are the
        inheritor of demonic art, do you think he will let you go? No, he would
        not only let you go, he will kill you with his own hands."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Shut up! Although the Young Master is not a good person, it is
        impossible for him to do such a thing. I know him very well."
      </p>
      <p>
        The voice of the woman in white was cold and angry, and there was a
        trace of daze and trembling. It was as if she didn't even believe it
        when she said it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hehe, she is really a self-assured woman, don't you really think that
        you hold a lot of weight in Gu Changge's heart? If so, why did he take
        you back to the Upper Realm for so long, so he would ignore you and
        leave you alone? After throwing you into the Divine Sect of Absolute
        Beginning, he won't care about you anymore‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "You must know that we both feel the same way, and what I think is the
        same as what you think in your heart, but you dare not say it, but I
        dare."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you insist on thinking that Gu Changge will be on your side, then go
        and tell him that you are the inheritor of demonic art, and see what he
        will do‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Shut up!"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the white-clothed woman's expression suddenly became as
        cold as ice, and terrifying demonic energy circulated on her body carved
        from jade as if it devoured everything in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing that she was about to have a seizure, the voice in her mind
        gradually calmed down and stopped talking.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, the woman in white couldn't help but feel confused and
        sad. Indeed, weren‚Äôt these words what she thought in her heart?

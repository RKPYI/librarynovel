        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in Westwin Domain, Crimson South City, as the most popular ancient city in said Domain, comprised territories of almost a million square kilometres and contained billions in terms of population. The entire ancient city was dazzling with extravagance and spectacularness, especially with the towering, neatly packed palaces and pavilions.</span><span id="more-31099"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mystic Mountains and Celestial Islands floated amid the cloud-filled sky, as the pouring waterfalls accentuated the ancient city&#8217;s magnificent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, the Upper Realm Army&#8217;s rapid and ferocious attack through Sky Deer City allowed forces to dispatch their troops to take over the various regions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Westwin Domain being relatively isolated, the flames of war had yet to reach it. However, the past few days hadn&#8217;t been peaceful as the people were still so anxious that many clans began to flee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were Four Great Clans in Crimson South City. Among them, the Swallow Clan possessed the greatest power and influence, which remained unchallenged for the longest time. The leader of the city was the same as the leader of the Swallow Clan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the other three of the Four Great Clans, although they had not remained in existence as long as the Swallow Clan, they were all famous clans in Crimson South City with the Swallow Clan as their leader.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimson South City refrained from participating in the current war against the Upper Realm as the might of the ancient city was miniscule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, things were still harmonious now in Crimson South City as the forces from the Upper Realm had yet to notice them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the Four Great Clans, Crimson South City also harboured innumerable clans that verified greatly in size.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the Luo Clan was a medium-sized clan that had stood for more than 100,000 years in Crimson South City, and they also had cultivators in the Sacred King Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few days, the Luo Clan Residence had been extremely merry as the red lanterns hung all over the residence were lit up. Those clans that shared a good relationship with the Luo Clan came over and paid their respect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the disasters that were now haunting the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, as per tradition, they should still give their auspicious blessing at such a celebratory moment. After all, the Young Master of the Luo Clan was about to get married. Even though the celebration did not involve the entire ancient city, it was quite a significantly blissful matter to the allies of the Luo Clan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, speaking of the Luo Clan, it was the Young Master of the Luo Clan that piqued the interest of countless, as he was considerably a unique person in their circle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allegedly, the Young Master of the Luo Clan was born slow, and he had spent the last twenty years in an unconscious state. Forget cultivating, he couldn&#8217;t even perform normal, daily tasks without assistance. As such, the Luo Clan hired the most famed doctors in their vicinity to check him out, only to find nothing wrong with him nor his soul. Despite the spirit herbs and godly pills he had consumed, he never bettered, deeming his medication futile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the silly Young Master of the Luo Clan became a laughing stock during leisure time to the people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, now that he was about to get married, many around him—especially the younger generation—were disappointed, as if they were pained by how a goddess was about to mar her own worth by dipping herself in a pile of cow dung.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, the &#8216;goddess&#8217; agreed to the marriage willingly, so they could do nothing about it despite their disappointment. After all, the woman who was to get married with Luo Feng was none other than Luo Ying, the adopted daughter of the Luo Clan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the entirety of Crimson South City, Luo Ying possessed unparalleled beauty, mesmerising every eye, and she was unquestionably the goddess to every man of the younger generation. Even her cultivation Talents were extremely powerful as she was basically peerless among the young generation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for her background, many felt sympathetic for the tragedies she experienced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, the Luo Clan found Luo Ying wandering miserably in the wild without any family and decided to take her in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty years flashed by and Luo Ying grew into an slender beguiling woman with irresistible charm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coincidentally, the Luo Clan was stressing over Luo Feng&#8217;s marriage, given that he was almost twenty years old. Sadly, no daughters of the neighbouring clans were willing to get engaged with him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, Luo Feng was a widely recognised idiot. Thus, even though he was the Young Master of the Luo Clan, allowing their daughters to marry an idiot would be equivalent to tossing them into a pit of fire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there were families or clans that were willing to surrender their daughters, but they were too weak in the Luo Clan&#8217;s eyes, so they failed to be accepted as a fitting choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, right when the entire Luo Clan was troubled by the matter, Luo Ying, who grew up together with Luo Feng, stood out and decided to get married to Luo Feng as a token of gratitude to the Luo Clan for having raised her for over twenty years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, commotions were stirred up as many secret admirers of Luo Ying grew immensely jealous, fazed by how absurd of a joke it was to have their beloved goddess betrothed to an absolute idiot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, such a matter actually happened before their eyes, as the marriage was about to take place very soon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the sake of the marriage, the Luo Clan decorated their residence for a banquet and invited guests over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless were intrigued by the matter, causing commotions throughout Crimson South City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Lady, you needn&#8217;t do this, to be honest. The Master and Mistress treats you as their own daughter, but this decision of yours may just doom your own future. Young Master Luo Feng is a nice person, but at the end of the day, he is still an idiot. Given your Talents and position, why give yourself to someone like him?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, in a quiet, elegant courtyard in the Luo Clan Residence, a woman in a violet dress was making herself up in front of a mirror. A thin layer of powder was patted on her delightful face. Her hair was sleek and her shoulders were boney. She was truly a rare beauty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind her was a maid, brushing her silky hair while venting her dissatisfaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Speak no further on the matter. I&#8217;ve made my decision. My marriage with Luo Feng is a sign to Uncle. Besides, given the burden I&#8217;m shouldering, marrying Luo Feng isn&#8217;t that bad of a decision.&#8221; The woman in violet was none other than Luo Ying. After listening to the maid, she was somewhat dazed. Nevertheless, she quickly regained her senses and replied with a complicated expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the outside world, her agreement to the marriage with Luo Feng was to repay the Luo Clan for having taken care of her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, to be truthful, she bore an ulterior motive, which would be discovered if her husband was an ordinary man, thereby foiling her plans for revenge and her effort would go in vain as she would be more prone to attract the attention of her target of vengeance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, Luo Feng was the most suitable husband.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, the fact that she was adopted by the Luo Clan twenty years ago was calculated in her grand scheme. All these years, she had done everything she could to avoid the public eye and lived her life with discretion, fearing that her nemesis from two decades ago would find her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, Westwin Domain was immeasurably vast, so were the numbers of ancient cities, let alone small clans such as the Luo Clan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, none of her enemies had found her yet, so she was still safe for now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, the maid visibly grew stern, after which she dully answered, &#8220;Understood&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the maid was Luo Ying&#8217;s most trusted servant, or she wouldn&#8217;t have dared to speak this much.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tomorrow&#8217;s the big day, but for some reason, I feel agitated… Perhaps it&#8217;s the Upper Realm&#8217;s attack on Sky Deer City? Or the fact there&#8217;s still no news about those scums who annihilated my family…&#8221; Seemingly perturbed, Luo Ying gently shook her head as she heaved a sigh. When she brought up the matter about her revenge, a hint of abhorrence flashed across her eyes, but she quickly recovered her calm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rest assured. With this old one here, no accident shall surprise the wedding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, the voice of an old person sounded from the air behind Luo Ying, to which she nodded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One night twenty years ago, Luo Ying&#8217;s family was ambushed by unknown enemies. The fires still burned to this day. Almost all of her family members were slaughtered as only a few managed to survive the massacre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the atrocity was engraved deeply in her mind, and she would remind herself to avenge her family every day. All these years, she had been secretly amassing power and rectifying the survivors of her family while paving her backup route and investigating the matter at the same time. Alas, even until now, her effort was to no avail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Perhaps the wedding may prove to be an opportunity.&#8221; Luo Ying&#8217;s eyes grew gloomier as she was contemplating a strategy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Luo Feng, he was merely an unimportant pawn to conceal her identity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, thanks to her adoptive parents of the Luo Clan, she certainly bore attachment towards Luo Feng, though such attachment was purely platonic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luo Ying could still remember that she had a baby brother, but whether he was dead or alive was unknown, so was his current whereabouts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Luo Clan was immersed in their celebration, in another extravagant manor within Crimson South City, every member of the Swallow Clan seemed to be greatly restricted, as if under complete domination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most senior, with the most profound cultivation within the Swallow Clan was their Ancestor, who was in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm, who just appeared today. However, even the Ancestor himself seemed absolutely reverent, not daring to display any discourtesy. Meanwhile, the rest of the higher-ups of the Swallow Clan, such as the leaders, Elders, and Young Master, were respectfully standing still, and they dared not to make a sound.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before them, a tall, slender woman in a black dress stood. Her skin was snowy and delicate; her hair was silky; her features were flawless and captivating, and there was a red spot on her forehead. Nevertheless, she seemed as cold as an iceberg. Even the air was freezing, almost leaving those in front of her to shiver.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was obviously a True Daoist, a being with a frightening cultivation level. She merely stood still, yet it was as though the sky was about to split apart. Even more stupefying was the fact that she was already suppressing her own aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In all honesty, these are the most compatible people you have asked about that I have found during my twenty years in Crimson South City.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The head of the Swallow Clan was a chivalric man, but at this moment, he was sweating profusely as he was handing over a number of jade tablets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman in black before them came from Great Bone Domain, and she was a True Daoist of the Bone Clan who possessed fathomless cultivation power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the Swallow Clan wouldn&#8217;t dare to upset her, let alone the powerful people of the Bone Clan behind her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Bone Clan&#8217;s number was small in Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, they were in full control of one whole Great Domain. And this was inevitably thanks to their terrifyingly powerful Ancestor who had lived innumerable years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman in black was none other than Ni Shang.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her brows were tense and her face was cold as she was scanning the messages carved on the jade tablets with her divine sense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she possessed the Secret Technique to obliterate the Family of Protectors and find the latter&#8217;s bloodline, she was still uncertain about her target. Therefore, she would need to minimise the number of candidates before coming to a definite answer. After all, among billions of people, many fell within the criteria she made, so not only would it be a hassle to search through the billions one by one, but she might also startle her true target, causing unwanted problems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems we can only resort to the other option…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ni Shang quickly put down the jade tablets and scanned across the people of the Swallow Clan before her, asking, &#8220;Are there any famed ones in the list?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Famed ones?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people of the Swallow Clan were visibly distressed. The jade tablets didn&#8217;t contain the names of local cultivators of Crimson South City, but outsiders who were either older in age or lone wolves that had no family. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, it was indeed a huge circle of people to search from. And that was why they were dumbfounded when the woman in black voiced her desire to look for these individuals. After all, the number of cultivators in Crimson South City was simply too great.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we are to consider fame, it should be Luo Ying. There is nothing notable about the others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, a heroic-looking young man spoke. He was the Young Master of the Swallow Clan. Having cultivated with Luo Ying in a certain academy, he was aware of the formidableness of her Talents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was taken aback to find out that Luo Ying was in the list of the candidates, but without any hesitation, he mentioned her name. Undoubtedly, such an answer was to be expected from the younger generation, given that Luo Ying was virtually unrivalled in terms of looks and Talents as well in number of admirers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the older generation was rather confused by the name as they had never heard of it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Luo Ying, is it?&#8221; Ni Shang nodded as she took note of the name.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, as if she detected something, she raised her head towards the high sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Ancestor, the strongest of the Swallow Clan, sensed an ambiguous, intimidating aura approaching. Though, the aura only persisted for a split second before vanishing, making it seem as though the Ancestor was mistaken.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in that split second, he was so startled that his back was drenched in cold sweat and his face blanched.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the rest of the Swallow Clan sensed not a thing, they could tell by the Ancestor&#8217;s expression that something incredible must have instantaneously zoomed across Crimson South City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancestor of the Swallow Clan was frantic with fear, shaking uncontrollably.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the sensation was only momentary, it was as if his soul was almost frozen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, the people of the Swallow Clan noticed three individuals that popped up out of nowhere in the manor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leader of the trio was a dashing man in white, seemingly young, possessing an extraordinary yet noble and mysterious aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind him, there were two other men—one old and one muscular.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tall, muscular one was donning a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">battle suit made of Hell Iron. as if he just charged out of a sea of endless blood, everyone else was agitated by his presence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skinny old man in grey, on the other hand, seemed rather ordinary. Though, none could perceive his face as he was concealed by his grey robe. Nevertheless, his appearance left Ni Shang&#8217;s constantly icy face drastically changed, as if the time in the region was frozen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every member of the Swallow CLan was stupefied, yet none was brave enough to speak up, let alone pant. The timid ones were already on their knees as a result of the overwhelming anxiety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ancestor, you…&#8221; Ni Shang muttered, intending to ask a question as she was shocked and amazed by the Bone Ancestor’s unexpected arrival.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old man in grey waved his hand as he glanced at her and replied with a calm face, &#8220;I&#8217;m merely accompanying Young Master Gu for a stroll.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the people of the Swallow Clan, who were already stunned, trembled even more violently as they almost passed out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The identity of an individual who was referred to as &#8216;Ancestor&#8217; by a True Daoist was already unspeakable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as for the young man, who even the Ancestor was obliged to accompany…</span></p>

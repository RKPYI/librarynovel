          incomparably handsome and youthful. There were waves of Celestial
          Energy lingering around his spotless white clothes. As the Sound of
          the Great Dao rang out, Dao flowers started appearing beside him, and
          they bloomed on his head. The wisps of Celestial Energy dripped and
          sank into his body before they came out from the top of the head,
          turning into a Dao flower again. It went round and round in an attempt
          to nourish his body.</span

          front of Sky Deer City fell into a brief silence. Whether it was a
          person from the Upper Realm or a beast from the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains, all of them were watching everything unfold at this
          moment, their hearts trembling. No one expected to see someone
          standing on the wall of Sky Deer City not long after this great war
          ended. All the experts and True Daoists felt gloomy in that instant.
          Many turned pale as they tightly clenched their fists, their bodies
          trembling, while some were so frightened even their teeth

          rumoured True Immortal was far less terrifying than Gu Changge at such
          an age. Now, he was calling out names as he proposed a fight with Zhao
          Yunze, the top Cultivator of his generation 60 million years

          that Gu Changge had recovered from his injuries, he must be strong.
          Devastatingly so. In other words, there was no way Zhao Yunze could

          It seems like Zhao Yunze is doomed to die today. He&#8217;s nothing
          more than a mere ant. Anyone who hasn&#8217;t reached the True Daoist

          expect Gu Changge to get involved himself. In their opinion, there was
          no need for Gu Changge to do so with his current status. But come to
          think of it, Gu Changge probably wanted to deal with the person in

          Masters of the Ten Great Domains all had their own techniques and
          secret methods to use the power of their Domains. Among them, the
          Great Cloud Domain was said to have gathered the Power of Faith into
          their cultivation, resulting in both body and soul to be
          indestructible. Such a method could only be described as mysterious
          and unpredictable.</span

          shattered at some point during the first battle. Despite that, the

          throughout the world, making everyone in the Eight Wastelands and Ten

          looked at him coldly with unadulterated hatred and a murderous aura

          did was stretch out his right hand, and the Fragments of Time began to
          fly between heaven and earth. As the Dao Principles and Chaos Qi
          surged, all traces in the world began to slow down. This was the
          manifestation of the unparalleled Dao and Dharma. In the eyes of
          ordinary people, Gu Changge simply pointed out two fingers without
          making any unnecessary movements. The supreme experts, on the other

          didn&#8217;t think that Zhao Yunze would be defeated, and was sent
          flying backwards while he spat blood almost immediately after the

          that enveloped him. He couldn&#8217;t believe the blow he had put his
          all into was so easily offset by Gu Changge. With a shout, Sword Qi

          Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s Manor. His face was calm despite the
          numerous rumours he had heard going around the outside world. However,
          it surprised him that the assassination of Empress Yao Xi actually
          left many of the Demon World angry instead of ecstatic. In his

          only seemed logical that no accident happened. He refused to believe

          Mountain to gauge his reaction. Even though Empress didn&#8217;t seem
          to think much about his reaction then, he couldn&#8217;t say for sure

          had a feeling that Gu Changge might have a goal in mind, seeing that
          he seemed to know and still hadn&#8217;t told her. In response to
          this, she started a large-scale search starting with those near the

          trust. That was why it was such a smack in her face when the culprit
          turned out to be from among them. Again, this made her recall the time
          Gu Changge told her she was ‘pure’.</span

          generation who she had met. Qing Zhu only went to Black and White

          Sacred Mountain must have had a deeper meaning to them. Jun Fan, Jun
          Bufan… Is there really something wrong? Jun Fan did have a rather odd
          reaction then.] Her frown deepened when she thought about this. She
          hadn&#8217;t had doubts back then, but now that she thought about it,
          this might be the clue she had been looking for.</span

          She frowned again as she massaged away the headache that hit her. In
          her opinion, Gu Changge&#8217;s methods could no longer be described
          as mysterious, but he would never reveal too much about what she
          wanted to know.

          prodigies, Gu Changge, who had his underling tail Bai Lian&#8217;er
          for a while now, finally received updates from Tian Ze.</span

          around Quelling Chaos King&#8217; Manor these days. We found a pair of
          suspicious-looking man and woman. They look no different from ordinary
          herbalists, and they come here with baskets filled with simple
          medicinal ingredients on their backs every day to set up a stall near
          Quelling Chaos King&#8217; Manor.</span

          our men walk a hundred steps away from her. We didn&#8217;t want to
          alarm them. Also, it&#8217;s suspicious because judging from her
          appearance, she seems to have a disguise on.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the palace where the fragrance of tea and mist lingered in the
          air, Tian Ze was respectfully reporting to Gu Changge as he stood
          behind the latter.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Gu Changge put down the chess piece in his hand and
          smilingly mused, &#8220;Good job. He&#8217;s finally taken the bait
          after so long. All the hard work I did trying to get the rat to bite
          the bait has finally paid off.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He knew that Bai Lian&#8217;er must have known Jun Bufan&#8217;s true
          identity back at Sacred Mountain. That was why she couldn&#8217;t help
          but disguise her current appearance to meet Jun Bufan and carry out
          the task her father entrusted her. All Gu Changge needed to do in this
          was get someone to watch her from nearby while they waited for her to
          fall into his trap.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As Gu Changge spoke, he stood up to &#8216;reel in&#8217; his prey.
          He didn&#8217;t believe that Bai Lian&#8217;er could slip away so
          easily this time like she did in Northcreek Ancient City.</span

          >Seeing this, Jiang Luoshen, sitting across from him grunted,
          &#8220;Can&#8217;t you at least finish the game with me before you
          go?&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to win anyway. Why bother yourself with
          that?&#8221; Gu Changge threw out when he walked past her. He had no
          intention to continue to play chess with her. During this period of
          time, Jiang Luoshen had been rolling with the punches as he gradually
          got used to it. However, she was still the lofty, indifferent and
          noble princess of the Godly Illusion Clan; the future Godly Illusion
          Empress in front of outsiders.</span

          do. You have to finish this round with me even if I lose.&#8221;

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that she had finally seen hope in winning against Gu Changge, she
          didn&#8217;t want to let him get away at such a crucial time.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, she huffed and stopped pestering him. She had gotten to
          know Gu Changge very well during this time. He would always utter
          words sweeter than honey when he needed her for something, but when he
          didn&#8217;t, he would eagerly get her away from him.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Capital of the Demon World covered nearly a million kilometres.
          Soon, Gu Changge led many experts to the area of the Quelling Chaos
          King&#8217; Manor, which was on the east side of the capital. The
          manor was made up of a group of grand and imposing palaces and
          mansions. It was a magnificent sight to behold even from a
          distance.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To the west of the gate of Quelling Chaos King&#8217; Manor was a
          spacious street where tall palaces and pavilions stood on both sides.
          The mist that shrouded them made the scenery all the more vague and
          majestic. There were also many shops, restaurants, and casinos located
          here, and it was lively as people roamed the streets.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          ingredients, such as tranquil herbs, poria, gastrodia, ginseng and
          more in a simple street stall. The herbs looked fresh as they were
          still stained with soil.</span

          complexion whispered to the woman beside him. &#8220;We have been
          waiting here for five whole days. How much longer do we have to
          wait?&#8221;</span

          >The woman&#8217;s face was indifferent when she gave a short reply to
          his long question. Still, as though trying to catch something, her
          eyes would peer in the direction of Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s Manor
          from time to time.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          astounding charm. Many passing by couldn&#8217;t help but look at her,
          but then they would feel their stomachs churn as they gagged.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The reason for their reaction was because the woman was simply…
          horrendous to look at. Not only did she have a big black spot on her
          face, her eyes weren&#8217;t of the same size, and her nose
          wasn&#8217;t aligned with her face.</span

          vicinity of Sacred Mountain and temporarily lived in the Capital. When
          they saw Jun Bufan failed to assassinate Empress Yao Xi, they quietly
          left Black and White Academy without attracting attention. After they
          had a discussion, they decided to give the brocade bag to Jun Bufan as
          Bai Kun requested.</span

          World right now. With that, the two planned to wait and see for a
          while outside Quelling Chaos King&#8217; Manor, find a suitable time
          to meet Jun Bufan, and hand over the things to him.</span

          acknowledgement. After arriving in the Demon World, Bai Lian&#8217;er
          had the final say in a lot of things, while Bai Hua was occasionally
          in charge of doing divinations and deductions.</span

          squeaked, causing Bai Lian&#8217;er, who had been staring at Quelling
          Chaos King&#8217; Manor, to look away and look in the direction Bai

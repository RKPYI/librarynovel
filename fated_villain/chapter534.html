          and rivers, to name a few, were all within the scope of the Celestial
          Boat of Creation&#8217;s deduction and detection. He might not be able
          to directly see what was hidden within those stones, but he could
          sense how precious it was.</span

          Creation had become more and more in sync these days. In fact, he
          could even kickstart some of the Celestial Boat of Creation&#8217;s
          powers, and these stone-gambling halls seemed to be made specifically
          for him.</span

          choose them. We get an equal share of whatever is inside. What do you
          say?&#8221; Monk Pu Du couldn&#8217;t help but beam as he suggested
          after receiving Jiang Chen&#8217;s promise. His amiable look was
          arguably one-eighty to his usual attitude.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since he and Monk Pu Du were considered old acquaintances, he
          naturally wouldn&#8217;t doubt the monk&#8217;s integrity. Of course,
          there was another reason. He was genuinely cash-strapped at the moment
          as he had spent most of his money on cultivation resources.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the stones here were costly. After all, they were from the
          nearby Kun Mountain. Hence, the price for each would naturally be
          beyond other stones within the city.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was obvious that Monk Pu Du was a regular at the stone-gambling
          hall. He knew that there were barely any worthwhile stones downstairs.
          After all, these stones were from the outermost periphery of Kun
          Mountain.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In no time, the two arrived on the third floor, which was more
          spacious. The place was flowing with multicoloured mists that made it
          seem otherworldly, and the stones that were placed everywhere were
          also bursting with glows of various colours. In fact, there were even
          unusual fluctuations coming from some of these stones.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was clear that the cultivators here were all notable figures, as
          their temperaments and cultivation levels were far beyond those who
          were downstairs. Jiang Chen even saw quite a number of Immortal Sect
          disciples on this floor. They were shrouded in powerful glows, and
          their temperaments were extraordinary.</span

          Jiang.&#8221; A brilliant smile had been plastered on Monk Pu

          third floor. It was so massive that a few people would have to
          surround it in order to form a complete ring, and it looked pretty
          rugged. Worst of all, it looked far plainer than the other stones here
          that were glowing brightly.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When Jiang Chen and Monk Pu Du first came in, they took a glance at
          the duo but made nothing of them since they were unfamiliar faces. If
          anything, they assumed the two would look around for some time before
          making their decision, but who&#8217;d have thought Jiang Chen picked
          the largest stone on the floor after taking just one look.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were first dumbfounded before bursting into laughter. To them,
          Jiang Chen&#8217;s decision wasn&#8217;t only foolish, it was also the
          making of an amateur who knew nothing.</span

          oldâ€¦&#8221; someone exclaimed with wide eyes.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Million-years-old Blood King Ginsengâ€¦ That was a heavenly herb that
          even a Sacred King Realm expert would lust over. It was something that
          could only be found by chance, and it was worth at least a few million
          Spiritual Stones.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The manager&#8217;s countenance turned awful at this point as he
          reeled in incredulity. Though it wasn&#8217;t to the point where he
          would literally cry out in regret, it still felt terrible.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >&#8220;Three hundred thousand for a million-years-old Blood King
          Ginsengâ€¦ It&#8217;s pretty worth it,&#8221; Jiang Chen commented
          plainly.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At this point, no one in the stone-gambling hall dared belittle Jiang
          Chen anymore. That said, there were some who were still unwilling to
          resign to fate and simply chalked it up to the young man&#8217;s win
          being just a fluke.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just then, a group of young men and women with extraordinary
          temperament and aura, wearing outfits with the Skyward Schloss emblem,
          showed up at the stone-gambling hall.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s a Blood King Ginseng. Has someone cut out a
          Blood King Ginseng from a stone?&#8221; pointed out a gorgeous young
          woman with luscious hair and fair skin. She had a pair of legs that
          were longer than most women, and the white dress she was wearing made
          her crisp and otherworldly, like a fairy.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen froze upon hearing the familiar voice, and the
          indifference on his face, too, disappeared quickly, replaced by
          disbelief as he turned around, landing his gaze on the young woman who
          walked over.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Ruoyin? What is she doing here?] Excitement overcame Jiang Chen as
          he trembled slightly. Never had he thought that he would reunite with
          Xiao Ruoyin here on this day after so many days had passed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >That said, he was under a disguise right then. Xiao Ruoyin probably
          couldn&#8217;t make him out, and the notion saddened Jiang Chen. But
          he still calmed down as he knew this wasn&#8217;t the time to reunite
          with her.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Have we met?&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin thought the young man staring
          at her was somewhat familiar. However, she couldn&#8217;t put her
          finger on it.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No, this is the first time we&#8217;re meeting.&#8221; Jiang
          Chen shook his head with a smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin didn&#8217;t bother herself with it and just looked at
          the Blood King Ginseng in Jiang Chen&#8217;s hand and asked, &#8220;Is
          this Blood King Ginseng yours?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She remembered that Yan Ji&#8217;s cultivation level was in the
          Sacred King Realm. Thus, the Blood King Ginseng would be of great use
          to her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes. Since you and I hit it off so well, I can give it to you
          if you want,&#8221; Jiang Chen offered with a smile as though the
          Blood King Ginseng was a carrot sold on the streets.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He could tell Xiao Ruoyin badly wanted the Blood King Ginseng, and at
          this juncture, he decided to give the young woman the heavenly herb
          without talking it through with Monk Pu Du. [Well, Monk Pu Du is
          likely to not mind something like this.]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, the countenances of those on the third floor shifted
          slightly. After all, this was a Blood King Ginseng that was worth
          millions of Spiritual Stones, but Jiang Chen intended to give it to
          the young woman just like that!</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then again, she was indeed exceptionally gorgeous, like a fairy sent
          from above.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Monk Pu Du, too, frowned slightly, but he didn&#8217;t say anything
          at this time, as he believed he had seen the young woman somewhere and
          that Jiang Chen seemed to keep a constant eye out on her back at the
          Godly Illusion Tomb.</span

          >[They&#8217;re probably old acquaintances. But Jiang Chen has put on
          a disguise now, so she probably can&#8217;t tell it&#8217;s
          him.]</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin, on the other hand, was at a loss for words, surprised
          that the somewhat familiar young man actually intended to give her the
          Blood King Ginseng.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His intention was so obvious that her brows furrowed slightly. Given
          her current status at Skyward Schloss, she naturally had the Spiritual
          Stones to purchase the Blood King Ginseng from him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          Ginseng.&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          he rubbed his nose in embarrassment.</span

          >&#8220;Tsk, tsk, tsk, another one that wants to shoot beyond his
          league. I advise you to give up now. Junior Sister Ruoyin is one of
          Young Master Changge&#8217;s people!&#8221; The young men and women
          all couldn&#8217;t help ridiculing Jiang Chen after hearing his words.
          Clearly, this wasn&#8217;t their first time witnessing such a
          situation.</span

          it, he might laugh at me for being delusional.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin

          blushed.</span

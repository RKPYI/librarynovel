      <h4>
        Chapter 207: My Heart Flutters, but I Cant Move Him; Its Time for The
        Hero to Save The Beauty!
      </h4>
      <p><b>[Resting Palace for exclusive guests, Gu Family]</b></p>
      <p>
        Inside a magnificent and remarkably grand palace illuminated by the hazy
        moonlight, Wang Zijin, now in women's clothing, sat cross-legged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The white clothes on her body surged like clouds, and her hair was
        draped in a bun, her flawless face carrying a calm expression.
        Comparable to the purest white jade, a peculiar sense of beauty
        permeated the space.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was currently absorbing the essence of Heaven and Earth, laws
        flowing in a strange rhythm.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        An illusory Immortal Gate loomed tall behind her, seemingly connected to
        a vast and mysterious world; ancient trees and divine herbs could be
        found in abundance, and the roars of primordial beasts sounded in
        unison, shaking the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the talent she was born with, the phantom of an Immortal Gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Gate imbued her with Immortal Qi during cultivation,
        allowing her to achieve twice the results with half the effort, making
        her progress far more rapidly than other cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, she was endowed with a legendary Immortal Spirit Body.</p>
      <p>Immaculate and flawless by nature.</p>
      <p>
        Because of this shocking situation, many members of the Ancient Immortal
        Wang Family's older generation believed that she was a great existence
        in her previous life and was most likely connected with the now-vanished
        Immortal Realm.
      </p>
      <p>It was just that…this assumption hadn't yet been confirmed.</p>
      <p>
        After hearing it, Wang Zijin didn't really care too much about it. To
        hell with a great existence. She was just an ordinary and unremarkable
        transmigrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Wang Zijin was quietly adjusting her vitality and Qi,
        same as always. It was a habit she had ever since she started
        cultivating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she might usually have a bit of a salty attitude, she always
        held a non-competitive heart for many other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she also never slacked or grew lazy in her practice of the Great
        Dao.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, she was a transmigrator. It would be extremely boring if she
        didn't eventually become a powerful individual standing at the top of
        heaven. It'd be simply a waste of her new life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, Wang Zijin had always looked down on the countless native
        Young Geniuses; whether it be their personality, cultivation base, or
        background, she couldn't find anyone who could pique her interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her previous life, she was always alone, lying in a hospital room and
        only saw the outside world on a screen. She had expected things to
        change after crossing over, thinking she would find a partner, a
        husband, or something.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, her status, background, cultivation talent, and so on had
        unknowingly elevated her expectations. She felt as if she had entered
        the fantasy world she had read about in her previous life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Young Supreme of the Immortal Wang Family who was born Sacred. A
        cultivation base enough to view all her peers in contempt, coupled with
        her strong background? She could crush myriad people without even
        trying!
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, even if she sought someone to admire, no one was actually
        worthy of her attention in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, Wang Zijin felt that, in this world, she would probably end
        up alone and miserable once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Zain: I didn't get isekai'ed, but why am I still alone and miserable?
        :’( ]
      </p>
      <p>
        On the long path of cultivating the Dao, solitude was Wang Zijin's only
        option. When she looked back, she would already be standing at the
        world's highest peak, but there would be no one to accompany her
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p>This had always been her thoughts.</p>
      <p>
        So, while Wang Zijin appeared easygoing and casual in many ways, she
        also exhibited a deep-rooted attitude of indifference.
      </p>
      <p>This situation has been ongoing for a long time.</p>
      <p>
        However, she noticed a difference when she met Gu Changge, a distinction
        that made him different from other native people of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        She found a long-lost familiar feeling in conversations, opinions, and
        many other aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, Wang Zijin felt that although he was extraordinarily
        handsome…
      </p>
      <p>It certainly wasn't to the point of love at first sight.</p>
      <p>
        After all, which Young Supreme would have poor looks in a fantasy world?
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, how many handsome young men did she meet, and how many
        admirers pursued her while cultivating in the Human Ancestral Hall?
      </p>
      <p>Her mood always remained stagnant.</p>
      <p>
        But… she didn't know why she liked Gu Changge's face in particular. As
        she saw him talk, laugh, and oppress the entire Immortal Ancient Dragon
        Clan, she felt as if a love arrow had struck her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately, she knew it was her heart that was being moved by Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a dignified transmigrator, her identity and cultivation were
        unparalleled in this world, yet there were still moments like this,
        causing Wang Zijin to reflect on herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly, she was uninterested in those proper and old-fashioned men.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she saw a novelty in Gu Changge that she had never seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why she became curious and attracted to Gu Changge, and now she
        felt she couldn't see through him more and more… as if a layer of fog
        obscured her vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin felt that if things continued as they were, one day, even a
        transmigrator like her might really fall for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, she wanted to uncover the layers of fog on Gu Changge's
        body, wanting to see his true Cultivation Base.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I can't see his cultivation base… it might be because my Cultivation
          Base is inferior.” </b
        >Wang Zijin was whispering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her conversation with Gu Changge, his perfunctory demeanour could be
        seen. He obviously didn't care much about her, but she still maintained
        a polite smile on her face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under that gentle and elegant appearance hid a cold and ruthless face.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, many of her previous suitors admired her immensely, both
        openly and secretly… unlike Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        He obviously had no feelings for her, yet he still pretended to be as
        gentle and warm as jade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether in her previous life or the current one, this was definitely her
        favourite type of villain persona…
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Based on the current situation, there's no way his heart will be
          moved by me.”</b
        >
        Wang Zijin sighed, shook her head, and then withdrew from her
        cultivation state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now being quite familiar with Gu Changge, she understood it was merely a
        superficial familiarity in public.
      </p>
      <p>Only ghosts would know what Gu Changge was thinking.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It seems that my crossing over to this world isn't going to be
          smooth sailing for long… but this is what makes it interesting…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Wang Zijin's eyes were shining brightly.</p>
      <p>There was a lot of motivation driving her on for the first time.</p>
      <p>
        She finally met someone in this world who could make her heart flutter,
        so she naturally had to find a way to chase them down.
      </p>
      <p>‘So what if Gu Changge has a marriage contract?'</p>
      <p>
        ‘As a transmigrator, will I not be able to fight an ordinary fiancee of
        his?'
      </p>
      <p>
        [Kshn: Did this b***h just call Mingkong an ordinary fiancee?! Where's
        my gun?]
      </p>
      <p>‘Huh?!'</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Wang Zijin slightly frowned as she felt an unpleasant aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was accompanied by a palpitating killing intent and icy cold air.
      </p>
      <p>She got up from the bed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Who is it?”</b> Wang Zijin's face turned cold, her eyes glanced
        across the four directions, and she asked coldly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her first thought was; that this visitor was definitely not a friend!
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the undisguised killing intent was overwhelming, like a
        turbulent ocean suffocating her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it was a False God, a True God, a Heavenly God, or a God King,
        all of them would tremble at this moment.
      </p>
      <p><b>“The aura of a Sacred Realm…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin frowned tightly. Even if she only stepped on the threshold of
        the Quasi-Sacred, she could be called a cultivator of the Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        But obviously, this aura wasn't of an ordinary Sacred Realm cultivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘A Saint? a Supreme Saint? Or… a Great Saint?'1<b
          >An existence in Sacred Realm, Supreme Sacred Realm and Great Sacred
          Realm, respectively.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>A haze arose in Wang Zijin's heart.</p>
      <p>
        She never expected that someone would dare to make a move on her on the
        Ancient Immortal Gu Family's territory.
      </p>
      <p>Were they not afraid of being noticed?</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I just left the Ancestral Hall; why would anyone want to kill
          me?”</b
        >
        Wang Zijin frowned and glanced around.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had no idea who she had offended. Could it be that an enemy of the
        Ancient Immortal Wang Family had put their sights on her?
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire palace was enveloped with tremendous pressure, causing
        several objects to tremble, and even the formation patterns carved into
        the ground started to glow.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        A tall figure shrouded in a dense black radiance entered the palace at
        once, like a demon god returning from hell, draped in an intimidating
        Qi, the Demonic Aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eyes were cold and indifferent, with ruthless intent, staring at her
        like a dead person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Who are you? How dare you act presumptuously on the grounds of the
          Ancient Immortal Gu Family?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Wang Zijin asked coldly as her heart sank.</p>
      <p>‘A Great Sacred Realm Existence!'</p>
      <p>Currently, she wasn't an opponent of a powerhouse of this level.</p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, the Ancient Immortal Gu Family had many strong individuals,
        not to mention how terrifying the heritage of the Ancient Immortal Gu
        Family was and how many supreme existences they had hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in the palace beside her right now, many strong members of the
        Ancient Immortal Wang Family had come together to attend the birthday
        banquet.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>Wang Zijin was perplexed and shocked.</p>
      <p>
        How on earth could this person have the courage to show up to kill her?
      </p>
      <p>Unless he was crazily stupid, something was wrong.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“At the command of my master, I have come to take your life.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The tall, pitch-black figure spoke with a cold, ruthless voice as if
        blowing from the nine demons, carrying a murderous intent that swept
        across everything in heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Sacred Realm's pressure was terrible, and he could easily
        shatter even the stars outside the realm.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Master?”</b></p>
      <p>Wang Zijin caught the word clearly.</p>
      <p>She couldn't help but be alert in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        ‘A Great Sacred Realm existence calling someone master? What kind of
        identity do they have?'
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘To sneak in here quietly, he had most likely come with the Ancient
        Immortal Gu Family's many guests and was hidden among them.'
      </p>
      <p>‘Taking advantage of the night's darkness to make a move.'</p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Wang Zijin's expression turned cold. Although her
        cultivation was only in the Quasi-Sacred Realm and couldn't be an
        opponent of the Great Sacred Realm—
      </p>
      <p>
        She did not have the feeling of being in a life-or-death situation;
        after all, once the commotion here escalated, it was bound to alert many
        powerful individuals to gather.
      </p>
      <p>
        All she had to do was stall until all the strong individuals perceived
        the fluctuations in this place and came to her aid.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Not good…”</b></p>
      <p>
        But the next moment, her expression abruptly changed, looking shocked
        and surprised.
      </p>
      <p><b>“How is this possible…”</b></p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        An extremely mysterious and complex rune bloomed from the void, followed
        by a layer of bizarre fluctuations that engulfed the entire hall
        instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dense mist rose from all directions, obscuring and blurring even the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, a fierce battle was inevitable unless she used great
        strength to defeat the Great Sacred Realm existence or broke through the
        space with a Divine Artifact. No matter how tremendous the commotion
        was, it would be impossible for others to notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It seems they were planning to kill me for a long time, even going
          as far as to prepare something like this.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji's expression turned somewhat unpleasant, and her brow furrowed
        tightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        She soon understood everything, as a powerful secret treasure appeared
        in her jade hand.
      </p>
      <p>A fierce battle was going to take place today.</p>
      <p>
        No matter how powerful her talent was, she could never defeat a Great
        Saint while being in the Quasi-Sacred Realm!
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a nightmare; if the other party truly wanted to kill her, it
        would be like crushing an ant to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        The figure shrouded in dense black radiance revealed a cold yet
        indifferent smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“All of this has already been anticipated by my Master, so resistance
          is futile. Just wait for your death today. Dare to obstruct Master,
          and everyone in this world will perish, first you, then Gu
          Changge…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Saying that, he struck towards the front, his big palm peeking forward,
        the void shattered, instantly overshadowing the crack in that place, to
        kill Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        This strike contained the supreme power of laws, yet the earlier
        concealment runes suppressed the disturbance to prevent others from
        being alerted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, the pressure of a Great Sacred Realm alone could easily
        shatter anything, let alone an actual strike!
      </p>
      <p><b>“Who is your master?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Hearing those words, especially Gu Changge's name being mentioned, Wang
        Zijin couldn't help but snort coldly,
        <b
          >“Do you know my true identity?! Once the forces behind me find out,
          you will die without a burial place!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, she sacrificed an exquisite string of multicoloured bone beads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each one was as big as a goose egg, emitting crystalline jewel light,
        like a shard of a star from beyond the realm, flowing with intense
        energy fluctuations.
      </p>
      <p>A divine light bloomed.</p>
      <p>They constructed a diagram of the constellations in the sky.</p>
      <p>
        The ripples spread like a river of falling stars with a majestic aura
        and immediately enveloped the entire void below, a terrifying anomaly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a Sacred-grade Artifact, and while it might not withstand a Great
        Sacred Realm existence's strike, it should be able to delay it for a
        while.
      </p>
      <p>Wang Zijin felt a little anxious in her heart as she realized this.</p>
      <p>
        The other party obviously planned beforehand for this assassination, as
        even an incomparably rare Heaven Deceiving Talisman was used to conceal
        the commotion happening in this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, it seemed that this was a deliberate act and that the other
        party's target, in addition to her, was Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p><b>“You are not worthy of knowing the Master's name.”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“In this life, you are destined to perish at the hands of Master! His
          name? A dead person shouldn't be concerned about that.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The dark and tall figure sneered, its big palm easily tearing apart the
        star diagram, causing the shrouded sky to collapse.
      </p>
      <p><b>Bang! Bang! Bang!</b></p>
      <p>
        The bone beads bloomed and exploded, and a hazy red wisp disintegrated
        into the empty void.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a single strike, he easily destroyed Wang Zijin's secret treasure.
      </p>
      <p>‘Are they… related to the Forbidden Demonic Arts' Inheritor?'</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin suddenly figured it out at this point. A chill ran down her
        spine as she thought about that person and his actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, her expression turned even colder. To lurk so
        blatantly inside the Ancient Immortal Gu Family's residence to
        assassinate her…
      </p>
      <p>Such courage was too great!</p>
      <p>Moreover, the other party was likely aware of her identity!</p>
      <p>
        ‘There must be some organization behind the Demonic Arts' inheritor
        instead of just a single person.'
      </p>
      <p><b>“I'd like to see how long you can last!”</b></p>
      <p>
        The tall black figure sneered again, his massive palms rumbled by, and
        the mist surged, revealing an amusing game of cat-and-mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        They seemed to be in no rush to kill Wang Zijin immediately and instead
        aimed to make her despair by torturing her slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since, for the strongest existence under the Quasi-Supreme Realm,
        killing a Quasi-Sacred Realm cultivator would be as simple as killing an
        ant!
      </p>
      <p><b>“This is my chance…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Seeing that the other party was not in a hurry to kill her, Wang Zijin's
        eyes flashed with a sharp intent as her figure hurriedly retreated
        backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Divine Artifacts were used just now to resist the enemy's assault.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Since ancient times, villains have always died from talking too much.'
      </p>
      <p>‘I didn't expect this to be so true.'</p>
      <p>
        She couldn't help but sigh with relief, knowing that as long as she
        delayed enough and waited for someone to notice the disturbance, she
        would be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        She truly didn't want to use her biggest trump card until the very last
        second. Furthermore, she wasn't sure whether the treasures given by the
        Wang Family's old ancestors back then could even stop this Great Sacred
        Realm existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, which Young Supreme had ever had to deal with a Great Sacred
        Realm powerhouse trying to assassinate them as soon as they stepped out
        of the seclusion?
      </p>
      <p>
        Others would have been crushed into a cloud of blood mist in an instant.
      </p>
      <p><b>Puff!</b></p>
      <p>
        But soon, Wang Zijin discovered that she was thinking too much. Despite
        her many Divine Artifacts, she couldn't withstand the pressure of a
        Great Sacred Realm existence and was struck with a hard blow, coughing
        up blood as she flew out backwards.
      </p>
      <p>There were several broken bones, resulting in excruciating pain.</p>
      <p><b>“Is this the strength of a Great Sacred Realm existence?”</b></p>
      <p>[Kshn: Reminded me of: “Is this the power of a God?” from Naruto.]</p>
      <p>Wang Zijin's face was a little pale.</p>
      <p>
        Her long white dress was stained red with blood; it was the first time
        in her life that she was in such a bad state.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Is today really going to be my last day in this new world?”</b></p>
      <p>Such a thought suddenly came to her mind, but she was reluctant.</p>
      <p>
        ‘It was hard to meet someone who touched my heart; do I have to die
        here?'
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin reached into her sleeve and pulled out a piece of gold paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Heh, the master has already calculated everything; no one can save
          you today.”</b
        >

          });

      <p>
        The black figure said indifferently, a dreadful aura, even the stars
        shattered and plummeted towards Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        After sending the demonic puppet to assassinate Wang Zijin, Gu Changge
        left the hall, took one step, and appeared high in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>The night breeze blew, clothes wandering.</p>
      <p>
        He stood above the palace, his hands behind his back, his ink hair
        fluttered, looking toward Wang Zijin's palace.
      </p>
      <p>In his eyes, a faint black and white divine light emerged.</p>
      <p>For a while, the entire world became blurry.</p>
      <p>
        The rules of light and shadow, the flow of heaven and earth aura in the
        world, and the intervening of laws appeared in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The numerous changes within a radius of thousands of miles could not be
        concealed from his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The voices of the cultivators speaking in the outer hall, the breathing
        during cultivation… all kinds of things were extremely clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the Origin of Reincarnation's Pupillary Art. As if nothing in
        this world could escape the cycle of life and death, every situation
        becomes exceedingly clear when viewed under the lens of reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for seeing through the opponent's weaknesses and slowing down the
        opponent's movements and abilities, it was even easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one except a Supreme Realm Existence, whose cultivation was much
        higher than his, could escape Gu Changge's eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, he could vaguely see the strange movements coming from the
        palace where Wang Zijin was in.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Not now; it's not yet time for me to appear and save the beauty.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said with a faint smile.</p>
      <p>
        If the puppet, unfortunately, killed Wang Zijin, it wouldn't affect him
        too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would only be a little disappointing that… he overestimated her
        abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, the talisman exchanged from the system shop cost him a lot of
        Destiny Points. After all, there were far too many powerful individuals
        in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. Perhaps some ancestor would notice
        and foil his plan, something he didn't want to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled with interest. If his guess was correct, Wang Zijin
        was most likely in a dangerous situation right about now.
      </p>
      <p>But there should be no real danger to her life yet.</p>
      <p>
        In order to give Wang Zijin an opportunity to delay, Gu Changge
        instructed the puppet to be a little lighter and release some steam.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Next, I have to wait. It's a pity I can't see these scenes in
          person.”</b
        >
        He sighed slightly but felt no guilt for attempting to take Wang Zijin's
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The appearance of the descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall had
        disrupted some of his previous arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the arrival of Wang Zijin, coupled with another descendant of
        the Human Ancestor Hall, who was about to show up, and the little
        servant's unexpected appearance, Gu Changge's plan to replace the Human
        Ancestor, became more certain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge felt it was time, so he took a step and rushed toward
        the palace.
      </p>
      <p>He had no intention of being the first to notice the abnormality.</p>
      <p>
        After all, under the concealing effect of the talisman, unless a
        Quasi-Supreme existence was nearby, it would be impossible to notice the
        commotion of the battle taking place and thus show up to save Wang
        Zijin. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
      </p>
      <p>
        He was young, yet he could tell that something was wrong even before a
        bunch of Sacred Realm powerhouses?
      </p>
      <p>Wouldn't that be asking for suspicion?</p>
      <p>Gu Changge always sought a seamless plan.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he was in no hurry.</p>
      <p>
        He still had confidence in Wang Zijin. As a transmigrator and as a
        Favored Daughter of Heaven, with such a status, how could she be capable
        of only this much?
      </p>
      <p>
        It wouldn't be a problem for her to change danger into opportunities,
        not to mention that he had already instructed the puppet to pull its
        punches as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking so, Gu Changge suddenly narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p><b>“Here it comes! It's time for the hero to save the beauty.”</b></p>
      <p>
        He smiled, transformed into a divine rainbow, and rushed to the guests'
        palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next moment, the smile on his face disappeared, replaced with a look
        of cold killing intent and bloodlust.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the pitch-black night sky resounded, accompanied by Gu
        Changge's cold thundering voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Audacious maniac, how dare you to try to commit murder in the
          territory of my Ancient Immortal Gu Family!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“You are courting death!”</b></p>
      <p>The voice startled many people.</p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        He appeared suddenly in the Wang Family's resting place, his gaze
        piercing cold as he blasted his palm towards the palace below, a
        devastating and radiant palm print that exploded with blinding light.
      </p>
      <p>It was similar to a miniature sun exploding!</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“What happened? It was Young Master Changge's voice. Is he fighting
          someone? Why did he suddenly shout?”</b
        >
        Many cultivators walked out in shock, looking up into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It seems to be the direction where the Ancient Immortal Wang Family
          is currently, and sounds are emanating…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A large group of cultivators from all sides of the Daoist forces
        instantly appeared in the sky, shocked and perplexed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle of the night, they were all at a loss, unsure of what was
        going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“That direction is where the Wang family is resting… Changge, did he
          attack Wang Zijin?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In the other direction, Yue Mingkong appeared high in the sky, her
        serene eyes carrying deep thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her first thought was that Gu Changge had made a move on Wang Zijin;
        after all, this was Gu Changge's style. He wouldn't delay for too long
        if he had already planned something.
      </p>
      <p>Under the sky, there were huge surging fluctuations.</p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        With Wang Zijin's unrelenting efforts, the entire palace suddenly
        emitted a faint trembling sound that spread out through the concealing
        talisman.
      </p>
      <p>The sky was filled with breathtaking runes bursting and flashing.</p>
      <p>
        Her body was stained with blood, and her face was weak and pale but with
        a cheeky smile.
      </p>
      <p><b>“I'm sorry, but it seems I'm saved.”</b></p>
      <p>She smiled at the black figure in front of her.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Dammit! Don't be too happy too soon. Your death is unavoidable!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The black figure appeared to be very reluctant and furious.</p>
      <p>
        His pressure was no longer concealed, like the sky smashing down, trying
        its best to kill Wang Zijin!
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't expect Wang Zijin to have so many tricks, and he was dragged
        along until now, allowing her to break the concealing formation in the
        hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a disturbance in the middle of the night instantly alarmed many of
        the nearby Wang Family powerhouses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's reaction was quick, but he was actually half a step behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old coachman, who was resting with his eyes closed on the carriage,
        instantly snapped wide awake; his snake-like dark golden vertical pupils
        emitted a faint light.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Who dares!?”</b> He was trembling with rage as he sensed a strong
        individual trying to assassinate Wang Zijin.
      </p>
      <p>
        He moved faster than Gu Changge and arrived in an instant. He was very
        close to Wang Zijin's palace, after all.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>The place erupted with vast ocean-like fluctuations.</p>
      <p>“<b>Miss!”</b></p>
      <p>
        When he rushed into the hall to see Wang Zijin covered in blood, his
        eyes couldn't help but split as his anger seethed, and he attacked the
        dark figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        A battle at the Great Sacred Realm level erupted, shocking everyone.
      </p>
      <p><b>“What?!”</b></p>
      <p>All of the cultivators in the vicinity were frozen in place.</p>
      <p>Soon, others began to react as chills rushed through their bodies.</p>
      <p>
        An incomparably terrifying and incomparable Great Sage Realm cultivator
        had gone to assassinate the mysterious woman from the Ancient Immortal
        Wang Family, obscuring the skies and concealing it from everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of them would have found out if it hadn't been for this commotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This pressure is terrifying! A Great Sacred Realm existence,
          attempting to kill a young lass…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        They were all covered in chills, and what they couldn't believe was that
        the mysterious woman from the Wang family had actually survived and
        wasn't dead already.
      </p>
      <p><b>“What exactly is her identity?!”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b

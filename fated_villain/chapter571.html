          >Kun Mountain, situated 30,000 kilometres away from Dark Kun City, was
          a breathtaking sight to behold. Enveloped in a thick Chaost Mist, the
          mountain range exuded an air of ancient mystery and grandeur that has
          existed since the dawn of time. It resembled a dragon crawling on the
          ground, stretching endlessly into the horizon. </span

          >Hazy divine light rose from the mountains, illuminating the sky and
          on the ground below. Its forest was home to many terrifying beasts
          that even supreme experts would think twice before venturing into
          it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As one delved deeper into Kun Mountain, the scenery became even more
          peculiar and otherworldly. The landscape here was a fascinating blend
          of contrasting elements. Some parts are reminiscent of the vibrant
          colours of spring, while others resemble the serene tranquillity of a
          snow-covered winter wonderland.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Kun Mountain was known for being a perilous place due to its unique
          domain governed by unyielding Principles that could swiftly obliterate
          any living beings that dared to venture within. Numerous Ancient
          Beings had speculated that this was a result of the residual power
          left behind by the blood of the Immortal King who had fallen
          here.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the outskirts of Kun Mountain, many figures had assembled and
          stood proudly in the sky. Their features were blurred by a veil of
          Chaos Qi that surrounds them. Towering like majestic peaks, their
          Dharma Body exuded a formidable and awe-inspiring presence.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A formidable array of Dao Artifacts loomed behind them, including
          Great Seals, ancient cauldrons, red furnaces, and great towers. The
          radiance they emitted was heavy, capable of crushing anything in their
          path. Undoubtedly, this was a league of extraordinary individuals who
          hailed from various Forces, all capable of wielding these Dao
          Artifacts.</span

          >“The anomalies within Kun Mountain have become increasingly severe. I
          think the Ji Family’s Prime Ancestor is reaching his limit,” a True
          Daoist commented. His eyes were gleaming with divine light, as he
          peered into the mysteries of Kun Mountain.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The person beside him shook his head and said, “This may not
          necessarily have any relevance to the Prime Ancestor. Regardless, we
          must remain vigilant while we are in Kun Mountain.” After observing
          the area for some time, they swiftly vanished and proceeded to locate
          members of their respective groups, to caution them about the
          impending danger.</span

          >Kun Mountain, a renowned treacherous region in the Upper Realm, held
          both danger and opportunity within its depths. The wondrous stones
          that could be found on the mountain held enchanting treasures within
          them. One could only imagine what they could uncover while exploring
          the mountain.</span

          including the Immortal Wang Family, Sky Emperor Mountain, the Ancient
          Ye Family, the Endless Fire Kingdom, the Mortal Palace, the War
          Immortal Manor, and the Hidden An Clan, had assembled on the outskirts
          of Kun Mountain, poised for the invasion that was about to take
          place.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Outside Dark Kun City, Gu Changge handed a jade tablet to Gu Xianer.
          With a gentle shake of his head, he said, “This is the translation for
          the mysterious sword technique manual you discovered in the rock
          before. It’s called the Deathbringer Sword Technique. Given its deadly
          nature, I don’t think it’s a suitable technique for you. Anyway, you
          can try cultivating it and see where it takes you.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Xianer accepted the jade tablet and stared at Gu Changge for a
          moment before snorting. “You don’t have to tell me that. I’m not a
          three-year-old child. I shall return to Peach Village now, you better
          not die in the depths of Kun Mountain.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She intended to visit several experts and have them examine the egg
          she had extracted from the rock. For the past few days, she had
          detected some subtle movements in it, but they did not resemble those
          of a normal creature.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In truth, Gu Xianer wished to join the expedition to Kun Mountain
          too, but Gu Changge adamantly refused her request. He even threatened
          to break her legs if she dared to venture there. Although Gu Xianer
          usually disregarded Gu Changge’s threats, the expression on his face
          looked serious this time, so she was left with no option but to
          abandon her desire.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Undoubtedly, the perils of Kun Mountain were so formidable that even
          supreme experts had no confidence they would be able to come out of it
          alive. Therefore, it was wiser for her to stay behind and not cause
          trouble for Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“All right. Be good and wait for my return in Peach Village.” Gu
          Changge chuckled and playfully pinched her nose.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Fine, I’ll be waiting,” Gu Xianer replied. For once, she did not
          swat Gu Changge’s hand away. Upon reflection, she realised that her
          response seemed out of her character.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just as she was about to explain, she saw a delightful grin spreading
          across Gu Changge’s face. Her cheeks immediately turned rosy as she
          shot him a glare. “What’s so funny? Stop grinning!”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After bidding farewell to Gu Xianer, Su Qingge, and the others, Gu
          Changge led his group toward Kun Mountain. Apart from Ah Da, his
          companions were Ji Chuyue, Ji Yaoxing, and a group of vicious bandits
          Ji Qingxuan had sourced from the Chaos Star Territory.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge had no intention of exposing anyone from his Family to the
          dangers of Kun Mountain when he had no confidence that he could ensure
          their safety amidst the treacherous terrain. After all, he was merely
          putting up an act since rescuing the Prime Ancestor of the Ji family
          was merely a superficial gesture. In fact, he would rely on people
          from other Forces to pave the way forward.</span

          >Jiang Chen walked behind a group of bandits with a sombre look on his
          face, his gaze fixed on Gu Changge’s back. He had no other option but
          to comply with his demands. Although Gu Changge had promised to free
          him once their mission was complete, Jiang Chen remained sceptical of
          his words.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Last night, he overheard news of Xiao Ruoyin showing up to plead with
          Gu Changge about his circumstances from the wardens guarding him. Her
          actions caused ripples in his heart, which had been a stagnant lake
          ever since he had given up on her.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Perhaps Xiao Ruoyin wasn’t as heartless as I had thought. Maybe she
          is in a difficult situation, as Niu Tian had suggested. No matter
          what, I need to survive. I need to find her and personally ask her
          about it]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As Gu Changge and his group departed from Dark Kun City, a mysterious
          figure in a white also slipped out of the city unnoticed. She trailed
          behind the group, slightly limping.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          invisible.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Gu Changge seems to be planning to enter Kun Mountain from the
          front…” Xiao Ruoyin frowned. She took care to keep her distance, wary
          of Gu Changge’s heightened senses that could potentially detect her
          presence. Although she was confident in her ability to conceal herself
          from others, she was uncertain if she could hide from Gu
          Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After their intimate encounter the previous night, she realised that
          he possessed an unparalleled stamina that only few in the Upper Realm
          could match. If it weren’t for the fact that she knew Gu Changge was
          still unaware of her unusual behaviour, Xiao Ruoyin would have
          suspected that his action from the previous night was
          deliberate.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This was actually her first time engaging in such activities, not
          counting the times she had done it before regaining her memory. It was
          only natural her body couldn’t take all the strain. She eventually
          succumbed to exhaustion, drifting into a deep slumber.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >By the time she woke up, it was already the next day. The chamber was
          eerily quiet and Gu Changge was nowhere in sight. This realisation
          left her feeling somewhat surprised. It was the first time in her many
          years of cultivation that she had slept so soundly that she was
          unaware of Gu Changge’s departure.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although the outskirts of Kun Mountain might seem desolate, there was
          actually a huge stretch of mountains. Each one stood tall and proud in
          a reddish-brown hue, which made people wonder if they were stained
          with the blood of the Immortal King.</span

          >Beyond the mountains, one could see the undulations of divine light,
          the dense Chaos Qi, the shimmering of ancient runes, and the intricate
          patterns of the Great Dao. That place was also fraught with peril and
          equally treacherous with fearsome beasts of the four elements roaming
          around, with overwhelming auras which could immobilise even the most
          powerful Sacred Emperor Realm experts.</span

          with terrifying auras emerged from it. One of them was a tall,
          middle-aged man dressed in blue robes. His eyes shone like the stars,
          and he carried himself with a noble air. Elusive lights and shadows

          Without him, our limited resources would not have been enough to rally
          so many people to come to our Prime Ancestor’s aid,” an old woman from
          the Ji family exclaimed as she watched divine rainbows appearing
          around them. Her voice was tinged with admiration when she spoke of Gu

          jade. Her eyes were a stunning shade of red and they gleamed like

          of the Hidden Celestial!</span

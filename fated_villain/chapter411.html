        p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underneath the ancient well, dense celestial energy was emitted as traces of
                purple fog were coming out, seemingly mysterious and ancient. If an ordinary man were to stumble upon
                the area, they would certainly be lost due to the nearby arrays, which would hinder them from locating
                the precise location of the ancient well.</span><span id="more-29807"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Gu Changge, by referring to the changes in Earthly Shi, and the
                intertwining lifeforce of the region, as well as Bai Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s lead, he quickly found the
                exact location.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, he brought along Jinag Luoshen, Tian Ze, Bai Lian&#8217;er and the
                rest, who were all peering at the ancient well in fascination. However, as the fog and vibrant mists
                were fiercely gushing out of it, they couldn&#8217;t quite see what was actually in the depths of the
                well.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is Jun Ruoxi down there?&#8221; Jiang Luoshen reached out her hand and
                made a few strokes with her finger and wrote &#8216;Illusion&#8217; in the air before sending it into
                the ancient well. Nonetheless, upon contact, the word was blown away by a ripple-like force that erupted
                amid blinding golden lights and vanished.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, she insisted on coming to Demon World out of concern that Gu
                Changge might sacrifice her clan members, but now, she was suddenly fascinated by the secrets of the
                Demon World.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her eyes, the chaos six thousand years ago and the disappearance of the
                Six Demon Overlords were clearly not coincidental. Furthermore, Jun Bufan&#8217;s reincarnation and
                revenge seemed to have been planned by someone else as well. If the Demon World was a shocking game of
                chess, then Jun Bufan and Empress Xiyao were merely chess pieces, and the Six Demon Overlords were the
                player. They were the true mastermind behind the mayhem. And now that she followed Gu Changge, she felt
                as though she was competing against the Six Demon Overlords.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, she subconsciously took a glance at Gu Changge with
                radiant light in her eyes. Although Gu Changge treated her poorly, it was granted that, to every woman,
                he bore inexplicable allure that would leave them charmed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Ruoxi, if you still refuse to show yourself, don&#8217;t blame me
                for taking action.&#8221; At that moment, Gu Changge spoke again, in his usual calm tone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was speaking, a thick black fog surged in his hands, followed by the
                manifestation of the Solar Heavenly Blade that seemed to be made of Immortal Divine Gold. Following the
                emergence of the immeasurably sharp blade, traces of power of the Nirvana Realm erupted amid blaring
                sounds, as though it could shatter the sky at any time. Such a spine-chilling murderous aura seemed to
                bear the might to destroy anything before it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Solar Heavenly Blade was a Nirvana Grade Artifact forged by the
                Solar Demon Overlord, upon Gu Changge&#8217;s repression, it appeared to be tamed as the divine item
                dared not to resist in fear that he would wipe out its conscience.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is my father&#8217;s weapon in your hands?&#8221; Finally, a voice
                came from underneath the ancient well. Although it sounded melodious, it was obviously carrying shock,
                coldness, and anger.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Jun Ruoxi opened her eyes. Although she remained sitting
                still, her body was letting off a terrifying force and murderous aura. Her snowy hair swayed; her milky
                skin covered by her waving dress that was as white as chalk. It was as though she was made of the most
                exquisite jade in the world, carrying stunning beauty.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, she was extremely enraged, but also puzzled at the same
                time. The Solar Heavenly Blade was left behind by the Solar Demon Overlord for her brother, Jun Bufan,
                yet it was now in the hands of the man before her eyes. As such, she couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if
                something unpredictable happened to her brother.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, Jun Ruoxi noticed Bai Lian&#8217;er standing by Gu
                Changge&#8217;s side and was dazed for a moment, but swiftly, she recognised her and realised that she
                was actually on his side.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when Jun Bufan brought Bai Lian&#8217;er over, Jun Ruoxi did not
                question him, thinking that she was his assistant, only to find herself gravely mistaken. Jun Bufan and
                Bai Lian&#8217;er had been childhood friends from six thousand years ago, yet she now chose to betray
                him and side with an outsider.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What did you do to my brother?&#8221; Jun Ruoxi coldly questioned
                without a hint of emotion in her voice.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve never really had the patience to repeat myself. If you wish
                to know what happened to your brother, come out and face me,&#8221; Gu Changge blandly stated at the
                mouth of the well.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, he was planning to test the Solar Heavenly Blade
                and see if it could break the array of the ancient well, and if that were to fail, he could only resort
                to another method—by using the Eight Barren Demon Halberd or the Grand Flask.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of silence, Jun Ruoxi icily replied, &#8220;I am unable to
                leave, so it&#8217;s impossible for me to go out and see you. Why is the Solar Heavenly Blade in your
                hands? What did you do to my brother?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really?&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Changge lost the patience to entertain
                her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, he swung the blade forward and instantly, ambiguous black lights
                broke out, engulfing everything in sight. Such power was terrifying. If it weren&#8217;t for the
                uniqueness of the region and the arrays planted all over the place, it would have been obliterated right
                away.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The might of a Nirvana Grade Artifact, even if it was not a true Nirvana
                Grade Artifact, was infinitely stronger than that of a Sacred Emperor Grade Artifact. Although Gu
                Changge hadn&#8217;t managed to fully awaken its might, it was already shockingly powerful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, there was nothing but the waning energy of the blade
                lingering in the air, as though an abyss was storming forward. Even the Night Demon, who attempted to
                assassinate Empress Yao Xi, had a hard time conjuring such power.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky was trembling as if it would explode anytime.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jun Ruoxi&#8217;s face uncontrollably changed. Although she and her enemies
                were separated by the ancient well, she could sense the frightening power as the air around her seemed
                to be breaking down. The next moment, as she rolled up her sleeves, countless runes exploded and bloomed
                into the blinding lights of the stars.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon Gu Changge&#8217;s swing of the blade, it was as though the sky above
                the ancient well was falling down. As numberless arrays were reawakened, amassing the fathomless
                energies of the region and turning into all sorts of glaring divine beams. Simultaneously, Chains of
                Order rained upon the land as if it was a raging storm that was to flood the entire region.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such dazzling eruption of lights bore no difference to the explosion
                of countless stars as it disallowed anyone from opening their eyes. Even Jiang Luoshen, Bai
                Lian&#8217;er, and the rest instinctively retreated to the opposite direction, having no desire to be
                hit by the shockwave.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Solar Heavenly Blade doesn&#8217;t belong to you. Why is it in
                your hands!?&#8221; Jun Ruoxi&#8217;s face was overflowing with coldness and her voice was filled with
                immense ferocity and aggression.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the ancient well was between them, the strength she suddenly
                displayed, evidently, could rival that of the Solar Heavenly Blade. But of course, she had to borrow the
                power of the nearby arrays to do so. Otherwise, given her cultivation level of the Sacred King Realm,
                she couldn&#8217;t have displayed such magnificent powers.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since you want to know it so bad, why don&#8217;t you try asking its
                owner?&#8221; Standing in the air, Gu Changge donned an apathetic expression. His black garment danced
                along the winds as his silky hair glistened, making him seem like a fabled young divine being that
                flamboyantly came to life.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, as he swung the blade forward, terror arose behind his back,
                resembling the rise of a blinding black sun, followed by countless chains made of Principle that could
                split the astral sky apart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You killed my brother… No way… You killed him and seized the Solar
                Heavenly Blade from him!?&#8221; Jun Ruoxi&#8217;s face changed once again. Although she was buffed by
                the power of the arrays across the region, she was still unable to take Gu Changge on. Even though he
                appeared to be in the Sacred King Realm, his aura was much more horrifying than that of any Sacred King
                Realm expert. Furthermore, with an Nirvana Grade Artifact in his hands, he was unbeatable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Jun Ruoxi conjured a crystalline, shining Celestial Sword from her
                sleeves. It was an Ancient Forbidden Weapon. Although its usability was limited, the power it could
                burst was unquestionably to be dreaded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right after Jun Ruoxi slashed the sword towards the outside of the ancient
                well, a vast sword energy ruptured, charging towards the blade in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands. At the same
                time, the arrays in the region were reawakened, bursting in obliterating auras. She intended to
                eliminate Gu Changge with this.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Trying to stop me with such child&#8217;s play?&#8221; Gu
                Changge&#8217;s face remained icy, unaffected by Jun Ruoxi&#8217;s attack, as he drew another
                blow.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Impossible…&#8221; At once, Jun Ruoxi&#8217;s face immediately turned
                into a grimace of disbelief as her body, which was sitting deep in the well, violently shivered. Blood
                dripped down from her delicate hands as she was damaged by the force of his counter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after, as the air quivered, Jun Ruoxi noticed that the sword she
                thrusted away was sealed. The dazzling sword light shone once again, but once it reached the air outside
                of the ancient well, it seemed to freeze as a strange force descended.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Blargh!&#8221; Jun Ruoxi spewed a mouthful of fresh blood. Even though
                she didn&#8217;t actually fight Gu Changge and was merely exchanging divine spells and abilities with
                him, she was clearly the inferior one.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Principles of Space and Reincarnation are being involved…&#8221;
                Dismayed, she felt her courage wavering, and it was her first time feeling afraid of a young man. Gu
                Changge was so powerful that it discouraged her. If it weren&#8217;t for the many arrays that were
                advantageous to her, he would have charged at her and left no chance for her to resist.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you don&#8217;t come out, I&#8217;ll go in there and kill
                you,&#8221; Gu Changge coldly claimed as gushing black and white lights emerged deep in his
                pupils.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such unparalleled might, resembling the restarting of a new universe
                as skies and lands were recreated. The intertwining black and white shade in both of his eyes resembled
                the evolution of Reincarnation, and he could see the wafting Chaos Qi as well as the countless stars
                that were plummeting.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first time he displayed such an ability after getting the Power
                of Reincarnation into his eyes. Such an aura was awfully dreadful. All-powering, even. Bai
                Lian&#8217;er, Jiang Luoshen, and the rest were terrified as their souls shivered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the gaze of such eyes, truth of the world, life and death of all
                beings, repetition of reincarnation seemed to take a physical form. It was an ability of absolute power.
                In that instant, every array above the ancient well broke out as all sorts of powers was visibly
                resisting the power of those eyes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Argh…&#8221; Quaking amid ambiguous air, the ancient well began to
                fall apart as alarming, enormous cracks occurred.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Jiang Ruoxi&#8217;s body was still shaking as she was
                profusely coughing up blood. Her face was as white as a sheet, and not a trace of blood was to be found.
                Her heart uncontrollably shivered. Never did she expect that, even with all the arrays in the region,
                she was unable to fend off against the threat of her enemy.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having found the flaw in the arrays, Gu Changge swung his blade once again
                and shattered all Principles being used to sustain it, which would then explode outside the ancient
                well. Withstanding the overwhelming aura, he walked forward into the well. He held the blade by Jun
                Ruoxi&#8217;s neck. It would take only a slight exertion of force to separate her head from her body, to
                end this woman’s life.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221; Obviously frightened, Jun Ruoxi couldn&#8217;t imagine
                that all the arrays planted by the Ancient Divine Beings were brushed off by Gu Changge so easily,
                allowing him entry into the ancient well.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll allow you one choice. Tell me everything you know.&#8221;
                Gu Changge shot her a glare as he blandly stated without much change in his tone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming to her senses, Jun Ruoxi could already feel the chilliness strangling
                her neck. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a clue. Just kill me.&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She remained seated. Her hair was as white as snow, so was her bloodless
                face. She was severely injured from the fight she had with Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really?&#8221; Having no intentions of entertaining her nonsense, Gu
                Changge immediately cut her neck with the Solar Heavenly Blade. Instantly, glistening blood splattered
                everywhere. Though, he didn&#8217;t cut it all the way as he merely inflicted a critical wound on
                her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221; Jun Ruoxi was obviously in agony as her heart
                palpitated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the Solar Heavenly Blade was no ordinary weapon as it was a
                Nirvana Grade Artifact, and the Principles of the Nirvana Realm it harboured could easily wear off her
                lifeforce, and cause an unrecoverable injury.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment there, she felt as though she had died.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I won&#8217;t kill you just yet. I believe your
                brother would surely come to your rescue.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes were extremely icy. Halting the
                meaningless chat, he extended his arm and sealed Jun Ruoxi&#8217;s cultivation. Then, as he rolled up
                his sleeves, his Inner World opened up, which he tossed her into.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        </p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right after Jun Ruoxi disappeared, fearsome auras surged in the region as the
                Divine Spring underneath the ancient well began to rage, emitting all shades of heavenly beams.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s expression subtly changed, after which a nebulous,
                terrorising figure walked out from his forehead amid thick grey fogs. Possessing no definite form, the
                figure carried an aura that could drive all lives insane.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indubitably, that was from his </span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;">Celestial Chant Talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At that moment
                it surfaced, it displayed overbearing, murderous power, upon which the air in the region was about to
                explode as the world almost fell apart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, the Grand Flask emerged on top of the head of the Celestial Chant,
                followed by a surge of black lights. As if it was a waterfall that was repressing and absorbing all
                energies of the region, lifeforce were sucked and swallowed by the Grand Flask.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It appears Jun Ruoxi was able to leave after all. It was just that her
                departure would mean that no one would be here to suppress the auras of the region, which may cause
                disturbances that would draw the attention of the outside world or perhaps even those in the Upper
                Realm.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge quickly discovered the truth of the region. However, now that his
                Celestial Chant and Grand Flask were suppressing the auras, he could instantly subdue any being that
                suddenly charged out of the Gates of Life.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the Gates of Life was continuously letting off endless lifeforce,
                which was quite the rare resource.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At this rate, I&#8217;ll be able to reach the limit of Sacred King
                Realm.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Gu Changge scanned his surroundings before teleporting out of the
                ancient well.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What was in there?&#8221; Jiang Luoshen came to her and hastily asked.
                Her curiosity tempted her to take a peek, but she couldn&#8217;t withstand the aura, which might break
                her body apart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Bai Lian&#8217;er was also interested in the mystery, but
                she refrained from asking about it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are a pair of mysterious gates,&#8221; Gu Changge briefly
                claimed without an explanation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And you killed Jun Ruoxi?&#8221; No longer detecting the aura from
                before, she intuitively assumed that Gu Changge murdered Jun Ruoxi.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of
                here.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was still waiting for Jun Bufan to locate the Gates of Death, he
                decided to put a pause on the matter at hand, and it seemed the place where the Six Demon Overlords were
                hiding was about to surface.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the group turned into divine rainbows and departed from the region.
                As for Gu Changge, he followed the aura on Jun Yao&#8217;s body without getting too close so as not to
                startle anyone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the Nine Domains of the Demon World, apart from Solar Domain, the other
                Domains were also vast to no ends, wherein vigorous ancient trees and stunning mountains
                towered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filled with brilliance and extravagance, the River Domain was a major Domain
                wherein a prosperous city lay. Should one stand on a high spot in the city and indulge in the view, they
                could perceive dense spiritual energy drifting through the mountains and woods, and be mesmerised by the
                spectacular mountains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the depths of the Domain, there was a crimson land, and there was
                not another shade of colour in its distant vicinity, as though the land was composed of blood. There,
                thick black clouds were billowing as dazzling Skullflower thrived between giant bones.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why would Fan’er come here?&#8221; Two women were hurrying to the
                crimson land. At that moment, the woman who was speaking donned a face of restlessness. &#8220;This is
                too far from the capital.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He claimed to have located a ruin here, and it would have been
                discovered by others if it weren&#8217;t for how isolated it is,&#8221; another woman beside her
                explained with a gentle voice.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two women were Jun Yao and Song Youwei, who departed from the capital
                of the Demon World.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really? Why would Fan’er come all the way here out of nowhere?&#8221;
                Jun Yao was baffled.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Song Youwei shook her head and replied, &#8220;Beats me. Perhaps you should
                ask him when we find him.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jun Yao then nodded without continuing the conversation. As a matter of fact,
                she was still anxious and uncertain about joining Song Youwei in her search for Jun Fan, fearing that
                accidents might occur. Essentially, Jun Fan was no longer her true brother. Nevertheless, she quickly
                composed herself right as she remembered the protective item Gu Changge gave her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiftly, the two traversed across a path in the crimson land, and Song
                Youwei, following Jun Fan&#8217;s instruction, found a somewhat secluded hill.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detecting their presence, Jun Fan then walked out, along with quite a number
                of formidable cultivators behind him, all of which were his father&#8217;s servants that possessed
                daunting strength.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, he was as wary as ever, having cast a Secret Technique
                beforehand to verify the auras of the two women, and he was only at ease after making sure that they
                were not followed. Though, he was surprised to see that Jun Yao tagged along with Song Youwei.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Youwei. Yao’er.&#8221; Jun Fan greeted the two as he showed
                himself.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, instead of speaking, Song Youwei looked at him with a perturbed
                gaze.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fan’er, why are you here?&#8221; Worried and confused, Jun Yao
                immediately questioned him without caring about the details.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jun Fan took a glance at Song Youwei, and judging by her expression, she
                seemed to have known everything as well as his true identity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was informed that a ruin is about to surface here, so I figured that
                I&#8217;d come to investigate the area, though our manpower is rather limited, which is why I invited
                Youwei over. But why are you here, Yao’er?&#8221; Jun Fan explained before revealing a puzzled
                expression, as if he didn&#8217;t know why Jun Yao even came.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jun Yao&#8217;s face grew a little dimmer as she remarked in a concerned
                tone, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know either. A few days ago, I went into the mountains to look for some tea
                flowers. As you know, Young Master Changge likes drinking tea. When I was on my way back to the capital,
                I heard news about Her Majesty sending Father and our family to prison. I didn&#8217;t know what to do.
                Then I happened to bump into Youwei, and she claimed to know where you are.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the explanation, Jun Fan grew to understand that Jun Yao was oblivious
                to everything that was happening, and she was clueless about his true identity. Thus, he was rather
                delighted, but mostly relieved, given that he didn&#8217;t want Jun Yao to know about the truth. It
                would also be beneficial to him since it would certainly save him the effort to explain himself.</span>

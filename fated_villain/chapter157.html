      <h4>
        Chapter 157: Never Planned To Let Him Live; Destiny Has Finally Arrived!
      </h4>
      <p><strong>Hum!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge left, stepping into the void as he went to the Ancient City
        where Ye Ling now resided in.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had just received the information that Yin Mei sent him in secret.
      </p>
      <p>Apparently, Ye Ling had now found the Immortal Cave.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge smirked, <i>‘What a great piece of news.’</i></p>
      <p>
        At this moment, the leek called Ye Ling had finally ripened and reached
        its fullest potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may sound a bit distasteful, but without Ye Ling, it would have been
        very difficult for Gu Changge to ever find the long-forgotten remains of
        the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on
        novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >‘At this moment, they should all be headed to that patch of ruins to
          hunt down Ye Ling… though I’m afraid they won’t find him there.’</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >‘However, with the many desecrated graves there, my previous claims
          will only grow stronger.’</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, Gu Changge made sure to tighten the black pot of the Demonic
        Arts on Ye Ling’s head.
      </p>
      <p>
        With most cultivators unable to let go of even the slightest bit of news
        regarding Ye Ling, rumours of his appearance alone were enough to move
        the masses right where Gu Changge needed them to be.
      </p>
      <p>If those tombs were exposed to the public at that time...</p>
      <p>
        The ancient corpses whose essences have been devoured would become the
        greatest evidence against Ye Ling, cementing his demonic title and
        pushing him into the abyss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insidious and flawless, this was precisely the kind of arrangement a
        villain such as Gu Changge would make.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it reaches such a state, Ye Ling would find it impossible to wash
        clean of the blame, reaching the point of no return.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, Ye Ling was completely oblivious to the whole matter,
        having already gone to the cave of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>And Gu Changge didn’t plan to let him come back alive either.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>As Gu Changge “received” news of Ye Ling’s appearance…</p>
      <p>
        Many of the younger generations also heard bits and pieces of
        interesting information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“Ye Ling’s figure appeared in the ruins to the east...”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling, who was leading people to search for Ye Ling in an ancient
        town, frowned slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she and Ye Ling travelled together before, Ye Ling did not reveal
        anything outside the norm.
      </p>
      <p>He had never approached those ruins either.</p>
      <p>
        However, Ye Langtian’s words made her suspicious. It was possible Ye
        Ling actually had the idea of entering those ruins but found it
        difficult to leave because she was by his side.
      </p>
      <p><i>‘He must’ve felt it was troublesome to slip away.’</i></p>
      <p>
        When she heard the news, the seeds of doubt planted in her heart only
        grew stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >‘I only hope that they don’t find anything implicating Ye Ling in the
          tombs; otherwise… that means he was hiding his true identity all this
          time, a terrifying thought’</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling’s eyes went cold as a murderous aura filled with bloodlust
        coursed through her body. She hated those who tried to deceive her the
        most, even more so when it came from a friend!
      </p>
      <p>
        The suspicions she had for Ye Ling had now outgrown even those she had
        for Ye Langtian.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Chi Ling, when you meet Ye Ling, I hope that kindness and
          sentimentality do not get in your way! There is no need to discuss the
          dangers of having the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor kept
          alive.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Dressed in colourful, feathered clothing with a handsome face, Kong Yang
        and the others persuaded her on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>After all, their hatred for Ye Ling was deeper than anyone else.</p>
      <p>
        It was especially so when they remembered the time when they had paired
        up with Ye Ling. It sent chills down their spins, giving birth to a
        terrible sense of fear and horror.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such an insidious person… it was their good fortune that they had safety
        in numbers and never acted alone. If they did, they may have suffered
        from Ye Ling’s poisonous methods and already be six feet under, buried
        heartlessly beneath the soil of the Immortal Ancient Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        They only prayed that Yin Mei of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family
        could also escape the devil’s claws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling’s cold and proud face darkened further after hearing their
        pleas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“This time, I shall tear all face with him!”</strong> she spoke
        icily.
      </p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p><strong>[Within the mountainous regions]</strong></p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang, Ye Langtian, and the descendants of the Immortal Lake
        received this news as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“The Demonic Arts Inheritor has appeared in a ruin in the East. Be
          careful, don’t let him escape!”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A Young Supreme relayed this information to his brothers and sisters
        behind him with a very stern look.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Ye Ling dared show himself, but I fear he may yet escape once
          more.”</strong
        >
        Ye Langtian frowned, golden rings covered his body as his hair shone
        brighter than the morning star.
      </p>
      <p>
        He knew Ye Ling well. The man looked honest enough, but in truth, he is
        a sinister and cunning individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he dares show himself with so many people hunting him, it meant he
        was confident he could either escape or fight back with minimal issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Nevermind, this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity must not be
          missed.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Langtian immediately summoned a group of his followers as they went
        to the rumoured ruins with the intent to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
        The White Tiger Clan was getting impatient, pressuring them to hand over
        Ye Ling. In addition, the other Dao Sects have also come to play as they
        too sent out their forces. Needless to say, Ye Langtian was under a
        great deal of unwanted pressure as the Heir of the Ye Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Ye Langtian wanted nothing more than to kill Ye Ling
        with his own hands, to pacify both the public as well as his own boiling
        hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang and the other Young Supremes did not stand idle either,
        venturing forth to slay the rumoured Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor.
        An amazing fluctuation emerged from the nearby mountains as the almighty
        forces moved to attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Divine chariots soared through the sky as divine rainbows shook the four
        fields as these forces moved to the ruins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many natives of the Ancient Immortal Continent were startled as they
        looked up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially the nearby Black Heavenly Eagles, Ancient Serpents, and
        Divine Crocodile clan members.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“What happened? Why did so many people rush to that place all of a
          sudden?”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“Could it be that some Immortal Treasure was born?”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the natives, the light in their eyes was cold, sinister. After
        all, their original plan was to join forces and besiege Gu Changge…
      </p>
      <p>But now, they have merely turned into divine rainbows and fled.</p>
      <p>
        Within the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan, a young girl stood on a
        cloud-shrouded cliff.
      </p>
      <p>
        She looked only seventeen or eighteen years old and possessed delicate
        facial features. She was dressed in white as clouds and mist covered her
        body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her black hair flowed like a cloud, held by nine phoenix hairpins. She
        wore a splendid jade robe depicting endless rivers and mountains, her
        appearance as holy as an immortal lotus with an unrivalled demeanour.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“By the command of the True Dragon Order, The True Dragon Clan has
          decreed that all younger generations of the Immortal Ancient Races
          will participate in the crusade against the Villain Gu
          Changge.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The girl whispered to herself, a gleaming light passed through her
        black, gem-like eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >‘Since Long Teng is dead, the younger generation of the Ancient
          Immortal Races are running around like a headless chicken. This is a
          perfect opportunity for me.’</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>She was none other than Hei Ming’s older sister, Hei Yanyu.</p>
      <p>
        On the bright side of things, she could be regarded as one of the best
        talents among the younger generation from the various Immortal Ancient
        Races.
      </p>
      <p>
        A rare, <i>“once-in-a-hundred-thousand-years”</i> genius of the Black
        Heavenly Eagle Tribe
      </p>
      <p>
        Some time ago, when Long Teng was still looking for the Heavenly
        Daughters of each race, he took a fancy to her outstanding appearance,
        wanting to include her in his harem.
      </p>
      <p>However, Hei Yanyu refused the offer.</p>
      <p>
        She kept a low profile and had no reputation, but that didn’t mean she
        was weak enough to just surrender to Long Teng and walk in his shadow
        for the rest of her life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In truth, Hei Yanyu was a very ambitious woman, and she intended to lead
        the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan past their ancient glories, dominating the
        other Ancient Immortal Races.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had originally planned to find an opportunity to challenge Long Teng
        and cement her position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Long Teng fell prey to Gu Changge before that thought
        could bear fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hei Yanyu had heard wind of Gu Changge and knew of his tyrannical
        strength. Unfortunately, most rumours that circulated among the various
        native groups of the Ancient Immortal Continent were faulty, to say the
        least. After all, they were far too focused on slander.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >‘In truth, Gu Changge’s strength should at least be on the level of
          Godhood[1].’</i
        >
      </p>
      <p><i>[1. False God, True God, Heavenly God, God King.]</i></p>
      <p>Hei Yanyu had personally investigated the outcome of that battle.</p>
      <p><strong>“Young Asura!”</strong></p>
      <p>Such a heavy title was not filled with mere words.</p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, all the clans were now united. And together, they were
        preparing their own crusade against Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>Hei Yanyu thought that this might be an opportunity for herself.</p>
      <p>
        No matter how powerful one is, how was it possible for them to face the
        entirety of the Ancient Immortal Continent’s forces on their own?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“The time has come, my followers! Come with me, and together, we
          shall put down Gu Changge!”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        With Hei Yanyu’s words came several blasts of Qi, as numerous tyrannical
        figures rushed out of the mountains behind her.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Swoosh!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The sound of the sound barrier being broken rushed out from the depths
        of the cliffs as mysterious figures appeared beside Hei Yanyu with an
        earth-rending stomp.
      </p>
      <p>
        A blond girl with glowing wings, an ancient and archaic dragon, a sturdy
        man with multi-coloured scales on his arms, and a giant of a man with
        bristling horns...
      </p>
      <p>
        These creatures emitted immensely powerful auras, the weakest among them
        having a cultivation base in the False God Realm, they were personally
        conquered by Hei Yanyu.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Hei Yanyu and the others disappeared, a pale and mysterious boy
        walked out from the edge of the cliff.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boy had a pair of obsidian-black wings on his back. It was Hei Ming.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he stared at the direction Hei Yanyu left in, a strange gleam
        coalesced within his piercing eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Now that the two ancestors have practised the Immortal Binding
          Technique... as soon as my sister fully leaves family grounds, it will
          be my time to ascend and take all the power for myself.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Hei Ming muttered to himself, a flame called ambition burning violently
        in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, even he himself did not notice the silken, silver-white patterns
        that webbed across his irises, appearing one moment, and then vanishing
        the next.
      </p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p><strong>[Inside the dry well, Ancient City.]</strong></p>
      <p>As Ye Ling took Yin Mei inside…</p>
      <p>
        The world spun in front of them. Space itself began to mix and overlap,
        shattering and reforming as if stuck in an endless loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, the two seemed to pass through a ripple in the void before
        landing firmly on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an odd flash in Yin Mei’s eyes, seeming rather
        surprised,<strong>
          “Where is this place? Did we come to another world?”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Yes, we are in another world. This place can be regarded as a Minor
          World left to me by my Master.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling tried to suppress the excitement blooming in his heart as he
        replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally, he addressed the one who left this inheritance to him as the
        Ancient Deity of Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, inside the Immortal Cave left by the Ancient Deity of
        Reincarnation, he must now address him as Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was just in case the Ancient Deity had placed a remnant of his soul
        here. It would be a great loss if he heard Ye Ling’s disrespectful words
        and decided to promptly expel him from this Minor World.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling’s usually had a deceptively simple appearance, but in truth, his
        heart harbours unfathomable secrets.
      </p>
      <p><strong>“The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation… could it be?”</strong></p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Yin Mei held an expression of shock, matching the
        gravity of Ye Ling’s words.
      </p>
      <p>She was wowed, awed even.</p>
      <p>
        In truth, Gu Changge had already said as much to her, so she wasn’t
        surprised in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“Yep, you guessed it.”</strong> Ye Ling felt a little proud,
        even boastful. Him being the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation’s rightful
        heir had made his ego swell to maximum capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, he didn’t dare expose such a secret for fear of being
        hunted down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confessing this fact in front of Yin Mei made him smile as he enjoyed
        Yin Mei’s <i>‘shock and awe’.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation is an existence infinitely close
          to True Immortals. You have such a background, it is really
          unexpected… it’s simply too much.”</strong
        >
        Yin Mei blushed as she said these words, <i>‘admiring’</i> him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling shook his head and continued,
        <strong
          >“So you need to know that the rumours from the outside that I am the
          Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor are completely false. The real
          Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor is actually Gu Changge, the Heavenly
          Dao Immortal Palace’s successor...”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p><strong>“He framed it all on me!”</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Gu Changge, this despicable and shameless villain. Sooner or later,
          I will tear off his self-righteous face and let the world know who the
          real villain is so that they can feed his flesh to the
          dogs...”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        While speaking of Gu Changge, deep hatred and murderous intent bloomed
        in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There has never been anyone in the world who he hated as deeply as Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>Even Ye Langtian was far behind in this regard.</p>
      <p>
        It was apparent that the two of them had never really met before, or
        even said a word to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet... Gu Changge still framed him like this, making him carry such
        a big black pot of blame, becoming a rat crossing the street that
        everyone shouted and beat!
      </p>
      <p>The whole world was practically his enemy!</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“You need not say anymore… I’ve always believed in you, Ye
          Ling.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei had a slight frown as she interrupted, ending Ye Ling’s tirade
        against her beloved Gu Changge. She grit her teeth, because at this
        moment, she could barely hold back from slapping that mouth of his.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Sister Yin, only you would treat me with such kindness!”</strong
        >
        Ye Ling exclaimed, a little moved.
      </p>
      <p>However, this wasn’t the time to get emotional.</p>
      <p>
        He immediately paved the way forward, guiding Yin Mei through his
        master’s abode.
      </p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p><i>’The trail left by Yin Mei ends here.’</i></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s figure walked out of the void and arrived at the same
        abandoned ancient temple.
      </p>
      <p>He stared at the dry well in front of him, his eyes thoughtful.</p>
      <p>
        <i
          >’Ye Ling should have already entered by now. In any case, it seems
          that this spatial passage is quite similar to my inner world...’</i
        >
        Gu Changge’s spiritual sense penetrated the empty well.
      </p>
      <p>
        As one who wields the Void Talent, it was no surprise that he noticed
        the faint spatial fluctuations.
      </p>
      <p>Obviously, this well led to another world with hidden secrets.</p>
      <p>
        <i
          >‘Somebody should have rushed over to the ruins by now. However, other
          than me, no one else knows where Ye Ling truly is.’</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled lightly as he stepped into the passage.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t his first time plucking up such a nicely fattened leek.</p>
      <p>As such, he was already quite familiar with the flow of events.</p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling would stand in the frontlines, charging forth to eliminate all
        kinds of dangers for him. He would then come from the back, happy and
        relaxed, following the easy road laid out for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately for Ye Ling, his reward could be summed up into a single
        word...
      </p>
      <p>Death!</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge did not plan for Ye Ling to leave this Immortal Cave alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, on the surface, a massive and heaven-shaking battle with the
        ‘Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor’ would break out after he followed
        him into his devilish lair.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in the end, Ye Ling bursts out with all his strength, escaping from
        Gu Changge’s hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word will spread that Gu Changge and Yin Mei joined hands to gravely
        wound the evil Ye Ling who fled. Meanwhile, he himself would take on the
        appearance of being seriously injured by the battle, all to convince the
        masses.
      </p>
      <p>In Gu Changge’s view, this strategy seemed to be flawless.</p>
      <p>
        After all, no one knows where Ye Ling will show up next. The Forbidden
        Demonic Arts’ Inheritor possessed the means to hide in plain sight,
        after all. He could be lurking anywhere in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the forces of Daoism will look for Ye Ling, but how does one find a
        dead man?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling’s various methods to change his face and hide his origin would
        then bite him in the a*s.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivating masses will not know that Ye Ling is dead, instead, they
        would think that he has escaped from view and is merely hiding in the
        dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, any future misdeeds that Gu Changge commits will be attributed to
        the dead Ye Ling. That was, of course, unless someone catches him in the
        act – the chances of which were slim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once these events have taken place, how could anyone suspect Gu Changge?
      </p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p>Ye Ling and Yin Mei walked a long way.</p>
      <p>
        The scenery had changed. An underground cavern, directly connected to
        the depths, sprawled out in front of them. A scorching breath tickled
        their faces as a certain unseen pressure enveloped them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engraved in the space surrounding them were intricate arrays, if one
        didn’t possess the power of reincarnation, they would severely hinder
        the movement of even those in the Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Ye Ling, you must pay close attention. This is the final test set by
          the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation. Be wary of the array structures in
          the void…”</strong
        >
        The Old Turtle’s voice spoke to him from within the pendant.
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling’s heart shuddered as he didn’t dare to relax his vigilance.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        He soon saw a bright light ahead of him as hot magma coiled under his
        feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single-plank bridge across the lava connected to the opposite side.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“There will naturally be creatures with the fire attribute thanks to
          the magma, so be careful”</strong
        >
        The Old Turtle reminded.
      </p>
      <p>Ye Ling nodded.</p>
      <p>A fiery wave of magma oozed from below, continuously striking him.</p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, the debris was effortlessly broken apart by the power of
        reincarnation hidden within his body, unable to hurt Ye Ling in the
        slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
        It carried an impossible amount of heat. Not only that, but the crushing
        gravity that followed would make even the sturdiest of body cultivators
        crumple and die.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average False God Realm cultivator would probably explode in an
        instant, and even True God Realm cultivators would find it difficult to
        pass.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, the test set by the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation was
        gruelling. Fortunately, such a test was well-suited for the Ye Ling of
        the present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a test wasn’t enough to turn this into a life-and-death crisis, but
        it wouldn’t be a walk in the park either.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge were here, he’d remark on how highly unnecessary
        everything was.
      </p>
      <p><strong>“Roar!”</strong></p>
      <p>
        A swarm of creatures wrapped in flickering flames jumped out of the
        magma and moved towards Ye Ling, momentarily embroiling him in an
        intense fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        All while Yin Mei stood at the back, watching the events unfold as she
        quietly left yet another invisible trail.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately for him, Ye Ling did not notice Yin Mei’s actions.</p>
      <p>
        In his eyes, boundless opportunities lay at the end of the road ahead.
      </p>
      <p>Nothing was more important than this!</p>
      <p>
        After the last magma creature died, Ye Ling took Yin Mei to overcome the
        other difficulties barring his path forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        He solved the multitude of tests left by the Ancient Deity of
        Reincarnation, destroying a series of formations and dispelling traps
        filled with killing intent along the way as they finally reached the
        depths of the abode.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was there that he would find a cave emitting an illustrious divine
        light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three bronze columns supported a bronze white-jade palace that lay
        suspended in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Laws of Reincarnation take on strands of black and white that surged
        throughout the entire structure, creating an incomparably dazzling view,
        a stark contrast to the surrounding darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the palace, a lake rose and fell like a boundless galaxy,
        emitting a peculiar silver mist.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small, silver-bark tree with white and black stripes containing the
        profound rules of reincarnation stood tall and proud in the centre of
        the hall as its leaves swayed.!
      </p>
      <p>
        When he saw all this, Ye Ling who stood outside the cave, was incredibly
        surprised and excited.
      </p>
      <p>Even Yin Mei was surprised, such a scene was simply too shocking.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“The Ancient Deity left behind this lake for you to attain the
          Reincarnation Physique…”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“The great root with the power of reincarnation! The immortal essence
          located in the Lake of Reincarnation will allow you to condense the
          Origin of Reincarnation, which may even be used as an almighty weapon
          to slash through all things!”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“What’s more, this portable cave was refined with a World Core
          containing the remains of the Ancient Deity alongside a few terrifying
          puppets that were refined alongside it.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>The Old Turtle’s excited voice resounded in Ye Ling’s ears.</p>
      <p><strong>“Haha! It seems my efforts weren’t in vain!”</strong></p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling jumped in excitement upon seeing all the opportunities, his
        whole body trembling slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“All of this is mine! Destiny is with me, Ye Ling! Just you wait, Gu
          Changge! I’ll kill you myself!”

          The white mist was a series of terrifying runes which contained the
          most brilliant divine light that could annihilated the void. It was as

          As a True Daoist, she stood out from everyone else, and she
          didn&#8217;t have a lot of enemies. Her strength could be seen with

          >Sky Deer Goddess sighed before she suddenly smiled. There was
          provocation on her beautiful dreamlike face. &#8220;What about me do
          you worry about? Why are you being so cautious, Young Master Gu? Is it
          my identity or my ability? How can I prove to you that I can be
          trusted when I am locked up here?&#8221;
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As she asked one question after another with her eyes on Gu
          Changge&#8217;s face, there was a kind of demonic nature in her body
          that felt completely different from the holy and detached one at the
          beginning.</span

          >Instead of answering her questions, he smiled and brought up the
          Aether Abyss. &#8220;That’s easy. Just tell me the route to pass
          through the Aether Abyss.&#8221;
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the Goddess seemed to have long expected his request, and
          she said, &#8220;I can do that, but it is useless to tell you the
          route. You must take me there in person to know it.&#8221; As if
          worried that Gu Changge would grow suspicious, she continued, &#8220;I
          say this because the Aether Abyss changes every second, and the route
          is not always the same. You need a guide every time you pass through
          there. You will get lost in it forever unless those from your realm
          can find the correct route.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[A guide…] Gu Changge frowned and glanced at her as he weighed the
          truth of her words. However, it was difficult to judge the
          authenticity when she just kept staring at him with her beautiful and
          alluring eyes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the past, it indeed took a lot of time to deduce the correct route
          when the Upper Realm invaded the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and
          crossed the Aether Abyss. However, the route could only be taken once.
          It would change the second time. Even those from the Eight Wastelands
          and Ten Domains had to go through the troublesome process of receiving
          special guidance when they returned to Sky Deer City.</span

          >&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it if you don&#8217;t believe me, Young
          Master Gu.&#8221; The Goddess nodded slightly as she sighed. Her
          current temperament was completely different from before. She now had
          a demonic nature, yet her consciousness was clear and orderly. It was
          hard to find any flaws in her well-founded words.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge stared at her again, his eyes lit up as scenes of
          reincarnation emerged. The world seemed foggy when an inexplicable
          energy descended.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;In other words, I need you to cross over the Aether
          Abyss,&#8221; he concluded. His face became blurred and radiant as if
          a river flowing through the heavens emerged from the dark, and the
          shower of light pouring out of it put the Great Dao of the world in
          disorder.</span

          >The Goddess frowned when she saw this. &#8220;Principles from the
          River of Time. I&#8217;m surprised you have reached this level.&#8221;
          She then hid nothing as she let Gu Changge freely feel her out.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She knew that this was one of Gu Changge&#8217;s mysterious
          abilitues. It was extremely profound as he could find the traces
          between heaven and earth. Of course, that included all causes and
          effects. Based on these things, Gu Changge could easily judge whether
          her words were true or not. In that instant, Principles of this place
          and the energy of many worlds blurred. Many images appeared in Gu
          Changge&#8217;s eyes, as if they were connected to that mysterious
          river.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As his frown deepened, all the brilliance in his eyes
          disappeared.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I’m not lying to you,&#8221; the Goddess added. Knowing that
          Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t found anything, she calmed down, leaving only
          a faint smile on her face. It was as if she had expected it long
          ago.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Your words earlier are true.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s frown
          relaxed. He then stretched out a palm quickly, and a misty sword-like
          beam appeared. With a click, the restriction on the Immortal Black
          Iron was removed, and the chains fell from her hands and feet.
        </span>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sky Deer Goddess was taken aback when she saw Gu Changge so
          resolutely remove the chain. She didn&#8217;t think he would release
          her so quickly.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Do you believe me now?&#8221; she asked.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He shook his head in response, and with a strange glow in his eyes,
          he gave a reply that didn&#8217;t particularly answer her question.
          &#8220;It seems that I&#8217;ll have to let you lead the way through
          the Aether Abyss. But we are not going right now.&#8221;</span

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multicoloured blood in his palm began to condense as it slowly morphed into an Iridescent Spear with an extremely sharp end. It first looked like it would pierce the sky, but it was soon driven downwards in an attempt to kill Ying Shuang.</span><span id="more-28388"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you still going to deny the truth even at this point?!&#8221; Ying Shuang growled, his face extremely twisted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colourful mist made of blood started to seep out of his body, as though it was from the blood of god. After all, like Prince Shen, he was the son of a Sky Emperor. Needless to say, the tyranny of this bloodline drove a burning, terrifying power that could make the void tremble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thump* As if colliding with an asteroid, the two of them had charged at each other within the next second. However, the impact shook Ying Shuang&#8217;s body so violently he ended up coughing up blood, and his arms spasmed as if they were almost blown to bits. The spear that was sent in his direction through unparalleled strength had nearly destroyed his internal organs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ying Shuang unhesitantly retreated at lightning speed. His speed and momentum was like that of a Roc that had its wings spread out. He fell back quickly in his attempt to stop fighting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What about the Demonic Arts you have cultivated? Why have you not used your skills? Are you looking down on me?&#8221; Prince Shen let out a scoff and chased after him in his Four-Spirit Battle Chariot, but his expression soon changed as he demanded in shock and anger, &#8220;Gu Changge? How are you already here?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Successor of Demonic Arts is my prey. Surely, you are not going to take him at my expense?&#8221; Ying Shuang, who was in the midst of escaping, also had a drastic change in his expression. In fact, he was slightly pale from fear, and was cold from head to toe as though he had seen a ghost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t expect to see ripples all over the space just in front of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, Gu Changge walked out of the void with a smile on his face, his eyes were calm and deep. With his extraordinary looks and wavy clothes, he looked divine and elegant.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you running anymore?&#8221; Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t help but smile when he looked at Ying Shuang turn white from fear. On the other hand, he had completely ignored Prince Shen, who was right behind in his chariot.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, I have no grudge with you. Why do keep framing me, over and over again?&#8221; Ying Shuang felt a chill throughout his whole body that his limbs shivered and his soul trembled. Despite how he forced himself to calm down, his voice still trembled.  He had never in his life felt such terror and hopelessness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wasn&#8217;t he fighting against the Golden Ancient Bell? How is he suddenly here?]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No grudge, you say? You are wrong. I do have a grudge against you.&#8221; Gu Changge still smiled softly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget your identity. You and I are mortal enemies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ying Shuang&#8217;s face was pale and desperate, and he had to force out his words through gritted teeth. &#8220;Why&#8230;&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was only jealous of Gu Changge&#8217;s identity and wanted to take everything from him at the beginning. However, he had never said a word about this, nor did anything. [How exactly did he find it out?]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you trying to say, Gu Changge?&#8221; All of a sudden, Prince Shen roared from afar as he drove the Four-Spirit Battle Chariot closer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ying Shuang is my prey!&#8221; He hadn&#8217;t made sense of the current situation. He also didn&#8217;t give Gu Changge&#8217;s abrupt appearance much thought.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed to him that Gu Changge was here to snatch Ying Shuang away after he saw the latter being heavily wounded. Thus, Prince Shen couldn&#8217;t possibly let Gu Changge get in his way so easily.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can&#8217;t you tell what I am doing?&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at him with an eased nonchalance before smiling, &#8220;But since Ying Shuang is your prey, I will hand him over to you. Don&#8217;t worry. I won&#8217;t meddle.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that, he floated away, and had already retreated aside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince Shen let out a frown then. His instincts were telling him that this was all somewhat strange. He even began to wonder if Ying Shuang was right about him being wronged. However, he couldn&#8217;t spend time trying to figure it out when he saw Ying Shuang turn into a divine rainbow and flee. Prince Shen&#8217;s face fell, and he quickly went after Ying Shuang.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh* As a shockwave from a punch swept over, Ying Shuang suddenly fell like a piece of leaf. He was uncontrollably spurting blood from his mouth. With the way he fell to the ground and couldn&#8217;t get up, one could only imagine how many bones he had broken.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You useless thing. I didn&#8217;t think you couldn&#8217;t stand after just one punch from me. If you are still putting on an act, don&#8217;t blame me for being ruthless…&#8221; Letting out a cold snort, Prince Shen approached him with quick steps as an iridescent spear took shape again in order to pierce through Ying Shuang and have him pinned to the ground.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unexpectedly, his expression became one of disbelief the next moment as if he had been struck by lightning.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Puff* Blood splattered like a dazzling red flower that bloomed from him. A slender and fair arm had penetrated from the back of his torso. The chilling wound was like a rip open a rag, creating a perfect hole. Gu Changge then appeared behind him with a faint smile on his face. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge… You…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince Shen mumbled and turned around to look at the man. His face had instantly turned pale as he spotted a look of incredulity. [Why? Why is he attacking me? Shouldn’t he go for Ying Shuang instead, at such a critical moment!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with his quick reflexes, he shot out a single grain of jade-like Holy Sand from his mouth, which had grown into the size of a mountain in the blink of an eye. It shape-shifted into a shield that launched an attack on Gu Changge, who was behind him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge only let out a chuckle and asked, &#8220;Do you really think that will do anything to me?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A terrifying glow shone and a sword appeared in his hand, which seemed to be forged from Divine Gold, which promptly sliced Prince Shen into pieces. The colourful blood that seemed to be from god bloomed in the air with a glint before the droplets landed on the ground. Yet, his figure still seems intact.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the mountain-sized grain of Holy Sand exploded with a bang when he slapped it down with his other hand, filling the place with fluttering dust. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you doing this, Gu Changge&#8230;&#8221; Prince Shen Couldn&#8217;t help but throw up blood as his face turned ashen. His body was on the verge of splitting up. His bones and lungs had been torn apart by the Sword Qi, and there was also an intractable glow from the sword that was constantly eating away at his vitality, making it difficult for his injuries to heal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His scalp felt numb, and his back was cold. His soul was almost frozen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Was what Ying Shuang said true…&#8221; He suddenly spoke. After all, he was not that dumb. It was just that he never thought about or tried to understand it before. Now that he had seen Ying Shuang&#8217;s terrified expression and experienced what Gu Changge did, he had finally found out the truth.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, Ying Shuang wasn&#8217;t lying after all! It turns out that Gu Changge had been the mastermind all along! He is the real Successor of Demonic Arts!] The realisation gave Prince Shen a bone-biting chill. Even his head felt like breaking from the unexpected revelation. This was something that he had never considered before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Gu Changge had been plotting against everyone from the very beginning. Even the many forces had been playing around in the palm of his hand. This was such an eerie but flawless scheme that could send chills down the bones of anyone who found out about it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have been telling you from the start. You were the one who didn&#8217;t believe me,&#8221; Ying Shuang heaved while spitting out a mouthful of blood. He struggled to get up, and had a gloating look in his eyes when he saw the scene before it was quickly replaced by gloom.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The only way we can survive this is by joining hands. Or else, we will die here today. Gu Changge, ah—&#8221; Ying Shuang was about to say something else when his face suddenly turned dark, and he spit out blood. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without anyone realising, Gu Changge had suddenly appeared in front of him, and had stomped on him with all his might.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ying Shuang&#8217;s bone had shattered, making a cracking sound. His entire body almost blew into bits at being stomped on by such tremendous force.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was so fast he almost seemed to have disappeared into thin air at that moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Join hands? Perhaps, you have misjudged your own strength.&#8221; He nonchalantly laughed as his frightening Demonic Energy took shape in his palm. At the very next moment, his Eight Barren Demon Halberd appeared in his hand, and it made a roaring sound that shattered the sky.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He swiftly swung down, and the terrifying glow of the blade looked at though it was falling from another universe as it quickly flashed by. With the weapon at its full force, everything that the blade came in contact with was destroyed. Seeing this completely drained the blood from Prince Shen&#8217;s face. Even when Prince Shen was trying to fend it off, it was to no avail.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The void exploded at this moment, and a terrifying crack stretched out a hundred kilometres. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Eternal Overcast creatures felt the frightening aura. Even if they had lost their minds, they didn&#8217;t dare approach, and chose to flee in fear while trembling.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this the combined power of your alliance?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled, &#8220;How disappointing.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the void, dark Grand Runes spiralled out as light and mist rose, condensing to form a Grand Flask, which soon fell down towards Prince Shen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom* But in the next moment, the look on Prince Shen&#8217;s face suddenly changed as a peerless aura emerged from his Knowledge Sea. It was a sword that was incomparably splendid and dazzling. It must have been forged from Divine Gold as it began to take shape. Then, his Primordial Spirit held it and slashed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That one slash caused dreadful phantoms to manifest. It was strong enough to split the universe and cause the collapse of stars. Even bringing the world to ruin would be a small feat for this sword.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Gu Changge only faced forward with a calm expression before a loud wisp of sword beam shot out. There was a loud clang, and then everything turned silent.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment the two swords collided, the terrifying aftermath almost destroyed both sky and earth. Prince Shen let out a pained groan as he was cut between his eyebrows, whereas his Primordial Spirit almost broke down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe this!&#8221; He couldn&#8217;t help but bellow, causing his soul to start radiating. Then, a purplish gold magic lamp swiftly appeared, and as soon as it did, it released a remarkable aura that could burn the sky.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the son of Sky Emperor Shen, this was something to protect his life. However, it could not be activated at will. Only when his life was at stake. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!!* Despite that, Gu Changge had long anticipated Prince Shen to pull another move. The Grand Flask then emerged behind him before black light and boundless fog loomed over the sky, shrouding the entire area under it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though this Grand Flask was a product of a condensation of runes, even that powerful gold magic lamp would soon be completely engulfed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You really are the Successor of Demonic Arts&#8230; You truly hid it well.&#8221; Prince Shen&#8217;s face was pale as his whole body shivered. Even his Four-Spirit Battle Chariot had been turned into powder by the Grand Flask.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You were the ones who was too idiotic.&#8221; Upon hearing that, Gu Changge laughed with nonchalance before the terrifying black light instantly devoured Prince Shen. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately afterwards, unwilling roars rang out, which shook Ying Shuang to his core and made him shudder out of extreme fear.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can&#8217;t kill me, Gu Changge. Because if you do, I will expose your true identity.&#8221; Ying Shuang&#8217;s voice was shaky as he wanted to kneel and beg for mercy. In the end, he was just a horse feeder. Nothing more than that. He was almost scared out of his wits at this moment.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No need.&#8221; Gu Changge let out another casual smile before he swung a palm at him, instantly killing both his body and soul as a poof resounded around the place.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filled with fear, Ying Shuang was still begging for forgiveness up until his last moment.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, before this, Gu Changge had already plundered the so-called Body Possession Fortuitous One&#8217;s Fortuity. Though, just in case, Gu Changge had even taken the Soul Lamp in Ying Shuang’s soul.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the System prompted him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;*Ding!* User succeeded in killing the Body Possession Fortuitous One. As the Zero Fortuity Rule was in effect, User is rewarded with a Heavenly Gift Treasure Chest.&gt;</span></p>

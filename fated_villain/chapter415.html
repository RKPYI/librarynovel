          sight, mainly because the world would turn upside down, and the stars
          would shift. The entire universe seemed to tremble due to their aura.
          If it weren&#8217;t for the fact that this place is especially sturdy,

          through the sky, the boundless blood-red exploded like a downpour. As
          he clenched his fist and smashed forward, his whole body turned into
          the most petrifying, sharp weapon. He made a clear trembling sound
          when he collided with the Solar Heavenly Blade. Afterwards, he spread
          out his wings on his back and quickly swept towards the back at a high
          speed. This was his powerful Divine Talent that only grew more
          outstanding after he reached the Nirvana Realm.</span

          Overlord&#8217;s eyes were equally indifferent as he dashed forward
          with his Solar Heavenly Blade and slashed ahead from an infinite
          distance. At this moment, the Solar Heavenly Blade seemed to have
          awakened when a peerless and powerful energy emerged and turned into a
          blade&#8217;s aura that engulfed the sky.</span

          >The look on the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord&#8217;s face was
          replaced by one of rage when he saw this. He had been at a
          disadvantage solely because he didn&#8217;t have his artifact. This
          made him feel aggrieved, as it felt like the Solar Demon Overlord was
          winning unfairly.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord was no simple person. With
          a roar, he brandished his other artifacts. Even though they
          weren&#8217;t as powerful as a Nirvana Grade Artifact, their power
          should not be underestimated. The Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord then
          tried his best to block this attack by attacking forward.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >And yet, it was all in vain in the face of the Solar Heavenly Blade.
          The moment the Heavenly Sword fell, all of the Crimson Cloud Demon
          Overlord&#8217;s artifacts, Principles, divine abilities, and runes
          collapsed, and even his body almost started cracking.</span

          Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord&#8217;s face turned frigid, and he
          quickly appeared in the distance. He was using a Forbidden Technique.
          One could only imagine how horrifying it was, to be called a Forbidden
          Technique even in the Nirvana Realm.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The next moment, a vast energy filled the area between his eyebrows,
          and a Primeval True Feather surrounded in golden light emerged. The
          Solar Demon Overlord looked apprehensive when he saw the item.
          &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have a backup plan,&#8221;
        </span>

          >He continued. &#8220;Other than the Crimson Cloud Spear, you actually
          made your sturdiest Primeval True Feather into an
          artifact.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord sneered, &#8220;I started refining
          this a million years ago, but I&#8217;ve never shown it to anyone
          else… because it is bound to return with the blood of an Nirvana Realm
          Expert once it is shown.&#8221; As he spoke, a golden feather broke
          out from between his eyebrows. There were all kinds of ancient and
          complicated patterns on it. The primitive item looked as though it
          contained all his comprehension of the Great Dao. The energy that
          descended between heaven and earth felt like it could shatter the
          sky.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Swish!* The golden feather was like a peerless Celestial Sword,
          whose splendour was astonishing. As if determined to kill the Solar
          Demon Overlord right here and now, it unhesitantly cut towards him.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even when Solar used the Solar Heavenly Blade to fight against it, it
          was so strenuous his arm convulsed for a while before it collapsed due
          to the impact. Residues of his bone fell out then. At the same time,
          the spot between his eyebrows cracked open. It was an inch away from
          being pierced through.</span

          refined from the most solid Primeval True Feather, making it
          indestructible. The item was closely linked to him, and it held a
          terrifying power that could even kill off one&#8217;s Primordial
          Spirit.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Now that’s something interesting.] Gu Changge, who had been keeping
          a close eye on the battle between the two, couldn&#8217;t help
          squinting a little in fascination when he saw the golden feather. If
          the golden feather managed to catch his attention, it was probably
          more extraordinary than it appeared. Its surface was thick with the
          divine abilities of the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord. It could hardly
          be fought against the moment it was taken out.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, it didn&#8217;t bother him much as he continued to watch the
          battle from a distance. Up to now, the Solar Demon Overlord and
          Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord were already deep in their fight.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Solar Demon Overlord thought that he would be the winner, as he
          had the Solar Heavenly Blade. To his surprise, the Crimson Cloud Demon
          Overlord&#8217;s ability was exceptional. Many years ago, he began to
          refine his own Primeval True Feather into an artifact, even though it
          still fell short compared to a real Nirvana Grade Artifact. During the
          short period of time, the two of them kept going for each
          other&#8217;s neck as they landed blow after blow. Their blood was
          consistently splattering in the air from their gruesome wounds.</span

          >At this moment, the Lunar Demon Overlord, who was fighting with the
          Blood Demon Overlord and another Demon Overlord in the distance,
          suddenly spewed out a mouthful of blood after she sustained grave
          injuries. Her face was ashen at this point. She seemed like
          couldn&#8217;t hold out against the two for much longer.</span

          Overlord to deal with Solar Demon Overlord earlier, but when he saw
          that the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord didn&#8217;t need his help, he
          went to aid in the killing of the Lunar Demon Overlord instead.</span

          >Even though she was also in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm, her cultivation
          level was far inferior compared to the two. She might be able to hold
          out if it was a one-on-one fight, but taking on them both at the same

          Changge&#8217;s eyes were dim when he glanced at a certain place in
          the void. He had set up many jade talismans just now. No one would be
          able to sense them, with how busy they were with their battle.
          However, he chose not to do anything just yet. He couldn&#8217;t let

          light loomed and roared, and it shook the sky when it passed by.
          Swiftly after, the Azure Dragon, the Celestial Phoenix, the Vermilion

          turned cold as he stared at Gu Changge and asked again, &#8220;Who are
          you? Your weapon reminds me of a taboo rumour that should have been
          submerged in the River of Time.&#8221;

          Eight Barren Demon Halberd suddenly fell horizontally, and an
          incomparably petrifying power burst out. &#8220;Senior, don&#8217;t

          in disbelief. His aura collapsed and exploded with a bang before he
          tore apart, turning into Bloodmist that permeated the air.</span

          he was torn apart, and his body was buried in the four cardinal points
          on earth, he would still be able to resurrect in the present world.
          However, under the destructive energy of the Eight Barren Demon
          Halberd, the Crimson Cloud Demon Overlord was annihilated in an
          instant.</span

          Overlord&#8217;s face falling abruptly. The Eight Barren Demon Halberd
          was soaked in blood, and its overwhelming aura that covered the land
          seemed like it could crush the sky.</span

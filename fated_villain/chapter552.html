          identity. He was a merciless man who murdered many Sect Masters in the
          Godly Illusion Tomb. He had some treasures on him, like the Godly
          Illusion Prime Ancestor’s Divinity Crystal and also the Demonic Seed
          implanted by Gu Changge.</span

          destroy Jiang Chen’s reputation and turn him into a street rat that
          everyone detested at any time he wanted. However, it was not the time
          for him to do that yet. Jiang Chen was still rather valuable to his
          plan of invading Kun Mountain.</span

          thoughts were suddenly interrupted by Gu Xianer&#8217;s voice coming
          from beside him, causing him to turn and look at her.</span

          shook his head slightly, and cast a quick glance at the rock she had
          chosen. There were a lot of rocks in this corner, but there were also
          many cultivators picking them out. Despite the commotion caused by
          Jiang Chen, not all of the cultivators were drawn over to his
          side.</span

          soon as it was cut open, a brilliant light poured out of it, causing
          another yet another commotion in the area. There was no doubt that
          another precious treasure had been born, as the energy fluctuation
          alone was already quite impressive.</span

          rumored to possess the Legacy of a Divine Source Master, so it was no
          surprise that she had an eye for picking stones. Unfortunately,
          compared to Jiang Chen, Gu Xianer was not someone they could just
          casually approach.</span

          >The Divine Rock Conference garnered the attention of the entire Upper
          Realm. Prominent figures were seen inspecting rocks In every corner.
          They carefully felt each one, as though they were picking out the
          perfect watermelon from a roadside fruit vendor. Pillars of light
          occasionally illuminated the sky. Many Ancient Beings were even seen
          fighting with each other over a mere rock.</span

          another. Many people gathered around to gaze at them. Some even
          attempted to resonate with them using ancient spells.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Not only the Intangible Demonic Rock, but the remaining Divine Rocks
          also had unique shapes. One of them stood as tall as a child and had
          seven orifices. Haze of light was seen coming out of each orifice,
          pulsing rhythmically just like a beating heart.</span

          an extremely powerful living creature. The rock has been sealed in a
          Dao Artifact within Dark Kun City, constantly absorbing Nirvana
          Energy. As a result, it now possesses some power of Nirvana. If a
          creature were to be born from it, its potential would be
          unimaginable.”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many ancient beings came forward and carefully studied the
          Seven-Orifice Divine Rock. Through the orifices, they saw hazy streams
          of light swirling within it. Slightly weaker cultivators felt their
          hearts quiver and nearly got down to their knees and bow before this
          Divine Rock.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Seven-Orifice Divine Rock was the most special out of the Seven
          Divine Rocks, because it could not be cut open. It had quite a
          significant history behind it too. It was originally obtained by a
          Daoist Master in ancient times from an Immortal Demon Paradise.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the time, the Principles of the World had not yet been broken.
          Anyone worthy of the Daoist Master title had at least attained the
          True Immortal Realm. Therefore, many believed the Seven-Orifice Divine
          Rock was actually the potential Successor to an invincible being,
          sealed away in the form of a Divine Rock.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Seven-Orifices Divine Stone had been kept in Dark Kun City for
          several epochs. Many made numerous attempts to steal it, but none
          succeeded. They either accidentally touched the Dao Artifact that
          safeguarded the rock, or were obliterated by the Prohibition Arrays on
          its surface.</span

          >Apart from the Seven-Orifice Divine Rock, the Immortal Foetus was
          attracting a lot of attention too. It stood at half the height of a
          person, among a heap of heavenly materials. The rock looked like a
          piece of sleek, flawless jasper, with rich Immortal Mist flowed within
          it and shrouded around it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At every moment, an endless stream of Dao Energy surged around the
          rock and was absorbed by it. Even cultivators standing nearby
          experienced a heightened sense of clarity in their Dao Hearts. Some
          even started meditating near it, believing that enlightenment was
          within their reach.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The origin of the Immortal Foetus was shrouded in even greater
          mystery. Some claimed it had fallen from the Nine Heavens, while
          others believed it had emerged from a divine river that flowed through
          the Celestial Realm and somehow drifted its way into this realm… Some
          also claimed to have seen a light streaking across the sky every
          night, so bright that it illuminated the entire sky for a moment.
          There were simply too many rumors about the Immortal Foetus.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Currently, a crowd had gathered around the Immortal Foetus, all
          closely examining it. A ground of Ancient Beings tried to assess it in
          different ways. Their bodies glowed with a hazy light as they used
          grand arts and divine abilities to try and catch a glimpse of its true
          form.</span

          To cut it open, you must trade it for Immortal Crystals. However,
          acquiring the necessary number of Immortal Crystals is no easy task,
          even for an Immortal Force. These Immortal Crystals are incredibly
          rare, and having one or two in possession is already a remarkable feat
          for any Immortal Force.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many cultivators shook their heads and sighed in disappointment,
          realizing it was very unlikely they would be able to witness the
          Immortal Foetus being cut open in their lifetime.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >So what exactly was an Immortal Crystal? A Immortal Crystal was a
          spirit crystal that contained the energy of immortality, and its value
          was beyond measure. Even True Daoists would be eager to obtain it. If
          such a thing appeared in the world, it would undoubtedly result in a
          bloodbath.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sheer number of Immortal Crystals required to cut open this piece
          of Immortal Foetus was beyond imagination. Even if a True Daoist took
          out his entire fortune, it would still be barely enough. Unless the
          major Immortal Forces were willing to pool their wealth, cutting open
          this Divine Rock would be nothing more than just a pipe dream. So the
          crowd gathered around the Immortal Foetus were just simply there to
          observe the Divine Rock.</span

          over. An Xi fixed her burning gaze on the Divine Rock and asked Jiang

          Immortal Foetus?”</span

          hearing the question, but in reality, he was secretly communicating
          with the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation in his

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen&#8217;s heart quivered. He relayed the message to An Xi
          and the others with a serious expression on his face. The people
          around them also heard him, but no one doubted the credibility of his
          words. After all, Jiang Chen had already proved himself to them by
          demonstrating his abilities that befitted his identity as a Divine
          Source Master earlier.</span

          requires so many Immortal Crystals. Even if we know that there’s
          something valuable in it, we’re unable to get it open.” The Young War

          King with Six Crowns and the Phoenix Lady agreed with him. The
          Immortal Foetus was definitely the most valuable of the Seven Divine
          Rocks. Up until now, no one in the Upper Realm could gather enough
          Immortal Crystals to cut it open.</span

          the final lost page of the scripture from the Great Yu Celestial
          Dynasty might be connected to this mysterious Divine Rock. It was an
          intuition that was difficult to explain.</span

          gather their Immortal Crystals together, it might be possible to catch
          a glimpse of what’s inside. Then again, it’s also likely that any

          determined not to leave it behind, especially after the Artifact
          Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation had confirmed that there was
          indeed something miraculous and precious in it.</span

          came over from another direction, exuding an immense aura that nearly
          brought the other cultivators around him to their knees. His
          expression remained indifferent as he spoke, but he still managed to
          instill fear in everyone, causing them to show him great

          taken aback and felt a bit embarrassed as he had not anticipated
          encountering another True Daoist here. Although he was eager to cut
          the Immortal Fetus open, he had never seen a Immortal Crystal before,

          as if he could see right through him. His words were harsh, as if he
          regarded Jiang Chen as a naive country bumpkin. Jiang Chen’s

          couldn&#8217;t help but tremble slightly under the old man’s imposing
          presence. His skin felt taut and his face paled as he struggled to
          remain standing on his feet.</span

          >Although his display of extraordinary abilities left a great
          impression on many prominent figures, no one dared to speak up for him
          in the presence of a True Daoist. Even his good friend, Niu Tian,
          appeared slightly pale from being suffocated.</span

          >True Daoists were those who stood at the pinnacle of the Upper Realm,
          individuals whom one could not encounter on ordinary occasions. With
          just one breath, they had the power to obliterate those beneath them a
          billion times over.</span

          >While everyone was afraid to make a noise, Gu Changge, who had been
          observing the Immortal Foetus for a while, broke the deafening silence
          with a chuckle. “This Immortal Foetus is indeed extraordinary, let’s
          cut it open today and have a look.”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The old man was momentarily taken aback by Gu Changge’s suggestion.
          He quickly regained his composure, but still wore a look of surprise
          on his face. The expression on his face softened a little as he cupped
          his fist respectfully and said, “Greetings, Young Master Changge. May
          I inquire as to the reasoning behind your decision?”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What? He’s really going to cut it open…?” Everyone was also taken
          aback to hear that Gu Changge also had the plan of cutting this
          Immortal Foetus open.</span

          >While Jiang Chen may not have been worthy of the Divine Rock, Gu
          Changge was a different case altogether. He could possibly possess the
          huge number of Immortal Crystals needed to cut it open. After all,
          there was probably no one wealthier than him in the Upper Realm.</span

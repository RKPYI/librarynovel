        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s original world, Sword Dao stood at the pinnacle. Almost everyone in the world was a sword cultivator. When talented individuals were born, they would be accompanied with Innate Spirit Swords.</span><span id="more-32772"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of his Innate Spirit Sword, he was able to enter one of the strongest sects in his old world, the Shu Sect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, he was accidentally struck by Heavenly Tribulation when he was observing the Prime Ancestor attempting to breakthrough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His residual soul drifted to this world and he reincarnated as a man with the same name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, third young master of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s General Residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His father was Tuo Ba Zhan, a great general of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Tuo Ba Zhan was overwhelmingly powerful, had frightful authority and also safeguarding a portion of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. He was currently heavily favored by Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had an elder sister, an elder brother, and a younger sister.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His elder brother was a commander of the army and was a famous youth hero of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. He had a huge and limitless future ahead of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His elder sister was a lecturer in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s Thousand Dao Academy. She had heavenly beauty, terrifying talent and had plenty of admirers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His younger sister was a famed prodigy of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. She was powerful and there was hardly a rival in the same generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As compared to his siblings, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was very mediocre. Some even see him as a dumb individual that couldn&#8217;t communicate well. Naturally, even his father felt disappointed in him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Imperial Capital, there was plenty of gossip and mockery about the all-powerful general having an incompetent son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao maintained an attitude of ignorance towards these gossips. As a person who lived through multiple lives, he deeply understood the reasoning to lay low-profile and acted like a fool to devour the strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his previous life, he had been too flamboyant and revealed his talent at a young age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once people of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty knew, it then attracted the attention of Gu Changge, bringing disaster onto them. Therefore, when Tuo Ba Xiao Yao awakened his previous life memories at the age of 13, he started to keep a low-profile and practiced the sword everyday, slowly accumulating his power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when he was a sword cultivator in the Shu Sect, he had learned many of the Divine Grade Sword Arts in that world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After arriving in this world, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao started cultivating from a young age and didn&#8217;t dare to be complacent. His current cultivation of the Sword Dao was already far beyond his previous cultivation in the other world. After all, he was a person who had memories of three lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was also one of the reasons why many people felt that Tuo Bao Xiao Yao was a little dumb. Instead of cultivating the Tuo Ba Family&#8217;s powerful cultivation techniques, he had been practicing the sword day and night. Everyone felt that something was wrong with his brain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s elder brother and sister couldn&#8217;t understand his behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;According to the memory of my previous life, Gu Changge wanted to seize the Sword of World Domination because he was seeking the Seven Tools of World Domination in order to open the Immortal Palace Treasury. As of now, I have used the Shu Sect&#8217;s supreme sword manual to combine the Sword of World Domination and my Primordial Spirit to refine the Primordial Foetal Sword of World Domination. So, the sword shall stay if the owner stays, and the sword shall die if the owner dies. There is definitely no way to take it in this world. So, if Gu Changge wants the Sword of World Domination, he cannot kill me.&#8221; Inside the antique room, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao muttered to himself while his eyes were shining with bright light. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao didn&#8217;t dare to underestimate his future nemesis, Gu Changge. The incidents that happened in this lifetime were slightly different as compared to his previous life, but it still didn&#8217;t change the fact that Gu Changge was terrifying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tuo Bao Xiao Yao&#8217;s opinion, this life&#8217;s Gu Changge was even more terrifying than the previous one. Gu Changge&#8217;s strength was even more unfathomable and unimaginable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Bao Xiao Yao might have been staying in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and have never left, but he had been paying attention to information on Gu Changge. He was carefully analyzing all of Gu Changge&#8217;s means and methods, so that he could come up with countermeasures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao knew that once Gu Changge collected the six other Tools of World Domination, he would start to investigate the traces of the Sword of World Domination. By then, Tuo Bao Xiao Yao would have to conceal everything even if he had to die. Otherwise, the same tragedy would happen just like what happened in his previous life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In my previous life, I have wronged Feiya. I thought that she was the one that leaked out that I possessed the Sword of World Domination to Gu Changge… But afterwards, she blocked a palm strike for me and was mercilessly killed by Gu Changge. It seemed like she didn&#8217;t leak it out. If so, how did Gu Changge find out that I have the Sword of World Domination?&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was deep in thought, trying to answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This had been something that he couldn&#8217;t understand. There were only a few individuals who knew about his possession of the Sword of World Domination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The fact that the Sword of World Domination is my Innate Spirit Sword is something that not even my father and the others know about. Could Gu Changge have used the connection between the Tools of World Domination to sense it? It is fortunate that I have refined the Sword of World Domination into the Primordial Foetal Sword of World Domination in advance. So now, it is able to isolate all methods of detection, but I still have to take precaution…] When thinking about this, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao involuntarily let out a breath of relief and relaxed a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his memories of his previous life, he wouldn&#8217;t be encountering Gu Changge soon and would be able to continue cultivating in peace for a period of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right now, I am already almost at the Sacred Lord Realm. If I fight at full strength, I should still be able to contest against Sacred King Realm experts. But my chances of victory against Gu Changge is still slim.&#8221; His eyes flickered with radiance before dimming into solitude again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the memories, in a few more days, it would be the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s Hunting Event. Prodigies from various Forces in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty would be participating. They would strive for the first place in order to win generous rewards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, members from the Immortality Forces would also be spectating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Tuo Ba Xiao Yao didn&#8217;t remember wrongly, during the Hunting Event, there would be a huge incident. A Prince of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family would attempt to have an alliance marriage with the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alliance marriage&#8217;s target would be Yu Feiya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had to stop the Eternal Overcast Royal Family&#8217;s scheme. According to his previous life memories, the Eternal Overcast Royal Family definitely had ties with Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky was pure, a stretch of azure blue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were flying boats that skimmed past quickly like dashes of rainbows. In just a blink of the eye, they traveled over 10,000 kilometers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sky Domain was located in the central region of the Upper Realm and the territories within were boundless. Even experts with great cultivation wouldn&#8217;t be able to reach the borders easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the eastern side of the Sky Domain was the Glorious Sky, and it was where the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was located.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Previously, Zijin left the Mortal Palace, and she has yet to return. According to her servant, Xiu Er, she was trying to enter the Immortal Wang Family&#8217;s Ancestral Land, trying to do something… But so far, after she left, we heard no news about her anymore.&#8221; On the flying boat that was rushing to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, Gu Changge had asked about Wang Zijin&#8217;s whereabouts. Meanwhile, Jiang Chuchu shook her head as she replied. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was ultimately different from Wang Zijin. Wang Zijin was born in the Immortal Wang Family. When she went to Mortal Palace to cultivate, she was just joining in name. At the end of the day, she could always return to her family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Jiang Chuchu, she had no parents, and had grown up in Mortal Palace from a young age. Thus, Mortal Palace was her home and she couldn&#8217;t leave so easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the outbreaks of Eternal Overcast Scourge, she had to oversee the situation, making it even harder for her to leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, she has returned to her family&#8230;&#8221; Gu Changge nodded and didn&#8217;t ask further. He asked because he was a little surprised that he didn&#8217;t see the other transmigrator at Mortal Palace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t really mind what Wang Zijin was doing. This trip to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty might be to investigate the recent Eternal Overcast Scourge, but Gu Changge was actually paying closer attention to the ancient world that had yet to be explored. He had a premonition that the Upper Realm would undergo a huge change before the Epoch Dao Fruit matured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the ancient worlds connected to the Upper Realm, they might have existed even longer than the Upper Realm itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Gu Changge&#8217;s opinion, those ancient world might contain other opportunities for one to become an Immortal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Upper Realm might seem peaceful, but there were plenty of undercurrents in the dark. Plenty of Forces were searching tirelessly for opportunities to become Immortal in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains Therefore, Gu Changge had to find a suitable reason, then lay the bait and net.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, there was all sorts of information about the Immortal Palace Treasury being circulated. Many people had placed their final hopes of reaching the Immortal Realm on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many knew of how many Tools of World Domination Gu Changge possessed. In fact, all of his actions were being monitored by a large majority. As such, using the name of the Mortal Palace to act became extremely convenient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon enough, half a month passed by. The flying boat crossed the void and traveled across countless territories. They were now finally near the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capital of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty stretched over millions of kilometers. It was magnificent and majestic, radiated with resplendent lights that were glorious and dazzling. There even seemed to be a celestial mist that revolved around it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking from far, there were various stunning visions. Amazing scenery, floating islands, celestial mountains, towering palaces and pavilions. It was just like an ancient immortal city that fell into the mortal world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver waterfalls, fairy fountains, and plenty of stars surrounding in a formation. Be it day or night, billions of descending star light could be seen. They formed a massive river of stars. It was a majestic sight. Any cultivator who visited the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty for the first time would be stunned by this scenery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the foundation of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty that had stayed standing for countless years. The Star Fiend Formation can draw the endless energy of stars and block a True Daoist&#8217;s attack. There are rumors saying that the full strength of the formation isn&#8217;t breakable by anyone below the Immortal Realm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty isn&#8217;t an Immortal Force for eras for no reason.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The terrifying foundation of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty is obvious to see. In the entire Upper Realm, there might only be a few Forces that can match up to them&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, there was a battleship moving around the clouds of the Great Yu Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a group of young men and women wearing clothes that were glowing. They had curious and yearning eyes as they sized up the scenery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were wearing uniformed clothings and had a special pattern on their wristband. It was apparent that they were from the same sect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of you have to strive hard. If any of you can make it to the top 10,000, it will be glorious for the sect. If anyone is lucky enough to make it to the top 5000, then there will be huge rewards after returning to the sect.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As for the top 1000, this old one and the others don&#8217;t dare to have that luxurious dream. In the history of our sect, the best result is the top 3000 and that person is your Supreme Ancestor, who is almost reaching the Sacred Emperor Realm.&#8221; An Elder sighed when speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of the young men and women, there were plenty of Elders leading at the front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elders weren&#8217;t trying to break the morale, but this Hunting Event had too many participating Forces. There were simply too many young prodigies, perhaps even countless. There were also plenty of other Forces like them who were vassals of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, they were all rushing over from all parts of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty to participate in this year&#8217;s Hunting Event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s tradition to host the Hunting Event every century. As long as it was a Force within the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, they would send their disciples to participate. After all, for each of the Forces, this was a great chance for them to rise to fame. Everyone would grasp this opportunity tightly and would not give up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young men and women that came here were formidable individuals of their Sect. They were all carefully nurtured for this Hunting Event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ranking of the Hunting Event didn&#8217;t just affect a Force&#8217;s future status, they might even receive heavy favors from the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, bestowing them with cultivation techniques and resources like divine weapons or elixirs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I heard that the venue for this year&#8217;s Hunting Event is rather special. It is rumored to be related to the Eternal Overcast Scourge. I wonder if it is true&#8230;&#8221; Someone muttered softly. When mentioning about the Eternal Overcast Scourge, there was a tone of unease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a secret that the Eternal Overcast Scourge had broken out in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s territory, and the Dynasty had dispatched plenty of experts to investigate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh? There seems to be royalty at the Imperial Capital?&#8221; All of a sudden, someone exclaimed and looked towards the Imperial Capital&#8217;s walls with an extremely shocked expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The others looked over in succession with similarly shocked faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The towering capital walls were like mountains and were suspended with dreadful chains made of Principles. They were extraordinarily radiant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, there were plenty of people standing there. They were all standing and riding on clouds, seemingly waiting for someone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leader was huge and tall. He wore a dragon robe and was wearing a purple-gold crown. He was emitting an indescribably tyrannical pressure as though he was an overlord. Whenever he opened and closed his eyes, there would be a fearsome aura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an Imperial Ancestor, who held formidable status!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing behind him was a group of individuals, who were also emitting noble and awe-inspiring auras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scene stunned the Elders and disciples of the various Forces. After all, members of the Royal Family all had terrifying statuses. A simple stomp of their feet could cause an earthquake in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. It was almost impossible to see them during normal days, but they were actually assembled outside the city and seemingly waiting for someone?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the youths were able to recognize the princes and princesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were all famous in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and were experts in their generation..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were even renowned in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could they be waiting for the members of an Immortal Force that have come here to spectate?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even if that is the case, there isn&#8217;t a need for such grandeur right? If my eyes are seeing correctly, that old Imperial Ancestor is a True Daoist!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just who is so important to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a huge uproar and astonishment. The various Forces that were here to participate in the Hunting Event found it hard to believe, therefore, it perked their curiosity.</span></p>

          >He remembered encountering the Successor once back at the Aether
          Abyss in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. However, because he had
          killed the former War Immortal, the entire War Immortal Manor regarded
          him as an enemy and was never happy to see him, even though they dared
          not cross him.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Maybe this is why Su Qingge challenged and attacked the Successor?]
          Gu Changge mused. He couldn&#8217;t think of a possibility other than
          this one that would cause Su Qingge to attack the Successor of War
          Immortal Manor.</span

          had been buzzing about was Su Qingge. After all, it had been some time
          since he last attacked someone from the younger generation. So even if
          someone were sceptical, they wouldn&#8217;t suspect Gu Changge.</span

          >Judging from the current situation, Su Qingge had stirred up the
          hornet&#8217;s nest. Not only would forces like the War Immortal Manor
          hunt her down, but even Forces whose Successors Gu Changge had killed
          would also dump all their vengeance on her.</span

          other choice but to flee. It&#8217;s a pity that she is still an
          amateur. She failed to get rid of the Successor of War Immortal Manor
          and landed herself in bigger trouble. Looks like she will land herself
          in danger if I continue to sit back and do nothing] Gu Changge
          mused.</span

          that the young woman being in danger would trouble him.</span

          Qingge&#8217;s face since he survived the attack, and if something
          were to happen to the young woman, there would be one less person for
          Gu Changge to shift the blame to.</span

          a moment, at least until after the Successor of War Immortal Manor has
          been dealt with.]</span

          her assassins to kill the Successor. Speaking of which, it&#8217;s
          been a while since I last visited the Chaos Star Territory. It&#8217;s
          time I stretch my hands towards the Hidden Ji Family.] The thought

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          to Chaos Star Territory. [As for the Hidden An Clan, Iâ€™ll only devise
          a plan and attack after An Yan presents me with the Hidden Celestial

          Bandit Thirteen, and though Gu Changge had already annihilated them, a

          and their size and complexity were no lesser than Bandit

          to the situation as they wouldn&#8217;t be looted of their goods after

          impassive eyes, luscious black hair, and a face veil was overlooking
          the vast Chaos City. Her hands were clasped behind her back as she

          gaze across the land below with wildly bold ambition surging in the
          depths of her eyes while stretching her fair hand out, seemingly
          wanting to wrap the entire land in the palm of her hand.

          disappeared as well.</span

          >&#8220;Are you really being serious, Qingge?&#8221; she reiterated,
          leading Su Qingge to frown. Su Qingge already had a feeling her plan
          wouldn&#8217;t run so smoothly, and her sister wouldn&#8217;t be
          willing to switch their identities back. But she didn&#8217;t expect
          Ji Qingxuan to be so persistent, even asking twice at that.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Naturally. It&#8217;ll be fine even if you return home now, as
          I have already sorted everything out,&#8221; explained Su Qingge as
          she eased her brows. She believed Ji Qingxuan was worried about her
          situation after returning to the Ji Family Residence. But she had
          already foreseen all that and had already sorted everything out.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I see. You have come to reclaim your identity because you have
          completed everything you needed to do, haven&#8217;t you!?&#8221;
          Impassiveness had replaced the smile on Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s face at
          this point, and her faint mocking was night and day to her expression
          earlier.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What are you saying, Qingxuan?&#8221; Su Qingge frowned,
          thinking the young woman standing before her eyes was starkly
          different from the sister she had gotten to know lately. In fact, she
          thought the young woman was a stranger.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then again, this young woman called Ji Qingxuan had always been like
          this when they first met. It was just that the obedience and whatnot
          on the surface was nothing more than a facade she had shown to the
          world because of her situation.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What am I saying?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan sneered, &#8220;Do you
          really not know what I&#8217;m saying, Sister? I did everything to
          please Young Master Changge and, even more so, managed this vast Chaos
          Star Territory in all its details. Iâ€™m governing these tens of
          millions of kilometres of territory and the people living in it, and
          you want to take everything without any effort, removing me from
          everything that I have built up till now!? Has it ever occurred to you
          how I would feel? Do you think I&#8217;d be happy about it?&#8221;

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge, on the other hand, fell silent, never expecting her sister
          to say something like that. Then again, it was her fault for being
          inconsiderate, as it never occurred to her that Ji Qingxuan would care
          so much about this identity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;But this is all ultimately a lie. You&#8217;re not me, nor am
          I you either. The lie can only go on for so long. Do you even dare to
          imagine the consequences we&#8217;ll face once all of this is
          exposed?&#8221; Su Qingge reasoned with slightly furrowed brows.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Honestly speaking, she was never certain if Gu Changge really knew
          about her identity switch with Ji Qingxuan, but now, as long as the
          two of them switched back, there would still be a way for
          everything.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yeah, everything&#8217;s a lie. You&#8217;re ultimately you,
          and I&#8217;m still me,&#8221; monotoned Ji Qingxuan with
          impassiveness. &#8220;So all I have to do is kill you, and henceforth,
          I will be you. Ji Qingxuan will no longer exist in this world and
          there will only be Su Qingge. All that is mine will still be mine, and
          Young Master Gu will spoil only me. You will have nothing to do with
          anything.&#8221;

          >&#8220;Qingxuan, youâ€¦&#8221; Su Qingge&#8217;s countenance shifted
          slightly as she sensed a chill. She knew it was from Ji
          Qingxuan&#8217;s pure desire for her to die. The notion shocked her.
          In fact, she couldn&#8217;t believe her younger sister intended to
          kill her and then use her identity to live the rest of her life. That
          way, it&#8217;d be just as she saidâ€”Ji Qingxuan would no longer exist
          in this world. There would only be Su Qingge.</span

          >&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want it to come to this, but you just have to
          force me, Qingge. I don&#8217;t want to lose Young Master
          Changge&#8217;s affection, nor do I want to lose everything I&#8217;ve
          so painstakingly built up. So, dear sister, please die.&#8221; There
          was nothing but frost and impassiveness as Ji Qingxuan spoke, and it
          was as though she was merely mentioning something insignificant.</span

          >*Buzz!* The next second, brilliant waves of light emerged within the
          palace, and quaint, powerful, mystical runes appeared on the walls and
          in the air, one after another, weaving into a vast starry sky that
          could kill any living being that entered it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          day to come either.&#8221; Ji Qingxuan remained cold as she approached
          Su Qingge. &#8220;But why must you barge into my life and try to steal
          everything that&#8217;s mine? Can&#8217;t you just acquiescently be Ji
          Qingxuan? I have constantly been worrying if Young Master Changge
          would suddenly discover I&#8217;m not the real Su Qingge but her
          useless little sister. Tell me, what do you think I should

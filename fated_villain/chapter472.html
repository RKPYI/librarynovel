          >In the battle arena, Xiao Yang and Gu Wudi stood 30 metres apart,
          facing each other as formidable auras arose on their bodies. Almost
          the eyes of all disciples and Mountain Elders were glued on them,
          attentively observing the battle to ensure fairness.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, before the battle began, a green, mountain-like seal the
          size of a palm fell from the high sky, harbouring dense intertwining
          auras as traces of Chaos Qi continuously emerged.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, the Fortuity of the entire Nine Great Mountains
          were gathered, and each trace of them emitted blinding silver gleams,
          resembling a Milky Way. The people could even see the shadows of nine
          spectacular, ancient mountains shrouded in vibrant lights
          simultaneously appearing in the sky.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Such a power was incomparably vast and boundless, as the nine
          mountains resembled actual unparalleled Mystic Mountains that could
          subdue all lives.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, every disciple and Mountain Elders intuitively
          shifted their attentive gazes towards the floating seal in the sky,
          displaying utmost respect. Even Gu Changge turned over with Grand
          Runes glowing in his eyes, analysing the item, after which he squinted
          his eyes, seemingly pondering. [So, that’s the Celestial Seal. It has
          Innate Patterns as well, hmm? It&#8217;s probably on par with the
          Immortal-Killing Gourd and Supreme Dao Diagram, but it seems even more
          mysterious. Is it perhaps related to the world before the Forbidden
          Epoch?]</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge inferred that the Celestial Seal must not be created in
          this era. Since it was an Innate entity, it might be greatly related
          to Nine Great Mountains&#8217; origin. It might even be that the
          Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains led to eventual formation of Nine
          Great Mountains.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The glaring Innate Aura that was hard to look straight into could
          easily suppress all other created artifacts, producing a heavy
          boundless Chaos Qi.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That item is involved in the creation of Nine Great Mountains,
          and has retained the enigma and extraordinariness of Nine Great
          Mountains for countless years. It was even said that, a person that
          managed to gain control of the Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains
          could even become an invincible being in Nine Great Mountains.&#8221;
          Seeing how Gu Changge was fascinated by the seal, the Sky Deer Goddess
          revealed a faint grin and described.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In response, Gu Changge nodded. He knew that Nine Great Mountains had
          been collecting the Power of Faith of Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains
          all these years, and the existence of the Celestial Seal of the Nne
          Mountains allowed the disciples and cultivators of Nine Great
          Mountains to efficiently cultivate with the amassed Power of
          Faith.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In this aspect, Nine Great Mountains were quite similar to Mortal
          Palace. Though, now that Gu Changge placed the Fortuity Cauldron in
          Mortal Palace, he could gather the Power of Faith of the Upper Realm
          for his own use.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >But now, he finally saw the substantial Power of Faith amassed by
          Nine Great Mountains for the past countless years above the Celestial
          Seal of the Nine Mountains.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;As per the agreement, this old one shall repress your
          cultivation to Xiao Yang&#8217;s level. Any objection?&#8221;
          Followingly, the Second Mountain Elder appeared in the battle arena,
          facing Gu Wudi expressionlessly as he spoke to him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With so many Mountain Elders present, Gu Wudi wasn&#8217;t at all
          worried that the Second Mountain Elder would resort to some sort of
          tomfoolery. He then feigned a grin and nodded. &#8220;Do your best,
          Second Mountain Elder. Even at the same cultivation level, I&#8217;ll
          easily take Xiao Yang down in three moves.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Given his confidence, the Second Mountain Elder&#8217;s eyes froze as
          he carefully took a few glances at Gu Wudi, but he found nothing
          strange about him. Be it Gu Wudi&#8217;s aura or strength, there
          wasn&#8217;t any noticeable change compared to his state before.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Regardless, the Second Mountain Elder remained cautious. As he was
          repressing Gu Wudi&#8217;s cultivation, he took the opportunity to
          investigate his body condition, only to find nothing suspicious about
          it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That old bat! He&#8217;s sneakily investigating Gu Wudi!
          Hmph!&#8221; As the Third Mountain Elder noticed the Second Mountain
          Elder&#8217;s sneaky action, he subconsciously let out a snicker,
          feigning indifference. As ever, he bore total confidence in his own
          disciple and the fact that he could take down Xiao Yang with three
          moves without any problem.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, right in front of the attentive crowd, the Second Mountain
          Elder repressed Gu Wudi&#8217;s cultivation to Xiao Yang&#8217;s
          level, and no one other than True Daoists could dispel the
          limitation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;In that case, let&#8217;s cut the nonsense and begin.&#8221;
          Xiao Yang bore not the slightest fondness towards Gu Wudi. The Chosen
          One had constantly troubled him, and now, he was proudly a lapdog of
          Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As he was finished talking, a terrifying aura whirled around his body
          as divine runes surged and swirled from under his skin, resembling
          mysterious yet vast ancient symbols of the MIlky Way.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >That was an exclusive absolute ability of Nine Great Mountains with
          unrivalled power, and the moment it was cast, the mountain rivers
          seemed to rush as time crumbled, gushing towards Gu Wudi, while Xiao
          Yang stood firmly in the air, resembling a divine being.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, he conjured an artifact—a green treasure
          pearl—which then emitted blaring thunder. Principles soon condensed to
          form a layer of protective barrier around him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What? Junior Brother Xiao Yang took the lead? I thought all he
          had to do to win the bet is to endure three blows from the Chosen
          One.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;We surely have underestimated Junior Brother Xiao Yang. He
          actually went first at such a moment?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That is my Youngest Junior Brother, alright! He&#8217;s
          certainly worthy as the Direct Disciple of Second Mountain Elder! When
          I was at his level, I definitely did not bear such
          intimidation!&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Junior Brother Xiao Yang&#8217;s strength is not to be
          underestimated. Give him some more time, and there&#8217;s no doubt
          that he&#8217;ll catch up to the Chosen One!&#8221; The other
          disciples were visibly dumbfounded, chattering among themselves.
          Clearly, they had never seen Xiao Yang fighting with his full
          power.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, those who assumed that his chance at winning was low
          faltered. Even the Mountain Elders squinted their eyes. With their
          perception as True Daoists, they could see that Xiao Yang indubitably
          bore an extraordinary aura.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh, he attacked me first?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, in contrast to Xiao Yang and his flamboyance, Gu Wudi donned
          an expression filled with coldness as a golden gleam flashed across
          his eyes. In brief seconds, his qualities went through a drastic
          change.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Mountain Elders that were spectating the battle squint their
          eyes, feeling that Gu Wudi seemed to have cast a Secret Technique.
          Though, they couldn&#8217;t tell what kind of Secret Technique it was
          and simply assumed that Gu Wudi had encountered an opportunity by
          himself.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What is this sensation I am sensing?&#8221; Sensing something
          was up, the Second Mountain Elder turned to Gu Changge who was far
          away.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing his usual interested look, the Second Mountain Elder somehow
          felt restless. He had fully prepared Xiao Yang for the battle by
          giving him numerous powerful artifacts and also the Silver Moon Battle
          Suit as protection, yet he remained uneasy and perturbed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At his cultivation level, the things he could sense weren&#8217;t
          carried by the breeze, but they were from an incidental glimpse in
          subtle changes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Gu Wudi, this blow is for your disrespect towards Senior
          Sister Suyun!&#8221; Nevertheless, Xiao Yang did not detect anything
          peculiar about Gu Wudi. At that moment, he was covered in radiant,
          glaring runes as his Silver Moon Battle Suit was shining. Even his
          hair was illuminated by a layer of green dawnlight.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Amid the radiance, he angrily shouted and cast a daunting ability,
          charging towards Gu Wudi. Instead of opting for defence, he chose to
          engage in order to avenge his Eldest Senior Sister.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Your ignorance is laughable.&#8221; Regardless, Gu Wudi seemed
          abnormally cold. When Xiao Yang drew his hand, he merely raised his
          fist, invoking a vast, frightening aura in the air.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          behind him. Covered in scales, the menacing shadow aggressively
          extended its claws and charged forward, seemingly capable of
          destroying all worlds.</span

          >The disciples in the crowd were stunned upon the sight. Naturally,
          they recognised the True Dragon Arts as they were exclusive to Nine
          Great Mountains, and basically all of them had learned it. Yet, Gu
          Wudi&#8217;s use of the ability was totally different from
          theirs.</span

          >&#8220;It appears the Chosen One has been hiding his strength very
          well.&#8221; The Mountain Elders thought of something and turned to
          the Third Mountain Elder. In their eyes, the Third Mountain Elder was
          the scheming one, deliberately disallowing Gu Wudi to show his true
          strength in anticipation for this day.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the Third Mountain Master was also somewhat dazed at that
          moment, but he quickly recovered his composure. He knew his disciple
          well, which was why he was taken aback. Normally, Gu Wudi had never
          shown such formidable strength. But of course, he simply assumed that
          Gu Wudi had been hiding it so well that even he, as his Master, failed
          to understand his strength.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“It seems that Brother Wu&#8217;s strength is not to be
          underestimated.” At the side, Gu Changge subconsciously revealed a
          light grin, seemingly out of astonishment.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, the Sky Deer Goddess couldn&#8217;t help but glance at
          him. Although she didn&#8217;t know what Gu Changge had done to Gu
          Wudi, she was sure that he had a hand in giving Gu Wudi&#8217;s
          current strength.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Impossible… How are you this strong?&#8221; Blood flowed down from
          Xiao Yang&#8217;s mouth as he got up from the ground, feeling
          humiliated and mostly doubtful.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His own ability was obviously remarkably stronger than the other
          disciples of Nine Great Mountains that were on his level. His own
          abilities far surpassed what should be possible in his current
          cultivation level. Yet, when he finally faced Gu Wudi, his heart
          slightly faltered as he saw how he couldn&#8217;t take him down, which
          was totally out of his prediction.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t even stand a blow from me. How do you
          expect to take another? Yet, you&#8217;re so intent on taking revenge?
          Trash&#8221; Gu Wudi&#8217;s expression was rather cold and
          condescending as he steadily walked towards Xiao Yang.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His entire body was emitting golden lights as traces of them
          constantly surged, making the surrounding appear cloudy. That was the
          effect of his Physique, the World Dao Physique.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All of a sudden, the crowd saw an alarming scene. Meteorites were
          merging behind him, relentlessly gathering and forming a world. In
          fact, they resembled infinite swords that flew towards Xiao
          Yang.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Without moving, Gu Wudi merely borrowed the power of his Physique to
          display his innate powerful Talents. It was a shocking ability to
          gather meteorites like troops that then plunged towards Xiao Yang to
          murder him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What on earth did Gu Wudi take?&#8221; The Second Mountain
          Elder felt that the Gu Wudi he was seeing now was completely different
          from the one he normally knew. Yet, he couldn&#8217;t quite fathom
          what the difference was.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang&#8217;s face drastically changed, unable to believe that Gu
          Wudi was capable of casting such an ability despite being in the same
          level as him. Moreover, Gu Wudi&#8217;s expression reminded him of Gu
          Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[No… The one I’m fighting is not Gu Wudi, but him!] With that in
          mind, Xiao Yang angrily, resolutely glared at Gu Changge. However, Gu
          Changge&#8217;s usual enthralled look made him feel as though he was
          an ant, entertaining a great being who was watching it struggle.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The next moment, amidst the thunderous explosions, meteorites began
          to materialise in a dense pack and plummeted towards Xiao Yang. The
          sheer number of them, like a torrential rain, filled all the disciples
          with dread, giving them their first taste of the terror of Gu
          Wudi.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With an icy expression, Xiao Yang summoned one artifact after
          another, unleashing countless divine rays. At the same time, his
          bloodline power was triggered, and suddenly, a fiery red silhouette
          rushed out of his body.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was a phoenix, incredibly ancient and though vague, it exuded a
          noble and mighty aura. As it spread its wings, a shower of crimson
          light rained down, as if it was a fiery sea that was to resist the
          attacks.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Boom! Boom! Boom!* </span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone peered at the scene in shock as they saw Gu Wudi calmly
          approaching Xiao Yang with a face full of indifference. As the
          meteorites, endless in number, constantly emerged behind him, they
          transformed into swords and sword lights that were huge and formidable
          which then charged forward.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At once, the area was illuminated with brilliance as a terrifying
          wave shook everyone, capable of tearing apart even those in the Sacred
          Realm.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite the numerous magic weapons at Xiao Yang&#8217;s disposal, he
          was unable to withstand the onslaught, his face constantly changing as
          his body shook violently. His injuries from before didn&#8217;t even
          manage to heal and now he was vomiting even more blood. Even the green
          treasure pearl above him was sent flying away.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The next moment, Xiao Yang widened his eyes and let out a groan as he
          was blown away.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before he realised it, Gu Wudi was already right in front of him,
          drawing an extremely heavy punch that left the void shattering. The
          terrifying force made Xiao Yang&#8217;s organs tremble intensely.
          Following the revolting cracks bones, cracks appeared on his bones.
          His injuries were insanely gruesome as he continuously spewed out
          blood along with bits of his internal organs.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although he had the protection of the Silver Moon Battle Suit, he was
          still unable to activate its full power, so it could only be used to
          protect his life. Otherwise, with that one punch, he would have burst
          into a mist of blood long ago.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;There goes my three blows. What else do you have to say
          now?&#8221; Gu Wudi&#8217;s face was awfully cold. Out of nowhere, he
          stepped on Xiao Yang&#8217;s head, rendering him unable to raise his
          head, and his voice bore a spine-chilling iciness.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You…&#8221; Feeling incredibly humiliated, Xiao Yang gritted
          his teeth as he knew that the man stomping on his head wasn&#8217;t Gu
          Wudi, but Gu Changge, given that there was no way Gu Wudi would be
          this strong.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, the other disciples also felt very distant towards the
          Chosen One that they were now looking at. Regardless, his
          formidableness was undeniable, and now that he had made three moves,
          Xiao Yang was miserably defeated. If it weren&#8217;t for the Silver
          Moon Battle Suit, he would have died earlier.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It appears there are no more doubts about this battle.&#8221;
          The Mountain Elders fixed their complicated gaze on Gu Wudi, intending
          to see through him, but given their capabilities, all they could see
          was that Gu Wudi was totally different from his usual state.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, he did use the exclusive ability of Nine Great
          Mountains and his own Talents to subdue Xiao Yang in three
          moves.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The result has been decided. Second Mountain Elder, are you
          not going to admit defeat?&#8221; Staring at the Second Mountain
          Elder&#8217;s hideous scowl, the Third Mountain Elder intuitively
          snickered as a terrifying aura surged around his body, seemingly ready
          to battle if there was any discord.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The battle today has indeed opened my eyes. Second Mountain
          Elder&#8217;s disciple has indeed been exceptional, but compared to
          Brother Wudi, he&#8217;s obviously lacking.&#8221; Then, Gu Changge
          walked over with a smile, speaking in a somewhat belittling
          tone.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You…&#8221; The Second Mountain Elder glared at him with a
          tense glower. He always suspected that Gu Changge somehow rigged the
          battle, but he had no evidence to back his assumption.</span

          amongst the swirling mist. Their elegant movements looked light and
          ethereal, resembling that of a flying bird. The relaxing scent of tea

          cross-legged on the floor. Her legs looked slender beneath her robes,
          and she was extremely gorgeous with her lightly powdered face and fine
          features. Her skin was smooth and soft while her hair was thick. Even
          the loose robes couldn&#8217;t hide her tall, slender figure. A
          laid-back young man was sitting in front of her with a bright smile on
          his face. Many of the dancers peeked over at them in envy and
          admiration.</span

          Young Master Changge?&#8221; Jun Yao looked shy, a look worlds away
          from the generous yet haughty expression she used with everyone else.
          Had anyone familiar with her been present such as Jun Fan, their jaws
          would drop from the disbelief they felt.</span

          praising involuntarily, &#8220;You are truly talented. This is the
          first time I&#8217;ve experienced tea like this. It’s bitter and
          astringent with a hint of sweetness. I can even feel the myriad types
          of ingredients, the spectrum of emotion, and the like after some
          careful deliberation. It is a truly special drink.&#8221;</span

          wasn&#8217;t as assured as she appeared to be. She had prepared for
          the appointment for three days without stopping, and even put more
          thought into dressing up. Her makeup looked different compared to her
          usual style and made her look fine and pretty yet elegant.</span

          in tea-making. It has satisfied me greatly.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled.
          &#8220;I was confused when I heard that you have an unsurpassed talent
          in tea-making, but our meeting today has convinced me so.&#8221;</span

          I have been researching such things from my childhood and besides,
          this isn&#8217;t really something I can show to the public.&#8221; Jun
          Yao waved her hand quickly. &#8220;There are masters who are much

          Everything can be made into a Dao; the Dao of tea, Dao of art, Dao of
          chess… all of them are Daos, so why can&#8217;t it be shown in public?

          embarrassed about it, yet her delight overrode that. She usually would
          disregard the flattery from other young prodigies, yet she was pleased
          because of some praise from him.</span

          unimaginable for someone of her status to sit with him over tea. How
          could she hope for more? However, she somehow found the courage to
          make the suggestion, blushing at how daring she had been. She could
          even hear her heart beating loudly.</span

          couldn&#8217;t even speak properly anymore as her voice shook and
          stuttered. She had never imagined that she could be acquainted with Gu
          Changge and even sit down to talk with him like that.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The whole thing felt unreal and her heart continued racing even after
          he left, as she had thought he would refuse her request and shoot down
          any hope she had. She never really expected him to say that.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Did he actually agree or refuse?] She frowned, confused and happy,
          yet concerned at the same time. She was afraid this whole thing would
          end up being a figment of her imagination. However, he did visit her
          over the next few days to discuss the art of tea-making and she
          couldn&#8217;t possibly deny him.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was so delighted that it almost felt like she had a chance with
          him. He behaved like a gentleman with his charming manners and was
          easy going without showing any condescension despite his status. This
          further cemented the perfect mental image she had of him and if her
          father and younger brother Jun Fan hadn&#8217;t gone with the army
          attacking the Life Forbidden Area, she would have willingly shared the
          happy news with them.</span

          >[Jun Yao&#8217;s Fortuity differs from that of the other Jun Family
          members. Jun Fan is probably more concerned about this adoptive sister
          of his.] Gu Changge naturally did not have any of such romantic
          motives towards Jun Yao and merely wanted to use her to manipulate Jun
          Fan.

          >Prodigal damsels like her were haughty and had high opinions of
          themselves, considered by normal society to be a gift from heaven and
          were brilliant. They wouldn&#8217;t even look at normal young
          prodigies as they already had their criteria for a partner, so it was
          easy to make them chase after him as long as he satisfied their
          romantic imaginations and desires.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Yao&#8217;s Fortuity was much higher than Qing Zhu&#8217;s, which
          Gu Changge assumed was because of her relationship with Jun Fan. Even
          the Quelling Chaos King, Jun Fan&#8217;s father in this life, did not
          have that much Fortuity, which spoke multitudes about Jun Fan&#8217;s
          relationship with his father and Jun Yao.</span

          Empress Yao Xi was even sterner towards her trusted advisors after the
          assassination attempt, even changing those court officials at the top.
          While this had caused some great commotion, the noise eventually died
          away. The Major Clans of the Demon World also behaved cautiously to
          prevent Empress Yao Xi from deciding to eliminate them.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          more reverently towards her.</span

          through her letters. He had shown up in the imperial palace without
          her noticing while looking interested, not making any vibrations as if
          he had suddenly appeared from thin air. She wouldn&#8217;t have
          realised he was there if he hadn&#8217;t spoken.</span

          had intimate relations, she felt uncomfortable and unhappy remembering
          that he had done everything deliberately without any true feelings for
          her. That was why she had been avoiding him purposefully, yet she
          hadn&#8217;t expected him to actively seek her out.</span

          few days, he would occasionally go to the imperial palace to inform
          her about several things. Empress Yao Xi still felt disturbed after
          discovering his true purpose. Yet, in this enormous Demon World, he
          was the closest to her. Thus, she did not show her dissatisfaction and
          did not refuse anything he asked from her either. Besides, she wanted

          >The Quelling Chaos King appeared on the peak of a nearby mountain and
          looked into the distance before giving the order. He wore bronze
          armour and held a large battleaxe. His eyes were shimmering with
          light. Runes interweaved within his gaze, revealing his extremely
          powerful might.</span

          >&#8220;Father, are we really going to clear out this place?&#8221;
          Jun Fan frowned towards the Life Forbidden Area from beside the
          Quelling Chaos King, feeling helpless and unwilling. This was where
          his true sister, Jun Ruoxi, lived in seclusion. He had never come here
          even after being reincarnated since he didn&#8217;t want to trouble
          her by involving her in his revenge. However, he didn&#8217;t have any
          choice now as even he had been sent to clear out the place and thus
          couldn&#8217;t do anything about it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That&#8217;s a useless question. Empress Yao Xi personally
          gave the order and Jun Bufan, the mastermind behind the plot to
          assassinate her, may be hiding out here. If we get him, we don&#8217;t
          have to worry about the power and status our family will have.&#8221;
          The Quelling Chaos King glanced at him meaningfully. His greedy gaze
          was fixed on the ancient forest before him as if he could see a bright
          future there.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Fan fell silent at that. He had already thought of many ways to
          stop this but they were no use at all. It was impossible to prevent Gu
          Changge&#8217;s wish from happening with his current strength, as he
          didn&#8217;t believe Empress Yao Xi could do something like this. Gu
          Changge definitely had used her name for his true purpose, which was
          forcing him to appear. Jun Fan could see through Gu Changge’s motive
          for doing this but he was currently more preoccupied with how to
          rescue Jun Ruoxi so she wouldn&#8217;t get caught.</span

          >[Six thousand years ago, my sister was already on the verge of
          entering the Sacred King Realm. After all those years, she may still
          be in the Sacred King Realm even if her talent is inferior to mine. It
          will be problematic if she wants to escape this safely.]

          >Jun Fan frowned. His sister was already in the Sacred Realm before he
          was born, so it was impossible that she hadn&#8217;t progressed. She
          was much more important than his adoptive father and thus one of the
          most important people in his life besides Jun Yao. It was truly a
          coincidence that both of them were his older sisters.</span

          anything strange happens, send me a message.&#8221; Jun Fan planned to
          leave the army for a while and entered the Life Forbidden Area from
          another direction so he could find Jun Ruoxi before the Quelling Chaos
          King did.</span

          alone.&#8221; Jun Fan refused the offer and left in the other
          direction by transforming into a divine rainbow without waiting for
          his father&#8217;s permission. The Quelling Chaos King did not concern
          himself with Jun Fan any longer and began ordering his men to set up
          camp while sending more scouts to survey the area.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After leaving the group, Jun Fan transformed into a divine rainbow
          and headed into the depths of the mountain range. The area had been
          classified as a Life Forbidden Area, yet there weren&#8217;t many
          protective arrays. It was easy to enter as long as one paid attention
          to the energy vibrations in the air.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!* However, when he was on his way there, a light ripple went
          through the void and caused a strange vibration to spread towards
          him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Who?&#8221; Jun Fan noticed this immediately and was taken
          aback. He cautiously paused his movements and drew his weapon, a pure
          white sword which glittered sharply.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time. Is this how you treat an old
          friend?&#8221; A vibration appeared in the void before a figure
          emerged from it. Her features were coldly attractive and somewhat
          seductive.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You are Lian&#8217;er.&#8221; He was stunned to see her at
          first, but his eyes then widened in disbelief as he became
          emotional.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time. I can&#8217;t believe
          you&#8217;re here. How did you find me?&#8221; He asked as soon as he
          calmed down and looked at her distant expression. He didn&#8217;t
          expect to see a familiar face after six thousand years, but Bai
          Lian&#8217;er&#8217;s looks had changed a lot. If he hadn&#8217;t been
          extremely close to her, he wouldn&#8217;t have recognised her. Was
          this really the soft young girl who used to follow him everywhere? He
          had mixed feelings about that, but he was more curious how she had
          found him and how she had known his real identity.
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ve finally met an old friend after six thousand years,
          but you look like this now. Jun Bufan, you haven&#8217;t really
          changed after all these years.&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er looked cool
          and distant.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He frowned after hearing her reply, sensing something wrong with her
          attitude as her behaviour was as cold as stone. When he realised the
          reason, he couldn&#8217;t help a bitter smile. He knew that some of
          his past actions had hurt her, as he had ignored her advice, choosing
          to believe Yao Xi and verbally abusing Bai Lian&#8217;er. He still
          felt guilty about her, who had been like his younger sister.</span

          How did you know who I am and how did you find me,
          Lian&#8217;er?&#8221; Jun Fan let out a bitter laugh before
          remembering himself and enquired seriously.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She merely laughed coldly before replying calmly, &#8220;I came to
          see you for a reason. As for how I managed to find you, you have to
          find that out yourself. Assassinating Yao Xi in plain sight? Do you
          think everyone is as dumb as she is?&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He looked slightly stricken, not used to her mocking tone. However,
          he knew what she was saying. She had already knew of his true identity
          back when he attempted to assassinate Empress Yao Xi.
        </span>

          >&#8220;So you have been hiding near the Quelling Chaos King&#8217;s
          Manor all this time and finally saw an opportunity to show up
          alone?&#8221; he couldn&#8217;t help but ask, having deduced what was
          going on yet curious about why she came to see him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It seems you aren&#8217;t that dumb.&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er
          laughed coldly once more before continuing, &#8220;I need you to help
          me save my father.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Your father?&#8221; Jun Fan was astounded. He already knew
          that her father, Bai Kun, had been captured by Gu Changge, but how
          could he win against Gu Changge with his current abilities? He
          couldn&#8217;t save Bai Kun or even go against Gu Changge&#8217;s
          will. Everything was meaningless unless he toppled Empress Yao
          Xi&#8217;s rule and took the Demon World.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that thought, his expression shifted slightly. He was conflicted
          about the situation; Bai Lian&#8217;er was his childhood best friend
          and Bai Kun had watched him grow up, so Jun Fan couldn&#8217;t just
          abandon him to his fate. However, he couldn&#8217;t do anything now,
          much less leave the Demon World to rescue Bai Kun in the Upper Realm.
          This put him in a very difficult position.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so hasty in refusing. You may not be able to
          win against him, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t be in the
          future.&#8221; Bai Lian&#8217;er immediately realised what he was
          thinking after seeing his face. &#8220;Your father asked mine to give
          you something when the time is right, but my father got captured by Gu
          Changge. So, he gave it to me instead, telling me to find you in the
          Demon World and hand it over.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jun Fan was slightly shaken as he recalled the words of the Solar
          Demon Overlord. ‘Someone would look for you and give you
          something’.Thus, he did not doubt her words.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No problem. Lian&#8217;er, it&#8217;s fine. Your issues are
          mine too and I can&#8217;t abandon Uncle Bai Kun to his fate.&#8221;
          Jun Fan exhaled in relief and made her a promise. He knew that if he
          refused her request, she would never give it to him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Bai Lian&#8217;er nodded with some satisfaction and withdrew a
          brocade bag from her sleeve. It looked ordinary, devoid of any
          patterns or embroidery and made from a common material. It was the one
          which Gu Changge had given to her; she had tried to open it during the
          journey but discovered it still contained that terrifying energy. Had
          she tried to force it open, the brocade bag would have been destroyed
          and injured her.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;This is…&#8221; Jun Fan was shaken and felt a strong urge as
          if there was something within which belonged only to him. It was such
          a powerful feeling that his expression shifted for a moment before
          becoming delighted.</span
        >

          to give this to me, and I don&#8217;t know how I can repay you.&#8221;
          Jun Fan smiled at her, about to take the bag from her. However, she
          laughed coldly and returned it to her sleeve instead of handing it
          over.</span

          >&#8220;Lian&#8217;er, what do you mean by this?&#8221; His expression
          froze slightly as he hadn&#8217;t expected the usually obedient Bai
          Lian&#8217;er to turn out this way after six thousand years.</span

          father from Gu Changge, or I won&#8217;t give this bag to you.&#8221;
          Something flashed across her eyes as she remembered Gu Changge&#8217;s
          instructions. She pitied Jun Fan somewhat as he was being played so
          well yet did not realise anything.

          >Gu Changge had already known Jun Fan&#8217;s true identity yet Jun
          Fan didn&#8217;t know about it, and still clung onto the hope that he
          would emerge the victor eventually. .

          >Jun Fan frowned. It was clear Bai Lian&#8217;er did not trust him.
          However, this caused the last of his doubts to disappear and he swore
          on his Dao Heart. Only then did she nod with satisfaction and hand the
          brocade bag to him. He did not open it in front of her but chose to
          store it carefully. She did not care about that, since he was no
          longer the naive youth of six thousand years ago. He was much more
          calculative now, trusting her words but not her person.</span

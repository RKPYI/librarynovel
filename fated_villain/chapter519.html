          boat sailing through the sky and over many borders in Sky Deer
          City&#8217;s direction. With rows upon rows of palaces and pavilions

          cause an earthquake just by stomping their feet. The Domain Rulers of
          the Ten Great Domains, the Leaders of the Eight Great Wastelands, and
          the remaining Leaders from the Three Powerful War God Clans: Vermilion
          Bird War God Clan, the Black Tortoise War God Clan, and White Tiger
          War God Clan were also on the boat. It wouldn&#8217;t be an
          overstatement to say that the group on the flying boat were people who
          stood above the rest and had the power to control the lives within the

          Even though Sky Deer Goddess still reigns over the land, she barely
          has anything to do with Sky Deer City after she surrendered to Gu
          Changge. So, everyone, don&#8217;t expect that traitor of a Goddess to
          help us.&#8221; An Ancient Being spoke then. Even though his whole
          body was shrouded in mist, his face was clear, and he had a pair of
          bright eyes that seemed to see through the secrets of the world.

          Domains and the Upper Realm. Surrounding him were a handful of ancient
          and strong men of similar status to him. However, none of them spoke

          couldn&#8217;t help the anger and shamelessness in their eyes as soon
          as Sky Deer Goddess was mentioned. Someone among the crowd even
          sneered, &#8220;But she sure is smart. Now that she has landed Gu
          Changge, not only has she kept Sky Deer City, but her status has also
          risen. Not even the Immortal Forces of the Upper World dares to get on
          her wrong side. It&#8217;s a different case for people like us. We
          need to always be on guard against the Upper Realm Army, who could
          kill us anytime. Worst of all, we have to live submissively under the
          shadow of the Upper Realm either way.&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite the way the complaints were worded, it was hard to conceal
          the jealousy laced within. It was a consensus that the biggest
          advantage Sky Deer Goddess had over other people was her otherworldly
          and rare beautiful appearance. An advantage they could never hope to
          compete with.

          scanned through the many clansmen behind them, trying to look for the
          most beautiful women among them. Gu Changge had invited everyone to
          discuss a truce this time, but he didn&#8217;t mention how they were
          going to discuss it. Feeling uneasy from not knowing what to expect,
          they thought it wouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea for them to get beautiful
          women to appease Gu Changge. Naturally, they hoped that this matter
          would go well, and the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains would regain
          its peace.</span

          saw a beautiful and charming woman with a cool temperament not far
          away. There was no doubt that her appearance was the most outstanding
          here. The rest of the women couldn&#8217;t even compare to her as they

          he and Gu Changge were sworn enemies. Lord Great Cloud&#8217;s most
          respected son, Zhao Yunze, was subdued and killed by Gu Changge in
          front of Sky Deer City. It happened in front of countless soldiers

          wanting to avenge his son was something that he had to leave behind.
          For the survival of the entire Great Cloud Domain, he had to grit his
          teeth and let go of this hatred for the time being as he rushed to Sky

          face. She and Lord Great Cloud were naturally close because of Zhao

          escape after they entered Sky Deer City.</span

          much. I wonder how Master is doing?] Xiao Yang quietly followed behind
          the Supreme Mountain Elder and the others. He didn&#8217;t know what
          to feel as he looked at Sky Deer City in front of him.</span

          >There were countless palaces and pavilions in the vast Sky Deer City.
          There were also Celestial Islands and Divine Mountains in the
          distance, but they now all belonged to the Upper Realm. The various
          forces had their own territories after they divided them. The
          discussion of the truce was being held in the Sky Deer Sanctum of Sky
          Deer City.</span

          >At this moment, divine rainbows could be seen flying across the city;
          they were the Masters of various forces from the Upper Realm. After
          they showed up, they kept a close eye on the leaders of the various
          clans from outside the city. However, the playful expressions on their
          faces made everyone uneasy. It was as though the Upper Realm was the
          cat, and everyone from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were their
          mice. Still, there was no room for regret at this point. They could
          only go on with the decision they made.</span

          participate in the discussion of the truce. You are all distinguished
          guests of our Young Master. The two realms might have been at war for
          countless years, and the grudge is still there, but Young Master
          Changge has the virtue of sparing lives, and he doesn&#8217;t want to
          take any more lives. The truce this time is also the Young
          Master&#8217;s sincerity to you.&#8221;</span

          >A Gu Family member who had heard the news rushed over to Sky Deer
          City. His strength was extremely terrifying, and with his battle
          armour on and divine light shining from him, he gave off a great sense
          of ferocity. A sense that he could reap hundreds of lives here if he
          so wished.

          thin he could be blown away by a gust of wind. However, no one dared
          to underestimate him because of his aura even though they
          couldn&#8217;t gauge just how powerful he was. He was, at least, a
          True Daoist whose seniority would shock anyone who knew.</span

          >Hearing this, the leaders from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains
          present quietly turned to the Supreme Mountain Elder in unison. To
          them, the Supreme Mountain Elder was like the backbone supporting
          them. The Supreme Mountain Elder was not surprised as well, He only
          spoke up, wanting Gu Changge to show due sincerity.</span

          banquet, obviously a trap for those invited. It would be an
          unimaginable disaster for them if Gu Changge decided to attack them
          now. Many would lose their lives here.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >What he said immediately worried everyone from the Eight Wastelands
          and Ten Domains. Indeed, sincerity was something that the current Gu
          Changge didn&#8217;t need to show. After all, the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains were at an absolute disadvantage. If things went as
          planned, it wouldn&#8217;t be long before they were completely
          destroyed by the Upper Realm.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          the meeting because it was their only hope despite knowing that this
          was a trap, but could it be that Gu Changge had already foreseen the
          outcome of the discussion before it even began?</span

          there was a spacious square nearby. Many blurry figures could be seen
          among the pagodas and halls here. The cultivation of these blurry
          figures was so powerful that even just standing there almost caused
          the nearby void to collapse.</span

          shaking his head and sighing. They were already too deep into the
          lion&#8217;s den to back out. A lot of people grew tense, and their
          palms were covered in cold sweat. If things really turned out for the
          worse in a while, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to run at all when the
          experts around them swarmed over. They would probably die in an

          the square and entered the sanctum ahead. The sanctum was vast enough
          to look like another world of its own. The banquet had already been
          set up at this point, and there were many alcoholic drinks, spirit
          fruits, and meat of rare beasts on display. The scrumptious meal
          exuded a radiant brilliance as visions came to life, the fragrance so
          tempting everyone was tempted to have a taste of the food.</span

          robes, was oozing with mystery and regality. He had a faint smile on
          his face as he sat there waiting in the main seat for everyone&#8217;s
          arrival. Behind him stood Sky Deer Goddess. Her face was hidden behind
          a thin veil, revealing only a pair of calm doe eyes.</span

          who entered, stunned. This was different from what they had imagined.
          However, they guessed that Gu Changge had his men hiding, and he only
          needed to give an order for them to rush in and take them down
          immediately. They felt conflicted standing in front of the young man
          who had complete control over whether the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains lived on or perished.</span

          Changge offered. He was smiling as his gaze swept across everyone from
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. He then elegantly lifted a wrist
          and gestured towards the seats.</span

          We hope that you keep your promise,&#8221; a leader warned in his deep
          voice. He looked like a black bear, with strands of Principles flowing
          around his body. One could tell how terrifyingly strong he was from
          the way his aura resounded like thunder, nearly bursting
          eardrums.</span

          >The rest of the leaders were also staring at Gu Changge at this
          moment with flickering divine lights intertwined with a heavenly mist
          of various colours in their eyes. They were all vigilant, and they did
          not sit down for fear that Gu Changge was trying to do something to
          them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Noticing this, Gu Changge only let out a small smile as he knew what
          they were feeling apprehensive about. &#8220;Rest assured, everyone. I
          wouldn&#8217;t attack my guest from the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains that I have invited over for an important meeting. Do you not
          trust me even over something so trivial?&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In fact, Gu Changge had already achieved his goal when everyone
          decided to rush to this meeting. The Supreme Mountain Elder, Xiao
          Yang, and the Powerful War God Clans were his ultimate targets.
          Moreover, he had already obtained the Tree of Epoch, not that many
          people in the entire Upper Realm knew about it. So instead of
          destroying these great clans, it was better to let them live.</span

          >&#8220;We hope you keep your word,&#8221; the Supreme Mountain Elder
          hummed before he sat down, seemingly not worried about Gu Changge
          playing tricks on them. Although he was blind, nothing that happened
          here could slip past his divine sense.</span

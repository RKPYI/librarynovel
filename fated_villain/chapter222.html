      <h4>
        Chapter 222-1: Cant teach but its good to have a disciple, Someone who
        is more intimate than relatives (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        The menacing and terrifying Black Wind bandits, in front of this
        Immortal, were wiped out from the heavens and the earth just by a wave
        of his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a terrifying method made the villagers of the entire Northern
        Mountain Village kneel on the ground in incomparable awe as if they had
        seen a miracle.
      </p>
      <p>Their words were full of gratitude for Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>And Gu Changge just did this casually, and didn't care at all.</p>
      <p>
        The laws of heaven and earth were under his palm, like a toy, which
        could be changed and twisted at any time.
      </p>
      <p>"Mr Immortal is so strong‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Yaoyao opened her eyes which were full of shock.</p>
      <p>
        This was the first time she had seen such a method, and it had surpassed
        the concept of cultivators in her heart.
      </p>
      <p><i>Can a cultivator be so powerful?</i></p>
      <p>
        In her eyes, the cultivator who took away her brother that day was
        already an extremely powerful existence. With a roar, the mountains and
        rivers could be shattered, and his aura penetrated the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in front of this Immortal, it seemed that he didn't even have the
        qualifications to compare.
      </p>
      <p>"At this time, are you still calling me Immortal?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge looked at her with a smile.</p>
      <p>"Master‚Ä¶ Master."</p>
      <p>Hearing this, Yaoyao's words suddenly stuttered and trembled.</p>
      <p>Then, she respectfully bowed to Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        After all, she was still just a little girl, after such a big crisis of
        life and death was lifted.
      </p>
      <p>Her mind relaxed a lot.</p>
      <p>
        At first, she didn't know why, but she had the courage to stand in front
        of Granny Yinhua.
      </p>
      <p>
        And others were very afraid of the mysterious master in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>Only she felt natural, without that kind of unnerving pressure.</p>
      <p>
        Especially when he suddenly appeared at a time of crisis, he saved her
        life and said that he would accept her as a disciple.
      </p>
      <p>This was like being in the dark, breaking all the light!</p>
      <p>Such a surprise came so suddenly.</p>
      <p>It made Yaoyao's little head feel a little dizzy.</p>
      <p>She even felt the envy of her granny for her!</p>
      <p>
        "She's really a well-behaved and sensible little girl. The more I see
        her, the more I like it. Fortunately, I came to Heavenly Domain on a
        whim."
      </p>
      <p>"Otherwise, I would have really regretted it."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled, and with his words, he gave people a bit of
        happiness, as if he was afraid of missing such a good disciple.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, only he himself knew how true or false these words were.</p>
      <p>"Master."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge say this, Yaoyao's eyes filled with joy and
        happiness.
      </p>
      <p>Even at a young age, she could hear the truth.</p>
      <p>
        In her eyes, although Gu Changge's face was very blurred, it was hidden
        by a layer of Immortal mist, so it was impossible to see it clearly.
      </p>
      <p>But there was a natural and gentle look in his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        It was completely different from the aloof indifference she heard in the
        rumors.
      </p>
      <p>"You have the heart of a child, pure and unblemished."</p>
      <p>
        "It's really unfortunate that such a good Immortal jade is covered in
        dust in this world."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled slightly, reached out and touched her head.</p>
      <p>At this time, he could naturally guess what Yaoyao was thinking.</p>
      <p>After all, she was the Daughter of Luck, young and precocious.</p>
      <p>
        Even if he didn't make a move just now, it was estimated that the leader
        of the Black Wind bandits would not be able to hurt Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had a very clear perception just now, and a terrifying aura
        suddenly emerged from Yaoyao's gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        That kind of aura could be called earth-shattering and had the ability
        to destroy everything.
      </p>
      <p>Although it was only fleeting, it would soon disappear.</p>
      <p>
        But once that kind of power erupted, let alone the little Black Wind
        bandit, even the entire Heaven Domain would probably be overturned.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, after his appearance, this terrifying force quickly
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the well-known plot and routines of taking care, this was
        probably the fruit of the mysterious Peach Tree!
      </p>
      <p>So no matter what, he must control this fruit in his own hands.</p>

        He had never been interested in teaching people, but this time, for the
        sake of convenience, he intended to appear as a master. F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew
        stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        Even arranging such a scene of the hero saving the beauty routine, had
        to brush the wave of goodwill.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, this girl might not be willing to go with him.</p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Yaoyao was the younger sister of the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        To deal with the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, the best way now
        was to start with her.
      </p>
      <p>"Master, is Yaoyao really as good as you said?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge complimenting herself like this, Yaoyao's face was
        also shy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she recognized him as master, she and Gu Changge were not very
        familiar yet, so it was difficult for her to show a very natural look.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge naturally knew this, so he was not in a hurry.</p>
      <p>
        This drama of the hero saving the beauty, although it was very
        old-fashioned, even he himself felt a little embarrassed by his acting
        skills.
      </p>
      <p>But if Yaoyao really took the bait, then it was worth it.</p>
      <p>After all‚Ä¶ this was just a pure and innocent little girl.</p>
      <p>
        No matter how much she knew, it was impossible to know that all this was
        arranged by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the people didn't dare to doubt at all, they only had the
        mentality of respecting Gu Changge like a god!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yaoyao is really lucky. I would say that she has great luck in her
        body, and she can turn a bad situation into a good one at any time, and
        turn a crisis into an opportunity."
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the silver haired granny, the only cultivator in this place, was
        full of excitement and joy in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>She was even envious.</p>
      <p>Yaoyao's good luck was completely unmatched by ordinary people!</p>
      <p>
        To be valued by this unfathomable and powerful Immortal, and accepted as
        a disciple.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was far better than being taken away by the Immortal Lun Sect
        thousands of times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Yaoyao's elder brother could not have such a good future as her!
      </p>
      <p>As for the suspicion of Gu Changge's other purpose?</p>
      <p>She hadn't thought about it at all.</p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that with Gu Changge's strength, it was absolutely easy
        to take Yaoyao away, no one could stop him, and he could it without
        letting someone know.
      </p>
      <p>Why would he do something so exhausting?</p>
      <p>
        With Gu Changge's identity and strength, I am afraid that there are
        absolutely too many cultivators who want to worship him as a teacher.
      </p>
      <p>"Yeah, you're actually really good."</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, listening to her question, Gu Changge couldn't help but
        smile and said.
      </p>
      <p>After that, he waved his sleeves.</p>
      <p>A clear light flashed before his eyes.</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The mud stains on Yaoyao's face seemed to have been washed by a clear
        spring, revealing a clean and fair face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her facial features were exquisite and flawless, and her eyes were as
        beautiful as a jade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her skin was delicate and snow-white, shiny and beautiful, like a
        porcelain doll.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the clothes were very old, and there were many patches, she
        still couldn‚Äôt hide her amazing fairy-like charm.
      </p>
      <p>As if she was the most perfect masterpiece of God.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Granny Yinhua, she usually covered it up.</p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, as long as one was discerning, one could perceive the
        extraordinariness of her.
      </p>
      <p>"Master‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Yaoyao's face was flushed, and she was a little shy.</p>
      <p>
        Even after growing up, it was still rare for her to show her true face
        in front of people like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even her brother hadn‚Äôt seen her like this, and her face was always
        covered in mud.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene shocked the villagers in the entire Northern Mountain
        Village, and they felt that the little fairy came down to earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        No wonder she was valued by this Immortal, she herself was not just a
        mortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of temperament, pure and without ambition, with a natural
        beauty, could it be possessed by ordinary people?
      </p>
      <p>"Don‚Äôt worry."</p>
      <p>
        "In the future, in front of the teacher, you don't need to cover up. No
        one will dare to snatch you." Gu Changge touched her head and said with
        a slight smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was a little girl, she definitely loved beauty and didn't
        want to put some mud on her face like this all day.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge boasted that he had a good control over their thoughts.</p>
      <p>"Mmmm, Yaoyao will listen to Master." Yaoyao nodded obediently.</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>There was joy in her big eyes.</p>
      <p>
        As Gu Changge guessed, she actually didn't like to smear mud on her
        face.
      </p>
      <p>How could a girl not love beauty?</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>At this moment, Gu Changge suddenly shook his sleeves.</p>
      <p>
        In the void in front of him, bursts of dazzling Immortal lights suddenly
        appeared, which were extremely dazzling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pieces of exquisite and gorgeous Immortal clothes and treasures,
        colorful Immortal skirts, intertwined with various magical runes and
        chains of laws and order.
      </p>
      <p>In the void, it manifested, filled with a terrifying aura.</p>
      <p>
        From the appearance alone, these things were definitely divine clothes
        far beyond what the world had seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The price was invaluable, and secondly, it was hard to find in the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention the gorgeous accessories of each Immortal clothes, all
        kinds of Immortal stones, bracelets, earrings, etc., it was really
        dazzling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Granny Yinhua's eyes widened for the first time, and she suddenly gasped
        in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>She had never seen these things before.</p>
      <p>
        The aura that circulated on each immortal's clothes was extremely
        terrifying, as if it could easily crush everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even on a small earring, there were many runes flickering, and there
        were strands of aura of laws hanging down.
      </p>
      <p>This terrifying power was really shocking!</p>
      <p>
        Except for this Immortal, probably no one in the Heavenly Star Realm can
        take it out, right?
      </p>
      <p>"Master‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao stared at these for a while, seeing these, was he letting her
        choose?
      </p>
      <p>
        She couldn't help showing joy in her eyes. It was the first time in her
        life that she saw such gorgeous and delicate clothes and accessories,
        which were embroidered with the brilliance of the sun, moon and stars.
      </p>
      <p>Her eyes were dizzy, full of love and joy.</p>
      <p>"It's all for you."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled.</p>
      <p>
        When he was in the Heavenly Dao Ancient City, many clothes that Gu
        Xian'er liked but couldn't wear after buying them were thrown to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, in order to make him bleed heavily, Gu Xian'er always
        chose the most expensive and beautiful ones.
      </p>
      <p>It just so happened that these things came in handy today.</p>
      <p>
        Others usually gave treasures as a gift when they accept disciples, but
        Gu Changge felt that Yaoyao might like these things even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, there was no shortage of things like treasures, and he could
        give away as much as he wanted.
      </p>
      <p>After all, he was rich and powerful!</p>
      <p>He couldn't teach his disciple, but he could raise her!</p>
      <p>
        Not to mention, with Yaoyao's naive personality, even the rest of the
        people, under this kind of offensive, would probably be dizzy and fall
        quickly.
      </p>
      <p>"It's all for Yaoyao?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yaoyao was a little stunned, and there was some confusion
        and shock in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>She suddenly got a little overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>
        She thought that the master asked her to choose one or a few of them,
        but she didn't expect that all of them were for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She could also see that these Immortal clothes and accessories were
        extraordinary and invaluable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it was somewhere else, it would probably set off a scramble for
        cultivators and cause a lot of bloodshed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah, it's all for you." Gu Changge smiled, waved it casually, and
        golden light flashed before his eyes again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many divine artifacts, divine weapons, divine medicines, elixirs, and
        engravings of classics‚Ä¶ manifested in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was like a walking treasure house of great teachings, and the
        resources were too numerous to count.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even a Quasi-Supreme Realm person would be greedy, and he wouldn't be
        able to compare to Gu Changge's wealth!
      </p>
      <p>"This‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Granny Yinhua was going to be stupid, especially when she saw the ups
        and downs of the divine artifact, her eyes were about to pop out.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was not mistaken, the divine artifacts among them were not one or
        two, but hundreds!
      </p>
      <p><i>Hundreds of divine artifacts? What the hell was this?</i></p>
      <p>
        <i
          >What kind of force was behind this Immortal? Her scalp was numb and
          her soul was trembling.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>What kind of terrifying master did Yaoyao choose to worship?</p>
      <p>
        "Why is my master being so nice to Yaoyao‚Ä¶" Her eyes suddenly became a
        little wet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides grandma and brother, there was now a third person who treated
        her so well.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as they met, he gave her so many good things, and she was
        embarrassed to accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Silly girl, you have to know that in this world, sometimes, the master
        is someone who is more intimate than your relatives."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge's expression seemed a little moved, then he
        sighed softly and touched her head.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 222-2: Cant teach but its good to have a disciple, Someone who
        is more intimate than relatives (2)
      </h4>
      <p>With a gentle expression, smiling without saying a word.</p>
      <p>
        "A person who is more intimate than a relative?" Yaoyao murmured this
        sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, at Gu Changge's insistence, Yaoyao accepted some greetings,
        but she refused to ask for too many things.
      </p>
      <p>She was already very sensible at a young age.</p>
      <p>
        This made Gu Changge very satisfied. If she were an ordinary person, how
        could she refuse.
      </p>
      <p>He himself was not interested in this little girl.</p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't to deal with the reincarnation of Human Ancestor, and brush
        up his Destiny Value and Luck Points, he would be too lazy to waste so
        much effort.
      </p>
      <p>It was just that Yaoyao was also very well-behaved.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt that while cultivating Gu Xian'er, it was not a big deal
        to cultivate such a young disciple.
      </p>
      <p>Still it should be really nice, right?</p>
      <p><i>Is this Gu Changge's first apprentice?</i></p>
      <p><i>Huh?</i></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge thought of this, and suddenly felt a movement in his heart,
        as if a gap had opened in an unknown corner.
      </p>
      <p>
        He faintly felt some vague images emerging from the depths of his mind.
      </p>
      <p>A figure in red as blood, murderous and unparalleled.</p>
      <p>
        In the end, he was knocked down by the demonic halberd and fell into the
        bottomless abyss.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene was very blurry, and when he remembered the sentence just now,
        it suddenly appeared and disappeared in a flash.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since the Nirvana Pool incident, I have been able to vaguely witness
        some scenes‚Ä¶ Could it be a self-sealed memory that I didn't know about?
        Or a past life memory?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge frowned secretly.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, he had sensed this state recently, just like his inheritance of
        the Immortal Devouring Demon Art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than him, no one could imagine that this part of the inheritance
        naturally emerged in his mind when he was three years old.
      </p>
      <p>It was not taught to him by anyone.</p>
      <p>
        In other words, this was the seal cracking itself, and some memories and
        inheritance reappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of method was very likely Gu Changge's own method, afraid of
        revealing his identity, and sealed the memory of his demonic power.
      </p>
      <p>But now, the memories of these seals were beginning to emerge.</p>
      <p>"Could it be that Yaoyao is not my first disciple?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge faintly felt this part of the memory, as if it was reminding
        him that the next Child of Luck was coming. F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at
        nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com
      </p>
      <p>But soon, he put these thoughts aside and stopped caring.</p>
      <p>
        The most urgent task right now was to consider resolving the matter of
        the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>Then things would get much easier.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge closed his eyes and waited in Northern Mountain Village.</p>
      <p>
        On the other side, with the help of Granny Yinhua, Yaoyao dressed up and
        put on new clothes before appearing in front of him again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared with her shabby clothes before, she looked completely
        different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her Immortal spirit was beautiful, her supreme bone was immortal, as if
        there was endless rhythm, and all of them were gathered into her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the background of such expensive and gorgeous colorful immortal
        clothes, her hair was soft and smooth, like a little immortal from the
        nine heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Gu Changge have to admit that she was indeed the Daughter of
        Luck, and as the fruit of the mysterious Peach Tree, this kind of
        temperament was unparalleled.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But if I'm not mistaken, the next normal routine should be that Yaoyao
        can't actually cultivate‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "As an immortal fruit, she contains extremely terrifying power, but she
        can't use it on her own."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But it doesn't matter, it saves me the effort to teach, just keep it‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Speaking of which, it's not time for the master to show his concern."
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's mind flashed with many thoughts, but a gentle smile
        appeared on his face.
      </p>
      <p>"Yaoyao, from today onwards, you will follow Master? How about it?"</p>
      <p>"Mmmm, Yaoyao will listen to Master." Yaoyao nodded.</p>
      <p>
        Although she had a great relationship with the Northern Mountain
        Village, she also knew that it was impossible for Gu Changge to stay
        here with her.
      </p>
      <p>"But Master, can grandma leave with us?"</p>
      <p>Yaoyao asked tentatively with anticipation on her face.</p>
      <p>
        She felt very sorry for her grandma Yinhua, but she was not sure whether
        Gu Changge would agree to take her away with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since she has raised Yaoyao for so many years, why not bring her
        along?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled, and what he said surprised Yaoyao very much, but she
        didn't expect the master to agree so quickly and decisively.
      </p>
      <p>"Thank you, Master!" She obediently said.</p>
      <p>
        "Thank you, Mr. Immortal!" Granny Yinhua said with excitement and
        gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>It was all thanks to Yaoyao, otherwise she would not be so lucky.</p>
      <p>
        Now that her cultivation base was exposed, if she didn't leave, the
        enemy family would find her soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this aspect, following Gu Changge was definitely the best choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, she didn't know that Gu Changge kept her, but there were
        other functions, even if Yaoyao didn't mention it, he would still bring
        her along.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge took the two of them and left the Northern
        Mountain Village, planning to find an ancient city in the Heavenly
        Domain, to find a good foothold first.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, as a Master, he would definitely have to fulfill his
        obligations as a Master for Yaoyao at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spreading the cultivation technique, strengthening her body, building
        the foundation‚Ä¶ Anyway, the process that should be followed had to be
        done.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, in the next period of time, terrifying rumors began to appear
        in various restricted areas of Heavenly Domain and the Sacred Mountain,
        causing a sensation in all parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        A man in white a little girl, an old woman, and a servant, went straight
        to the major restricted areas and the Ancient Sacred Mountain, as if
        entering an ownerless realm, and came to ask for various divine blood
        essence and divine medicines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even a master of the forbidden area who had lived for more than 100,000
        years and had reached the Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        His most precious horn was slashed by the man in white with a sword, and
        his rarest blood essence was taken to build the foundation for the
        little girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Sacred Mountain that was in the Sacred Realm refused to accept
        it. As a result, the servant of the man in white wiped it out of this
        world with one palm, causing a sensation in the entire Heavenly Domain
        and causing all kinds of discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All kinds of terrifying rumors made many Sacred Mountains and restricted
        areas uneasy, for fear of when it would be their turn next!
      </p>
      <p>This news shocked countless monks and creatures to the extreme.</p>
      <p>
        Many people speculated that the Immortal from the Upper Realm who
        appeared in the Xuan Domain had come to Heavenly Domain!
      </p>
      <p>
        And the identity of that little girl also shocked countless cultivators
        and forces, and there were all kinds of speculations.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the leader of the Black Wind bandits was in a cold
        sweat after listening to the reports of the other chiefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The incident in the Northern Mountain Village had not only shocked them,
        but even the forces in other places had heard of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Immortal descended on that day, all the bandits who raised
        their hands were wiped from the heavens and the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a fairy tale was even more shocking when the villagers of the
        Northern Mountain Village told it in person, which led many forces to
        quietly send people to investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current Northern Mountain Village was different from the past,
        although it was full of mortals without cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>But no force dared to provoke it.</p>
      <p>
        Because some cultivators speculated that the little girl next to the
        Immortal was someone from the Northern Mountain Village!
      </p>
      <p>
        So much so that the villagers of the Northern Mountain Village seemed to
        have a relationship with the immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even some Holy Land disciples did not dare to offend them too much when
        they saw them!
      </p>
      <p>"Master, shall we repay this revenge?"</p>
      <p>The third chief next to him asked with a solemn expression.</p>
      <p>
        But before he finished speaking, their leader slapped him in the face.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Revenge? A fart? All of you must remember. Don't ask me anything about
        the Northern Mountain Village, don't say a word, just pretend that you
        don't know, understand?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Their leader said fiercely, but only he knew now that his back was wet
        with cold sweat.
      </p>
      <p>
        That Immortal from the Upper Realm was definitely the mysterious Lord
        who suddenly appeared during that time!
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>On this point, the leader of bandits was convinced.</p>
      <p>
        He didn't know why the Immortal from the Upper Realm arranged it like
        this, but he knew what he was doing, and it would be fine to rot in his
        stomach.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was a wise man, so he knew that it was already the greatest gift that
        the Immortal from the Upper Realm did not take action to wipe out the
        entire Black Wind bandits!
      </p>
      <p>Or tell him what to do.</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, the leader of the bandits was even more decisive, and
        he directly took action, and abruptly cut off his memory about that
        part!
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, no one except the Immortal from the Upper Realm knew that
        it was him who arranged the Black Wind bandits to suddenly want to
        slaughter the village.
      </p>
      <p>No one could trace the truth anymore.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        On the other side, Gu Changge took Yaoyao to travel in the Heavenly
        Domain, looking for some precious divine blood material for her to
        train.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, he also learned a lot about her and her brother.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, these things started when Granny Yinhua accidentally picked
        up a baby by the river after she went into seclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Granny Yinhua was also a disciple of an incomparably powerful master in
        the Holy Land back then, and she had a good talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for some reason, the sect where she was, went into a rapid decline,
        and after encountering an opposing sect, it fell apart.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was not interested in this.</p>
      <p>
        If it was the Son of Luck, maybe he would help the silver haired granny
        to restore the sect or something.
      </p>
      <p>But for him, it did nothing to do so.</p>
      <p>
        And the baby that Granny Yinhua picked up was naturally Yaoyao's older
        brother, the current reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this point of view, Jiang Yang might have a background of
        bitterness and hatred behind him, and he was abandoned by his parents
        because of some last resort.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was not interested in learning about it.</p>
      <p>The name Jiang Yang was different from the usual Son of Luck.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was a little surprised that there was no Ye, Fan, Hao, etc.,
        but it was reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like this kind of reincarnation, the Son of Luck was not comparable to
        that kind of clich√©.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of start was high, the background was strong, it was estimated
        that even his mood was also quite different from those ordinary Children
        of Luck.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge didn't find it challenging.</p>
      <p>After all, there was no one from the Upper Realm to intervene here.</p>
      <p>
        In the Heavenly Star realm, he didn't say that he could cover the sky
        with one hand, but it was actually not much different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the identity of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor had
        been determined, everything was easy to handle.
      </p>
      <p>Nip the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor in the bud.</p>
      <p>On the way, drain all the Luck points from him.</p>
      <p>This was Gu Changge's next purpose and plan.</p>
      <p>
        From Granny Yinhua's words, Gu Changge knew even more that the Human
        Ancestor was reincarnated more than a year ago and was taken away by the
        cultivators of the Immortal Lun Sect to practice, and there was no news
        since then.
      </p>
      <p>Immortal Lun Sect, their ancestor was Immortal Lun Supreme.</p>
      <p>This surprised Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        According to the world barrier of Heavenly Star Realm, there was a Great
        Sacred Realm at most. If you want to achieve the Quasi-Supreme Realm,
        you need some luck or chance.
      </p>
      <p>Or seclusion for countless years to make a breakthrough.</p>
      <p>
        The Ancestor of this Immortal Lun Sect turned out to be someone in the
        Supreme Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        This could only show that he was not a creature born in this world, and
        it might also be from the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor was now cultivating
        in Immortal Lun Sect, but he didn't know how much of his reincarnation
        memory had awakened.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The good thing was that the so-called Awakening of Reincarnation was
        actually no different from taking over someone‚Äôs body, swallowing up the
        original consciousness and letting the previous memory dominate."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled with deep meaning.</p>
      <p>
        To deal with such a Son of Luck, he had long been familiar with it, and
        naturally he was within his grasp.
      </p>
      <p>He had already thought about the plan.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao and Granny Yinhua, as the relatives of the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor of this world, were naturally his main weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, except for Gu Changge, no one knew the true identity
        of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>Even Yaoyao didn't know about it.</p>

          >On the other hand, Tang Wan heaved a sigh shortly after Gu Changge
          left. The overwhelming pressure finally disappeared. It felt as though
          she had been dragged out from a pool of ice cold water and was still
          shivering with fright. This was a feeling she could never forget. She
          didn&#8217;t even dare to speak mindlessly in front of Gu Changge or
          she might accidentally call him &#8216;Master.&#8217;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, at that moment, she lost her patience and questioned Yin
          Mei, thinking that they were on the same boat. Subconsciously, she
          assumed that Yin Mei must be the same as her, having fallen under Gu
          Changge&#8217;s grasp and was coerced into getting a Slave Mark
          planted.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Earlier, she was worried that, after the Slave Mark, Gu Changge would
          force her into doing shameful things against her will. Fortunately,
          that was not the case as the man chose to leave, which somewhat
          relieved her.</span

          >&#8220;I am Master&#8217;s servant. What else could it be?&#8221;
          Hearing that, Yin Mei casually revealed a smile. The subtle joy on her
          flawless face was beguiling.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She witnessed the entire process of Gu Changge coercing Tang Wan, as
          he did not ask her to leave. This means that her master has absolute
          faith in her. As such, Yin Mei was delighted, so gleeful that she
          uncontrollably wagged her fox tails.</span

          Don&#8217;t you feel ashamed saying those words out of your
          mouth?&#8221; Tang Wan was stunned, thinking that Yin Mei must be
          teasing her or the Slave Mark imprinted into Yin Mei must be much
          scarier than the one planted in her.</span

          Tang Wan was thinking, Yin Mei smilingly stated, visibly joyous.</span

          secretly contemplating a way to work with Yin Mei, to dispel the Slave
          Marks in them, but her behaviour left her absolutely speechless.</span

          have the Slave Mark in me, you know?&#8221; Yin Mei happily
          claimed.</span

          >&#8220;Impossible. You are doing this by your own will?&#8221; Dazed
          once again, Tang Wan was in dismay. [She doesn&#8217;t have a Slave
          Mark? Then why would she refer to Gu Changge as
          &#8216;Master?&#8217;]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, she managed to calm herself down and retain her composure. In
          order to avoid suspicion, she deliberately waited for her injuries to
          recover before carrying the unconscious Tang Tian out of the courtyard
          as the formidable experts of the Tang Family were anxiously awaiting
          them outside.

          Noble Realm expert asked out of concern. He was a loyal servant of the
          Tang Family, possessing a muscular body covered in gleaming
          mist.</span

          while,&#8221; Tang Wan answered. Back then, Gu Changge withdrew Tang
          Tian&#8217;s soul, and although he didn&#8217;t do anything more than
          that, certain effects were to be expected.</span

          before asking, &#8220;Lady Wan, did you have to agree to their
          conditions in order to retrieve Young Master Tang Tian? That is too
          absurd!&#8221;</span

          retaliate and let them understand that we are not people they should

          when he discovered that a new memory surged in his mind, as though he
          encountered something when he was unconscious. Though, the pictures
          were messy and ambiguous, as if they carried some sort of godly
          meanings. Vaguely, he could see a vast, endless world where a towering
          palace stood on the clouds, whose heavenly door resembled a path to
          ancient times.</span

          after facing such great danger?&#8221; Tang Tian was thrilled. He had
          heard similar fantasy tales as well as a story from a storyteller in
          which a person was granted peerless abilities after waking up. Yet, he
          had never expected that that would happen to him one day.</span

          Tang Tian suppressed his emotions, forcing himself to calm down as
          such a matter must not be revealed. Despite being pampered till he was
          spoiled, he was in no way a fool.</span

          depths of the Capital of Vermilion Bird Empire, a woman in white was

          as the glow on her bewitching face carried subservience and
          harmony.</span

          the elegant and quiet type.</span

          has been rather peaceful since you went to deal with the Eternal
          Overcast. Though, in Black Tortoise Empire, an empire not far away
          from Vermilion Bird Empire, many young prodigies seem to have faced
          some kind of accident.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Though, truthfully, right when Ji Qingxuan mentioned it, he figured
          that Su Qingge, as the Successor of Demonic Arts, must have been
          searching for a new target. Essentially, to Su Qingge, the best
          hunting ground would be where Sky King Zhi Yang was.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Furthermore, since there was a grudge between Sky King Zhi Yang and
          him, the former would easily be the first she would target, and even
          if she failed to kill him, she could at least give him a hard
          time.</span

          taken away. It seems the Successor of Demonic Arts is hiding among
          their team.&#8221; Ji Qing Xuan nodded with her eyes fixated at Gu
          Changge.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          the matter as he reckoned it was about time he made a move on Ying
          Shuang, who was in Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s team. After all, he had
          been leaving Ying Shuang the Body Possessing Fortuitous One for far
          too long, and it was probably time to collect his dues. But of course,
          there was something else he needed Ying Shuang to do first.</span

          crisis, as he had been awaiting her to look for the Source of the
          Eternal Overcast, which he sought after.</span

          Eternal Overcast had not been thoroughly dealt with, it was no longer

          still in his possession. On them, was a list of names who detested Gu
          Changge, and those who had had a conflict with him. Thus,

          Sister from the previous life. You just don’t remember at the moment.”
          Sky King Zhi Yang soon continued after taking a breath. “Do you still
          remember that day, in front of the entrance of the Immortal Academy? I
          acted that way because I wanted to help you restore your memories from
          the previous life. If you don’t believe me, I can’t do anything about

          quite a bit. She had already guessed what Sky King Zhi Yang and Qin

          her expectation.</span

          life was Dao Xian.” Qin Wuya also opened his mouth this time. He hoped
          these words could help Gu Xianer remember.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The name Dao Xian, was something she had heard Qin Wuya mentioned
          before. She just didn’t expect it to be her name in her past life. It
          was just too unbelievable and absurd. [Does reincarnation really exist
          in the first place?]</span

          someone’s memory from their past life. If you don’t believe us, you
          can drink this.” Qin Wuya spoke up again. He took out a small white
          jade bottle from his sleeve and handed it to Gu Xianer.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It gave off a dazzling, mystical white light that filled the air and
          the Power of Reincarnation emitted from it, making a shocking sight.
          In fact, just the bottle alone was enough for people to feel the power
          surging from it.</span

          >“Water from the Lake of Reincarnation?” Gu Xianer knitted her brows.
          She didn’t take the bottle. She could not find it in her to trust Qin
          Wuya and Sky King Zhi Yang. Similarly, she didn’t even have a way to
          confirm if it really was water from the Lake of Reincarnation. [Who
          knows what is actually inside this bottle? But, I can’t say that I’m
          not curious about what they’ve said. Is it truly what these two want?
          Setting aside whether the matter about my previous life is a lie,
          luring me here hardly makes them seem as though they hold any good
          intentions.]</span

          >“If you don’t believe us, this is what I saw when I used the
          Foreseeing Eye.” Seeing Gu Xianer’s silence, Sky King Zhi Yang thought
          she was thinking about their words seriously and his eyes were filled
          with joy. He couldn’t help but add on.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, a golden mark appeared between his brows, the
          brilliance illuminating everything was incomparably resplendent and
          filled with divinity. He was unable to use the full ability of the
          Foreseeing Eye right now. However, recreating the scene he saw before
          wasn’t a difficult thing for him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He believed that if Gu Xianer could see it, she would definitely
          become suspicious of Gu Changge. At the very least, she wouldn’t trust
          him unconditionally like she was now.</span

          >*Buzz!* While speaking, a void formed before Sky King Zhi Yang and
          suddenly rays of light appeared. Following after, a scenery began
          forming. In a dim and wet dungeon, a graceful maiden covered in dust
          was pierced by chains. Her four limbs hung from the wall and there
          were bloodstains everywhere. Her breath was weak, but her expression
          was frigid and stubborn.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The handsome man in front of her wearing clothes purer than snow
          looked like a young noble untouched by dust. The small, white jade
          bowl in his hand was filled with blood that emitted an evil
          aura.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing this, Gu Xianer who had been silent suddenly trembled, her
          complexion turning white as if she was completely drained of
          blood.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What a load of bullshit, I’m going to kill you.” Suddenly, she
          coldly spoke and her jade sword flew out from her palm. It was clear
          and sparkling, giving off a resplendent light, with a fearsome sharp
          tip. It sliced through space, heading straight towards Zhi Yang with
          every intention to kill him.
        </span>

          ill intentions towards you, he is the real Successor of Demonic Arts,
          why won’t you believe us? Eldest Senior Brother and I would never hurt
          you.” Sky King Zhi Yang’s expression was heavy and he couldn’t help
          asking. At the same time, he waved his sleeve and a purple aura rushed
          out like the Milky Way, crashing down from the sky to counter Gu
          Xianer’s attack.

          >With his current strength, if Gu Xianer didn’t have other tricks up
          her sleeve, it wouldn’t be hard for him to subdue her. However, Sky
          King Zhi Yang didn’t do so, and continued trying to mend the
          situation. He hoped the Gu Xianer could think it through and no longer
          stick to the wrong path.</span

          relationship with Gu Changge? Suppose that’s my future, so what, I’m
          willing.” Gu Xianer’s voice was still cold as frost without any kind
          of emotion.</span

          demolished everything around causing the mountain range to crumble.
          The sword carried incredible Principles, which were turbulent and

          >Hearing her words, Sky King Zhi Yang’s expression became extremely
          ugly; there was anger, gloominess, hatred, but above all, there was

          wants to harm you…” He was practically roaring in anger, he didn’t
          think Gu Xianer would say something like that. He could feel his whole
          body being engulfed by the flames of envy. At this moment, Sky King
          Zhi Yang couldn’t care about anything anymore. He was going to
          suppress Gu Xianer and make her drink the water from the Lake of
          Reincarnation.

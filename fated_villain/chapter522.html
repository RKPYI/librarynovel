          you someday…&#8221; In Sky Deer Sanctum, the bloodied and dishevelled
          Fairy Qingyue looked like a banshee as she screamed. She no longer
          kept her calm like before. Even her eyes were bloodshot. After having
          her plan exposed, she yelled at Gu Changge like a shrew. Now that she
          had nothing she cared about, she didn&#8217;t mind dying. However, it
          would be her greatest regret to never avenge Zhao Yunze.</span

          to be.&#8221; Gu Changge lightly shook his head with an indifferent
          look on his face. &#8220;The one thing I do know is that the millions
          of living beings in the Great Cloud Domain will have to bear the
          consequence that they shouldn&#8217;t have to because of
          you…&#8221;</span

          as though to vent all the anger she kept inside during this period.
          &#8220;I&#8217;m the only one who is involved in this plan. Come at me

          me this?&#8221; Gu Changge nonchalantly asked in return before a few
          experts from the Gu Family came and locked her up. In all honesty, he
          was not surprised by Fairy Qingyue&#8217;s assassination
          attempt.</span

          other Great Domains would be affected to some extent. After all, the
          Great Cloud Domain Ruler was the one who harboured evil intentions and
          offered Fairy Qingyue to Gu Changge, and Fairy Qingyue tried to
          assassinate him. All of this happened in Sky Deer City.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, Gu Changge had a feeling that the Great Cloud Domain Ruler
          was unaware that this would happen. Fairy Qingyue obviously intended
          to avenge Zhao Yunze. Still, this wouldn&#8217;t stop Gu Changge from
          making an example out of them to serve as a warning to others.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          curious to see when the Great Cloud Domain Ruler was planning to make
          his next move. To Gu Changge, the big fish, the Great Cloud Domain
          Ruler, was way more important. He had already set up a trap without
          his opponents knowing, and all he was waiting now was for the Supreme
          Mountain Elder to make his first move.</span

          Gu, how could you tell that Fairy Qingyue would attempt an
          assassination?&#8221; She hadn&#8217;t noticed anything out of place.
          If it hadn&#8217;t been for Gu Changge&#8217;s sudden attack that sent
          the weapon that Fairy Qingyue hid in her sleeve flying, she might not

          leaders flickered. They were still guessing the reason the Great Cloud
          Domain Ruler wanted to give up Fairy Qingyue, and they even thought
          that he had given up on avenging his son. To everyone&#8217;s

          and it even felt like there was a thunderstorm in his head. He never
          thought that Fairy Qingyue would try to assassinate Gu Changge without

          Xiao Yang to look for you. That&#8217;s why I made preparations in
          advance and got a few subordinates. Even though they betrayed Sky Deer
          City, they&#8217;re undoubtedly my people. They might be able to find
          the place where the Second Mountain Elder and the others are being

          surprise.&#8221; Seemingly satisfied, the Supreme Mountain Elder
          nodded in response. Still, he didn&#8217;t put all his hopes on Gu
          Wudi. There was no way Gu Wudi could easily find the captives&#8217;
          location, considering how cunning a man Gu Changge was.</span

          Bone Ancestor started respectfully, &#8220;Young Master Gu, as per
          your order, we have set up traps around here, and various forbidden
          arrays. The moment the Supreme Mountain Elder breaks in here, there is
          absolutely no way of him getting out.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His eyes then slowly swept across the walls of the dungeon. Seeing
          the areas that shone with faint brilliance gave him even more
          satisfaction than before. Although Sky Deer City had been guarded
          heavily, and even the territory within a million kilometres had been
          sealed off, he was still worried. After all, the Supreme Mountain
          Elder was someone whose peak strength surpassed that of an Immortal.
          His powers were comparable to that of Ancestor of Wind. Even if it was
          difficult to exert the most power he could during his prime time given
          the current World Principles, Gu Changge doubted anyone could stop the
          Supreme Mountain Elder if he wanted to escape.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge highly doubted that the Supreme Mountain Elder cared about
          the millions of lives in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. Someone
          like him only cared about the Tree of Epoch controlled by Luo Feng;
          his only concern was the possibility of restoring himself to his
          prime. Therefore, Gu Changge came to the conclusion that the Supreme
          Mountain Elder would find a way to uncover where Luo Feng was being
          held, come to rescue Luo Feng, and then take him away.

      <p>

          to make the first move so that he could beat him at his own
          game.</span

          for the big fish to swim into it.&#8221; Gu Changge looked at the
          unconscious Luo Feng with a slightly strange look in his eyes. Just in
          case, he had already devoured Luo Feng&#8217;s Source and Soul during
          this period, and the only thing that remained was only a faint Life
          Force. So even if the Supreme Mountain Elder managed to escape by
          chance, all his effort would come to nought when he eventually found
          out that Gu Changge had already acquired the Tree of Epoch.</span

          >Two days went by in the blink of an eye. Everyone from the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains had been feeling on pins and needles these
          days because of Fairy Qingyue&#8217;s assassination attempt on Gu
          Changge. They were worried that they would be implicated. But to their
          surprise, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t seem to be angry, nor did he blame
          them for it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the contrary, it was the Great Cloud Domain Ruler who led his
          clansmen to Gu Changge and pleaded guilty the next day. He explained
          that the assassination by Fairy Qingyue had nothing to do with them,
          and they were willing to serve the Immortal Gu Family from now
          on.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge had anticipated this. Being the largest Domain in the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the Great Cloud Domain was vast and
          rich in resources. Gu Changge had no reason to not make it his
          territory. Not when there was a chance for him to do so without much
          effort on his part right in front of him.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This incident caused quite a stir. None of the clans expected that
          the Great Cloud Domain Ruler would be so decisive. Many were getting
          restless as well because of it. The three days they got were actually
          time for them to calm down. Now that they had got hold of themselves,
          it was time for them to make a decision.</span

          >&#8220;Supreme Mountain Elder, I have mobilised those spies in the
          past few days and found a suspicious place. I suspect that Second
          Mountain Elder and the others are being held there.&#8221;</span

          >At this moment in the palaces where all the clans were resting, Gu
          Wudi stood respectfully in front of the Supreme Mountain Elder and
          reported. Behind him stood Xiao Yang and three other experts from the
          Three War God Clans. Their expressions now were the same as Gu
          Wudi&#8217;s. Judging from the excitement on their faces, they had
          obviously found some clues.</span

          >? And where is this &#8216;suspicious place&#8217;?&#8221; the
          Supreme Mountain Elder asked, seemingly not excited by what he heard.
          To be honest, he was starting to feel anxious when no one had gotten
          any leads in the past two days. However, he was a cautious man who
          only acted after he was certain. He wouldn&#8217;t do things that he
          didn&#8217;t feel confident about.

          >Gu Wudi calmly began, &#8220;We found subtle array fluctuations in
          the southwest corner of Sky Deer City. But compared to the tight
          security at other places, the security there is extremely lax. We
          didn&#8217;t pay attention to that place at first. It didn&#8217;t
          seem important because there weren&#8217;t many people guarding the
          place. But then Youngest Junior Brother noticed something was wrong.
          The loose security there seemed to be a deliberate attempt of the
          Upper Realm to make us skip that place. But actually, the security
          there is secretly way tighter than anywhere else.&#8221;</span

          >There was a strange look in Xiao Yang&#8217;s eyes when Gu Wudi
          mentioned noticing something weird about the place. However, it
          disappeared just as quickly as it emerged.</span

          and he let out a rare smile. &#8220;How surprising. You are extremely
          meticulous. That must be the spot we&#8217;re looking
          for.&#8221;</span

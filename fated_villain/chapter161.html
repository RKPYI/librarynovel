      <h4>
        Chapter 161: To Call Him A Treasure-Giver Would Not Be An Exaggeration;
        A Fan Of Gu Changge!
      </h4>
      <p>
        Shortly afterwards, Gu Changge refined the Immortal Cave and placed it
        in his Inner World.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, he used some Destiny Points to create a separate space
        in his Inner World for the purpose of storing divine weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the vast space filled with golden light, floated various kinds of
        divine weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swords, spears, halberds, even cauldrons for alchemy. They all floated
        in the void with light so brilliant that it seemed to be able to pierce
        the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Such is the power of the Void Talent.</p>
      <p>
        <i
          >[PR/N: Clarification: The Void Talent is why they’re floating, but
          the divine weapons were from the Immortal Cave.]</i
        >

      </p>
      <p>
        It was also worth noting that all the weapons in the Divine Armory were
        real, not mere rune constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Gu Changge’s Divine Armory, he now practically owned a treasure
        trove of divine weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that something unexpected happens, he could simply use this
        to his advantage and crush his opponent.
      </p>
      <p>As to why Gu Changge did this… it was purely because of his wealth.</p>
      <p>
        For now, he basically had no use for the divine weapons he suddenly
        obtained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei chose a few divine weapons from among them, but there were still
        plenty left unchosen.
      </p>
      <p>There were hundreds of divine weapons in the cave.</p>
      <p>
        Everything that the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation had seen and left
        behind was not ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this regard, Gu Changge had nothing more to say to the Ancient Deity
        of Reincarnation other than to express his courtesy.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Ye Ling was a treasure hunting rat, then the Ancient Deity of
        Reincarnation would be the treasure giver.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge visited another area to collect a small piece of
        the Lake of Reincarnation and the Root of Reincarnation it held within.
        These things were also taken into the Inner World.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only can the Root of Reincarnation be used as a weapon, but it can
        also produce the Fruit of Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, so far, Gu Changge had not yet come to the point where he
        needed to use the Root of Reincarnation as a weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Note: The Root of Reincarnation is something similar to the Branch of
        World Tree mentioned in many novels. They can be used as weapons by
        refining and can also be planted to obtain various benefits, which in
        this case is a special fruit.]
      </p>
      <p>Currently, he was planning to depart from this place.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Once we return to the outside world, you will explain that Ye Ling
          was severely injured and fled…”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Before doing anything else, Gu Changge instructed Yin Mei.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“I know, Master. Ye Ling has yet to die, for, at a critical moment,
          he used his trump card and escaped from Master’s hand.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Yin Mei nodded her head.</p>
      <p>Naturally, Ye Ling was dead.</p>
      <p>However, the time wasn’t right for the world to find out just yet.</p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, there would be no one else to carry the black pot of Gu
        Changge’s identity as the Inheritor of the Demonic Arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, for both her and Gu Changge, it was necessary to deceive
        the world by putting on a show.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“No, at the critical moment, Ye Ling used his Demonic Arts to
          seriously injure me when he was also badly injured. Only then did he
          take the opportunity to escape.”</strong
        >
        Gu Changge shook his head at the words, correcting Yin Mei’s statement.
      </p>
      <p>What Yin Mei said was right, but not perfect.</p>
      <p>
        It was easy for him to pretend that he had been severely injured by the
        Immortal Devouring Demonic Technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if someone were to look into his injuries, he could still leave
        traces proving that the Immortal Devouring Demonic Technique had injured
        his essence.
      </p>
      <p>By doing so, no one would think twice about it.</p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, more people will become wary of Ye Ling because of this
        matter. After all, even someone as powerful as Gu Changge was injured by
        Ye Ling.
      </p>
      <p>What would they do if they were to face Ye Ling?</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Currently, it would be best to give the world the idea that Ye Ling
          possesses unfathomable might. With this, we can lay the groundwork for
          our actions in the future.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“I understand, Master’s thoughts are truly flawless.”</strong>
        Yin Mei suddenly realized his plan and began to admire Gu Changge more
        and more. Furthermore, she was quite pleased with this development.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, in the past, when Gu Changge gave her instructions, he would
        never explain them to her.
      </p>
      <p>She had to guess the reasons for everything herself.</p>
      <p>
        Since he did so, it was logical to assume that Gu Changge was beginning
        to trust her more and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yin Mei was a very clever girl, so she naturally understood this quite
        quickly.
      </p>
      <p><strong>“Let’s go.”</strong> Gu Changge spoke.</p>
      <p>
        On their way back, Gu Changge suddenly spurted out a mouthful of blood,
        his face turned pale and his appearance became weaker.
      </p>
      <p>It looked as if he had been wounded at his very essence.</p>
      <p>
        The time of the injury had to be controlled carefully to ensure that
        there are no flaws.
      </p>
      <p>Naturally, this look was only a superficial disguise in the end.</p>
      <p>
        There was no way that Gu Changge would ever do anything that would cause
        harm to himself.
      </p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p><strong>[Ruins, 8000 miles from the Ancient City.]</strong></p>
      <p>When Gu Changge rescued Yin Mei from Ye Ling’s “clutches”.</p>
      <p>
        Large numbers of cultivators and creatures had rushed here as the sky
        was filled with divine rainbows and warships, the sounds alarming all
        those nearby. The light of their divine weapons soaring to the skies
        could be seen for miles.
      </p>
      <p>People searched every nook and cranny.</p>
      <p>
        Atop each of the ruins’ peaks appeared vast groups of people, their
        divine senses covering the entire area.
      </p>
      <p>They were hunting for the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor.</p>
      <p>
        Thousands of young geniuses have been alerted this time, and one could
        even spot 6 or 7 Young Supremes among them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang – the Heir of the Immortal Wang Family, Ye Langtian – the
        young master of the Immortal Ye Family, and Chi Ling – the heir of the
        Vermilion Bird Clan…
      </p>
      <p>
        All of them rushed here after receiving the news, stopping for nothing
        along the way for fear that Ye Ling would escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after searching the entirety of the ruins, there hasn’t even been a
        single sign of any living souls nearby, not to mention any trace of Ye
        Ling.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were eager to find Ye Ling even if it meant unearthing his grave.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“Did Ye Ling really escape?”</strong> Chi Ling frowned, having
        rushed here so quickly after hearing the news, only to find nothing.
      </p>
      <p>She suspected that Ye Ling was no longer around.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Chi Ling, a tomb has been found here, and as we suspected, the
          ancient corpses within have had their essences refined…”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        At that moment, a divine ray of light descended from the sky and onto
        the ground before transforming into a tall, heroic man whose figure was
        like that of a young deity.
      </p>
      <p>It was none other than Ye Langtian.</p>
      <p>He spoke in a deep tone, his expression very grave.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>“Really?”</strong> Chi Ling sighed, her expression also heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had guessed before that a tomb would appear in this place, so she
        had kept an eye out for it.
      </p>
      <p>She never thought that she would be right.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, many of the ancient corpses in the tomb had already been
        devoured and absorbed by Ye Ling.
      </p>
      <p>Their worst fears had come true.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>“Unfortunately, we are still a step too late.”</strong> In
        another direction, a figure shrouded in mist approached.
      </p>
      <p>It was Wang Wushuang.</p>
      <p>
        He too sighed and said,
        <strong
          >“I didn’t think that this hard work would all be for naught in the
          end.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“But why haven’t we seen Brother Gu? Didn’t he pass on this message
          to us?”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang spoke with a slight frown as he suddenly noticed that
        there was no sign of Gu Changge anywhere around here.<strong
        > </strong>This puzzled him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reasonably speaking, this matter was important enough that Gu Changge –
        who had passed on the news himself – should not have been absent.
      </p>
      <p>Yet now there was no sign of Gu Changge, not even his followers.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Indeed, why is Brother Gu not here? I also got this news from his
          followers.”</strong
        >
        Ye Langtian was also puzzled.
      </p>
      <p>The moment they got the news, they rushed over.</p>
      <p>
        However, there was no sign of Gu Changge, could it be that they received
        the wrong information?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Perhaps Daoist Brother Changge had already guessed that we would
          return from this trip empty-handed which is why he didn’t
          come.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        When Chi ling heard this, she speculated,
        <strong
          >“Perhaps Daoist Brother Changge already knew that Ye Ling would
          escape. After all, with so many people coming to attack him, he would
          escape if he weren’t stupid.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p><strong>“We will probably find nothing.”</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“In addition, since Daoist Brother Changge dared to inform us, it
          means that he is already sure that he can find Ye Ling’s location.
          Maybe this is part of his plan to force Ye Ling to show
          himself…”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Chi Ling showed a thoughtful face as she analyzed the situation.</p>
      <p>She drew her conclusions based on her understanding of Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, Ye Langtian’s eyes lit up as he nodded his head in
        acknowledgement,
        <strong
          >“Chi Ling’s words make sense. Given Brother Gu’s character, there is
          no way he would make a mistake on such a matter. He definitely already
          knew that Ye Ling would escape, so the purpose of informing us was
          just to force Ye Ling to show himself.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Having heard this, Wang Wushuang was silent for a while.</p>
      <p>
        Although he felt reluctant to do so, he could do nothing but feel
        helpless.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“So it seems that we have all been used as pawns by Brother
          Gu.”</strong
        >
        Wang Wushuang said.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone else had used them in such a way, they would have been furious
        and enraged, but in the face of Gu Changge, they did not dare.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Young Asura and a Young Supreme were not on the same level of
        existence after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, Gu Changge was acting for the sake of all the people and of
        all the various creatures of the world.
      </p>
      <p>At this point, what more could they say?</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Perhaps Daoist Brother Changge has already encountered Ye Ling by
          now….”</strong
        >
        Chi Ling exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“I didn’t expect you to know so much about Daoist Brother Changge,
          how unexpected….”</strong
        >
        At this point, Ye Langtian couldn’t help but open his mouth with a
        narrow smile.
      </p>
      <p><strong>“Brother Ye, you should be careful what you say.”</strong></p>
      <p>
        After hearing the words, Chi Ling was slightly stunned and could not
        help but shake her head.
      </p>
      <p>There was a bitter smile in her heart.</p>
      <p>She must not let the future female emperor hear this.</p>
      <p>
        She still vividly remembers the day when Yue Mingkong killed a beast in
        the True God Realm with a mere slap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong was so aggressive in protecting what was hers that Chi Ling
        wouldn’t dare mess with her so casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though she never revealed it, she felt that Yue Mingkong’s strength was
        far superior to that of Ye Langtian and Wang Wushuang.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also remembered the cold, dangerous glare that Yue Mingkong’s eyes
        had that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she really dared to get too close to Gu Changge, he may not care.
      </p>
      <p>However… Yue Mingkong might really kill her.</p>
      <p>
        It was at this moment that a sudden stream of light flew in from the
        distance as a young cultivator rushed to them with shock and disbelief
        written on his face.
      </p>
      <p>He seemed to have something important to report.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>“Not good!”</strong> he shouted with a frightened expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene caused the group of Young Supremes, including Chi Ling, Wang
        Wushuang and Ye Langtian, to look over and raise their eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“Why are you in such a panic?!”</strong> A Young Supreme, seeing
        his follower like this, yelled back in response.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Young Master Changge was injured while fighting with the Forbidden
          Demonic Arts Inheritor….”</strong
        >
        The young man’s voice trembled as his face paled. He shuddered as he
        spoke these words.
      </p>
      <p>The news was so shocking that it was hard to believe!</p>
      <p>
        Even the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, the Young Asura
        who was said to be invincible among his peers, was injured when faced
        with the Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>For them, it was as if the sky had fallen.</p>
      <p><strong>“What?!”</strong></p>
      <p>
        The instant they heard this, everyone was dumbfounded, wondering if
        their ears had heard wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had encountered and fought with the Demonic Arts Inheritor,
        and he was even injured?
      </p>
      <p>Such news was simply too shocking.</p>
      <p>
        The cultivators who heard this had reactions ranging from disbelief, to
        shock, to being frozen in place.
      </p>
      <p>They couldn’t believe it.</p>
      <p>
        Chi Ling was the first to react as her cold and haughty face could not
        help but reveal her worry when she asked,
        <strong
          >“Is this matter true or not? Is Daoist Brother Changge
          alright?”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“I heard this news from the mouth of Young Master Changge’s
          followers, Young Master Changge is lightly injured, other than that
          there is nothing serious to worry about. Moreover, the Nine-Tailed
          Celestial Fox Family’s Holy Maiden, Yin Mei has also been saved by
          Young Master Changge from the clutches of the Demonic Arts
          Inheritors…”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>By now, the young man had also calmed down.</p>
      <p>He took a deep breath and then explained to everyone.</p>
      <p>It was natural, for the news truly was an unbelievable surprise.</p>
      <p>
        Everyone here was still searching for traces of the Forbidden Demonic
        Arts Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, Gu Changge not only found him, but he had even fought against
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“I’m glad everything’s okay.”</strong> When she heard the rest
        of the news, Chi Ling immediately breathed a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was most concerned that, because of Gu Changge’s immense strength,
        he would be targeted if he became weakened.
      </p>
      <p>Luckily, he was only lightly injured.</p>
      <p><i>‘The skills that Ye Ling hid were truly astonishing.’</i></p>
      <p>
        <i
          >‘It is no wonder that he faced the Heavenly God Realm and even God
          King Realm existences without fear.’</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>When she thought of this, Chi Ling’s face became slightly bitter.</p>
      <p>
        But if even Gu Changge was injured at Ye Ling’s hands, then what would
        happen if they were to meet him?
      </p>
      <p><i>‘I’m afraid it would be a death sentence.’</i></p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“It seems we were right, Daoist Brother Changge has truly used us as
          a diversion to force Ye Ling to show himself, but it seems even he
          underestimated Ye Ling’s strength…”</strong
        >
        Ye Langtian sighed.
      </p>
      <p>
        From his point of view, Ye Ling had many hidden cards to play, so it was
        only reasonable that even a strong man like Gu Changge could be injured.
      </p>
      <p><strong>“What about Ye Ling?”</strong> Wang Wushuang inquired.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Ye Ling is said to have fled after using his most powerful hidden
          technique, though he was gravely injured by Young Master Changge, and
          is now missing…”</strong
        >
        the young man who spoke earlier replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“He escaped… What a disaster! Even Gu Changge wasn’t able to kill
          him.”</strong
        >
        Wang Wushuang shook his head.
      </p>
      <p>However at this moment, they were unable to criticize Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        In order to take down the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor, he had made
        plans, and now he was even injured.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only person who could take the blame was the Forbidden Demonic Arts’
        Inheritor, a cunning foe with plenty of tricks up his sleeve.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“The Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family’s Holy Maiden, Yin Mei, is said
          to have butted heads with Young Master Changge. I didn’t expect for
          him to be the one to eventually save her from the clutches of the
          Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor…”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Although Young Master Changge has a bad reputation, Holy Maiden, Yin
          Mei, is his junior sister after all, so he couldn’t possibly neglect
          her to the point of death at such a crucial time. Young Master
          Changge’s heart is truly admirable.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the rest of the Young Supremes present at the ruins
        began to speak up one after the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        They all expressed their views on the matter alongside their admiration
        for Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, they had no such feelings for Gu Changge in the
        past. But after having rescued his junior sister from the hands of the
        Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritor….
      </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, the recent series of events have put them to shame as
        they too began to admire him.
      </p>
      <p>He was a Young Asura and for good reason.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Yes! I always thought that Young Master Changge was a strong and
          domineering person, but I never thought that there was such a gentle
          side to him. At this time, I presume that Holy Maiden, Yin Mei, would
          be very touched!”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p><strong>“After all, it’s a hero saving a beauty!”</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“I’m a bit jealous of the Holy Maiden… I can’t help but wonder if the
          Young Master Changge will come to my rescue if I fall into the
          clutches of the Demonic Arts Inheritor?”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Many young geniuses of the fairer s*x had also spoken up, their eyes
        full of admiration and wonder.
      </p>
      <p>To put it simply, they were enamoured by Gu Changge’s actions.</p>
      <p>
        He stood up and took it upon himself to attract the hatred of the
        Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor, something that had been terrorizing
        their peers.
      </p>
      <p>Such righteousness made their hearts flutter.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >“Where is Daoist Brother Changge now? It seems we need to find him
          again if we want to find the whole truth.”</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        After a moment’s deliberation, Ye Langtian and the others decided to go
        to Gu Changge to find out the details of what had actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they too were to encounter Ye Ling in the future, it was best for
        them to be prepared.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        One by one, divine rainbows left the place and headed for the former
        gathering place in the valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the news of Gu Changge’s encounter with the Forbidden Demonic
        Arts’ Inheritor spread throughout the Ancient Immortal Continent as if
        it had grown wings, causing an uproar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the Young Supremes who had not been involved in this matter were
        stunned, astounded by the news!

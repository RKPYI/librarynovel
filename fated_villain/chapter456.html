          to draw their enemies into a trap.</span

          side. So, we shouldn&#8217;t worry too much about Sky Deer

          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. At the same time, they were also

          was blessed with an immortal cultivation technique that turned him

          was a wondrous place formed by the chaotic disorder of space, clashing
          of Principles, and the intertwining of Great Dao, appearing after the

          walking. The city was incomparably spacious and its streets knew no

          couldn&#8217;t even rescue his beloved. At the same time, he was even
          more revolted by Gu Changge&#8217;s slyness as the latter did not keep
          his promise. Gu Changge promised that he would let everyone go, yet he

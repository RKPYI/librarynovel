          >*Boom!* Blood rained down as a horrifying sound rang out. Gu Changge
          sat in the depths of the universe; when he opened his mouth and
          roared, Sources rushed towards him like stars. A cocoon seemingly
          appeared around him, and soon a slender figure approached from a
          distance who didn&#8217;t look surprised by the proceedings.</span

          are naturally inferior to the Nine Mountain Elders.&#8221; The Sky
          Deer Goddess&#8217;s eyes flickered for a moment, sensing that his
          strength was much greater than before. At this rate, he could cross
          the threshold of the Nirvana Realm very soon. It was no surprise that
          the other members of the younger generation were all left in the
          dust.</span

          nodded, a strange look on his face, before raising a hand and hitting
          himself once. A speck of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth
          immediately and his aura wilted as if greatly injured.

          attack at any moment.&#8221; She came back to herself and reported the
          situation with a conflicted expression. She was clearly the one who
          had stabilised it.</span

          escape.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded before sighing regretfully. The Sky
          Deer Goddess&#8217;s eyes glittered as she stared at him, suddenly
          understanding what he was planning to do.

          >It was shocking enough that he had fought bravely against three True
          Daoists, and he would certainly be doubted if he was only slightly
          injured. Once his secret identity was exposed, he might end up being
          the greatest enemy of the world in a blink of an eye. There probably
          wouldn&#8217;t be a place for him in the Upper Realm. Nevertheless, it
          didn&#8217;t look like the first time he was in such a
          situation.</span

          >&#8220;Of course not.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and smoothed his hand
          along her face before reaching her pale neck. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
          difficult for me to strangle you to death after all.&#8221;</span

          armies were fighting. The void shook and a light shone brightly, the
          aura thick as if a tunnel had been built. It was like there was a
          terrifying being ready to break the barrier and rush out.</span

          their way here!&#8221; Several powerful beings of the Upper Realm
          immediately sensed the vibration and became shocked yet
          confused.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!* Beams of terrifying divine sense shot forward to collide with
          the void, each one as sharp as a heavenly blade. This was the pure
          force of their Primordial Spirit, which could easily crush anything
          due to its Sacred Emperor Realm might.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Loud booms could be heard which sounded like stars exploding and
          something collapsed in front of them. It was like the world had
          collapsed as the ground shook and Chaos Qi stirred violently.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Ahhh!&#8221; There was a sudden cry as a member of an Ancient
          Royal Family became stricken with fear, feeling like his body was
          about to explode. All light was extinguished and even the sounds of
          killing disappeared as a shiny golden sword sliced downwards
          decisively. With a loud pop, the cry was cut off as the Sacred Emperor
          expert from the Ancient Royal Family was savagely killed.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The void cracked open to reveal a Space Tunnel which had been formed.
          An indistinct figure emerged, looking tired and old despite appearing
          physically youthful. A white mist hovered around him and his eyes
          glittered like stars as he stood in the void. The enormous Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains Army followed behind him; it was clear that
          they knew their compatriots had been surrounded and so quickly sent
          aid to the space coordinates of the Aether Abyss.</span

          Ten Domains became stunned. They all called out loudly in surprise and
          excitement as they recognised who had arrived.</span

          come to assist us. That&#8217;s great. We managed to fight until help
          arrived!&#8221; a cultivator exclaimed hopefully, suddenly seeing hope
          in such a desperate situation.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were the collective names of the
          Eight Wastes and the Ten Domains, with the Great Cloud Domain as one
          of the Ten Domains. Even Ancient Clans had to respect the laws of the
          Domain they were in and every Domain Ruler held the highest status in
          their domain.</span

          >This man who had suddenly appeared was the Young Master of the Great
          Cloud Domain, Zhao Yunze, who was frighteningly strong. He had been
          the best among his peers 60 million years ago and his strength had
          already reached the Quasi-Nirvana Realm for a long time. However, his
          current strength was unknown.</span

          pursuers.&#8221; Zhao Yunze looked young and courageous, his hair
          glowing as well. The first thing he did was to raise his hand and
          wield a terrifying sword to stop any Upper Realm soldiers who tried to
          pursue them. Every movement of the blade contained a power too
          powerful to behold, seemingly splitting the world apart as he used it
          to force the retreat of the Upper Realm soldiers all on his own.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          himself! He stood tall and proud, surrounded by mist while his eyes
          were calm and wise. There was an unrivalled air to him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          fearful at the sight of the sword, as they were far inferior compared

          progress of numerous Upper Realm Soldiers. He is far too
          strong!&#8221; The sight excited the beings of the Eight Wastelands
          and Ten Domains. Even members of the young generation like Xuan Tuan
          looked at him with respect. After all, he was the best among his peers
          60 million years ago, far surpassing everyone else in his abilities.
          His current strength could not be estimated since he had displayed
          unrivalled power since his appearance.</span

          high since many of the soldiers recognised him. However, he seems to

          strong army?&#8221;

          the world. They had lost to the three True Daoists of the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains, but they didn&#8217;t fear Zhao Yunze at

          retribution from the many crimes they have done.&#8221; Zhao
          Yunze&#8217;s expression was frigid and it intensified after seeing
          the terrible conditions the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains Army was
          in.

          >More Upper Realm soldiers were appearing from deep within the Aether
          Abyss, planning to kill them once and for all. This meant that there
          was a traitor in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains Army, and one in
          a high position at that, as they would know more about the change in
          routes within the Aether Abyss. Otherwise, the Upper Realm
          couldn&#8217;t have entered the Abyss in such a short time.

          this was dealt with, but the most pressing issue at hand was to save
          all they could and bring them back to the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. At that thought, Zhao Yunze glanced around at the soldiers
          and assigned his followers to take members of the younger generation
          away first.</span

          was penetrated over and over until it resembled a sieve with how many
          cracks it sustained. The ancient beings of the Upper Realm displayed
          their abilities in unison to fight Zhao Yunze and everything blurred
          after a bright flash of light. Dao was evolving and Principles
          collided with each other, all of this accompanied by rumbling sounds.

          returned sometime before. Everything would have ended if Zhao Yunze
          hadn&#8217;t arrived suddenly. Just like when Gu Changge had arranged
          a backup plan which surprised the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains,
          Zhao Yunze&#8217;s reinforcements were out of the blue and shocked all

          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains so they could surprise the Upper
          Realm army. However, it was because of Gu Changge&#8217;s scheme that

          While he currently has the upper hand in this situation, there might
          be some danger in the long run. He&#8217;s still too young and with
          some time, he may be able to fight a True Daoist.&#8221;

          was not confident in Gu Changge&#8217;s abilities, but these three
          True Daoists were nearly unrivalled in the Upper Realm. She
          wasn&#8217;t sure how Gu Changge had destroyed the Nine Great
          Mountains, but Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t have done it alone without
          the help of the Gu Family Ancestor, now that she thought about it.
          This battle wouldn&#8217;t be an easy one for him.</span

          have deduced the intentions of the other side—nearly everyone was

          and fluttered in the air. Each strand of his hair transformed into
          countless shiny and sharp Sword Qi which shot in every direction. It
          was like millions of Sword Qi were slicing through the air, each one
          equally terrifying, and no one at a level lower than the Quasi-Nirvana
          Realm could stand it. This was a mysterious technique of his which
          exhausted a lot of his Source, but he didn&#8217;t care about that
          now.</span

          attack. Besides, the Sword Qi was not just shooting towards them but
          also everyone in the ancient battleship behind him. Zhao Yunze&#8217;s
          thought process was simple—he wasn&#8217;t just going to retreat just
          like that, but also use this attack to kill the soldiers of the Upper
          Realm.</span

          Zhao Yunze was not merely a Quasi-Nirvana being but one close to being
          True Daoist. They were only Dharma Bodies and had already been
          exhausted from the fight with the True Daoists. They could not return
          to their peak condition so soon.</span

          Lady, and the Sky Demon Sovereign looked somewhat cold as they
          realised Zhao Yunze&#8217;s intention. They all had a protective
          amulet before coming here due to their statuses, and even if they
          wouldn&#8217;t be endangered much from the attack, it was painful to
          lose such a useful artifact, which cannot be reused.</span

          face as she pulled out a jade amulet. Before she could activate it, a
          stocky dark figure crossed the void to shield her like a War God. It
          wielded a black spear which destroyed the approaching Sword Qi,
          exuding a terrifying aura as it stood in front of her.</span

          and protect her now. It didn&#8217;t look like a Quasi-Nirvana expert
          from the Gu Family and she felt confused since she had never seen such
          a figure before. However, she still sighed in relief and kept her jade
          amulet since it could block a Quasi-Nirvana level attack, making it
          highly valuable.</span

          their protective amulets which glowed brightly as they shielded the
          attack. They all looked embarrassing though, since they all flew
          backwards from the impact and coughed up blood.</span

          An Yan, the Princess of the Hidden An Clan, was one of those that got
          humiliated but still noticed the terrifying figure in front of Gu
          Xianer and froze. A feeling of envy immediately rose inside her.</span

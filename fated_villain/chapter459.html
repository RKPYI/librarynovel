          kind of energy ordinary Cultivators could dwell in. Even Sacred
          Emperor Realm experts, who had cultivated for tens of millions of

          the Nine Wonders of the World. It is said that any living being that
          falls into the Demonic Domain will eventually lose their way. However,
          cultivators from the Morphing Demonic Domain have only been spotted a
          handful of times from ancient times to the present. I always thought
          that the Morphing Demonic Domain was a mysterious space from the

          when she spoke in a soft voice. As her expression changed slightly,
          she quickly calmed down when a sense of Zen and Buddha aura manifested
          from her body. She soon let out a sigh and began to chant an Ancient
          Scripture as a light surged from her face.</span

          skin. They were similar to ancient Immortal Scriptures that shone
          bright, or even Buddhist candlelights in the dark. It was a majestic
          treasure whose brilliance shouldn&#8217;t be underestimated. Even
          though it could drive away the grey fog, it seemed fairly useless and
          helpless now. Like a candle in the dark abyss, she only managed to
          illuminate a small area around her.</span

          cross-legged on the same spot. Every rune, each containing the supreme
          power of the gods, was imprinted in the void as they resisted the
          power.</span

          that she currently had no chance against Gu Changge. She had come to
          this realisation the moment he exposed his true identity. Gu
          Changge&#8217;s hidden abilities was beyond imagination, such that she
          could no longer understand him by common sense. Normal cultivators
          could never dream of being his equal.</span

          beams condensed in his palm and crushed forward as if they could cover
          the world. In the torrential grey fog, there were also black and
          white, which represented life and death, mixed in. As the black and
          white swept across, they turned into terrifyingly destructive
          millstones that rolled down from all directions.</span

          the ability to devour the strength, life, Source, and cultivation of
          those trapped inside. It wouldn&#8217;t be an overstatement to say
          that it was pervasive, and completely irresistible once trapped.</span

          didn&#8217;t know was that this was just an ability born from the
          Forbidden Demonic Arts. Moreover, the Morphing Demonic Domain
          displayed by the other Successors of Demonic Arts was only a
          prototype. It couldn&#8217;t even be compared with what Gu Changge

          momentum shook the sky. All the thick fog started devouring the Sky

          her into the abyss beyond redemption.

          Her complexion had turned slightly pale, but her expression was still
          calm. She was very confident in her Dao Heart as she had been
          cultivating for countless years. She knew that the world was
          ever-changing, and everything was merely passing clouds.</span

          definitely be in a life-and-death crisis. Furthermore, Gu Changge had
          never made the first move to attack from the beginning to now. All he

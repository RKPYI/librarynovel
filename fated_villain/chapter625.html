        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere before Ancient Mulberry City was deathly silent. </span><span id="more-33870"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were only bone shards mixed with blood showing what had happened. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Snow Sword Immortal watched on in shock as if she hadn&#8217;t come to terms with what happened. The Families of the city fell quiet due to their extreme fear, while the heads of each shivered uncontrollably as they looked at Gu Changge like he was some kind of  monster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What formidable power.] The eyes of Ah Qing, Princess Xuan Dea, and the rest were wide as they wondered if their eyes were tricking them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Star Sword Immortal might not be famous in the Profound Sword World, but he was still a legitimate Earth Sword Immortal and thus one of those who stood at the peak. How could he be killed with a mere strike from Gu Changge&#8217;s subordinates, which destroyed both his body and soul?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had never thought that the silent man beside Gu Changge was this terrifying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene was so astounding that everyone&#8217;s minds were blank and buzzed with static.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A physique exceeding the Earth Sword Immortal Realm. How is this possible? He did not even use his abilities…] Within the city, Lin En&#8217;s pupils contracted, being overwhelmed by intense shock. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His eyes were unique, so he could discern that the terrifying figure, which resembled a tower, had merely suppressed Star Sword Immortal by brute force before landing an infinitely heavy strike on the unprepared Sword Immortal. There was no chance of blocking it since it was like thousands of mountains falling on top of Star Sword Immortal. The force was extremely destructive. Yet, this was the horrifying truth, and Lin En felt that even his true body wouldn&#8217;t be able to withstand that sudden strike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin En could even see the grey cracks left behind in the void where the figure had stepped, which emitted Chaos Qi. Such a physique could only be described as monstrous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death of an Earth Sword Immortal caused shockwaves in Ancient Mulberry City. Everyone who had personally witnessed it was overwhelmingly terrified and felt as if the world was about to collapse. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To them, Earth Sword Immortals were the epitome of invincibility, yet one of them had been killed with a single punch from that Otherworldly Sky Demon&#8217;s subordinate. This was enough to make their worldview fall apart. Everyone felt a chill down their spine as they watched Gu Changge standing on the city walls, still calm and serene as ever. How could the death of an Earth Sword Immortal be like that of an ant that had been crushed?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think I may have worried too much&#8230;&#8221; Snow Sword Immortal took a deep breath to calm herself down before landing from the sky. While she regretted that Star Sword Immortal had died just like that, it had been his own doing and couldn&#8217;t be blamed on anyone else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He has a Force backing him, right?&#8221; Gu Changge asked while shifting his gaze leisurely from the city as if uninterested in the view.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Da was born from his True Blood, back when he was the Demon Lord. Thus, his physique wasn&#8217;t inferior to the average True Daoist. Besides. The Earth Sword Immortals of this world looked to only be at the Quasi-Nirvana Realm at the very most, so the difference in strength between both sides could be described as insurmountable. Thus, how could Star Sword Immortal ever fight against Ah Da?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He is from Star Sword Valley, but he acted stubbornly and thus his act had no connection to the Profound Sword World.&#8221; Snow Sword Immortal somehow sensed a chill rushing towards her face and her expression changed beneath her mask, but she braced herself instead. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hadn&#8217;t encountered such a feeling for a long time after reaching the Earth Sword Immortal Realm. She felt uncomfortable and fearful in front of Gu Changge, since the man gave her goosebumps. She had already tried to advise Star Sword Immortal against it, but he did not care and still attacked Gu Changge. The consequences of that action should be borne by Star Sword Immortal himself. Besides, she had some guesses as to why Gu Changge had asked the question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Star Sword Valley, huh?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s expression did not change as he continued smiling. &#8220;I have always been tolerant towards everything but if someone tried to attack me, I can&#8217;t just do nothing, right? Ah Da.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His smile disappeared at that point. &#8220;This Sect no longer needs to exist.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Master.&#8221; Ah Da&#8217;s expression remained cold as he obeyed the command, tearing apart the void before him with his hands before stepping through it. To him, killing the Star Sword Immortal was equivalent to crushing a bug and Star Sword Valley could be destroyed without much effort.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone quivered and turned pale with fear at the sight. They hadn&#8217;t expected that Gu Changge would want to exterminate Star Sword Valley due to a quarrel since that was a powerful Force, comparable to the Southern Light Empire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow Sword Immortal had the intention to stop them, but she could only sigh and remain silent. Star Sword Immortal was the strongest person from that Sect. His horrific death meant that its fate didn&#8217;t need any further thought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From another aspect, she now also understood something. To Gu Changge, their survival didn&#8217;t matter since the important thing to him was not obstructing or angering him. He wasn&#8217;t a kind person at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing, Princess Xuan Dea, and the rest were also silent. None of them was stupid enough to advise him against it. He might be usually genial and polite towards them, but that didn&#8217;t mean that they held much importance to him. In fact, for someone to hold such importance, how could they be that simple?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since you are all here already, why are you rushing to leave?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze landed on a certain spot, his expression unchanging.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow Sword Immortal and the others were surprised and looked towards the place he was talking about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* In the next instant, the entire world shook violently as an overwhelmingly frightening energy spread. Gu Changge stretched out his hand to enclose something within the void, which caused the entire world to darken as all rays of light disappeared and plunged it into eternal darkness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An enormous terrifying hand seemed to stretch from within a black hole, radiating a powerful energy which shook the whole world and caused widespread destruction. The void collapsed immediately, where numerous cracks appeared and caused it to shatter to nothingness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Is this the apocalypse?&#8221; Countless were shaken by this and were prepared to prostrate themselves towards the source of such power. The inhabitants of Ancient Mulberry City felt this most acutely. It felt like the apocalypse had arrived since they were suffocating and about to fall apart, both body and soul, from the energy emitted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was struck with fear, even the Snow Sword Immortal’s soul was quivering. Her expression was more serious than it ever had been since she now sensed how formidable Gu Changge was. Even with the World Principles suppressing him, he could mow down everything with just one hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aaaggghhhh!!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The painful sounds of bones cracking and screaming rang through the air as a spot in the void collapsed and blood seeped from it. Several figures concealed within were all revealed. Though, they all looked extremely pitiful. They couldn&#8217;t move after being grabbed by a terrifying black hand and were trapped in its palm with fearful and desperate expressions. Their bones were cracking apart and their bodies were collapsing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s Heavenly Monster Grandma, Dust Sword Immortal, and an unrivalled old Emperor of a Dynasty.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people of Ancient Mulberry City shivered with fear when they recognised the captives. These were all undeniably beings of the Earth Sword Immortal Realm, especially the old woman with her hair down. She was the famous Heavenly Monster Grandma, who had the Heavenly Monster Sword Spirit and had already built a famous reputation in Profound Sword World 4000 years ago. The Star Sword Immortal was incomparable to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was now in a bad state and was about to be destroyed, her entire body covered with blood while her bones cracked and collapsed into themselves. The other two Earth Sword Immortals looked terrible as well, unable to move due to the death grip on them, which was close to crushing them into blood mists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The giant black hand blocked out everything like the hand of god and exuded energy which made everyone desperate as their hearts froze. It caught the three Earth Sword Immortals like they were worms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They may have followed the Sword Immortal Order and came with Star Sword Immortal, but they tried to retreat when they noticed things weren&#8217;t right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow Sword Immortal frowned at the sight of her familiar acquaintance, the Heavenly Monster Grandma. The two of them had clashed before when they were still evenly matched. However, once she finally cultivated to obtain her Ice and Snow Domain, the Heavenly Monster Grandma could no longer beat her. As such, she disappeared without a trace. She hadn&#8217;t expected the Heavenly Monster Grandma to show up like this, and felt extremely conflicted at the sight of her pathetic appearance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those within Ancient Mulberry City were shaking at the sight as well. Under normal circumstances, Earth Sword Immortals stood at a peak, where everyone could only worship and look up to them, but now they were begging wretchedly for mercy since they have been reduced to flesh on the chopping board and couldn&#8217;t control their fate. Such a great contrast immensely shocked everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You dream of killing me like this?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t change as he stood on the city walls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Help!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were merely following the Sword Immortal Order from the Old Sword Immortal of the Shu Sect. This has nothing to do with us! We were only following orders and don’t have any ulterior motives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavenly Monster Grandma and the rest looked terrified and pitiful, bloody emanating from their body as their bones cracked. They were about to be crushed to ashes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had sensed something wrong after seeing Star Sword Immortal die and tried to flee, but a terrifying force as powerful as the world, enclosed them and sealed away every centimetre of space. A hand big enough to block out the sky then stretched towards them, which seemed to contain the universes. They couldn&#8217;t escape at all and felt weak and desperate for the first time since becoming an Earth Sword Immortal. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a force they could never fight against, yet they had thought pathetically that they could kill Gu Changge due to their sheer number. They thought once they were done, this would force back the Otherworldly Sky Demons. However, now, they realised that this was all just a daydream. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Old Sword Immortal of the Shu Sect? The Sword Immortal Order? It&#8217;s fine; he will be accompanying all of you soon enough.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled with an unflinching gaze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please have mercy!&#8221; Sensing his murderous aura, the Heavenly Monster Grandma and the other Earth Sword Immortals looked desperate and horrified. They had ruled over everything all their lives yet had to die in such a pathetic way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Ancient Mulberry City, everyone shivered with fear as they sensed that something momentous would occur today, which would shake the entire Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next moment, Gu Changge shook his head slightly, and the giant black hand within the void abruptly clenched tight. Infinite rays of light seemed to shimmer before exploding and transforming into clouds of blood.</span></p>

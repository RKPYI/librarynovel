        <p>“They’ve already gone, should we leave too?” Lin Wu, Lu Luo and the others waited for those from Supreme Cave
            Heave to enter the mist before appearing from the nearby forest. The one who spoke was a young man named Huo
            Rong. He had a head full of crimson hair akin to flames. Even his eyes were a brilliant red as he carried
            the blood of the ‘God of Fire’, burning like none other. <span id="more-30327"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No need to rush, the other party is cautious and will likely wait at the entrance for a while. It’s better
            for us to be more cautious. It’s not like they will find something immediately” Hearing this, Lin Wu shook
            his head and answered. He was unworried but still had a cautious expression. He could get to where he was
            today, other than the mysterious Martial Arts Space, due to how much more cautious he was compared to the
            average person. Therefore, he thought it was best if they waited a bit longer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If that’s the case, we’ll listen to Brother Lin Wu.” Goddess Lu Luo smiled and said. Her figure was tall and
            slender and she wore a long, light green skirt and appeared very beautiful and moving. Her pupils were a
            light black color and she gave off a clean and fresh aura.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hearing her words, the rest of the young prodigies nodded their heads. Without saying anything more, they
            continued to hide in the same spot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A few Elders looked at Lin Wu with approval. In this situation, he was not impulsive at all, he had foresight
            and could maintain a levelled head. In the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, such a person was rare among
            the younger generation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [As long as Lin Wu doesn’t fall, my Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains will stand at the peak and be unrivaled.]
        They sighed in their hearts but then saw the horizon in the distance. Something huge like a mountain was falling
        rapidly towards this place like a meteor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“What is that?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The group of Elders wrinkled their brows. First they were stunned, then shocked; there was a terrifying
            pressure and it engulfed the sky as it headed towards them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fear struck everyone and they couldn’t help trembling. The youths&#8217; faces were even paler, they nearly
            stopped breathing and their legs went soft.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fortunately, an Elder raised his sleeve, runes appeared and blocked them from the immense pressure. Otherwise
            they wouldn’t have been able to stop themselves from prostrating in that direction. Although the immense
            pressure came from afar, it was enough to cause their skins to break out in goosebumps.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“A Scared Emperor Realm Beast…” Lin Wu’s face sank and he stuttered. “A Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon, what
            is such a terrifying beast doing here?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Extremely shocked, they carefully hid their presence, not daring to reveal themselves and draw any attention.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There seems to be someone sitting on top of the Black Flood Dragon…” As Lu Luo said this, her eyes glowing
            with divine light, and she said gravely, “I can’t see this other’s appearance clearly, but his terrifying
            presence isn’t something we can go up against.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lin Wu nodded, a strange feeling forming in his heart. That blurry figure seemed to have a lot of karma with
            him, although he had never seen the other person’s true appearance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*Buzz!* Streaks of mysterious runes appeared before Lin Wu’s eyes, seeming to form divine Principles. He
            activated his Heaven Peering Eye, wanting to see who the figure sitting on the Three-Headed Black Flood
            Dragon was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, beside a blurry phantom, nothing could be seen clearly. It was like the other person resided in
            another realm and was the only god of heaven and earth. He was powerful, mysterious, and unfathomable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He wanted to see more clearly, but he couldn’t help groaning as he received backlash. There was shooting pain
            in his eyes and blood flowed from them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Lin Wu…” Lu Luo gave him a worried look.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lin Wu waved his hand to console her, “I’m fine.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“What a frightful person, he is who knows how many times stronger than the other group of people who entered
            first. If this old man isn’t mistaken, the Three-Headed Black Flood Gradon is a tyrant of the Boundary
            Marker Sea. To think it’s being used as a steed right now.” An Elder said with a heavy tone. His heart rang
            in alarm and the feeling of apprehension reached its peak.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The rest also had an incredulous expression on their faces. They kept running into terrifying characters here
            one time after another. This person’s strength had definitely reached above the Scared King Realm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I feel like that person has some kind of great karma with me.” Lin Wu said gravely, his heart heavy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lu Luo knew what he was worrying about and comfortingly said, “Don’t think so much. We are still young. One
            day, we’ll also catch up to an existence like that. But it seems like we need to be even more careful.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before their eyes, the terrifying figure sitting cross-legged on the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon quickly
            vanished into the misty space.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps the other had noticed them? Or perhaps he didn’t care about them at all, viewing them as a group of
            ants?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I contacted my Grand Uncle, he’s nearby. We’ll go in first. If we encounter any danger, he can come and help
            us.” A young man suddenly spoke up, his expression heavy. He felt a type of fear that made him feel
            extremely unwell. He even wanted to call quits on the entire thing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The others nodded after hearing this and began thinking of ways to escape. No matter what, after seeing that
            terrifying figure, no one could remain calm. That person was clearly a terrifying figure from the Upper
            Realm and had come here for some reason. If they met the other party again, they would be out of luck. The
            prospect of escaping was slim.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An Elder with a grave expression, after feeling the terrifying aura disappear, finally dared to come out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Following him, Lin Wu, Lu Luo and the others carefully approached the misty space and after a bout of
            vertigo, their figures disappeared within it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I have a leaf from the mysterious gourd that the Spirit Gourd Master had. As long as I follow that direction
            it points towards, we can quickly find the Spirit Gourd Master’s resting place.” After they landed, Lin Wu
            saw an open vast forest ahead and his heart gradually calmed down. [Though they might be stronger than me,
            they don’t know the location of the treasure. As long as I seize the chance and obtain the Spirit Gourd
            Master’s inheritance, we can immediately leave this place. By that time, who could possibly find me?]
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Young Master, are you not going to deal with those ants?” Gu Change sat on the back of the Three-Headed
            Black Flood Dragon, his robe swayed with the wind as he stood motionless. From him, there was Divinity and
            Chaos Qi being mixed together in a mysterious way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hearing the words of the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon, he opened his eyes and lightly said, “Since they’re
            ants, why should I pay attention to them?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Indeed.” The Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon lowered his head after hearing this and continued towards the
            vast forest before them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although that group had hid themselves quite well, they couldn’t possibly hide from the Three-Headed Black
            Flood Dragon, who had a superior perception. Naturally, it was even more impossible to hide from Gu Changge.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, since Gu Changge ignored them, the Flood Dragon naturally wouldn’t overstep to care about a trivial
            matter like this.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this place, the mountain range stretched on uninterrupted, as ancient trees were lush. Every divine
            mountain was majestic without comparison, covered with sunlight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were many powerful beasts occupying their own territory. However, feeling the aura of the Three-Headed
            Black Flood Dragon, they all ran away in a panic and dared not approach. After all, seeking opportunity and
            avoiding calamity, such was the nature of these beasts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the distance, colourful celestial mist flowed. It was hard to tell this was a space created after a
            battle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This so-called Void Realm was a small realm without a definite location and was hidden within the void,
            making it very difficult to find. Such a place was normally desolate, rarely containing any life, since they
            were all wiped out from the battle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [The Fortuitous One from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains has appeared, isn’t this what they call rushing
        towards destruction at the face of death? Well, since both Fortuitous Ones came to this place, this will be
        interesting.] Gu Changge eyes swept over the place before him as the corner of his mouth revealed a faint smile.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before coming to this place, he only wanted to finish off Chu Hao. However, he took a look just now and there
            was something else that caught his interest. Besides Chu Hao, there turned out to be another Fortuitous One.
            His Fortuity was blue as well so, he must not be that simple.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For Gu Changge, this was an unexpected surprise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, he didn’t alarm the two. Now, he only wanted to know what pleasant surprise they could bring him. If
            he took them down just like that, it would be too boring. After all, each Fortuitous One, could play the
            role as treasure detecting mice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [In this spacious Void Realm, it appears that there are supposedly many good things hidden. Between the mountain
        ridges, there are many Heavenly Herbs. They are those that are hard to find in the outside world. They are
        ancient as well. But, I don’t really need them. Still, from this, I can tell this is most likely the first time
        outsiders had come in to interrupt the peace here.]
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Afterward, Gu Changge followed followed the aura left by Ah Da.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Chu Hao failed to notice that among the people he brought, there was an unfamiliar face mixed in. With Ah
            Da’s cultivation level, unless he met a True Daoist, he wouldn’t be discovered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this moment, there was a loud rumble from the distance, like a big chuck of the mountain range had
            collapsed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dust flew in the air and parts of the mountain ranges collapsed with a loud sound. They soon revealed a
            greenish blue lake that was vast and boundless, which sparkled under the sunlight. In the deep part of the
            lake, it had brilliant colors from the sunlight and an abundance of Divinity, as if a treasure was about to
            appear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The dense aura swept over all directions and crimson light shot up to the sky, alarming the beasts in the
            surroundings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Black and white weaving together could faintly be seen, just like a pair of black and white fish Dao Diagram.
            They looked like heavenly curtains manifesting in the sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dao energy tangled together and transformed, as if containing a thousand secrets of the world. One gave birth
            to two, two gave birth to three, and three gave rise to a myriad of creatures.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a shocking sight, and under the illumination of the black and white dao diagram, a passageway appeared
            in the lake. Celestial Mist filled the air and a light shot up to the sky with unparalleled resplendence, as
            if it was a place of legend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, other than the radiance filling the place, there was also a fearsome murderous aura. A beast with
            eyes full of greed rushed over, trying to snatch the Supreme Dao Diagram.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, a terrifying blade aura cut through it, turning it to bloody mist.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Its bones and blood were scattered, causing splashes, making a frightful sight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was not done by the formation, rather it was the Divinity accumulated by the black and white Dao
            Diagram.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dense concentrations of runes and the blade aura cut down swifty. Even if it were a large and
            terrifying beast, it would be mutilated to pieces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Under the Dao Diagram, there also stood several figures exuding strong auras. The person leading them was Chu
            Hao, who was looking excited. Behind Chu Hao, where those from Supreme Cave Heaven, looking around
            vigilantly, on guard against creatures that might rush over.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The Supreme Dao Diagram…is right before me.” Chu Hao couldn’t hide the excitement in his eyes. As he stood
            there, his entire body glowed as he recited an ancient scripture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shining symbols appeared one by one and wove together incessantly, trying to calm the black and white Dao
            Diagram in the air. This was Supreme Cave Heaven’s Supreme Dao Diagram. It was lost in this place, and they
            came here to awaken it using a secret technique.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was no doubt the Supreme Dao Diagram held a mysterious power. Even before it awakened, just from the
            aura it exuded, it could kill any creature that approached it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their Ancestor from the past failed to completely comprehend the Supreme Dao Daoist in its entirety but still
            gained power to move around the world unhindered. However, in the end, that Ancestor arrived in this world
            and met with a difficult opponent, dying after exhausting all his strength, leaving behind the Supreme Dao
            Diagram here.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reason the Supreme Dao Diagram had been low-key to the world in these years was because it had been lost.
            It was said that the Supreme Dao Diagram was an innate treasure that contained unfathomable secrets. During
            the ancient era, an Immortal once came to the Supreme Heaven Cave to borrow the diagram and attempt to
            comprehend its complexity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It has slept here for many years. So, when being awakened today, the Supreme Dao Diagram was in a very
            unstable state.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The scenery was transforming around the Supreme Dao Diagram. Mountains, rivers, rass, trees, and the stars
            turned into blades. They lined across the sky and rushed down. Under such a terrifying aura, even a Scared
            Emperor Realm expert would panic. They would not dare to approach at will.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Chu Hao didn’t expect that the current Supreme Dao Diagram didn’t have the slightest response to their Sect’s
            scriptures.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Seems like we can only use the other methods. Let’s first make contact with the Supreme Dao diagram. Then,
            we’ll think of ways to subdue it. I will definitely obtain it at all costs.” Chu Hao’s expression was
            solemn. He turned into a divine rainbow and rushed towards the passageways over the lake where the Supreme
            Dao Diagram had appeared moments ago.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was the place where the Supreme Dao Diagram had remained dormant all these years. Today, it was abruptly
            awakened by people with a secret technique and it killed any beast that tried to approach it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*Bang!* The Supreme Dao Diagram trembled and released a terrifying blast of energy, within which there were
            terrifying scenes of moons being destroyed and stars being sunk.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Chu Hao’s expression was grave, bright runes surfaced on his body, and he used all his might to subdue it. At
            the same time he summoned an artifact from Supreme Heaven Cave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Grand Furnace!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moment it opened, its lid flew into the sky and it released the might of the sun. The blue flames inside
            contained peerless destructive power. It seemed capable of refining anything.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moment the furnace appeared, it floated above Chu Hao’s head and fended off the swords from the Supreme
            Dao Diagram. Meanwhile, the three legs of the furnace glowed as It formed a hazy shape of a pill as it
            swallowed the impact.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It had to be said, it was a terrifying defensive magical artifact. Its grade was unclear, but it had to be
            above Nirvana Grade.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this time, there was a burst of intense tremors as if stars were falling from the sky, bringing about
            boundless destruction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Supreme Dao Diagram trembled. Pieces of flying mountain range, wreckage left by stars and other evidence
            of destruction all disappeared completely. Heaven and earth were instantly covered in darkness, it was a
            world contained in the diagram.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Under such a circumstance, even those experts from Supreme Heaven Cave had a rapid change of expression and
            wanted to evacuate the place. They were clear on the Supreme Dao Diagram’s boundless divine might, Once one
            was sucked into it, it was hard to escape death and they would be refined alive.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The sky over there is black, did a rare treasure appear?” A voice came from the Eight Wastelands and Ten
            Domains group. Their faces were shocked as they looked at the scene not too far into the distance. They
            could feel the terrifying fluctuations from here.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like a black sun rising in the sky, it bobbed up and down. A wisp of its aura was enough to implode stars,
            flatten lands, change mountains, and alter the course of rivers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This is the supreme treasure of the expert who fought against the Spirit Gourd Master?” Lu Luo looked into
            the sky and muttered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A Dao Diagram with white and black interweaving could be seen. It floated in the horizon, as if wanting to
            suck in the entire heaven and earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The young men and women nodded their heads, their eyes all carrying a degree of greed and excitement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lin Wu turned to look at her and asked in a serious tone, “What are the chances of snatching it?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lu Luo went silent and shook her head, “Unless we can find the Spirit Gourd Master’s gourd, our chances are
            less than 10%.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“What a pity. If we could obtain such a treasure, it would definitely play an important role in the battle
            against the Upper Realm.” Lin Wu was somewhat unwilling in his heart. After all, this treasure was obviously
            higher than the Nirvana Grade.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It had been ownerless for so many years, hidden in this place. Now that such a treasure had appeared, how
            cou;d he possibly be willing to part with it and let the opportunity be taken by someone else?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The others remain silent as well. They naturally also knew what the appearance of this treasure meant. Back
            then, if it weren’t for Spirit Gourd Master making a move, evenmore experts from their sides would’ve died.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Any cultivator who knew of the battle from back would know how terrifying this treasure was. It could
            encompass heaven and earth, and could remake the universe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*Bang!*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this time, a heaven–shaking sound came from the lake in front of them. A black lance suddenly appeared,
            covered in black light, which could tear apart heaven and earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Many from Supreme Cave Heaven were caught off guard by this. Their faces were filled with terror, as it was
            filled with rage. Still, they exploded instantly, without any hope to resist.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Those who were spared broke out in cold sweat, seriously injured by this attack and fell into the lake.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A tall figure wearing a battle suit made from Hell’s Iron appeared from the void. With bright eyes, he stood
            there like an unrivalled war god. His whole body exudes a frightening and terrifying aura, further worsened
            by his absolute indifference.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Who are you!?&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Those that could still speak roared as their faces turned cold. They didn&#8217;t expect that there would be
            someone following them in the dark. Someone who could kill so many of them in just one move. Naturally, the
            presence of this man even made them tremble. After all, he was in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;My Master has an order for all of you to die.” Ah Da&#8217;s voice was filled with indifference. There
            was,no emotional fluctuations. Once he spoke, he simply stepped forward again to eliminate the rest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Master?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everyone from Supreme Cave Heaven was stunned. They did not expect that this man was a servant of someone.
            [Could his Master be the strongest being in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains?]
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Kill him! We cannot let him steal the Supreme Dao Diagram!&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him disturb Sect Master.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They quickly struck back. An old man roared and showed his Sacred Emperor Realm cultivation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Technically, there should not be anyone past this cultivation level crossing the Boundary Monument Sea,at
            this time. After all, the cost would have been too much. Thus, to see someone in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm,
            was naturally something they dreaded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Even so, this was crucial for them to avoid. Chu Hao was trying to refine the Supreme Dao Diagram. They could
            afford to let anyone interfere with this process.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the face of this attack, Ah Da remained indifferent. He just grasped the spear in his hand and slashing
            down. From it, runes flew out, flooding forward like the milky way. It caused everyone to cough up blood or
            be blasted apart.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Naturally, even if they feared his might, it does not mean everyone feared death. Instead of relenting, some
            pushed forward, conjuring various forbidden techniques to attack Ah Da again in an attempt to stop him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;How spiteful. To think you would choose this precise moment to mess with me.” Chu Hao&#8217;s
            expression was equally ugly. He was livid, showing excessive killing intent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Grand Furnace was floating above his head, resisting the might of the Supreme Dao Diagram. He kept
            chanting ancient scriptures, intending to calm himself down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How could he possibly allow someone to disrupt him during this crucial step?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;This man’s strength is unfathomable as well. But, it is obvious he is not from our world. When did he
            manage to come in?&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It is said that the other world is plagued with conflicts, with many infighting occurring between them.
            There are rumours that war never ends there. That it is difficult for them to have unity. Watching this show
            right now, It does indeed seem to be the case.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lin Wu, Lu Luo and others were hiding behind a mountain, watching the battle closely. Although they were very
            curious about who this figure in the dark battle suit was, the fight between the two parties was just in
            line with their wishes. Thus, they did not want to interfere</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the Upper Realm was more united, the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains’ defenses would have been broken
            long ago.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Compared to the Upper Realm, the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains had more unity. There was essentially no
            rivalry among its forces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*Roar! * At this time, there was a terrifying Flood Dragon roar sound from heaven and earth. A Three-Headed
            Black Flood Dragon descended from the sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His body was incomparably huge. If he was poured filled with molten magma, it would need as much as a
            mountain’s worth. His eyes are black and red, bloodthirsty and ferocious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moment the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon appeared, a claw headed towards Chu Hao. It was wrapped with
            black divine light, containing unparalleled power.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since Chu Hao was reciting ancient scripture, he did not expect to be attacked so suddenly. Caught off guard,
            he erupted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;You are courting death!&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Eyes cold, unable to attend to the Supreme Dao Diagram, he turned to look at the Flood Dragon behind him.
            With his fists wrapped in light, he struck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Naturally, he was strong. His fist wrapped in a gold hue, seemed like it was made of Immortal Gold. It even
            caused the space behind him to explode with a bang.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        [This man is so strong?] The Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon was shocked. He did not expect this man, whose
        cultivation level was subpar compared to him, to be this strong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This punch seemed to be able to cover the whole world. It was obviously an Immortal Fist Technique.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thus, the Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon became a lot more cautious when dealing with Chu Hao.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a moment, a dazzling brilliance erupted. The Grand Furnace above Chu Hao&#8217;s head continued to float
            as it resisted the might of the Supreme Dao Diagram.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the two fought, millions of stars seemed to have fallen all around, as though the vast and endless
            universe had started from them and had spread out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Isn’t this Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon the mounts of that person we saw back then?&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;If that’s the case, maybe that black figure is also a subordinate of that person?&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lin Wu, Lu Luo and the others were shocked as they saw this scene. They then looked around, trying to find
            the mysterious person from that time. After all, this person’s appearance caused far too much dread in them.
            Even if they were looking at the figure from a distance, it was a memory that would last a life-time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just as Ah Da was held back by those from Supreme Cave, Chu Hao was held back by the Three-Headed Black Flood
            Dragon, under the radiant lake, a young man appeared.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His white clothes were even purer than snow. Spotless and ethereal. There were no words to describe how
            divine he looked. He seems to be quietly comprehending the mysteries of this space.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He gave people an unparalleled sense of tranquillity as his whole body was shrouded in divine light tinged
            with Chaos Qi. Just by standing there, he seemed to be the centre of the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Supreme Dao Diagram floating up above seemed to be reacting to something. It soon made a trembling sound,
            as if it was about to fall into the lake.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;He’s over there!&#8221; Lin Wu&#8217;s voice sounded out, filled with unconcealable shock.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They saw sights of infinite different scenes from the Supreme Dao Diagram. It seemed as though it was going
            to be reactivated, and the mysteries of the Great Dao were being deciphered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was an incomparably shocking sight as the pillar of light caused the chimes of the Great Dao to sound out.
            At the same time, the Supreme Dao Diagram fell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soon, the pillar of light became dim. It was covered in chaos mist. Naturally, the young man at the bottom
            was also shrouded. However, this just made him seem even more ethereal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This scene was so similar that Lin Wu&#8217;s complexion changed drastically. He quickly turned pale as
            hatred surged as he was gnashing his teeth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;It’s him! He was the one who killed my brother!&#8221; Lin Wi’s voice contained deep-seated hatred, as
            his eyes turned red. The scene of his brother&#8217;s tragic death was still fresh in his mind. He was not
            there personally to witness it but it had been recorded by many people using photographic stones. This was
            how he could tell the young man in front of him was the one who killed his brother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;It’s him? The strongest in the young generation?&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;He&#8230; actually came here? Is this reality?&#8221;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Lu Luo and the rest heard what Lin Wu said, their complexions changed drastically. They all turned pale.

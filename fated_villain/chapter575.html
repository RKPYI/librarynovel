          puddle could pose a grave threat, capable of causing casualties.
          Throughout their journey, they encountered many challenges, each more
          menacing than the last. Many Forces also faced significant losses, and
          nearly even lost their young prodigies. Nevertheless, they considered

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At depths of the majestic Kun Mountain were shrouded in a mysterious
          mist that was filled with Chaos Qi. Hazy lights surrounded the
          mountain range, illuminating the sky above. At this moment, various
          Forces, which had taken different routes upon entering the mountain,
          had now converged at this very location.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          overwhelming aura. Many heard a deep rumble among the radiance from
          time to time, as if something was on the verge of awakening.</span

          present, there are no representatives of the Ji Family present. We
          should wait for their arrival before proceeding with any further
          discussions?” another Ancient Being from the Sky Demon Tower asked.
          Behind him stood the Sky Demon Sovereign and their entourage.</span

          >Meanwhile, cultivators from the Buddhist Mountain, the Immortal Wang
          Family, the Ancient Ye Family, and the Endless Fire Kingdom also
          showed up. Despite facing numerous obstacles and setbacks, they all
          managed to arrive at their destination unscathed. As they surveyed
          their surroundings, they marveled at the strange blood-red plants that
          thrived on steep cliffs among the mist.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The thick mist ahead made it challenging to determine the correct
          path forward. The peaks within a 5,000 kilometer radius pierced
          through the clouds, often shrouded in snowstorms, fog, or sandstorms,
          creating an otherworldly landscape. There seemed to be a unique domain
          here, which created a stark contrast between the climate here and the
          outside world.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Atop the peaks, some noticed Sky Pools among the wispy clouds and
          mist. They seemed to have existed since the dawn of time and
          occasionally released bursts of Chaos Qi.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“The peaks resembled the long spine of a dragon. Could there be
          something of great importance buried beneath it? Perhaps a Divine
          Source Master could discover a way to access it,” an old man with a
          profound knowledge of mountainous and riverine terrains said.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He held a compass that emitted a radiant light, illuminating the
          surroundings. The others nodded in agreement. From the moment of their
          arrival, they could hear faint echoes of dragon roars, as if there was
          a mighty dragon imprisoned deep within the earth.</span

          >“This is a dragon nirvana, rumored to be a dragon’s lair. It may be
          true that a True Dragon was born here in the past.” A voice suddenly
          rang out from the Ji Family group that had just arrived on the scene.
          It belonged to none other than Jiang Chen, who overheard the
          conversations of the Ancient Beings.
        </span>

          >He knew that in order to make an impact and increase his chances of
          survival, he needed to assert his significance. And so, he spoke up
          confidently, hoping to capture the attention of those around
          him.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The people who were studying the mountain range ahead were taken
          aback by the unexpected appearance of Jiang Chen. It was no secret
          that he was a Divine Source Master, and his presence in Kun Mountain
          held even greater significance than in the Divine Rock Conference. As
          a result, the gazes fixed on him burned with intensity.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“It seems like Gu Changge requested his presence on Kun Mountain
          after seizing him at the Starcatching Pavilion.” Many young prodigies
          noticed Gu Changge among the members of the Ji Family behind Jiang
          Chen, who was also gazing at the mountain range.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >From their perspective, Jiang Chen’s status as a Divine Source Master
          granted him access to a variety of mysterious techniques that could
          prove invaluable in the current situation at Kun Mountain.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Given his bad blood with Gu Changge, it was likely that he was
          coerced into working for the Ji Family.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All eyes were now on Jiang Chen, curious to find out how he would
          handle the situation. In Gu Changge’s presence, it seemed unlikely
          that they could get Jiang Chen work for them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Brother Jiang, what’s your perspective on this matter? Kun Mountain
          poses a great danger, and we have already suffered significant losses.
          Venturing further into its depths may result in even more casualties
          before we reach Senior Ji Shengchu.” A few Ancient Beings expressed
          their concerns, feeling somewhat helpless in the face of such
          adversity.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The rescue of Ji Shengchu was a significant occurrence in the Upper
          Realm, but they were not foolish enough to endanger their own lives.
          Even if they decided against further exploration of the mountain,
          their efforts thus far were commendable.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing this, Jiang Chen did not disappoint everyone and
          surveyed the surroundings before returning with an analysis. His words
          flowed eloquently as he spoke, “We stand upon the first ridge of the
          Dragon’s Spine Ridge, which is the gateway to the heart of Kun
          Mountain. The mist up ahead is none other than the dragon’s
          breath…”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“This place is extremely dangerous. Should we fail to steer clear of
          the dragon’s breath, it will reduce us to those unfortunate pools of
          pus and blood,” Jiang Chen warned, gesturing toward the dark blood
          pools emitting a putrid odor that was both repulsive and
          unsettling.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The expression on everyone’s face immediately changed. They could
          sense the overwhelming aura from the dark blood pools and none of them
          dared to get any closer. Even the Ancient Beings couldn’t help but
          feel a chill in their hearts because they could tell that the blood
          probably belonged to cultivators who were just as powerful as them
          when they were still alive.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Brother Jiang, do you have any idea how we can gain entry into it?”
          one of True Daoists asked. Despite his status, he appeared to be
          humble and friendly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Venturing into the depths of Kun Mountain to secure opportunities was
          a thrilling endeavor, separate from the noble mission of rescuing the
          Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family. Despite the perilous journey,
          everyone had reaped bountiful rewards and sensed that even greater
          prospects lay ahead. Surely, the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family had
          compelling reasons for coming to this place in the first place and
          ended up getting trapped here.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The heart of Kun Mountain presented great opportunities within, and
          after venturing this far, they were unwilling to give up so
          easily.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“As long as we avoid the dragon breath and keep a keen eye on the
          direction of the spine, we will be able to reach the heart of the
          mountain, but I will need the cooperation of the True Daoists in this,
          as the path ahead may be treacherous.” Upon hearing those words, Jiang
          Chen let out a sigh of relief. He intentionally put on a thoughtful
          expression as he silently communicated with the Artifact Spirit of the
          Celestial Boat of Creation in his mind for a moment before relaying
          the message.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          gazing at the mountain ridge.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite his composed exterior, Jiang Chen’s fists were tightly
          clenched inside his sleeves. In that moment, he saw a glimmer of hope
          for his own survival. If his plan succeeded, he could even utilize the
          natural terrain to bury Gu Changge and finally avenge his fallen
          comrades!</span

          the heart of Kun Mountain. Jiang Chen called upon the Artifact Spirit
          of the Celestial Boat of Creation to survey the place, and discovered
          a looming threat, potentially a True Dragon!</span

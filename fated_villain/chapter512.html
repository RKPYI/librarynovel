          >Twenty years ago, the Family of Protectors of Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains was ambushed by an unknown force. Their territory was
          turned into a desolate land in just one night and everything that
          stood was obliterated. The inextinguishable fires were still burning
          till this day. </span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Back then, the incident startled the entire Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. Alas, the clans went to investigate the cause, only to no
          avail. Eventually, the incident became an unsolved case as no one knew
          whether there was any survivor from the Family of Protectors.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was not until Gu Changge mentioned it that Yan Ming realised what
          was happening. Subconsciously, his body trembled and he was agitated
          when he remembered the Bone Ancestor&#8217;s reverence towards Gu
          Changge.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Was the Bone Clan perhaps the ones that attacked the Family of
          Protectors?] Yan Ming knew he should stop thinking about the matter
          any further. Although the Bone Clan comprised only a few people, the
          fact that they were able to conquer a whole Great Domain was a clear
          indication of how powerful the clan was. It would only take one
          formidable cultivator from the Bone Clan to effortlessly obliterate
          the entire Crimson South City.</span
        >
      </p>

          >&#8220;It appears she isn’t the sole survivor of the Family of
          Protectors.&#8221; Gu Changge gently shook his head as his dense,
          overwhelming divine sense flew out from his conscience and
          instantaneously engulfed the entire Crimson South City.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The only reason he didn&#8217;t act so flamboyantly earlier was
          because he might startle some other members of the Family of
          Protectors hiding in the dark, which would cause them to flee. Now
          that Luo Ying&#8217;s identity was exposed, the other members hiding
          in the dark would definitely emit some sort of disturbance in their
          auras, which Gu Changge would be able to detect.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, every living being in Crimson South City felt their
          souls trembling in fear, as though they were being watched by heaven,
          and their secrets were being spilled. Nevertheless, the aura persisted
          only for a short while before disappearing, yet they remained
          frightened as their backs were drenched in cold sweat.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221; Gu Changge withdrew his divine sense
          after detecting nothing else of interest.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes, Young Master Gu,&#8221; the Bone Ancestor deferentially
          replied.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that, before the fearful eyes of the crowd in the grand hall,
          the Bone Ancestor swung his hand forward and an alarming aura surged
          as he dragged Luo Ying over while taking Luo Feng away.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even if Luo Ying were to attempt to shake him off, given her current
          strength, she was nothing but an ant compared to the Bone
          Ancestor.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sadly, the crowd was so terrified that their souls were about to fall
          apart, so there was no way they would dare to stop him. All they could
          do was watch the golden fog emerging below Gu Changge and the
          rest&#8217;s feet before forming a path, which shattered the barriers
          of space as the group departed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, the traumatising atmosphere continued to haunt the crowd
          as no one dared to raise their head and take a look at the sky.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The faces of the Luo Clan members were extremely pale as many of them
          collapsed to the ground. No one could have foreseen the wedding
          banquet to turn out this way.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Anyone that dares to speak of what happened today shall taste
          the wrath of the Swallow Clan.&#8221; At that moment, Yan Ming, who
          was also soaked in cold sweat, waited until Gu Changge leave before
          coldly gazing at the crowd and threatened.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Fortunately, he was the only one who knew of the Bone
          Ancestor&#8217;s identity. Otherwise, he would be overwhelmed from
          worrying that Gu Changge might pin the blame of the Bone
          Ancestor&#8217;s identity being exposed on him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;O—Of course not!&#8221; Hearing that, the crowd in the grand
          hall hastily shook their heads, not daring to add any unnecessary
          remark.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yan Ming&#8217;s gaze mainly swept across those of the Luo Clan. He
          believes that Gu Changge refrained from annihilating the Luo Clan
          because they were nothing but insignificant bugs to him. However, he
          dared not to act rashly, worried that Gu Changge might have another
          motive.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Indubitably, as Yan Ming figured, Gu Changge chose not to exterminate
          the Luo Clan with a reason.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Essentially, he was still uncertain whether there were other remnants
          of the Family of Protectors. As long as the Luo Clan continued to
          live, the other remnants of the Family of Protectors would surely get
          to know that Ying Luo was in his grasp through the members of the Luo
          Clan.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Other than that, apart from Luo Ying, there was another member of the
          Family of Protectors that he knew of. It was Xiao Yang, the Fortuitous
          One, who was currently searching for the Supreme Mountain Elder along
          with Gu Wudi.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Supreme Mountain Elder would definitely bring Xiao Yang to his
          family. As such, whatever remains of Nine Great Mountains were walking
          right into their own trap.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that the Second Mountain Elder of Nine Great Mountains and Xiao
          Yang&#8217;s family were in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands, if Xiao Yang
          intended to rescue them, he would certainly ally with anyone he could
          reach. Naturally, Gu Changge could use that as bait and wipe out his
          prey all over the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Not long after Gu Changge, the Bone Ancestor, and the rest departed
          from Crimson South City, disturbances suddenly erupted in the sky. As
          the sky became hazy, the Supreme Mountain Elder, Xiao Yang, and Gu
          Wudi walked out from the void.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It appears we were too late.&#8221; The Supreme Mountain
          Elder&#8217;s swaying robe accentuated his extraordinary, though his
          eyes remained pitch black. As he gazed downward at Crimson South City,
          he shook his head and spoke. Although he was blind, his daunting
          strength allowed him to easily detect the lingering aura in the
          region.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On their way, he used Xiao Yang&#8217;s Blood Essence to deduce and
          located his family. They never stopped on their hasty way, worried
          that an accident might occur, but alas, they arrived at the sky of
          Crimson South City only to find themselves late.</span

          >&#8220;We&#8217;re too late?&#8221; Xiao Yang&#8217;s face subtly
          changed as his mind rang. He was somewhat dismayed.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[We hurried over right after we found Supreme Mountain Elder, yet we
          are still too late? Did I miss out on my family just like that…] He
          clenched his fists in restlessness.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Supreme Elder gently shook his head. With that, he cast his vast
          divine sense downwards. Given his cultivation level, he could easily
          sense which region contained unusual living beings.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Without breaking a sweat, the three of them found the Luo Clan
          Residence. There, the Supreme Elder detected an aura which caused the
          World Principles to be repressed. Evidently, the opponent hadn&#8217;t
          left for long.</span

          that cultivation realm…&#8221; The Supreme Mountain claimed as he
          shook his head. He could feel a relentlessness amid the lingering aura
          in the region.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Yang&#8217;s face blanched. Soon, he went to a member of the Luo
          Clan and heard about the incident that took place earlier, and after
          hearing about it, he was thoroughly stunned.</span

          might have been my sister… Damn it all!&#8221; Immense exasperation
          surged in Xiao Yang&#8217;s eyes. His body trembled in rage as he
          remembered the scene wherein his Eldest Senior Sister was slaughtered
          by Gu Changge in Nine Great Mountains. He never expected that Gu
          Changge would arrive at the city before he could and captured his
          sister.</span

          Elder wasn&#8217;t really bothered by Xiao Yang&#8217;s resentment,
          but after hearing about Luo Feng, he furrowed his brow as his heart

          Upper Realm and had integrated himself with the Tree of Epoch.

          way to rescue the Ancestor of Wind.</span

          referring to the Four Powerful War God Clans?&#8221; Xiao Yang was
          dazed for a moment before asking without hesitation. If he recalled
          correctly, before the Upper Realm Army broke through Sky Deer
          City&#8217;s defences, the True Daoists from the Four Great Clans were
          defeated in front of Sky Deer City right in front of countless. Such
          humiliation embarrassed him, leading him to lose his respect for the
          Four Great Clans. Thus, he sounded rather opposed to the idea.</span

          Ten Domains would be willing to help you?&#8221;</span

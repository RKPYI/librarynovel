          he going to explain this to them? These words had ended up backfiring

          had pondered the issue carefully but still couldn&#8217;t understand
          Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s motive. If it was related to the Successor
          of Demonic Arts, then that meant it was related to Gu Changge, the
          true Successor of Demonic Arts, as well and had no relation to his
          innocent self.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[I will make his actions public sooner or later. I will repay him in
          full for making me his scapegoat!] Ying Shuang clenched his fists as
          hatred flashed through his eyes before becoming concealed once again.
          Gu Changge was the man he hated the most!</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[I still have some business today. I wonder why Yin Mei invited me to
          the teahouse. Is it because of the recent occurrences?] Ying Shuang
          quickly put his thoughts to rest, smiling slightly as he rushed
          towards a teahouse. There were more important things waiting for him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yin Mei no longer chased him away after he refused to leave her
          alone, and he felt like it was an improvement even though she still
          looked at him with disdain and impatience. He would move her
          eventually as he had before, and the meeting later was proof of
          progress in their relationship.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, he arrived at the teahouse.</span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the first floor nearest to a window, a woman in white supported
          her chin with one hand as she looked out of it, looking thoughtful.
          She was flawlessly beautiful in a seductive way, with an elegant
          figure and attractive glowing skin.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yin Mei.&#8221; Ying Shuang opened his mouth helplessly,
          unable to calm down despite his best attempts because of her beauty.
          He had only been able to glance at her secretly when he was a horse
          feeder, while he could now look at her openly and proudly.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;re here?&#8221; Yin Mei frowned before saying
          lightly, &#8220;Do you know why I am meeting you?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Well…&#8221; He was stunned, not expecting her to be so direct
          upon seeing him, and shook her head. &#8220;No.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Really?&#8221; She intriguingly looked at him before drinking
          her tea.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I know what you&#8217;re interested in, though.&#8221; He
          didn&#8217;t know the reason behind her deciding to meet him, but he
          guessed that it was to scare him off so he would leave her alone. That
          was why he quickly resumed their conversation with another topic after
          she became quiet.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh? What&#8217;s that?&#8221; She looked at him with some
          confusion.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;About the Successor of Demonic Arts,&#8221; he answered. He
          planned to use this opportunity to talk to her about this since he
          might not be able to do so in the future.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;About the Successor of Demonic Arts?&#8221; Her expression
          shifted a little but she didn&#8217;t seem surprised. &#8220;How much
          do you know about the Successor of Demonic Arts?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;More than you do.&#8221; Ying Shuang smiled, enjoying the way
          she was looking straight at him. &#8220;I even know who the Real
          Successor of Demonic Arts is, but you may not believe me when I say
          it. Even so, I&#8217;ll have to say it for your own safety, but
          it&#8217;s up to you whether or not to believe me. After all, I will
          never harm you.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yin Mei let out a laugh before saying calmly, &#8220;Well then, tell
          me.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He smiled lightly and said slowly, &#8220;The true Successor of
          Demonic Arts is actually…Gu Changge.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He expected to see her expression becoming shocked, angry, or
          sceptical as well as her kicking him out of the teahouse. He
          hadn&#8217;t expected to see her looking calm and undisturbed, as if
          it didn&#8217;t surprise her at all.</span

      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you shocked? Or sceptical?&#8221; He was taken
          aback by her reaction as it was far too strange. Shouldn&#8217;t she
          be shocked and disbelieving? Why was she calmer than he was?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;m not shocked because I already know.&#8221; She
          nodded truthfully.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What? You know?&#8221; Ying Shuang froze at her words, feeling
          a terrifying chill run up his spine and into his skull. He might be
          infatuated with her but he wasn&#8217;t stupid.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So, why did you want to meet me?&#8221; His voice stuttered
          slightly although he tried to sound unruffled.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Because I wanted to see you.&#8221; Another voice came from
          behind him, sounding as if this person was smiling. The coldness
          rushed to the top of his skull and his limbs felt like they were
          freezing. He didn&#8217;t dare turn around at all.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Master, you&#8217;re here.&#8221; Yin Mei let out a smile as
          she got up to greet him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ying Shuang immediately realised what was happening, the blood
          draining from his face. He was rooted to the spot, as his confidence
          and assurance were replaced by indescribable fear. [So, she has been
          serving by Gu Changge side all this time. I’ve been kept in the dark
          and didn&#8217;t realise at all!]</span

          >&#8220;Should I call you Prince Ying? Or horse feeder? I can also
          call you scapegoat? Which do you prefer?&#8221; Gu Changge asked with
          interest, after walking past him carelessly to sit at the table and
          picking up a teacup to taste the piping hot tea.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You… you know everything?&#8221; Ying Shuang&#8217;s voice
          shook. He had tried to remain calm, yet the intense fear had
          overwhelmed him and made his legs feel weak.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Of course. I knew from the very beginning.&#8221; Gu Changge
          smiled lightly. &#8220;I feel guilty for framing you for this long.
          So, I’ve decided to set you free today.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He said that with ease, even picking up his tea and blowing away the
          steam. However, Ying Shuang was stunned, shivering in fear and unable
          to move. No matter how much he disguised himself, he was just a horse
          feeder, who had gotten lucky. What else could he do in this
          situation?</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Gu Changge, I&#8217;ll make you pay!&#8221; he angrily roared,
          refusing to surrender to Gu Changge when the other wanted to kill him.
          Anger and hatred burst out of him and a terrifying phantom appeared
          within his gaze. A multi-coloured light shot up into the sky as the
          power of the Sky Emperor Ying’s bloodline was triggered.</span

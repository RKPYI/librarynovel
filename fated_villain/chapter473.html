          foot stepped firmly on Xiao Yang&#8217;s face covered in aggrievance,
          anger, and blood. The latter looked extremely pathetic at this very
          moment. However, he couldn&#8217;t even lift his head because of the
          grave injury he had sustained. The rays of cyan light that flowed on
          the surface of his body looked as if they were about to spread under
          his skin.</span

          being oppressed. The surges of power feel as if they are about to gush
          out of me. Is Second Mountain Elder still not going to acknowledge
          that I&#8217;m better?] Gu Wudi looked like he was in a trance.
          However, he quickly collected himself, and after letting Xiao Yang go,
          he stepped over in wide strides as he sneered, &#8220;I remember
          everything that happened earlier clearly.&#8221;

          potential have now reached an unprecedented level. I never imagined
          that my physique could possess such terrifying abilities and divine
          abilities before this. I never even dared imagine anything like this.]
          Just the thought of that brought Gu Wudi&#8217;s respect and fear for
          Gu Changge to a whole new level.</span

          being reluctant, he didn&#8217;t dare go back on his words under
          everyone&#8217;s watchful eyes. He knew that the other Mountain Elders
          wouldn&#8217;t just stand by and ignore this matter. After all, this
          was a major event related to the handover of the Celestial Seal of the
          Nine Mountains, the most precious treasure of the Nine Great
          Mountains.</span

          to consider who his opponent is.&#8221;

          pleasant surprise!] The Third Mountain Elder glanced at the Second
          Mountain Elder smugly before he turned to look at Gu Wudi with great
          satisfaction. [I honestly did not expect Gu Wudi to surprise me so
          much. My heart dropped when Xiao Yang showed his powerful strength
          just now. I thought something would go wrong. But Gu Wudi&#8217;s
          retaliation shocked me as much as it delighted me. I never expected
          that my disciple had hidden strength more powerful than I thought.
          Today, he easily defeated Xiao Yang and won the right to guard the
          Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains in front of all the disciples and
          Mountain Elders. For the next tens of millions of years, the Celestial
          Seal of the Nine Mountains will be held by the Third Mountain.]</span

          those words to congratulate him. After all, whoever in the Nine Great
          Mountains held the Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains was equivalent

          naturally fall into the hands of Third Mountain Elder. In other words,
          Third Mountain Elder will be in charge of the entire Nine Great
          Mountains for tens of millions of years to come. Second Mountain

          huffed the Second Mountain Elder. His face was sour. Just as everyone
          said, he didn&#8217;t dare to go back on his words in front of all his
          disciples and the Mountain Elders, let alone break the rules of the

          stumbled over suddenly interrupted, &#8220;Hold on, Master!&#8221; It
          was hard to conceal the coldness, anger, and deeply hidden humiliation
          on his face. He should have defeated Gu Wudi today to wash away his
          shame and protect Chen Suyun&#8217;s reputation for the last
          time.</span

          front of all the disciples and Mountain Elders, and was even stepped
          under his foot. Not one who had ever suffered such humiliation, Xiao
          Yang only further blew his top. Furthermore, Xiao Yang was sure that
          the person who pulled that trick just now was not Gu Wudiâ€”it was Gu
          Changge who was an outsider! He knew that Gu Wudi wasn&#8217;t strong
          enough to do something like that.</span

          He might be disappointed, but he knew that he couldn&#8217;t put the
          blame of what transpired on Xiao Yang. Even he was surprised by Gu
          Wudi&#8217;s power earlier.</span

          the sideline!&#8221; [I wouldn&#8217;t have lost so pathetically if Gu

          them looked at Xiao Yang in disbelief. Some others were unhappily
          frowning as they thought they had misjudged his character. He should

          didn&#8217;t expect Xiao Yang to say such a thing. This was no longer
          only about winning or losing; this was a matter of Xiao Yang&#8217;s

          did you agree to the contest if you can&#8217;t accept your defeat? I

          guard the Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains goes to the Chosen
          One.&#8221; He then waved his sleeves, and the misty blue light flowed
          and pushed a soft force into Xiao Yang&#8217;s body, making him wake
          up from his current state. He helped heal Xiao Yang&#8217;s wounds at
          the same time.</span

          somewhere and stop caring about the matters of the Nine Great
          Mountains.] The Second Mountain Elder decided and with a flick of his
          sleeve, left with Xiao Yang and his other disciples. Soon, on a

          the sky made a trembling sound, and its brilliance was absorbed into
          the seal before it descended from above. Finally, it turned into a
          palm-sized cyan seal that flowed with radiance. It dripped with wisps
          of Chaos Qi as it fell into Gu Wudi&#8217;s hands.</span

          of the Nine Mountains. After all, this was the treasure of the Nine
          Great Mountains that was finally theirs after he coveted it for nearly
          ten million years. He couldn&#8217;t possibly stay calm under such

          obtained the seal, he didn&#8217;t hand it to the Third Mountain Elder
          right away. Instead, he respectfully presented it to Gu Changge next

          was trying to butter up Gu Changge. Even though he was still fuming
          about it, he kept a smile on his face as he started to explain to Gu
          Changge. &#8220;This is a treasure of the Nine Great Mountains.

          that the Celestial Seal of the Nine Mountains is a piece of Innate
          Immortal Stone from the end of heaven and earth. It was born in the
          Chaos Sea countless epochs ago. It has a long and ancient
          history,&#8221; the Third Mountain Elder couldn&#8217;t help showering
          praises when he heard Gu Changge&#8217;s reply. His eyes, however,
          were stuck to the seal.</span

          shook, brilliant and gorgeous Grand Runes suddenly turned into chains
          that imprinted on the seal in his hand. The originally surging and
          vast energy gradually faded into nothingness, and the seal turned into
          an ordinary stone seal. Within the next second, the seal suddenly
          disappeared from his hands as it seemed to fall into another world
          without a sound.</span

          smile on the Third Mountain Elder&#8217;s face was gone now as he
          froze. He didn&#8217;t know what Gu Changge was doing. The other
          Mountain Elders were also frowningly looking at this confusing change
          of events.</span

          >Gu Changge didn&#8217;t seem to care about the angry and cold
          expressions of the crowd. His eyes merely swept across the six
          Mountain Elders in front of him, and the smile on his face gradually

          chance. Those who surrender will live, and those who resist will die.
          There will be no Nine Great Mountains after today.&#8221;</span

      <h4>
        Chapter 227-1: The word taking over someone‚Äôs body is not unfamiliar,
        This master is not very sure (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "You are despicable and shameless, you are a big man, and you actually
        deceived Yaoyao, you are not worthy of being her brother!"
      </p>
      <p>"Damn you! Give back my body!"</p>
      <p>
        After returning to the cave, Jiang Yang's face finally lost its calm and
        indifference, his brows wrinkled, and there was even a hint of anger.
      </p>
      <p>"Shut up! Who are you to point your fingers at me?"</p>
      <p>He shouted at the voice in his head.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang felt that this time, things became tricky and out of his
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, who suddenly came here from the Upper Realm, did not come
        here to look for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the cultivators of the Human Ancestor Hall hadn‚Äôt found him yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang felt that this was a coincidence, but he felt that Gu Changge
        had deep malice towards him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wondered if it was his delusion, but he always felt that Gu Changge
        was uneasily kind to him.
      </p>
      <p>But he didn‚Äôt know the exact reason.</p>
      <p>
        "Anyway, younger sister, Yaoyao cannot fall into the hands of that
        Immortal‚Ä¶ I need her to trust me‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a flash of light in Jiang Yang's eyes. Earlier, he still kept
        his promise and didn't want to devour that consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if he didn't fully integrate with him, his actions, words and deeds
        would be extremely flawed in Yaoyao's eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like when he was in the main hall today, why didn't Yaoyao even
        listen to his explanation?
      </p>
      <p>He must have been too eager.</p>
      <p>
        In addition, the appearance of an odd variable like Gu Changge, made him
        have to guard against it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No matter what the trifles are, when have I ever been in such a
        position‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"It's a big deal when all the worlds return to one place."</p>
      <p>
        While shaking his head and smiling, Jiang Yang's expression quickly
        returned to calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What are you doing? Didn't you say you wouldn't touch me? I can't die,
        I want to protect Yaoyao‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        In the sea of ??consciousness, an unwilling and angry voice sounded, and
        then it gradually subsided.
      </p>
      <p>
        "From today, you are me and I am you. Accepting me is also a great
        opportunity for you."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry, I will take good care of my sister and grandma. On the
        other hand, I am also Jiang Yang."
      </p>
      <p>As Jiang Yang said softly.</p>
      <p>
        At the position between his eyebrows, rays of light began to emerge, as
        if in the deep darkness, wisps of golden light fell.
      </p>

        One after another, the intricate and profound Reincarnation runes
        suddenly appeared, and the brilliance seemed to reflect the heavens and
        the world, and it was firmly branded on his soul at this moment.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Click!</strong></p>
      <p>There was a cracking sound at the moment.</p>
      <p>
        One of the Reincarnation runes cracked, and the multicolored rays of
        light were sprayed out of them, which were colorful and splendid, like
        an immortal rain.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Borrowing 1% of the World's First Dao Fruit will not affect me too
        much."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang muttered to himself, and his expression was very calm. ùí©ewW
        ùíèovels updùíÇtes on nov/ùíÜl/b(i)ùíè(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the most critical time, he actually did not intend to use the
        last means of Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that if he didn't use it now, he would appear too weak
        against Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>Conventional cultivation methods no longer worked.</p>
      <p>
        And this was the usual method of the Human Ancestor Hall, borrowing Dao
        fruit!
      </p>
      <p>It was just that he borrowed the fruit of a certain life.</p>
      <p>This body couldn't take much.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Jiang Yang's aura was changing quietly. From the Divine
        Power Realm, it began to change towards the Great Power Realm and the
        Holy Lord Realm‚Ä¶ at an extremely terrifying speed, the aura was also
        increasing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And he also closed his eyes, planning to use the secret method to sway
        the general trend of Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order not to repeat what happened today that he even could display
        it, he was slapped to the ground, which was extremely humiliating.
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        "It doesn't seem to be peaceful tonight. The fate of the entire Immortal
        Lun Sect is changing rapidly."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The reincarnation of the Human Ancestor is really trying to find a way
        to deal with me. Today, I slapped him in the face and made him hate me‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>On the other side, Gu Changge's mouth had an inexplicable smile.</p>
      <p>
        He was standing above a palace in the Immortal Lun Sect, overlooking all
        the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black and white light appeared in his eyes, and many rules between
        heaven and earth, and the flow of runes, all appeared in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could clearly see the current topography of the Immortal Lun Sect,
        which was gathering from all directions, as if there was life, hundreds
        of rivers were returning to the sea and gathering somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that place was obviously the place where Jiang Yang usually
        cultivated.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was definitely some kind of tactic that he was intending to use, to
        make a move on Gu Changge at a critical moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just a pity that Gu Changge had already anticipated it and even
        intended to use it as a ploy.
      </p>
      <p>"That's all about Jiang Yang?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge withdrew his gaze and faintly swept a glance at the
        green-faced creature with fangs kneeling in ambush below.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "Reporting to the Superior Immortal, all these, I don‚Äôt dare to hide
        anything‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        The creature kneeling on the ground was none other than the Green Ghost,
        the one who took Jiang Yang out of Northern Mountain Village that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge found out about him after asking a little from the mouth of
        Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were some things about Jiang Yang that must have learned from his
        mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afraid of being wiped out by Gu Changge, the Green Ghost naturally told
        everything he knew, including the matter of Immortal Lun Sect secretly
        forging the Road to Immortality.
      </p>
      <p>And then, he waved his hand and let the Green Ghost leave.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge expression became somewhat confused, and he fell into deep
        thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        He previously thought that although the reincarnation body of the Human
        Ancestor liked to pretend, at least it should be a heroic role, but now
        it seemed that it was not necessarily true.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of reincarnation meant, it looked rather like a turtledove, he
        was forcibly adding the souls in his physical body.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the other divine soul awakened, then he would occupy this physical
        body.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There is purposeful reincarnation, so even everything that follows is
        actually arranged."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Casting the Immortal Road, the act of reaching the sky, the Desolate
        Holy Body, the inability to cultivate‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Oh, it seems that in addition to
        me, to the Heavenly Star Realm, even the reincarnation body of the Human
        Ancestor is probably an anomaly, and his means of reincarnation does not
        seem to be open and honest."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge couldn't help but let out a laugh.</p>
      <p>
        According to the normal set-up, Jiang Yang should have died of
        exhaustion while building the Immortal Road, followed by Yaoyao's strong
        rise all the way to the top.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was unable to cultivate, she was the Dao fruit of a certain
        Supreme existence, as long as she could use a little bit of power to
        avenge her brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time comes, she would overthrow the Immortal Lun Sect with a
        palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Heavenly Star Realm left with immortal legend, it would become a
        generation of ruthless people.
      </p>
      <p>This was the normal way.</p>
      <p>
        The real Daughter of Luck of the Heavenly Star Realm was actually
        Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, Jiang Yang suddenly became the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor, or Yaoyao's older brother, reversing the ending of his
        cultivation of the Road to Immortality.
      </p>
      <p>In this way, all of the Luck fell on the Human Ancestor.</p>
      <p>Even Yaoyao had a great relationship with him.</p>
      <p>"That's a good calculation."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge couldn't help but smile, having seen through the Human
        Ancestor's scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his opinion, now that the Human Ancestor wanted to succeed in front
        of him, this was dreaming of day during night.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time comes, not only would the Human Ancestor get nothing, but
        he will hitchhike here.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now Jiang Yang is wary of me, but should not be wary of Yaoyao, both
        have the Luck of the Heavenly Star Realm in their bodies, even if the
        Human Ancestor borrowed the Luck of Heavenly Star Realm, the effect
        would be very little. In this way, it would save me some effort."
      </p>
      <p>"By the early morning‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge thought and took a step.</p>
      <p>
        The void in front of him blurred, one ripple after another spread, and
        with it, he approached within the inner world.
      </p>
      <p>
        With quite a lot of information about the Human Ancestor, he still had
        to ask Jiang Chuchu.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Jiang Chuchu, who was sitting on a cliff in the inner
        world like an old cultivator in meditation, sensed Gu Changge's arrival
        and suddenly opened her eyes.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 227-2: The word taking over someone‚Äôs body is not unfamiliar,
        This master is not very sure (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        The light of her eyes appeared to be incomparably calm, without any
        ripples.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that you are quite satisfied with the current environment."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked at her and said with a casual smile, then with a
        thought, a stone chair appeared behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a means of creating things out of thin air caused Jiang Chuchu to
        be slightly stunned, but she thought that this was Gu Changge's spatial
        divine weapon.
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't impossible for him to perform such a tactic.</p>
      <p>
        "What did you come to see me about?" Jiang Chuchu asked indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Holy Maiden of the Human Ancestor Hall, she had been trapped in
        this place for some time, serving no purpose other than cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>It even made her think that Gu Changge had forgotten about her.</p>
      <p>Perhaps in this life, she would die of old age here.</p>
      <p>
        Today, Gu Changge's sudden arrival also made her slightly surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge sat down, looked at her neatly, then smiled and said, "I am
        going to ask you some questions, if the answers satisfy me, then I can
        consider letting you go."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu looked at him, and a touch of disbelief swept through her
        crystal eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What do you want to ask? If it's about the Human Ancestor's
        information, forget it, I don't know, and even if I did, I wouldn't tell
        you." She said indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why are you so stupid, woman, be good and obedient and regain your
        freedom, do you really want to die here of old age?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge let out a faint laugh and reached out to pinch her chin.</p>
      <p>
        She had always scoffed at this kind of attitude of hers toasting the
        wine.
      </p>
      <p>The last time was the same.</p>
      <p>
        Do not shed tears until seeing the coffin, she knew the fear, but
        unfortunately it was already too late.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, how can you be so despicable‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"Besides this tactic, do you know anything else?"</p>
      <p>Seeing Gu Changge's actions, Jiang Chuchu‚Äôs expression changed.</p>
      <p>Even her good state of mind was broken at this time.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked at her indifferently, "If you don't tell me, I will
        come every day, I don't believe you can last that long."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, Jiang Chuchu instantly turned white with anger, she
        couldn‚Äôt wait to cut him to pieces.
      </p>
      <p>In the end, she compromised and said the result Gu Changge wanted.</p>
      <p>
        "The Human Ancestor Hall's method of borrowing Dao fruits actually
        originates from the Human Ancestor's Reincarnation Seal? In other words,
        the biggest trump card of the Human Ancestor's reincarnation body is
        actually his Reincarnation Seal?" Gu Changge asked with great interest.
      </p>
      <p>This point was similar to his guess.</p>
      <p>
        "The refinement of the Reincarnation Seal is incomparably difficult, but
        each one contains the strongest Dao fruit of each generation of the
        Human Ancestor."
      </p>
      <p>
        "So don't even think about being able to deal with the Human Ancestor,
        just give up, Gu Changge." Jiang Chuchu said indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is there no weakness in the Reincarnation Seal?" Gu Changge looked at
        her.
      </p>
      <p>Jiang Chuchu shook her head and said, "I don't know."</p>

      </div>
      <p>
        "You don't have to lie, I can already see that the Dao fruit in the
        Reincarnation Seal is extremely difficult to fuse and requires a very
        strong body."
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is the plan of the Human Ancestor of all worlds to return to one?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge couldn't help but let out a laugh.</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's face turned white, not expecting Gu Changge to see it.
      </p>
      <p>Her thoughts were wavering.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was so confident and certain, could it be that he was really
        planning to murder the Human Ancestor and then replace him?
      </p>
      <p>A terrifying chill could not help but arise from her back.</p>
      <p>Then, Gu Changge left the inner world and went to find Yaoyao.</p>
      <p>
        The little girl had not rested at night and was talking with her grandma
        about what happened in the main hall today.
      </p>
      <p>In the end, Jiang Yang was a relative of both of them.</p>
      <p>It was not that easy to cut off with him.</p>
      <p>"Master‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was taken aback when she saw Gu Changge's arrival and hurriedly
        shouted in a good manner.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded with a gentle expression.</p>
      <p>
        Silver haired grammy was also sensible and intended to leave the place
        by herself, knowing that Gu Changge might have something to tell Yaoyao.
      </p>
      <p>But to her surprise, Gu Changge called her back.</p>
      <p>"You should also listen to this matter together."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge said indifferently.</p>
      <p>"Yes, Mr. immortal."</p>
      <p>
        Silver haired granny was a little surprised, then hurriedly said
        respectfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao was also a bit curious, what would the Master say to them in the
        middle of the night?
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge opened his mouth and informed the two about what
        Jiang Yang had encountered in the Immortal Lun Sect all these years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if he didn't say it now, Jiang Yang would probably find time to
        tell Yaoyao about his hardships. FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>So why not help him to say it.</p>
      <p>This would have a better effect instead.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yaoyao couldn't help but stare at him with wide eyes, it
        was a little hard for her to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother was actually thrown to be a slave‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ This Immortal Lun Sect is
        also really too much!"
      </p>
      <p>Yaoyao's little face couldn't help but reveal a look of anger.</p>
      <p>But soon, seeing Gu Changge‚Äôs frowning look.</p>
      <p>
        The young maiden also reacted, feeling wrong, and asked tentatively in a
        small voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, you gave this information to Yaoyao, I don't think it's not
        only because you just wanted to say this, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at her and said softly, "This Master originally did
        not intend to tell you this, afraid that you might not be able to
        accept‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>

          window.pubfuturetag.push({

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        After hearing this, the silver haired granny, who was a cultivator, felt
        a chill down her back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention a little girl in the early days, even her own face became
        very pale.
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly dug out something ominous, and then all the slaves died.</p>
      <p>
        But only Jiang Yang survived, his cultivation progressed rapidly, and
        his status in the Immortal Lun Sect rose.
      </p>
      <p>Was it only because he was too Lucky?</p>
      <p>Silver haired granny shook her head.</p>
      <p>
        Even though it was her own grandson, she felt a shiver of discomfort, it
        was too odd.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There are quite a few doubts in this matter, how did Jiang Yang
        survive, relying on his physique to hold on? But he didn't have any
        cultivation at that time at all."
      </p>
      <p>Silver haired granny thought about it and said seriously.</p>
      <p>
        She was at least an outstanding disciple of a sect at the time, for
        these ominous things, she could still kind of understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words, Gu Changge also nodded, and his expression revealed a
        trace of deep meaning, "Digging out something ominous, is indeed a very
        dangerous thing."
      </p>
      <p>
        "According to my knowledge, even Sacred Realm cultivators tainted with
        ominous aura had the risk of violent death. Jiang Yang, a mortal who was
        not even able to cultivate at that time, how did he survive the ominous
        aura?"
      </p>
      <p>"This matter is indeed quite suspicious."</p>
      <p>
        "What do you mean? That day the ominous aura went violent? Jiang Yang‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
        is no longer himself?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing these words, the silver haired granny‚Äôs face could not help but
        turn white.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, without Gu Changge saying anything more, she had already
        guessed it by this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word "taking over someone‚Äôs body" was not very unfamiliar in the
        Heavenly Star Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for why the Immortal Lun Sect didn't react because the person who now
        occupied Jiang Yang's body had a great connection with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, the silver haired granny was filled with sorrow and
        anger, helplessness, bitterness, sadness and other emotions all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ You mean, in fact, my brother has disappeared, now another
        person is occupying his body?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Little Yaoyao's expression looked much calmer than the silver haired
        granny.
      </p>
      <p>Although she was also a little pale and bloodless at the moment.</p>
      <p>While clenching her lips.</p>
      <p>Her voice was trembling.</p>
      <p>
        This news really came too suddenly, without a little bit of
        anticipation.
      </p>
      <p>
        She actually would rather accept that Jiang Yang had changed, rather
        than accepting that brother Jiang Yang had actually disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the one occupying his body today was a stranger who had no idea who
        he was.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the words of her master, Gu Changge, Yaoyao was now very
        convinced.
      </p>
      <p>And even her grandma had said so.</p>
      <p>In this matter, was there really any other possibility?</p>
      <p>
        Especially today in the hall, Jiang Yang's words and actions, and even
        his way of speaking, were completely different from the brother she knew
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I am actually not very sure, this matter still needs to be discussed
        again, in any case, in these few days when you and your brother contact,
        you have to pay attention to it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry, Master, if he really has a problem, it's impossible for
        him to hurt you."
      </p>
      <p>"I also hope that your Master is overthinking."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge sighed, stroked her head and said seemingly helplessly.</p>

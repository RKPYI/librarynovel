<p>The news regarding the death of Jin Yun soon reached those surrounding the Eternal Overcast. Nearly every single person fell into a state of shock.<span id="more-37269"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experts from Sky Emperor Mountain, Endless Fire Kingdom, and all the other Immortal Forces were thunderstruck by the news as well. Their jaws fell open in disbelief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way…&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the old woman in red from Endless Fire Kingdom, her expression was so dark and contorted that she looked rather grotesque.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her most beloved Junior had also suffered at the hands of the Successor of Demonic Arts. It coincided with the Eternal Overcast Outbreak. Gu Changge had been there but he chose not to save her Junior. Therefore, the hatred she felt for Gu Changge was not any less than that which she felt for the Successor of Demonic Arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her most beloved Junior would not have died if Gu Changge had been willing to lend a hand at the time. This was the reason why the old woman in red remained adamant in her attempt to label Gu Changge as the Successor of Demonic Arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, at this very moment, it was reported that the Successor of Demonic Arts had emerged and killed the ancient monstrocity from Purple Cloud Valley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This news both shocked and infuriated her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The True Daoist from Sky Emperor Mountain and all the other people fell silent as well. None of them expected to hear news of the Successor of Demonic Arts in this manner and at a time like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, the claims that Gu Changge was the Successor of Demonic Arts were discredited just like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, Gu Changge was right in front of everyone. How could he have possibly killed the Successor of Purple Cloud Valley?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they say that Young Master Gu is the Successor of Demonic Arts? Isn&#8217;t he right here? If he was, how did the ancient monstrocity from Purple Cloud Valley die at the hands of the Successor of Demonic Arts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news sounded unbelievable to many.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How could Gu Changge have possibly attacked Jin Yun over such a great distance? He would have to be in two places at once, which hardly seemed possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might happen if he had created a clone of himself to carry out the attack while he, the original, remained behind to mislead everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, only a few of the cultivators considered this possibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once most of them got past their initial shock, they began to eye Sky Emperor Mountain, Purple Cloud Valley, Endless Fire Kingdom, and the other various Forces with looks of amusement and ridicule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just moments ago, these Forces had claimed with full confidence that Gu Changge was the Successor of Demonic Arts, only to have this news break out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real Successor of Demonic Arts was in a cave somewhere within the ruins and had just killed an ancient monstrocity from Purple Cloud Valley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this incident, who would still believe that Gu Changge was the Successor of Demonic Arts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, Sky Emperor Mountain and the other Forces had been slapped in the face right in front of everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The real Successor of Demonic Arts has surfaced. Seniors, this means your efforts here have been all for nothing. The cave where the unfortunate incident took place should be fairly close by. Considering how powerful you are, I&#8217;m sure you can get there in next to no time, Seniors. If you do catch the true Successor of Demonic Arts, I hope you will remember to clear my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gu Changge reacted as if this were his first time hearing the news. He had just the right amount of shock in his expression, though his tone was laced with a tinge of ridicule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only hope that when the time comes, Seniors, all of you will be able to justify your actions and make it up to everyone. I also hope you&#8217;ll give Young Master Gu a sincere apology.&#8221; Saintess Jiang Chuchu of Mortal Palace was also eyeing them icily as she spoke candidly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although she was part of the younger generation, she showed no fear or trepidation when she faced the True Daoists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as these words fell, the True Daoists from Sky Emperor Mountain and Purple Cloud Valley reacted with darkened expressions. Nevertheless, they did not have the gall to say anything else to Gu Changge. Their cheeks were inflamed. It was as if they had been given a heavy slap in the face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation with the Eternal Overcast was something that affected the hearts of every single cultivator, be it what Force they hailed from. Right now, nearly all eyes were on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was certain that from today onwards, the rumours about Gu Changge being the Successor of Demonic Arts would almost die out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The accusers&#8217; only option would be to procure irrefutable evidence that proved Gu Changge was indeed the true Successor of Demonic Arts. If they could not, then all their efforts thus far would go to waste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to come to a conclusion in such haste. Who knows? Gu Changgu could&#8217;ve set this up to clear his name when he is indeed the true Successor of Demonic Arts.&#8221; The old woman in red from Endless Fire Kingdom could not resist snarling in response. Her expression was a dreadful sight to behold. She could not accept the turn of events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of those present frowned at her words. They wondered if she had gone mad. [Even at a time like this, she&#8217;s still determined to frame Gu Changge.]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The True Daoists from Sky Emperor Mountain and Purple Cloud Valley exchanged glances. They saw the helplessness in each other&#8217;s gazes and instinctively took a few steps back. They did not want to get dragged into this any further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a death wish, huh?! You have repeatedly framed the Young Master! I shall destroy your Dao Base today as a warning to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just then, a familiar pressure swept across the void.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah Er appeared dressed in a battle suit made of Hell&#8217;s Iron and a mask that hid his face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His gaze was cold and his tone was merciless. He tapped his finger in the direction of the old woman in red from Endless Fire Kingdom. It was merely a simple motion but it channelled the might of the Great Dao, capable of setting all things back in order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Gasp*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the very next second, a clear sound rang out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old woman in red had a look of terror on her face. She could barely move as the attack had pierced through the centre of her brows. The bloodied hole through her skull was a ghastly sight. The Dao Base where her soul resided had shattered. In the blink of an eye, the great might of a True Daoist vanished into nothingness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;No… You can&#8217;t do this…&#8221; she screeched in agony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was filled with her unwillingness to resign herself to this outcome. Her face was contorted with a look of horror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Successor of Demonic Arts&#8217; reappearance and actions must be in response to the many rumours that have been spreading recently…&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Successor of Demonic Arts seems displeased by the idea of someone else taking their identity, so that&#8217;s why they emerged. Nevertheless, the Successor is indeed arrogant beyond compare to show up at a time like this. Is the Successor not afraid of becoming everyone&#8217;s common enemy and targeted by all of Forces?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to understand what the Successor of Demonic Arts is thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the cultivators in the vicinity of Eternal Overcast were engaged in fervent discussion. They were completely taken aback by the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logically speaking, the Successor of Demonic Arts had successfully escaped from Gu Changge&#8217;s hands many times. The two were mortal enemies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when Gu Changge was framed as the Successor of the Demonic Arts, the true Successor made a high-profile appearance to get Gu Changge out of his predicament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a righteous thing to do, even though the Successor had viciously stolen the Source of many young prodigies in the past for the sake of cultivation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to the conniving schemes, false accusations, and other sinister trickery of the various Forces, the Successor seemed a lot more principled and honourable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite a number of the older cultivators even developed a sense of respect for the Successor of Demonic Arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon, the incidents at Eternal Overcast ignited huge waves across the Upper Realm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Countless people, across all kinds of ancient stars, were discussing this matter.</p>

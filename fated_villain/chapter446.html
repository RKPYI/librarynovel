          >Withered without any sign of life, ancient black trees covered the
          sky. Still, they were incomparably tall and covered the entire area of
          the desert. The mountains undulated as if they had no end. The yellow
          sand billowed and covered the sky and earth. It was unknown how many
          corpses these ancient trees have absorbed over countless years for
          them to be refined into demons. If one is lucky, they won’t be harmed
          by these trees. However, Lu Luo and her party were still extremely
          cautious as they were afraid that they would attract the attention of
          other cultivators. Now that the Upper Realm was at war with the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains, this place wasn’t far from the frontier.
          Thus, if anything unusual happened here, cultivators with a strong
          perception would sense it and might disrupt their plans. </span

          >“Lin Wu, I empathise with you, but at this point in time, you need to
          let it go.” Lu Luo persuaded with deep sympathy. She held affection
          for this legendary figure and didn’t want to see him affected by this
          incident. That horrifying existence that killed Lin Qingyang was
          definitely not someone who Lin Wu can compete against.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The expression on Lin Wu’s face was very calm as he stopped himself
          from his usual look of solemnity. He nodded, “I know. Don’t worry, Lu
          Luo.” Just like how Lu Luo liked him, he also had a deep affection for
          this girl in front of him, who was knowledgeable and beautiful. In
          many people’s eyes, when he and Goddess Lu Luo stood side-by-side,
          they were a match made in heaven.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After they heard the conversation between Lin Wu and Lu Luo, a few
          young men and women couldn’t help but look over. Someone sighed and
          said helplessly,“I heard the person who killed Lin Wu’s brother has an
          unparalleled status on the other side. Over there, he is said to be
          the best and no one is qualified enough to be compared to him. ”

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This person was one of those who witnessed what happened that day.
          That Ancestor of the Lin Clan was someone in the Sacred King Realm.
          Over here in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, he was regarded as
          an ancient cultivator. However, the fact that he was smacked to death
          by a Dharma Body from an infinite distance away shook the world. Not
          to mention, someone heard that the other party was around the same age
          as them. Before this incident, this was something that was
          unbelievable, something that no one dared to think of. In front of
          that person, this genius in front of them was no more than an ant.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I know that man is very strong.” As Lin Wu heard their words, he
          remained calm and showed no fear. He wouldn’t back down just because
          the other party showed terrifying strength.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Brother Lin Wu, as long as you understand…” The person who spoke
          just now also shook his head. He knew Lin Wu didn’t witness what
          happened that day so it was difficult for him to understand the terror
          of the other party. That scene simply created too much despair and
          hopelessness. However, at this point in time, it was impossible for
          him to persuade Lin Wu to let go of his hatred.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“There is no genius that I can’t catch up to in this world.” Everyone
          was stunned as they saw the expression and confidence on Lin Wu’s
          face. As they listened to him, their expressions changed slightly as
          they felt Lin Wu’s indomitable ambitiousness.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many young men and women couldn’t help but admire him. Some of the
          older ones also nodded their heads in praise. Now that the Upper Realm
          has invaded the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, this was time for
          everyone to be united. If every member of the younger generation had
          the same spirit as Lin Wu, what would there be to worry about?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“No matter what, it is an unavoidable fact that we would eventually
          need to face off with the other side. Rather than letting go of hope
          and being meek, why not fight them to death? What’s more, other than
          the Boundary Marker Sea, we still have our last line of defence, we
          haven’t reached the point of despair yet…” Lin Wu continued and
          everyone regained confidence. “Although the Upper Realm is strong,
          since ancient times, evil has never triumphed over justice. This is an
          unchangeable law of the world. We are on the side of justice, heaven
          will be on our side…”
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >These words were indeed from his heart. To be able to stand here
          today, he was truly blessed by the heavens.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Lin Wu had a secret that he had never told anyone before, he had
          always kept this in the deepest recession of his heart. When he was
          thirteen, on the eve of the awakening of his Bloodline Talent, he
          prayed by an ancient well in the courtyard that he would awaken a
          decent level of his Bloodline Talent. He hoped to change his
          situation. He wished that tomorrow, he would not need to bear those
          stares of disdain and finally be seen to be worth something.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The next day, it was as if heaven had heard his prayers. After a
          shooting star streaked across the sky, the Seven Coloured Energies
          appeared in the ancient well like a ball of light and Lin Wu got a
          hold of it. It was something mysterious called the Martial Arts Space
          that was hidden in his mind.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Martial Arts Space was really mysterious. It not only contained
          unpredictable wonders that helped him to deduce and control different
          spells and abilities. It also allowed his consciousness to enter it.
          Inside, time passed really slowly. This allowed Lin Wu to have much
          more time than others to cultivate. Thanks to this Martial Arts Space,
          he could quickly master various spells and abilities to become a young
          legend of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. If not, his original
          Talent was actually awful.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Naturally, his Dragon Bloodline Talent also benefited from this. It
          was precisely this reason that caused Lin Wu to feel that he was truly
          blessed by heaven.

          >[With the invasion of the Upper Realm, the Eight Wastelands and Ten

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At the same time, above the endless black Sea of Death, a
          Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon flew through the clouds, above the sea
          at high speed. On its head, sat a young man, cross-legged. His clothes
          were as white as snow and he radiated an extraordinary aura. Between
          each strand of his hair, there seemed to be a magical aura. He seemed
          to be in the midst of something.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >One by one, runes moved, transformed and disappeared behind him, like
          ancient worlds being destroyed and reshaped again and again. This was
          a terrifying scene, just the aura that permeated was enough to make
          one tremble. It was as if there were hundreds of millions of worlds in
          his palm destroyed and reshaped.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon beneath his feet was even more
          frightening. Everyone was afraid that with just one wisp of its
          breath, they would all turn to ashes. The ability of that young man
          was so great that it was anguishing and no one dared to disrespect
          him.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Are we almost there?” Gu Changge looked up into the distance and
          asked casually. There were no waves in the sea and it seemed as if it
          was dead. As they got closer to the coast, the weaker the
          All-Repelling Force got. The Boundary Marker Sea had started to dry up
          and its All-Repelling Force was no longer as strong as before. It was
          obvious that when all the seawater here dried up, the army from the
          Upper Realm would come down to attack with full strength.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Reporting Master, after we go across this area, we will arrive at
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains… The two sides once fought here.
          The Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains once forged fortresses called war
          forts. They could connect to the powers of the stars outside, creating
          great powers. That battle almost drowned this place. When I was just a
          little dragon, I witnessed the entire battle with my own eyes.” The
          Three-Headed Black Dragon replied instantaneously as he told Gu
          Changge everything he knew, right down to the specifics.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was in the Sacred Emperor Realm and had lived for countless years.
          Because he lived in the Boundary Marker Sea, His abilities were much
          greater than others who were of the same cultivation level. However,
          now, this dragon had been reduced to a mere transportation tool.
          Still, he didn’t dare to show even an ounce of reluctance or hatred.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On their journey, he had witnessed with his own eyes how a ferocious
          beast that was at the Third-Order of the Quasi-Nirvana Realm jumped at
          this young man in an attempt to devour him. However, the young man
          just grabbed it effortlessly and black runes within his palm condensed
          into a black spear. Then, he threw it into the void. As if a thousand
          sun exploded, it pierced through the sky with a bang.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that one attack, the terrifying beast collapsed and died
          tragically on the spot. It was an instant kill. That was why the
          Three-Headed Black Flood Dragon decided to be obedient. He knew the
          chilling extent of the abilities of the young men on top of his head.

          >“War forts? Looks like that battle wasn’t an easy one.” Slowly, the
          banks started to appear in Gu Changge’s eyes. Indeed, there were many
          stars scattered all over the place, all of which were refined weapons.
          Not to mention, from his angle, he could see how grey clouds billowed
          high up in the sky and many ancient warships were parked.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Domains were on that side. On the contrary, on his journey here, he
          rarely saw other cultivators. Of course, there were very few people
          like him who dared to directly cross over the Boundary Marker Sea like
          him.</span

          popularity…by the looks of it, he has found treasures for me once
          again.] Gu Changge gazed far ahead, he had already asked Ah Da to keep
          an eye on everyone from Supreme Cave Heaven. That was why he didn’t
          rush here after he found out that Chu Hao came. Instead, he went
          somewhere else. Still, this got him interested.

          search for a treasure, but Gu Changge just didn’t know how useful a
          Fortuitous One of the Upper Realm would be in the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains. Not to mention, the closer they got to the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains, the more he could feel how fragmented the
          Great Dao Principles were, along with traces of Immortality Essence in
          the air. This made Gu Changge a little sceptical about the credibility
          of the ancient records from the Upper Realm.</span

          Great Dao, how could the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains still get a
          share of the Immortality Essence? Could it really be true? The
          Celestial Gate can only be reopened through the reunification of the

          their party were on their way, an old man suddenly waved and halted
          the entire party with furrowed brows as he gazed forward. There, on a
          majestic and infinite mountain peak, laid a Golden Eagle in its lair.
          Its body size wasn’t considered very big but its entire body glowed
          brightly as if it was carved out of pure gold. Even its feathers
          shined as if it were indestructible.

          demonic. Although it was faraway, their eardrums were almost torn
          apart. This was an extremely terrifying ferocious beast that possessed
          the strength reaching the Sacred King Realm and various other great
          Talents. It rested in its lair like an overlord and no one dared to
          provoke it.

          with great fear. It was obvious from their clothes and aura that that
          group of people weren’t natives to the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. It was unknown when they had arrived. Their leader was an
          elegant and calm young man, who had a glow around his body. He also
          possessed a commanding aura that made people afraid to underestimate
          him.

          expressions on Lin Wu’s and Lu Luo’s faces turned solemn as they felt
          that the young man’s strength was extremely terrifying. It wouldn’t be
          an exaggeration to describe his strength as unfathomable as it was
          simply way beyond their current abilities to contend against.

          were around the same age yet there was such a great difference in
          their cultivation level. That person was at most a hundred years older

          against the Spirit Gourd Master…” Lu Luo stared intensely in that
          direction. She could use all natural plants as her eyes. Thus, she
          could clearly see the patterns on that person’s sleeves despite the
          far distance between them.</span

          >“The expert called Tai Shang?” Several old men made eye contact, it
          was obvious that that person came here to look for that hidden space.
          With such a great distance in between them, they couldn’t tell that
          person’s abilities and thus, they could only be careful to stay hidden
          in the dark and play by the ear.

          notice us.” With a plan in mind, the old men made eye contact as they
          instructed Lin Wu, Lu Luo and the others. They were responsible for
          the safety of this group of youths and had to protect them from harm’s
          way. Afterall, they were the young prodigies of the Eight Wastelands
          and Ten Domains, and were the seeds of hope for their future. If
          someone from the Upper Realm found out about them, they would not
          spare them and would definitely kill without hesitation.

          >Lin Wu, Lu Luo and the rest were all very alert. They all nodded to
          express their awareness of the danger that laid ahead, before they
          continued to follow behind cautiously.

          >Soon, the Golden Eagle in front attempted to escape in fear, however,
          it was quickly killed. As it cried out, golden fresh blood splattered
          all over and caused its feathers and parts of the mountain to be
          stained by it. Lin Wu and the others watched with sobriety. That
          elegant young man was really strong, with just a few moves, he laid
          the Golden Eagle to rest.

          >In the Upper Realm, he would at least be on par with Sect Masters.
          Even the leaders of the forces behind them would not be this strong.
          In fact, only the Ancestors of their family stood a chance. The
          thought of such a person who came here covertly and even crossed the
          Boundary Marker Sea sent shivers down their spines. It looked like the
          Boundary Marker Sea had become increasingly perilous.

          accurate, the Supreme Dao Diagram that was lost back then should be
          here. ” A short elderly man expressed enthusiastically. Within his
          palm was a geomantic compass that was purple and gold. The needle on
          top of it spun at lightning speed and eventually steadied to point at
          the gigantic deserted mountain ahead.

          >The elegant man was Chu Hao who had crossed the Boundary Marker Sea
          in great strides. As he listened to the old man’s words, he nodded his
          head. With his secret method of improving his perception, it was only
          natural that he could determine the location of the great treasure of
          the Supreme Cave Heaven, the Supreme Dao Diagram.

          >Some people say that the origins of Supreme Cave Heaven was related
          to a cultivation technique, which helped them obtain great power,
          called the Ancient Heavenly Art. However, Chu Hao knew this was false.
          The origin of the Supreme Cave Heaven was merely due to a mysterious
          diagram. That diagram had been passed down generations and contained
          the deepest secrets of Supreme Cave Heaven.

          >Once, it was carried by one of their Ancestors, who almost broke
          through the defences of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.
          Unfortunately, it was lost and that Ancestor encountered a powerful
          expert from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the Spirit Gourd
          Master. Both fought and died of exhaustion. As a result, the treasures
          they had carried with them were buried in the area where they had
          fought. Regarding that Spirit Gourd Master, Chu Hao didn’t know much
          about him. He only knew that his greatest treasure was a mythical
          gourd and he didn’t even know where it came from.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everytime the cap of the mythical gourd was opened, a peerless flying
          sword would rush out and slay everything. It wouldn’t return to the
          mythical gourd unless blood was spilled. Just the thought of it caused
          goosebumps.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This supreme treasure was likely one of the legendary Innate Seven
          Mythical Gourds that was injected with malevolence. Now, its worth was
          unimaginable and had definitely surpassed the Nirvana Grade. Although
          Chu Hao said that he wanted to retrieve the Supreme Dao Diagram that
          was lost by Supreme Cave Heaven, he couldn’t stop desiring the
          mythical gourd.
        </span>

      <p>

          >“Master Chu Hao, I’ve found the entrance. Due to the aftershocks
          caused by the battle, this place is very unstable. Over the course of
          countless years, the space created may collapse at any time. So, we
          have to quickly find the Supreme Dao Diagram.” The short old man
          beside Chu Hao couldn’t help but speak cautiously. At the same time,
          he pointed to the haze in front of them as he sensed something
          strange. After they pass through this haze, they could enter the space
          and search for the lost Supreme Dao Diagram.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Then, let’s go.” Chu Hao didn’t hesitate. So far, he had been quite
          lucky on this journey. He didn’t feel that anything was out of place
          about this search for the Supreme Dao Diagram. As usual, it was an
          easy and calm journey for him.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As his words fell, there was a wave of ripples and Chu Hao stepped in
          first. The remaining members of Supreme Cave Heaven looked around
          vigilantly, then stepped in once they were sure that they had left no
          traces.

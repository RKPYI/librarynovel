          peaks of the outside world, which was currently suffused with Eternal
          Overcast Fog. These beams were cultivators and young prodigies who had
          come as soon as they heard the news. The place became busy as young

          >The mysterious King with Six Crowns was wearing grey, with a
          moderate-looking figure and mist covering his face. He had arrived on
          a white crane and was now looking down from it. Beams of divine light
          flashed across his eyes, evolving runes and awe-inducing phenomena
          flickering within as he deduced what was happening. Even he was uneasy
          about the whole thing, as his heart was racing from the anxiety.</span

          must have put a lot of effort into this setup, to attract many young
          prodigies here. Otherwise, this wouldn&#8217;t have happened. This
          must be a trap setup in advance. I have underestimated you, Ying
          Shuang.] The King with Six Crowns shook his head with a sigh, then
          glanced at the Sacred Emperor Grade artifacts still standing firm
          against its enemy and frowned.</span

          Disciple appeared beside him. She had a tall figure and beautiful
          features. There was a phoenix pattern between her eyebrows and her
          bright colourful wings resembled flickering flames were spread out.
          She had come here as well but like him, she was wary of the danger and
          did not enter.</span

          >&#8220;Ying Shuang definitely did this to trick anyone who&#8217;s
          hunting him down.&#8221; The King with Six Crowns said with a nod. He
          had been mistaken in his observations before since he did not expect
          Ying Shuang to conceal his identity so well that he had tricked him as
          well. Such a nasty plot and technique, as well as the courage Ying
          Shuang had shown, made the King with Six Crowns have no choice but to
          take him seriously. However, this did fit the image he had of the
          Successor of Demonic Arts.</span

          >[Gu Changge is powerful and it&#8217;s always him plotting against
          someone. How could he have been tricked by someone else now? Nothing
          will happen to him.] Gu Xianer appeared on top of a mountain. Her
          dress moved with the wind and her expression was cold, yet there was a
          frown on her face. Despite her own thoughts, she couldn&#8217;t calm
          down or avoid worrying about this.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >So many things had happened continuously, with Gu Changge promising
          to bring Qing Xiaoyi home but then rushing off halfway with the claim
          that he knew where the Successor of Demonic Arts was, and would arrive
          earlier in the Black Tortoise Empire than her. She hadn&#8217;t
          expected to hear the news of him and the others being tricked by the
          Successor upon her arrival and that no one knew whether they were
          still alive or not. This made her extremely worried despite knowing
          that he was strong and no one can harm him. Besides, no one would
          bully her in the future if something had happened to him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She wasn&#8217;t happy about that, though. This was the Successor of
          Demonic Arts who Gu Changge had seriously wounded many times, so it
          was natural that the former would hate the latter and thus not let
          this chance pass.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Xianer began to urge Gu Changge&#8217;s followers to encourage the
          other young prodigies to come. She knew she would trouble Gu Changge
          further if she went alone recklessly, making her a burden to him.
          However, a greater number of people would be different. Her plan was
          extremely effective since many young prodigies were greatly motivated
          and now felt confident.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. We have so many people that I don&#8217;t
          think the Successor of Demonic Arts would do anything careless when we
          go in at the same time.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Exactly. Why are we so scared? Young Master Changge and the
          others have already gone there, so how could we stay here cowering?
          This doesn&#8217;t fit our reputation of being the best of our
          generation.&#8221; Many young prodigies began to be filled with
          justified anger, as they were all young and proud and could not accept
          anything less. They had heard the other prodigal damsels secretly
          comparing them to Gu Changge and the others, which made them feel
          guilty and embarrassed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Killing the Successor of Demonic Arts was not just the responsibility
          of Gu Changge and the others, but every cultivator there was. They
          felt energised at that thought. Besides, there were so many of them
          that the Successor of Demonic Arts couldn&#8217;t possibly trap and
          kill everyone despite his cunning plans.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;This is the most effective way, definitely.&#8221; Gu Xianer
          nodded, her figure disappearing as she left the mountain and headed
          for the Land of Eternal Overcast with the others. Since two Sacred
          Emperor Grade artifacts were facing off against each other, and no one
          else came out to block their way, they were able to successfully enter
          without encountering any danger.</span

          >&#8220;Brother Changge, please be alright.&#8221; Yin Mei looked
          worried. Gu Xianer had disliked her ever since she saw her in Skyward
          Schloss. However, her attitude improved upon seeing how concerned the
          other woman was about Gu Changge. Furthermore, this wasn&#8217;t the
          time for petty arguments.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The King of Six Crowns, the Phoenix Lady, and the others followed
          behind, all having their own motives. They did not walk at the front
          so they could retreat quicker if they encountered any danger. They
          were the best of the young generation and thus not a mere
          weakling.</span

          >*Boom!* Grey fog permeated the sky as four Sacred Lord Realm experts
          clad in black robes sealed every centimetre of space. Grand Runes wove
          in between each other and condensed, turning into a Grand Flask which
          hovered above. It exuded powerful waves of energy which felt like a
          great galaxy ready to fall on top of them.</span

          should&#8217;ve expected this when you hunted me down. You will get to
          accompany Prince Shen very soon.&#8221; A condescending and arrogant
          laugh rang through the sky as the figure cloaked in thick fog sneered
          down at the ground. He had already noticed Chosen Monk Jin
          Chan&#8217;s arrival but he wasn&#8217;t interested in him. He only
          had eyes for Gu Changge, as if he would be undefeated after killing
          the man.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jin Chan could no longer maintain his calm after hearing this, his
          heart stuttering. He had already assumed both Gu Changge and Prince
          Shen to fall for the Successor of Demonic Arts&#8217; cunning tricks
          as well as the fact that they would be at a great disadvantage. He did
          not expect the battle to be so violent that Prince Shen was already…
          gone. Once this got out, there would be so many powerful waves
          unleashed as the might of the Successor of Demonic Arts, which would
          shocked the whole Upper Realm once more.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He tried to use his senses again, secretly using the Karma Seed this
          time, but had discovered that Prince Shen&#8217;s energy had
          completely disappeared. [So, what Ying Shuang said is all true!]

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge looked like his Source was grievously wounded as well, now
          sitting cross-legged with a calm expression and lowered gaze. His aura
          was weak too, with no sign of it being as extraordinary as before. His
          white clothes were red with blood as the frightening-looking wound had
          nearly torn him apart. This was extremely horrifying and shocking! If
          not for the unusual Golden Decree emitting multicoloured light and
          acting like a shield against the Principles attacking him, Gu Changge
          would have followed in Prince Shen&#8217;s footsteps!</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Successor of Demonic Arts had really put effort into this scheme.
          First showing himself strategically and attracting their attention,
          then using a Sacred Emperor Grade artifact to separate them and also
          counter Gu Changge&#8217;s Sacred Emperor Grade artifact. He had
          already prepared plenty of traps in the Land of Eternal Overcast,
          waiting for them to enter before emerging to attack them. Such a
          scheme would have even defeated and killed a true Sacred Emperor Realm
          expert, much less Prince Shen!</span

          thought. He felt cold with fear as he would have been the one harmed

          >Quickly, a light flickered within his gaze as he gained an idea. From
          the powerful waves of energy, the battle had to be violent. No one
          could underestimate Gu Changge&#8217;s strength, yet he was now
          injured this badly. Ying Shuang definitely wasn&#8217;t much better,
          showing strength outwardly but was now internally exhausted. He had
          already used so many abilities just now since assuming by his
          character, he would never let Gu Changge live.

          meant Ying Shuang was actually fearful of Gu Changge, and did not dare
          act carelessly even now. Ying Shang probably wasn&#8217;t confident if
          Gu Changge had any other abilities. This might be true from how
          unruffled Gu Changge looked despite his weak appearance.</span

          muttering praise to Buddha, he stepped forward and appeared in midair.
          He looked at the figure cloaked in a grey fog, attacking immediately
          in order to investigate it.</span

          light shone from behind him as the phantoms of Buddha, Bodhisattvas,
          Buddha guardians, and other beings appeared. Powerful Buddhist energy
          shot forward to attack. A purple-gold bowl appeared as well, expanding
          in midair, which reassembled the Heavenly Tribulation Pond.
          Immeasurable bolts of lightning flashed inside, releasing crackling
          sounds. Different types of lightning phenomena materialised and
          exhibited a dangerous aura.</span

          this was a trap but did not inform Prince Shen about it.</span

          snorted and waved a hand. Great puffs of Demonic Qi surged forwards to
          form monstrous beasts which drowned out the Buddhist phantoms Jin Chan
          had summoned. The four Sacred Lord Realm experts were surrounded by
          black fog and reached to seal off the space. The Grand Flask exuded a
          terrifying aura and black runes swirled around it to form runes and
          Dao Swords. At the same time, cascades of black light poured from the
          opening, breaking through all of Jin Chan&#8217;s abilities as fast as
          lightning. The light eventually landed on the purple-gold bowl, but it
          was made of a tough unknown material and managed to withstand it.
          However, some of its power did still diminish.</span

          darkness while destroying everything.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!* The strikes collided, and the Chosen Monk Flew backwards. He
          spat out a mouthful of blood, his Buddha light fading slightly. His
          arm was twitching as many of its bones were broken, but he
          wasn&#8217;t surprised and even smiled a little.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Amitabha. You are truly strong externally but exhausted
          internally. I think most of your abilities have already been used on
          Young Master Changge. Such an attack cannot harm me.&#8221; His smile
          as he expanded as his bowl, which had been knocked away from the
          impact, dropped back into his hand. It was entirely different to the
          one which he had used in his fight against Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge narrowed his eyes at this. &#8220;The Vairocana Immovable
          Golden Physique? You&#8217;ve concealed it really well.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I’ve never concealed it. It&#8217;s just that I have to take
          this more seriously.&#8221; The Chosen Monk smiled, his wounds healing
          rapidly. He shone with Buddha light once again, looking as dignified
          as before.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge smiled meaningfully, not saying anything. He looked into
          the distance as he thought about something. It was about time the
          other young prodigies arrived. However, the injuries he had sustained
          for his entire charade weren&#8217;t grievous enough.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!* Suddenly, the Golden Decree rose into the air, glowing with a
          blinding light. It looked like a great star, suddenly expelling a
          powerful sword aura. Gu Changge stood up at the same time, eyes
          bright. While his clothes were covered in blood, his energy was
          rapidly increasing. Powerful energy exuded from the top of his skull,
          surrounded by multicoloured light, and shot into the sky. It was
          enough to gain everyone else&#8217;s attention. The cells all over his
          body were now all active and filled with energy.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What is he planning to do?&#8221; The Chosen Monk Jin Chan,
          still fighting against the Successor of Demonic Arts, was stunned by
          the display. He might be the weaker side and had to occasionally
          defend himself against the four Sacred Lord Realm experts, but he
          still had some leeway.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He had already noticed that the Successor of Demonic Arts had greatly
          exhausted his strength and wasn&#8217;t as undefeatable as he seemed
          to be. That the Successor of Demonic Arts had been seriously wounded
          in his fight with Gu Changge, and was just holding on stubbornly.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, the other Sacred Lord Realm experts were occupied with
          maintaining the condensed Grand Flask. Thus, Jin Chan guessed that
          Prince Chen&#8217;s Protective Soul Amulet was bound inside. Just like
          Ying Shuang&#8217;s Golden Ancient Bell, it was a Sacred Emperor Grade
          artifact. Prince Shen, of a similar status as Prince Ying, would of
          course have a Sacred Emperor Grade artifact protecting him, and it was
          bound to be inside that Grand Flask. If he could occupy the Successor
          of Demonic Arts a little longer, he could defeat him and even avenge
          Prince Shen.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jin Chan had no idea why Gu Changge would rise suddenly and wield the
          Golden Decree in order to attack. He might have utilised a type of
          forbidden technique.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Do you think this worth it, Young Master Changge?&#8221; He
          shook his head, chanting Buddha scriptures.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You still have some abilities, huh, Gu Changge? You
          can&#8217;t stand it any longer?&#8221; Just when Jin Chan sighed, the
          Successor of Demonic Arts suddenly laughed coldly. His aura changed as
          the Demonic Qi around them became thicker. Just as Jin Chan realised
          something was wrong and tried to retreat with a stricken expression, a
          blade consisting of condensed black runes which swirled with a black
          flame appeared from thin air and stabbed through him. It split the air
          and whooshed through him, leading to a widening crevice in the void.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jin Chan became pale and spat blood, using his might to crush that
          demonic blade and retreat. He hadn&#8217;t expected the Successor of
          Demonic Arts to still conceal some of his abilities. [It seems both
          the Successor of Demonic Arts and Gu Changge have not shown their full
          might even till now. How patient of them!]
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This similarity made him want to curse and he had no choice but to
          use his Buddha light to dispel the black fog. His injury was difficult
          to heal and he needed time to recuperate. At least it was a small
          injury, which did not harm his Source, which made him feel
          relieved.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Don&#8217;t you have more to show?&#8221; Gu Changge appeared
          calmly in the sky, face still pale. The Golden Decree dropped as if
          heeding his order to kill, the golden writing spreading out infinitely
          and descending. The ground cracked at the impact, the sky changing in
          colour. It was a terrifying sight.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Successor of Demonic Arts’ ability was destroyed by the Sword Qi.
          His eyes widened at once and he spat blood with a disbelieving
          expression.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh, no! He&#8217;s mad! He wants to burn away his Source and
          Blood Essence. I’ve failed to foresee this! Retreat! Retreat
          immediately!&#8221; With the final order, he led the Sacred Lord Realm
          experts away in a bid to flee. The void blurred for a moment to reveal
          an already-opened portal and he stepped in without hesitation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Above them, the grey fog had split as beams of light descended.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All the young prodigies had also arrived at the scene. They had all
          seen the shocking sight and felt rattled to the core, nearly ready to
          prostrate themselves.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

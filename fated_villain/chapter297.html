          businessmen, hence their complicated web of connections. In fact, a
          prodigy from the Tang Family possessed a business Talent that was
          perceived as one in a million, and thanks to that, he was able to
          carry the insignificant family to its current state, which even
          Immortal Families wouldn&#8217;t dare to belittle.</span

          were too afraid to speak a word. Anyone, including the favoured young
          ones, that dared to interrupt him whenever he was venting his vexation
          would be confined for three months as punishment.</span

          and he let out a scoff. &#8220;Attempting to deceive the Tang Family,
          does that brat from the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan think I&#8217;m
          blind?&#8221;</span

          higher-ups of the Tang Family below him, in which they expressed their
          disconcertment and anger. Even a blind could see it was a scheme
          deliberately set up by Yin Mei.</span

          >Alas, in spite of that realisation, the witnesses back then were
          eliminated the moment Yin Mei showed up as she promptly dealt with
          them and disintegrated their bodies and souls in order to erase any
          evidence. And as for Innkeeper Zhu, he must have been murdered or
          hidden somewhere by Yin Mei to keep his mouth shut.</span

          >Therefore, even if the Tang Family wished to trace back to the
          incident, they wouldn&#8217;t have any witnesses to turn to as they
          could only grit their teeth and swallow their frustrations. After all,
          each of those present in the palace were crafty individuals who had
          been a part of the Alliance of Thousand Merchants for years, so such a
          scheme was blatantly apparent to them.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          couldn&#8217;t openly declare their allegation as they didn&#8217;t
          have any proof to back it up.</span

          stone she delivered is solely to send a message.&#8221; Old Master

          would aggravate into a conflict that would involve more than simply
          Yin Mei and Tang Wan. Essentially, the Tang Family were aware of their
          place in front of the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan.</span

          Feng, who was also the father of Tang Tian and Tang Wan. Although he
          was frustrated about the problem his own son caused, he couldn&#8217;t
          do anything about it, given that his own son was too ignorant to fall
          into the hands of others. Thus, he could blame no one but Tang Tian,
          thinking that there wouldn&#8217;t be so much trouble if it
          weren&#8217;t for his pervertedness.</span

          let Tang Wan tend to this herself. Since she is his older sister and
          the enemy is clearly targeting her. Do you think it&#8217;s wise for
          us to intervene? Besides, we are at fault in this, and the old ones in
          the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan would be sure to give me a hard time if
          things go out of hand. I&#8217;ve been feeling that they are eyeing my
          position lately, since the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan has been planning to
          dominate the world from within the Alliance of Thousand
          Merchants…&#8221; Old Master Tang scornfully stated.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, the higher-ups of the Tang Family grew silent as they
          acknowledged the reasons in his words. The Gifted Lady of the
          Nine-Tailed Fox Clan made it quite obvious that she was targeting Tang
          Wan. Therefore, the Tang Family couldn&#8217;t afford to intervene at
          such a moment or the minor feud would worsen into an unsalvageable war
          between the Tang Family and the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan.</span

          stipulating certain benefits from her hands. What a thoughtful kid,
          Tang Wan is, huh? She obviously wants the family to help her while she
          retains the benefits in her own hands. Hmph! Does she think I

          &#8220;She clearly wants to take advantage of the family&#8217;s
          influence so that her words would seem weightier. Her motives all
          these years haven&#8217;t gone unseen. At this point, the enemy has

          family, Tang Wan was left in stupefaction and disbelief. Her rate of
          succeeding would have been higher if her family would send some
          formidable experts over to back her up, but unfortunately, that
          wasn&#8217;t the case, and all it took was one photographic stone from

          >&#8220;What condition?&#8221; Hearing that, Tang Wan was rather
          relieved, though she retained her iciness as she asked the question.
          [Yin Mei doesn&#8217;t seem to bear any ulterior motive. Was the omen
          of danger I saw earlier not from her?]</span

          >&#8220;Hand over your power over the major ancient cities
          you&#8217;re controlling.&#8221; With a casual look, Yin Mei added,
          &#8220;You know that I haven&#8217;t been in power for long. People
          don&#8217;t have enough trust in me, so I can only turn to this. I
          hope you can forgive me for the offence I&#8217;ve
          caused.&#8221;</span

          you?&#8221; Tang Wan was somewhat comforted by Yin Mei&#8217;s words
          as her alertness notably waned. She was worried that Yin Mei might not
          voice her demands as that would have been a real trouble.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll agree with that, but if you think
          you&#8217;ll gain control just because of this? I&#8217;m afraid you
          couldn&#8217;t be any more wrong.&#8221;</span

          condition…&#8221; Yin Mei continued with a smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Second condition? Aren&#8217;t you overstepping here?&#8221;
          Annoyance surged on Tang Wan&#8217;s face. &#8220;Yin Mei, know your
          boundaries. Control your greed or things will get ugly.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re not saving your brother anymore, Lady Wan?
          Nevermind, I&#8217;ll confine him for a little longer, then. The Tang
          Family can&#8217;t do anything to me anyway.&#8221; Imitating Gu
          Changge&#8217;s mannerism, Yin Mei chuckled as she lifted the glass of
          wine on the table and put it at her lips before chugging it down. Her
          attitude indicated her condescension towards Tang Wan.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Fine, I agree with your second condition.&#8221; Despite her
          perturbation, Tang Wan reluctantly concurred to Yin Mei&#8217;s second
          condition. Though, she felt more reassured as she grew even more at
          ease. Her preceding anxiousness wasn&#8217;t even
          mention-worthy.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although Yin Mei was quite greedy, it was nothing out of the ordinary
          to Tang Wan. Nonetheless, she had to feign reluctance and displeasure
          as well as her helplessness towards Yin Mei.</span

          where&#8217;s my brother?&#8221; Tang Wan asked again, seemingly more
          unaffected. Essentially, any slight disturbance in Sky View Pavilion
          would draw the attention of the entire city, so she wasn&#8217;t
          concerned that Yin Mei would pull off any reckless stunts.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;As for my last condition…&#8221; Yin Mei retained her smile.
          &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I promise this is the last one.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to see to my brother&#8217;s safety
          first,&#8221; Tang Wan said with a frown as she did not agree right
          away, since she predicted Yin Mei would be wanting more.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At such a fine opportunity, there was no way Yin Mei would only voice
          two demands, but Tang Wan was aware that she couldn&#8217;t be
          manipulated by Yin Mei the entire way, fearing that Yin Mei would go
          back on her words upon their agreements as she never trust an oath to
          a cultivator’s Dao Heart. After all, the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan was
          known for their cunningness, and they even possessed a Secret
          Technique to dispel the curse of breaking a Dao Heart Oath.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Hmm…&#8221; Hearing that, Yin Mei hesitated, seemingly
          troubled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I understand. I, Tang Wan, swear on my Dao Heart that I will
          fulfil each one of the conditions I promised Yin Mei. Should betrayal
          occur, I shall be struck by lightning and tormented as each of my
          cells turn to ash.&#8221; Observing Yin Mei&#8217;s expression, Tang
          Wan let out a scoff as she instantly knew what she was thinking, after
          which she straightforwardly swore.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you straightforward, Sister Wan? I love
          it.&#8221; At once, Yin Mei subconsciously laughed aloud and even
          changed her form of address to Tang Wan.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Very well, then. Follow me.&#8221; Having said that, she
          slightly moved her body and left Sky View Pavilion along with her
          servants.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, Tang Wan stopped suspecting Yin Mei since she was
          the one who suggested to see Tang Tian, unless Yin Mei also foresaw
          this. Besides, she was quite confident in her own acting skills.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Judging by the atmosphere of their conversation earlier, everything
          went perfectly according to her prediction, and Yin Mei didn&#8217;t
          seem to bear any other intentions as well. Nevertheless, to be safe,
          Tang Wan brought along a number of formidable experts, including those
          in the Sacred Noble Realm with one in the Sacred Lord Realm hiding
          among them as an element of surprise if anything were to happen.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          assiduous she was now.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, she followed Yin Mei and left Sky View Pavilion towards a
          palace-like residence.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"><br /> </span
        ><span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There, Tang Wan noticed Yin Mei entering a tranquil, delicate
          courtyard. Without much hesitation, she followed after her, while her
          group of formidable experts were stopped by Yin Mei&#8217;s servants
          at the entrance.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Wait for me here.&#8221; Tang Wan calmly nodded. She hid a
          jade talisman in her garment, which she could tear to inform the
          formidable experts outside if she was in danger.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Having entered the courtyard, Tang Wan was stunned by its
          extraordinary elegance as the ornamenting paintings and calligraphies
          were emitting a graceful sensation. Thereupon, she even wondered
          whether she went to the wrong place as she couldn&#8217;t find the
          connection between the sly Yin Mei and grace.</span

          >&#8220;Where&#8217;s my brother?&#8221; Seeing as Yin Mei stopped
          moving in the courtyard, Tang Wan questioned with a scowl.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          know, since we couldn&#8217;t have him tormented,&#8221; Yin Mei
          casually replied as she continued walking forward.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, Tang Wan could see an underground prison in the
          depths of the courtyard, and she was relieved, but before she could
          take a few steps forward, she found herself dumbfounded as a
          spine-chilling aura overtook her body, trembling even her soul while
          she had goosebumps all over her body.</span

          instantaneously figured out the connection between the incidents in
          the past and the present. It was as though everything became clear to
          her.</span

          stretched across the horizon. It looked mottled, with terrifying Chaos
          Qi laced in it. The land below was chaotic and filled with various
          broken World Principles. If an ordinary cultivator were to make
          contact with these Principles, their body would be blown to
          bits.</span

          off an unyielding feeling. Meanwhile the young woman next to him was

          couldn&#8217;t help sighing as she swept her gaze across the

          the Aether Abyss.</span

          Sky Deer City after leaving from the pavilion&#8217;s secret
          passageway. Fortunately, they never let their guard down the entire
          journey and left Sky Deer City through the path Lin Wu set up long
          ago, arriving at the Aether Abyss without alarming anyone.

          admonish us anymore. Without the barrier, Sky Deer City has no way of
          defending itself against the Upper Realm Army.&#8221; Though both
          exhaled audibly, Lin Wu was heaving a sigh of relief, feeling like a
          weight had finally been lifted off his shoulders.</span

          >In his hand was a bronze box that contained an Array Core of Sky Deer
          City. Slivers of mysterious glowing energy, which made one&#8217;s
          heart race, flowed around the box. It made it look like an ancient
          world was contained within it.</span

          half a year, Lin Wu believed his life was safe for the time being.

          danger.</span

          Song Chan asked with doubt as she couldn&#8217;t help recalling what
          she saw back in Sky Deer City.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had witnessed the terrifying scene of Gu Changge annihilating
          Zhao Yunze, the greatest in his generation sixty million ago,
          twice.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To her, Gu Changge was lofty, mysterious, and incredibly powerful. He
          was not someone mere mortals could ever hope to defeat. Even her
          Master, the Sky Deer Goddess, whom she thought was invincible, also
          fell into Gu Changge&#8217;s hands. If it weren&#8217;t to save her
          Master, Song Chan probably would never dare to approach someone like
          him her whole life.</span

          simultaneously comforting himself.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Back then, in what they called theVoid Realm at the Boundary Marker
          Sea, Gu Changge had indeed promised to let them go but never said
          anything about releasing Lu Luo. Hence, she was still taken away by
          the man.</span

          gradually becoming blurry.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The next moment, a slender, dashing white figure stepped out. As he
          approached the two, the mysterious mist enveloping him gradually
          dispersed, allowing his originally blurry face to become more
          apparent.</span

          >Song Chan was stupefied when she saw the heavenly young man, having a
          hard time coming to herself. If it weren&#8217;t for the fact that she
          had witnessed Gu Changge&#8217;s terrifying powers, she would never
          believe the otherworldly man before her eyes was him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the other hand, Gu Changge disregarded the young woman entirely
          after taking a gander at her. Instead, he gazed at Lin Wu, who was
          looking warily at him, and smiled. &#8220;Have you completed the
          task?&#8221;</span

          >Chills instantly ran down Lin Wu&#8217;s spine. He had even planned
          on contacting Gu Changge with the brand inside of him, but little did
          he think Gu Changge would appear before his eyes so suddenly. It was
          as though his every action was within the man&#8217;s control, and the
          notion made him shudder.</span

          >He didn&#8217;t doubt that there was more than one Array Cores to the
          Sky Deer City&#8217;s array. Besides, the array would become
          incomplete when one piece had been removed, and the defence would be
          greatly weakened. In fact, now, they would be able to rip open a space
          rift in certain areas with ease.</span

          instead continued to gaze warily at the latter.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I hope you can keep your promise of sparing Lu Luo and remove
          the thing you’ve left inside me. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll open the box
          right away. If I do so, the Array Core will return to Sky Deer City by
          itself. If you don&#8217;t agree, I won&#8217;t let your scheme
          prevail, even if it&#8217;s the last thing I do,&#8221; Lin Wu
          threatened warily, then pointed to Song Chan. &#8220;Also, this is the
          Sky Deer Goddess&#8217; disciple, Song Chan. She wants to see that her
          Master&#8217;s is safe and sound.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Though rumours of the Sky Deer Goddess having betrayed the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains and had become Gu Changge&#8217;s concubine
          had spread, no one knew its validity. After all, none of the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains cultivators had seen the Goddess with their
          own eyes.</span

          of accident, or better yet, the Upper Realm had only deliberately

          morale.</span

          liking to your beloved and wants to make her his servant,&#8221;
          taunted Gu Changge with a plain smile, making nothing of Lin

          He gritted his teeth and handed Gu Changge the bronze box
          unwillingly.</span

      <h4>
        Chapter 195: Not Afraid of an Evil Villain, Just Afraid of a Handsome
        One; An Irresistible Charm
      </h4>
      <p>
        The aftermath of the battle shrouded an area of ??nearly 300,000 miles,
        as heaven was turned upside down, and the sun and the moon shifted
        positions.
      </p>
      <p>The universe itself trembled in place.</p>
      <p>
        Many of the True Dragon Clan’s islands and mountain ranges were crushed
        into powder by the terrifying pressure, as even the Ancient Immortal
        formations filled with boundless killing intent were erased by the might
        of a Quasi-Supreme the moment they soared into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>The other battle was also over.</p>
      <p>
        Thousands of star fragments scattered in all directions, turning the
        land into a burial ground of stars, surging between Heaven and Earth.
      </p>
      <p>The divine lights that covered the world, falling down!</p>
      <p><b>Buzz!!</b></p>
      <p>
        A golden Dao path stretched out towards the endless sky. The Great Elder
        had returned, his perfect white robe fluttering, looking like the
        paragon of an Orthodox Cultivator. Seemingly untouched, none could
        imagine that he had just fought an earth-shattering battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him, the True Dragon Clan’s Quasi-Supreme existence was sealed
        within a huge palm! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>[Kshn: Don’t ask me how someone can be sealed in a palm.]</p>
      <p><b>“Are we done?”</b></p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder's calm expression had hints of annoyance mixed in,
        showing his reluctance to take action from beginning to end.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the sole exception of suppressing the Dragon Clan’s strongest
        existence, he didn’t even participate in any of the following battles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s sudden revelation about his identity as the Heir of the
        Ancient Deity of Reincarnation had also shocked the Great Elder. He
        originally imagined that Gu Changge would borrow the power of the
        Ancient Immortal Gu Family in order to face the True Dragon Clan, he
        didn’t think about the possibility of such an astounding matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It seems that the identity as the Heir of the Ancient Deity of
        Reincarnation was Gu Changge’s ultimate trump card all along.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, the Great Elder couldn't help but take a deep look at
        Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It is getting more and more difficult to see through him. Exactly how
        many methods has he secretly hidden in the dark, not known to the
        world?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The fact that Xian’er’s grudge with him had already been resolved was a
        fortunate one, for if it had continued…’ the Great Elder could not
        imagine how harsh Gu Xian’er’s life would’ve been, attempting to face Gu
        Changge's onslaught alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If it weren’t for a group of old monsters like them supporting and
        backing Gu Xian’er, I’m afraid that Gu Changge would probably have eaten
        up all her bones by now.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“It's over. My apologies for having bothered the Great Elder.”</b> Gu
        Changge smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Don't even bother. Just remember what you have promised this old
          man.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>The Great Elder snorted coldly.</p>
      <p>
        He waved his sleeves dismissively and the suppressed True Dragon Clan’s
        powerhouse was momentarily released from his seal, appearing in front of
        Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Please rest assured, Great Elder. I won’t forget my promise...”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s face was apathetic as he glanced at the slumped True Dragon
        Clan’s powerhouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, he looked at the horizon in the distance, his eyes sweeping across
        the many powerful cultivations in the vicinity.
      </p>
      <p>His lips curved slightly.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“As the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace’s successor, Changge indeed has
          an obligation to clean up and pacify the chaos of the True Dragon Clan
          for the Palace.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The various Daoist Sects and Ancient Immortal Races watching from a
        distance burst into commotion immediately, not fully comprehending the
        meaning of Gu Changge’s words.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Huh?”</b></p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, you...”</b></p>
      <p>
        Even the Great Elder was confused for a moment, wondering why Gu Changge
        would decide to say that in front of the many Daoists present.
      </p>
      <p>And only after the realization sank in—</p>
      <p><b>“It's too ruthless! How goddamn shameless!”</b></p>
      <p>
        His snowy-white brows jumped! A stormy kind of anger quickly rose within
        his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace had always prided itself in being neutral,
        and its policy was to never interfere with the power struggles and
        grievances of other Dao Sects and Immortal Clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace had not provided Gu Changge
        with a single iota of help in this fight, though he was their only heir.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet Gu Changge’s current words were clearly meant to tell everyone that
        the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace had taken the initiative to help him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of speaking about his and the Great Elder’s personal agreement…
      </p>
      <p>The Great Elder knew exactly what Gu Changge was plotting.</p>
      <p>
        He had understood it almost instantaneously and it made him furious to
        the extreme!
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only did that b*****d want to muddy the waters of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent, but he was also trying to find a way to drag the
        entire Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace alongside him, making them his
        accomplices!
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge succeeded, forces from Immeasurable Heaven would feel that
        the matter of unifying the Ancient Immortal Continent this time
        possessed the direct involvement and intent of the Heavenly Dao Immortal
        Palace behind it.
      </p>
      <p>Would this assumption not divert everyone’s vision from Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>
        Would it not let him gain benefits unharmed, while letting the Heavenly
        Dao Immortal Palace take the blame?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder’s face contorted with outright anger. He was furious!
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, he really could not refute Gu Changge’s statement at the
        moment, since only a few people truly knew about the agreement they had
        that day.
      </p>
      <p><b>“The Great Elder's kindness, Changge will keep it in mind.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's face showed a slight smile before melting back into
        indifference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“However, Great Elder, it seems you still owe me a favour. So don't
          forget that either.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Great Elder’s cultivation base was not very evident, Gu
        Changge knew that it should be far beyond the Quasi-Supreme Realm, and
        might even be better than his father and Gu Nanshan’s cultivation base
        if they were to be compared.
      </p>
      <p>Hence, he must firmly take hold of this precious ‘favour’.</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it would be used as his “Protective Talisman” one day. Moreover,
        he felt that there was nothing wrong with having the influential
        Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace block some incoming storms for him
        occasionally, so he just said it casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        The many cultivators in the outside world felt that he coerced the
        elders into taking action in some way to achieve his goal.
      </p>
      <p>And that was true.</p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, in Gu Changge’s view, he needed something more. He needed
        the cultivators from the outside world to think that the Heavenly Dao
        Immortal Palace was taking the initiative to plan all these schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he had become quite famous recently. The limelight that was
        Gu Changge’s was on the verge of overshadowing everyone. Unfortunately,
        the more those pesky cultivators and creatures pay attention to him, the
        harder it was for him to plan his schemes in secrecy; stealing the
        benefits for himself while pushing the blame onto others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had always liked to make his fortunes secretly in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        He treated Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace like a chess piece, no different
        from others, maybe even more than some.
      </p>
      <p>Whether it might be effective or not was another matter entirely.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If Great Elder thinks that Changge's approach was wrong… you could
          always explain it once more. I’m sure there are still many cultivators
          who would believe—”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge continued to smile. His prediction of the Great Elder’s
        temperament had been spot on, and he calculated that at this time, the
        Great Elder would not say much at all.
      </p>
      <p>His goal... was thus achieved.</p>
      <p>
        For him, angering the Great Elder was not worth caring about at all. It
        was better to consider how he would unify the Ancient Immortal Continent
        next.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Ahem!”</b></p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder, with an extremely gloomy face, interrupted his spiel,
        walking into the void angrily with his sleeves in a fuss, as the void
        quickly blurred around him and swallowed him whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        He then decided that from today onwards, all Heavenly Dao Immortal
        Palace affairs would be left to the current Palace Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shamelessness of Gu Changge was peerless underneath the Heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was to the point where the Great Elder was helpless, unable to
        control him.
      </p>
      <p>So why not just go into seclusion and cleanse his soul for a while?</p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, one day, he really might become unable to resist killing this
        shameless junior.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Come, clean up the True Dragon clan, and kill those who don't
          obey!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“From today onwards, I just want to hear only one voice in the True
          Dragon Clan.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s faint smile now vanished completely.</p>
      <p><b>“Yes, Master!”</b></p>
      <p>A tsunami of sound rang out from behind him.</p>
      <p>
        The mighty armies of the three major clans soon began to resolve the
        remnants of the rebellious True Dragon Clan, rooting out their stubborn
        nature like weeds in a garden.
      </p>
      <p>Refusal to submit would result in death.</p>
      <p>They killed them without any mercy.</p>
      <p>
        Obedient creatures are what this world lacks the least, and are a dime a
        dozen. There was no reason to tolerate disobedience. It was simply too
        annoying.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Master!”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Your order has been completed. All the True Dragon Clan rebels have
          been put to death.”</b

      <p>
        As the words fell, a majestic and overwhelming might bore down upon the
        world!
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side, the Quasi-Supreme ancestors of the Ancient Serpent,
        Black Heavenly Eagle, and Divine Crocodile Clans had suppressed many
        True Dragon Clan powerhouses and were currently in the midst of running
        back to Gu Changge to present the fruits of their labour.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Very good.”</b></p>
      <p><b>“Well done.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge swept his gaze through the many sights below and showed his
        satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>Then he nodded and waved his hands to dismiss them.</p>
      <p>
        The appearance of the three major clans would definitely arouse the fear
        of the other clans, but Gu Changge was considering hiding them in the
        dark for a while longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally after solving the issues of the True Dragon Clan, Gu Changge had
        time to start thinking about his ‘fellow otherworlder’.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his speculation, even Yue Mingkong might not know of her existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason being, a transmigrator… was a massive anomaly, just like
        himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong’s previous life experience wouldn’t help her here because
        it was unknown if the existence of transmigrators was there in that
        timeline or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        But since she took the initiative to appear in front of Gu Changge, he
        would find her tracks eventually, even if he needed to dig a thousand
        feet under the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Unless she is the unluckiest type of transmigrator, she must possess a
        golden finger[1] and would quickly become well renowned in this world.’
      </p>
      <p>[1: Crazy-a*s system or Ability]</p>
      <p>
        It’s just that Gu Changge did not know whether that transmigrator had
        come to this world before him or after.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next thing to do was to facilitate the unification of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent’s various clans. With this power, it can provide him
        with a lot of cultivation resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        The True Dragon Clan alone would have no shortage of good things that
        are useful to him!
      </p>
      <p>
        It might even be possible to obtain some of the essence and true blood
        left by their Dragon Progenitor back then. For Gu Changge, those were
        all great benefits he could easily reap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, his Immortal Devouring Demonic Arts’ Cultivation Base reached
        the peak of the Quasi-Sacred Realm, only missing a bit of cultivation
        essence needed to breakthrough to the actual Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, Gu Changge would be able to condense many more Black Dao
        Bottles once he had reached the Sacred Realm, which would help him
        swallow and refine the remaining wisps of the Fairy Spirits.
      </p>
      <p>His cultivation would soar by leaps and bounds by then.</p>

        <b

          defeated by Gu Changge after a long and harrowing battle but escaped
          his hands at the last minute. Furthermore, there has been no real
          trace of him found for so long. And though there are still Young
          Supreme existences being attacked or killed, they had all been
          targeted in a sneaky manner. Hence, we can conclude that the Forbidden
          Demonic Art's Inheritor was severely injured by Gu Changge, an injury
          not easy to cure at that.”</b

          assume that his cultivation is not as simple as it is on the

        Upon a lofty, ancient warship, Qi and vitality intertwined. A majestic
        scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Immortal Wang Family masters were currently discussing and
        debating. Whether it be the older or younger generations, their
        expressions were filled with amazement and slight envy, their hearts
        palpitating erratically due to the shocking nature of the developing
        situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although they did not intervene in the prior battle, they were able to
        observe and scrutinize everything from beginning to end.

        The wild joy and excitement that came from Wang Zijin’s return from the
        Human Ancestral Hall felt as if it had been hit right in the face by a
        basin of cold water, cooling down immensely.
      </p>
      <p>What an insane scene!</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin wasn’t the only younger generation cultivator who was
        dazzling beyond belief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her talent was unique throughout the ages, and she had practised in the
        Human Ancestral Hall, so her cultivation speed would eclipse most
        cultivators by miles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking through a small realm in half a month, and a big realm in half
        a year. A breakthrough was as simple as drinking water and eating food
        for the Young Miss of the Immortal Wang Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she was but a member of the younger generation after all and
        had not yet inherited the full might of the power backing her.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Gu Changge was already in charge of everything. The
        forces in his hands alone could make them all deeply fearful of him!
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention anything else, but just the three clans; Black Heavenly
        Eagle, Ancient Serpent, and Divine Crocodile Clans were enough to
        contend against many Daoist Sects and Immortal Clans, able to sweep the
        world aside.
      </p>
      <p>Three Quasi-Supreme ancestors were no mere joke!</p>
      <p>
        A normal Quasi-Supreme was a peerless power who could lift a palm to
        shatter the stars, and rend the continent with a ray of breath, a
        profound existence even in the greatest of Dao Sects and Immortal Clans!
      </p>
      <p>
        Without any Supreme Realm or Dao Enlightened[2] existence around, the
        Quasi-Supreme Realm was an invincible and unbeatable character!
      </p>
      <p>
        [2: Dao Enlightened are existence in the realm above the Supreme Realm,
        which is Emperor Realm.*]
      </p>
      <p>
        If they really compared, in terms of power, then they were afraid that
        the current head of the Immortal Wang family actually needed to be
        polite when he sees Gu Changge, right?
      </p>
      <p>It was almost unimaginable.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This method seems to be simple, but in fact, it is meticulously
          interlocking. Even I can only see some clues of its arrangement. If I
          really want to investigate deeper, I am afraid it can be traced back
          to when the Ancient Immortal Continent first opened...”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This kind of long-term calculation really leaves this old man in
          admiration!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I am afraid there are not many people who can compare with him in
          this generation.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        On the ancient warship, hearing Wang Wushuang's words, the old monster
        of the Wang family couldn't help but say with a sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        The banner of justice wielded by Gu Changge played a big role in the
        battle of the True Dragon Clan and even they had to admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was obvious that he was plotting to secure the Ancient Immortal Races
        for himself, and not for some petty notion like justice.
      </p>
      <p>But so what?</p>
      <p>
        They were helpless and had no reason to take action. Would the Ancient
        Immortal Gu Family backing Gu Changge stand back like hapless chickens
        when they really took action?
      </p>
      <p>Impossible.</p>
      <p>
        Now Gu Changge was eating the biggest piece of meat in front of all the
        Daoist Sects and Immortal Clans, and yet they were all helpless to act,
        feeling depressed and in awe at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        These kinds of methods fully expressed the charm and wiles of the Young
        Master of one of the Ancient Immortal Families, rather than a simple
        cultivation talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        With such a young master there, how could the Daoist Family not be
        overjoyed?
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, because Gu Changge had revealed his sharp fangs, and
        controlled the terrifying powerhouses of the Ancient Immortal Continent,
        to the point where even the Quasi-Supreme ancestors obeyed him...
      </p>
      <p>
        The various Daoist Sects and Immortal Clans might pay attention and
        unite against him in the future.
      </p>
      <p>Gain and loss were intrinsically linked, virtually unavoidable.</p>
      <p>In the past, it was mere battles of youth, but now...</p>
      <p>The entire Upper Realm had gotten thrown into the mix!</p>
      <p>Who wouldn’t be afraid?</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Young Master, I'm afraid you’ll have to learn a bit from Gu Changge
          in the future.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>The old monster of the Wang family couldn't help but smile.</p>
      <p>
        Never blindly overpraise your opponent, but never belittle them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        He spoke such words in order to spur his Young Master on, who would be
        compared with Gu Changge in many aspects, as they were both heirs of
        their families.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the Immortal families have a long heritage, and it is
        impossible for the young master of any generation to collapse so
        casually.
      </p>
      <p>Not being as good as the other would not fundamentally harm them.</p>
      <p>
        So why would they engage in this type of petty, malicious belittling?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge is indeed very strong. In terms of schemes and methods, I
          am far inferior to him. I will admit this without shame.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“But Elder should not forget that these conspiracies are useless
          under absolute power. If Gu Changge didn't have the identity of being
          Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation, it would have been
          impossible for the three major clans to obey his orders...”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Wang Wushuang shook his head.</p>
      <p>
        Although he did admire Gu Changge’s intelligence, it was not a bone-deep
        admiration, and he thought that Gu Changge was just relying on this
        relationship to succeed in his schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without the help of those three clana, this battle would not be so easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing his words, Wang Zijin, who’d been staring at the figure in the
        distance, shook her head silently. Her expression had become quite
        strange.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Since the Young Master said so, then let me ask you, what does
          absolute power mean?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The old monster of the Wang family was happy to use this opportunity,
        and chuckled slightly, intending to educate his Young Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        The younger generation should have the will to fight, but this fight
        should not be one that was impossible to accept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since Wang Wushuang was born, there has always been arrogance in
        his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        His cultivation base was far inferior to his sister, who was born in the
        Sacred Realm. He recognized this and had nothing to say.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>However, Gu Changge was obviously younger than him in terms of age.</p>
      <p>
        Yet Wang Wushuang could not perceive his cultivation base clearly and
        was only able to vaguely see it, knowing it to be unfathomable.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, he was a little unwilling and unconvinced of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the Clan Elder was berating him, and in front of his sister no
        less, the Immortal Wang Family’s Young Master could no longer bear it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Absolute power naturally refers to the true cultivation of an
          individual. No matter how strong Gu Changge is, it is impossible for
          him to surpass my sister in cultivation, right?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang spoke recklessly, the golden light in his eyes flowing,
        unable to sit still.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was usually impossible for him to rattle off such claims, but he was
        currently in a state of frustration upon seeing his sister, and couldn't
        think properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normal Young Supremes would never be able to accept such a situation.
        However, thanks to his far superior ambitions, Wang Wushuang was not too
        deeply affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Wushuang. There'll always be a higher sky, and there will always be
          a taller mountain. You have to remember this sentence. It was one
          someone said to me long ago.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Wang Zijin, who had been quiet for a long time, finally
        spoke up, with a voice like the sound of a Heavenly Chime.
      </p>
      <p>With a smile on her face, she looked at Wang Wushuang.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Wushuang, this younger brother, does not seem like he was an
        arrogant genius type, which made her a little satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, the sentence was for her as well.</p>
      <p>
        She used to think that she was very powerful but soon found that Gu
        Changge's methods and skills were unparalleled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the only two areas she could edge him out in were Cultivation
        Talent and Cultivation Base.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Kshn: It’s exactly the same thing dammit, why must you make it two?]
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Wang Zijin more and more curious and interested in Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a transmigrator, she was familiar with the various routines of
        novels, and also possessed a strong background and terrifying talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had stood at almost the pinnacle of these cultivators ever since she
        was born.
      </p>
      <p>So naturally, she got bored.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin actually wanted to find something that interested her, which
        was why she had planned to travel around the world.
      </p>
      <p>And just happened to meet Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        A native genius who did not seem to play by the rules of the system,
        completely different from the rest of the cannon fodder.
      </p>
      <p>His meticulousness had surprised her.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin continued to speak,
        <b
          >“Gu Changge's cultivation is not only as simple as what you see. To
          be honest, even I myself can't figure out what his realm is.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Sister, even you can't see his cultivation?!”</b></p>
      <p>
        This time, Wang Wushuang and the rest of the Immortal Wang Family’s
        Young Supreme around him were stunned, and couldn't help but stare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin's strength had most likely already reached the Quasi-Sacred
        realm, according to those elders of the clan.
      </p>
      <p>Yet she couldn't see through Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin nodded. For her, this kind of thing was not difficult to
        admit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Moreover, to easily utilize the imitation of a Dao Weapon, one's
          cultivation must surpass ordinary people by far. If I were to give you
          a replica of a Dao Weapon, could you utilize it as easily as Gu
          Changge did?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“And as for your statement that he is relying on his identity as the
          Heir of Ancient Deity of Reincarnation, then can you be like Gu
          Changge and let the three major clans obey your order if you were the
          heir?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“As long as the three major clans are not stupid, they won't agree to
          surrender to a young man so nonchalantly. If Gu Changge can make them
          surrender, that means that his methods are not simple at all.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin revealed her analysis and her understanding of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>A point of view that differed from others.</p>
      <p>
        When she finished speaking, everyone in the Immortal Wang Family on the
        ancient warship was silent for a while and some people took a breath,
        extremely shocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“As expected of the Young Miss, you can see things so thoroughly…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The old monster of the Wang family couldn't help but nod and laugh. He
        could see all this because he had lived a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        And since Wang Zijin could also see it, it could only mean that she was
        smarter than the average person and more talented.
      </p>
      <p><b>“I see.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Wang Wushuang went quiet for a while, and after thinking
        about Wang Zijin's words, he finally understood the difference between
        him and Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>He really couldn't do what Gu Changge did.</p>
      <p>Deep depression and unwillingness arose in his heart.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It's a pity. I heard that this Gu Changge has a marriage contract,
          otherwise, he and the young lady are actually quite a good match.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“But something like a marriage contract can be cancelled…”</b></p>
      <p>
        The old monster of the Immortal Wang Family suddenly sighed, feeling
        moved.
      </p>
      <p>If the two marry, it will definitely be a win-win situation.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Wang Zijin was slightly startled and her expression
        suddenly became a little weird. Why did he suddenly mention this kind of
        thing? Could it be that the fiance routine that she had been thinking
        about before was coming right now?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge tore up the marriage contract of the original heroine, then
        forged a marriage contract with her instead?
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from what Gu Changge did, he didn't look like a decent person.
      </p>
      <p>‘Hmm, it doesn't seem impossible.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Elder, does Gu Changge have a useless fiancee or something...”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        After thinking for a while, Wang Zijin worded her question well and
        asked tentatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        What the Clan Elder had said just now was too much like the rhythm of
        some kind of bloody broken routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“This…”</b> The Immortal Wang Family elder obviously did not expect
        Wang Zijin to ask such a question and was stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Xiu'er promptly answered,
        <b
          >“Miss, Young Master Changge's fiancée is the famous and influential
          Future Emperor of the Supreme Immortal Dynasty, Yue Mingkong. She has
          the appearance of a fairy, along with the temperament of an immortal.
          How could she be a waste?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Wang Zijin was a little disappointed all of a sudden.</p>
      <p>
        If she could nab a fiancé like Gu Changge, she would be fine, and won't
        get goosebumps just thinking about it like before.
      </p>
      <p>There was nothing wrong with being greedy.</p>
      <p>
        After all, no matter what world you are in, the most important feature
        is appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, Wang Zijin had always felt that she would never meet a
        young genius who would interest her and life would be smooth sailing
        like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, a protagonist's face was written as being unremarkable. A
        complete reversal from the type of man she wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she thought about various descriptions of the protagonist, her head
        started hurting and she lost interest quickly.
      </p>
      <p>This world is clearly not the world of women-oriented wuxia novels.</p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, it has a consistent male oriented and cultivation
        driven style. Thus, the protagonists must also be the ones who have to
        gradually become stronger, and climb up from being an underdog,
        fulfilling the so-called upgrade enthusiasm.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Gu Changge, although Wang Zijin has not contacted him yet, she
        could feel the subtle difference between him and the rest of those Young
        Supremes.
      </p>
      <p>And her gut feeling was never wrong.</p>
      <p>It might even be her golden finger ability in this new world.</p>
      <p>Wang Zijin suddenly remembered a sentence from her previous life.</p>
      <p>“Not afraid of an evil villain, just afraid of a handsome one.”</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Miss, since you've all come here, how about we drop by to meet Young
          Master Changge?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Seemingly becoming aware of Wang Zijin's disappointment, the Elder of
        the Immortal Wang Family suddenly asked this question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin was stunned when he heard the words, her expression remained
        unchanged, but with a smiling undertone,
        <b>“If that is what the Clan Elder wishes.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Miss, did you not say before that you were not interested...”</b>
        Xiu'er couldn't help but mutter when she saw this scene.

      <p>Wang Zijin flicked her forehead.</p>
      <p><b>“You talk too much.”</b></p>
      <p>At this time, inside Dragon Island.</p>

        Clan in a splendid and magnificent treasure house, suddenly heard a

        [*If you read our notes frequently, you might remember when the
        Ancestors of Black Heavenly Eagle Clan were introduced, there was a talk
        about how Supreme Realm can catch and Emperor Realm can identify the
        Immortal Devouring Demonic Arts and we said we don’t know which is above
        or below cause it wasn’t specified by the author. So now, there you have
        it. The Emperor Realm is above the Supreme Realm.]

          cultivate but they can remain ordinary mortals. Everyone says being a
          deity is good, but what do they know of our woes?&#8221; Gu Changge
          walked over with a warm smile, talking to her as if wanting her to
          relinquish all her worries..</span

          >&#8220;You&#8217;re right. The worlds of mortals and Immortals will
          always remain separated. Since they cannot cultivate, it&#8217;s a
          good idea to allow them to remain mortal. I hope they will get over
          this, as the world can be cruel.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin nodded and walked
          to his side, her gaze filled with an indiscernible emotion.

          >She had already calmed herself down; she had been unwilling to let
          this happen at first, but things would become much more complicated if
          she did not make a clean and quick break. Any lingering connection
          wasn&#8217;t a good thing for her nor for the others. From today
          onwards, she would begin her life of cultivation and that meant she
          had to sever herself from the mortal world.</span

          everything about the world of cultivation. With your Talent, it
          won&#8217;t take a long time for you to become a famous young prodigy
          in the Upper Realm,&#8221; Gu Changge said, a hint of surprise
          flashing across his eyes as he noticed the extreme change in her
          Fortuity. [She is truly worthy of being the reincarnation of the </span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;En.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin nodded, now feeling more relaxed. This
          might be considered unshackling to her. At the very moment, she now
          looked more otherworldly with her flowing dress and the flickering
          light between her eyebrows.</span

          >Yan Ji walked towards them with light steps, her expression cold and
          clinical as if it couldn&#8217;t be disturbed by anything. She looked
          to Xiao Ruoyin and said, &#8220;From today onwards, you will cultivate
          with me. I will teach you about some common knowledge in cultivating
          for this world as well as some easy techniques later.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yan Ji had been a mentor before, so training a disciple wasn&#8217;t
          hard for her. Besides, Gu Changge had already informed her about Xiao
          Ruoyin&#8217;s background and the woman might be able to awaken some
          memories of her past life very soon. All Yan Ji needed to do was to
          act the part.</span

      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Thank you, Master,&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin replied quickly, feeling
          respect for the woman. She felt some anticipation towards her future
          life of cultivating. Gu Changge nodded and motioned for Yan Ji to take
          her away. Yan Ji understood immediately and took the woman away with
          the reason of teaching her.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, Jiang Chen, Niu Tian and the others were still calling
          Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s name, yet her expression did not change nor did
          she turn her head even though she could hear them. As Gu Changge said,
          her life in the mortal world was already over and she no longer
          belonged in the same world as them. After a thousand years, they would
          be dust and buried somewhere unknown while she remained beautiful. It
          was best that she severed that connection now or there might be
          regrets.</span

          >&#8220;Come.&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at Jiang Chen and his
          companions, then waved a hand to summon several beings with strong
          auras and gave them an order.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          their expressions all solemn.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge left the place after that, appearing in a palace where Hei
          Yanyu had already brewed a pot of tea for him. Steam rose from the
          light green tea, making it look fresh and fragrant.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

          >&#8220;Prepare the army for battle. Purple Mansion shall be here
          soon,&#8221; Gu Changge said after taking a leisurely sip of tea.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He did not participate in the Immortal War. Nonetheless, he knew of
          the current situation there, and knew that Purple Mansion had secretly
          sent an army to rescue Sky King Zhi Yang. The Vermillion Bird Empire
          was falling to pieces but there was still one more step to go before
          its demise. Gu Changge mainly wanted Chu Hao and Qin Wuya to face each
          other. Otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t have gone through so much trouble.
          The tiny Empire wasn&#8217;t worth this much attention after
          all.</span

          orders.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After she left, Gu Changge began thinking of another issue. The
          Hidden Ji Family Su Qingge and Ji Qingxuan stemmed from. It could fall
          under his control with the right scheme in place. It was a formidable
          force after all. So, it would benefit him to have it as one of his
          pieces.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He had discerned that Ji Qingxuan had an unusually strong desire for
          power and status. Furthermore, her abilities were on par with that of
          her sister. It would be truly convenient if she took control of the Ji
          Family as she greatly feared him yet greatly relied on him. Thus, it
          would be easy for him to make her move for him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Other than that, Gu Changge had nearly completed his infiltration of
          the Tang Family in the Alliance of Thousand Merchants. The secret pawn
          he had placed, Tang Wan&#8217;s useless younger brother, should be
          acting by now.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There were not many coincidences in this world and such a great gift
          from the heaven that he gotten was merely a trap set in advance. With
          the power of the Immortal Entanglement Spell, Gu Changge could control
          the clans of the entire Ancient Celestial Continent, much less the
          Tang Family in the Alliance of Thousand Merchants. He could let Yin
          Mei control the Tang Family; that way, most of the power in the
          Alliance would belong to her. As for Tang Wan, he didn&#8217;t plan to
          let her control anything. Her only use was to become a trigger for the
          enmity between the two Fortuitous Ones. Other than that, she held no
          other purpose.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[During this time, Yue Mingkong should be busy gathering the Seven
          Tools of World Domination. Except for the Flask and the Jar which are
          within my possession, she may have gathered most of them. I&#8217;ll
          demand them from her when this is all done.] Gu Changge smiled
          slightly at the thought. Even if he didn&#8217;t demand it, she would
          bring them to him anyway when she had finished collecting them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After that, Gu Changge remembered something and waved a hand. A
          black-robed figure enclosed in black fog appeared in the void behind
          him, expression cold and cruel yet exuding Sacred Lord Realm strength.
          It was one of his Demonic Puppets!</span

          >&#8220;Greetings, Master!&#8221; the puppet said respectfully, a
          spark of life appearing within its eyes. Gu Changge nodded and waved
          his hand again, the black fog over the puppet&#8217;s face dissipating
          to reveal the face of a normal middle-aged man. After some thought, an
          indiscernible smile appeared on his features.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the next moment, the face of the puppet began to change. It soon
          became a cold-looking old man with a tall nose like an eagle&#8217;s
          claw. It gave an unsettling feeling.</span

          more merciful for Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s sake but when they were proven
          not to have any talent to cultivate, their true selves were revealed.

          Ruoyin&#8217;s words had been cruel but he knew there was nothing they
          could do. She did not believe that the test stone had been tampered

          >He continued discussing with the Artifact Spirit on the way down from
          the battleship. Now that he had thought of a way, his mood finally
          relaxed. However, Niu Tian, Wang Ning, and the others looked dejected,
          as if they hadn&#8217;t moved on from the news.

          same and cannot cultivate in this world. We may be killed a thousand
          times over if we ever encounter two fighting cultivators…&#8221; Song
          Ming, who had laughed at Jiang Chen, couldn&#8217;t stand the calm
          look on his face and spoke to him in a hostile tone. He was annoyed by
          that expression, as Jiang Chen was still acting unruffled in such a
          situation.

          >The other man had acted the same way during the test and everyone
          thought he might create some sort of miracle, yet he had been
          embarrassed greatly. Didn&#8217;t the stone remain unchanged as it had
          for everyone else? Jiang Chen even dared to say the stone was damaged
          and asked for another stone to undergo the test again. Only he would
          do something so undignified! Song Ming already had second-hand
          embarrassment from that situation. The others joined in as soon as
          they heard Song Ming&#8217;s words, their gazes full of mockery. This
          might be the only way they could express their frustration.</span

          He was tall and stocky and had been shown to have talent. It was
          average but was still superior to them. Everyone else was fearful and
          muttered under their breaths before falling silent.</span

          you are all blaming me now? How ironic,&#8221; Jiang Chen said mildly,
          letting them say what they want. He knew internally that he had the
          aptitude to cultivate, meaning he wouldn&#8217;t be with these
          condescending people for much longer.</span

          suddenly felt a fragrant-smelling presence sweep to his side. He
          looked back to see an anxious-looking Wang Ning. She didn&#8217;t know
          why he was so confident and felt there was a reason for his usual
          behaviour. He definitely knew something.</span

          never felt anything for her since all his attention was on Xiao
          Ruoyin, but now, with some focus on her, he could tell that she was a
          decent person. Since they were classmates, he didn&#8217;t mind
          telling her.</span

          it had been Xiao Ruoyin who had done this so she could get rid of
          them.

          become hopeful in such a dire situation.</span

          Didn&#8217;t you say you would take us somewhere safe? This
          isn&#8217;t safe at all!&#8221; One of them looked around, sounding
          irritated.

          ranges. Ivy and nettles hung from everywhere and heavy fog blocked the
          horizon. It was truly terrifying when accompanied by the sound of
          roaring beasts and the sight of flying birds. Where was the difference
          in abandoning them here carelessly compared to killing them? No
          cultivators would dare enter this place; how could they survive when
          they had never cultivated before?</span

          The being who had spoken smiled and showed his sharp teeth, looking
          extremely savage. Everyone became so frightened that they shook and
          didn&#8217;t dare speak.</span

          warning, nearly reacting too late. At the same time, a terrifying aura
          swept towards him from behind as a red light surged and made the
          nearby mountain range shake almost to pieces. Turning around, his
          pupils contracted as a panicked Wang Ning was hit by the red light
          before she could react, exploding into a puddle of blood.

          targeted by the red beam of light, evaporating before they could even
          scream. Those who responded quickly were so frightened that they fled
          into the distance, stumbling the entire time.</span

          anxiety and fear. His back was damp with a cold sweat and his limbs
          felt cold. If he had reacted just a little later, he would have ended
          up sharing the same fate as Wang Ning and the rest, being blasted into
          blood puddles. This scared him badly to the point his knees were
          weak.</span

          dog-eat-dog world, he would end up being killed as easily as an ant
          without any life-saving abilities. Besides, Jiang Chen hadn&#8217;t
          expected these beings to be so emboldened and ruthless by taking them
          here and not allowing them to leave. [This definitely was ordered by
          Young Master Gu!]</span

          killed them in front of Xiao Ruoyin. Doing that was just so he could
          make himself seem like a good person in her eyes. He had looked so
          genial and kind during the banquet, yet he had ordered his people to
          take their lives. [How could someone be so cruel? It just shows how
          one can never know another&#8217;s true intentions from their
          appearance! Damn it! They probably weren&#8217;t be as lucky as me… I
          doubt they can escape from these powerful beings, who can even easily
          traverse through sky&#8230;]</span

          Niu Tian had run in a different one from his. Besides, Niu Tian was
          much stronger than him; if Jiang Chen managed to escape, then Niu Tian
          might too.</span

          Jiang Chen gritted his teeth, cold with fury. He had known the other
          man was no decent man but hadn&#8217;t expected him to be this savage
          and wicked. He first pretended to agree to let them go but then

          a shade of white brighter than snow, looking almost otherworldly due
          to his ethereal and majestic aura. How could he act so cruelly? Did he
          really want them all dead? There was no hatred between them at
          all!</span

          stunned him. He could discern that it had been one of his companions;
          he was definitely killed. He became scared and didn&#8217;t dare to
          linger any longer, turning round and running deeper into the
          forest.</span

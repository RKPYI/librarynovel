<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge appeared outside the crack with lights glowing around him, reaching Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s side with just one step.</span><span id="more-28413"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you alright?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu blinked forward and asked as she observed him. Sensing that his aura was stable, unlike that of an injured person, she heaved a sigh of relief as she remembered his alarming injuries back when he was corroded by the Yin Energy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; Gu Changge waved as he calmly smiled. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t I a spoiled one to gain the concern of the glorious Saintess Chuchu herself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself. This started with me, so I won&#8217;t feel good if anything were to happen to you.&#8221; Upon those words, Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s worried face stiffened, after which she gazed at Gu Changge with a stone cold look as she explained herself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I agree. You&#8217;re worried about me.&#8221; Smiling, Gu Changge reached out his hand and wrapped it around her slender waist.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jiang Chuchu was about to deny it, her body and face suddenly froze. As if she was a stationary mud figure, she stood still upon Gu Changge&#8217;s intimate gesture. As goosebumps surged all over her snowy, delicate skin, she couldn&#8217;t tell what kind of emotion she was feeling right now. She detested Gu Changge, yet she couldn&#8217;t resist him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Gu Changge constantly bullied her and ferociously subdued her the first time they met before imprisoning her in his Inner World, and that, to her, was the darkest, most helpless time of her life. Followingly, she witnessed as Gu Changge deceived and murdered the Mortal One, which severely impacted Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s mind. Something that she had cultivated for more than twenty years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was the most terrifying being ever existed, yet he wouldn&#8217;t kill her despite the fact that she knew many of his secrets. He even rescued her and dealt with crises caused by the Eternal Overcast, numerous times for her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chuchu?&#8221; Suddenly, Gu Changge softly called for her, making her return from her messy thoughts as she peered at him confusedly with her bewitching eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu hinted him to proceed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you not going to show any sign of gratitude?&#8221; Gu Changge asked with a smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazed for a moment, Jiang Chuchu gently answered, &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that it?&#8221; Gu Changge tensed his brows, seemingly unsatisfied with her answer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you expect?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu stared at her. Ever since she tasted her supposed&#8217;reward&#8217;, she seemed to have grown bolder, talking back to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did you expect this to be a charity?&#8221; Gu Changge asked with an enthralling grin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jiang Chuchu started to give it a thought. [It does sound like a charity, doesn&#8217;t it, given that I haven&#8217;t really done anything? He, on the other hand, came all the way here and wasted so much time only to solve this minor problem, and a &#8216;thank you&#8217; is all I can give. How can I live with that? But again, given that he&#8217;s the most despicable man in the world, there&#8217;s nothing to feel sorry about, is there?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of pondering, Jiang Chuchu decided it was best to feign some sincerity as she might need his help again in the future. Thus, she blandly said, &#8220;That is not my concern. You started all this. Such problems wouldn&#8217;t have occurred had you not killed the Mortal One. But still, I am very grateful f—&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu didn&#8217;t manage to finish her sentence as her mouth was covered. Her dashing eyes widened as her intricate fist landed on Gu Changge, letting out a frightening shockwave. No ordinary cultivator would have survived that punch as they would instantaneously explode and turn to dust. Her strength was remarkably forceful, and it was even more terrorizing when she exerted it out of instinct as she was taken by surprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, no matter how hard she struggled, she couldn&#8217;t unshackle herself. Eventually, she let out a *hmph!* through her nose as she grew too lazy to shake Gu Changge off. Since it was hardly the first time he bullied her this way, she was already used to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chuchu?&#8221; Gu Changge blurted with a grin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu looked at him with her beguiling eyes, and she appeared much calmer than usual. She wasn&#8217;t even affected by how Gu Changge affectionately called for her, as if it was nothing out of the ordinary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge was always picky about girls, not many of them were able to pique his interest. Not only was Jiang Chuchu useful to him as she could help him locate Eternal Overcast Sources, but she also somehow managed to draw his liking. Therefore, naturally, he didn&#8217;t mind treating her with some tenderness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chuchu, were you expecting me to do something to you?&#8221; Nonetheless, the next moment, Gu Changge let out a chuckle as he instantaneously blinked to a spot in another direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu, having shut both of her eyes as her lashes lightly shook, was stunned upon Gu Changge&#8217;s words. Instantly, she opened her eyes and realised what was happening before a pair of blush surged on her exquisite, flawless cheeks. Her face was filled with anger and embarrassment as she glared at him coldly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, you damn bastard!&#8221; Jiang Chuchu vexedly exclaimed with her icy voice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why? Are you disappointed?&#8221; Gu Changge grinned as he stood in the sky far away. As his white robe swayed, he appeared outworldly extraordinary and elegant, as though he was ascending the stairway to heavens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, to Jiang Chuchu, the smile on his face was nothing but that of a horrible, loathsome scum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why do you always bully me?&#8221; Disaffection surged in her heart yet her face remained cold. She already compromised to this state, yet Gu Changge still teased her as usual. As such, she, who tended to stay away from quarrels, almost gritted her teeth and reprimanded the man, though she managed to control her emotions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When have I ever bullied you?&#8221; Gu Changge leisurely stated, &#8220;I could hardly wait to pamper you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, Jiang Chuchu was infuriated by his shameless remark, thinking no man would ever pamper a woman like him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Though, I&#8217;ll consider this the reimbursement I desire. Well, stop dreaming about receiving charities from me all the time, and the next time you want my help, have some compensation ready for me, understand?&#8221; Gu Changge then added. Finished, he swung his arm and the air grew hazy as a path appeared. And in a flash, he vanished from the area.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it was said that he entered retreat to recover from his injuries, no one else other than Jiang Chuchu knew that he was here. Nevertheless, to ensure there were no flaws in his plans, he decided to return for now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I…&#8221; As Jiang Chuchu was thoroughly stupefied by Gu Changge&#8217;s words, immense hatred surged in her heart. [What was he implying by &#8216;stop dreaming about receiving charities all the time?&#8217; I already belong to him, yet he&#8217;s still thinking of taking advantage of me? Does that mean I&#8217;ll be bullied whenever I look for him for help from now on?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Regardless, he was the one who dealt with this Eternal Overcast crisis, but I am the one who takes credit for it while he asks for nothing…] Followingly, Jiang Chuchu thought of something else while her eyes remained fixated on the direction Gu Changge left as an unfading ripple occurred in her heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this, she never had the intention to have Gu Changge replace the Mortal One, and she, without the slightest hesitation, rejected him when he first brought it up. However, whenever the idea arose in her head now, she would be unable to resist it, as if it was a raging wildfire burning in her mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, she was the Successor of the Mortal Palace, so given Gu Changge&#8217;s reputation, she needed only to make one declaration and no one would ever doubt her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How are Young Master Changge&#8217;s injuries?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can see that he looks much better after all this time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s Young Master Changge, alright! In spite of the grave injuries, it only took him a few days to recover. Such a potent vitality must be more vigorous than that of the ancient races.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Indeed. We would have died if we were the one injured…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a merry day in Black Tortoise Empire as many were gathered in an extravagant palace. Countless young prodigies got together, including Yin Mei, Ying Yu, Gu Xianer, and Qing Feng, as well as a number of Elders of the Immortal Academy, who hurried over upon receiving the news.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, a few young prodigies were conversing, expressing their astoundment and awe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing in the centre of the palace, Gu Changge greeted his guests with a smile, though his face was still a little pale. It was the first time he showed himself to the outsiders after such a long time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before him, there was a set of chess with pieces of black and white. When his guests arrived, he was playing chess with Ji Qingxuan to kill some time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since he returned, he immediately commenced the planning for his next moves as the feud between the two Fortuitous Ones, Qin Wuya and Chu Hao, needed his aggravation from the dark. Naturally, his first move was to first eliminate Sky King Zhi Yang. But of course, this plan was only known to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instant, in the crowd&#8217;s eyes, Gu Changge&#8217;s cultivation level and aura bettered compared to before, though his injuries had yet to fully heal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge had his Source damaged, so it will take longer than usual for him to fully recover,&#8221; an Elder claimed, shaking his head as he withdrew his hands from checking out Gu Changge&#8217;s injuries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Gu Changge&#8217;s identity, he had all the Sacred Herbs and heavenly ingredients he could ever use. Still, their effects were insignificant, and that showed how scary his injuries were.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the crowd was left perturbed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for your concern, Elders.&#8221; Gu Changge revealed a smile. &#8220;I am sure this will take only half a month. It&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyway, Elders, have you received any news of Qing Xiaoyi nowadays? Or rather… news of Sky King Zhi Yang?&#8221; With that, Gu Changgei immediately went on a tangent and questioned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the atmosphere in the palace instantly changed. The smiling faces of the Elders froze as they were left speechless, while complex emotions arose on the faces of the young prodigies. [Sky King Zhi Yang!?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late, if the Successor of Demonic Arts was the most heated topic, then Sky King Zhi Yang would indubitably be the runner-up. Many were discussing that Sky King Zhi Yang might repeat Prince Ying&#8217;s mistakes, as the former was alleged to have kidnapped Qing Xiaoyi. Since she had the Celestial Demonic Physique, a unique physique, he might even be affiliated with the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Sky King Zhi Yang claimed to be pursuing the Successor of Demonic Arts, but he actually abducted Qing Xiaoyi. Thus, many would rather die than to believe that he wasn&#8217;t related to the Successor of Demonic Arts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, despite the recent world-trembling rumours, Sky King Zhi Yang had not shown himself, and many perceived that to be a coward&#8217;s act of escaping.</span></p>

          graced about the celestial mountains. It was a breathtaking sight to
          all who behold it. There were many people who had surrounded the
          place, all of them from the clans of the Celestial Ancient Continent.
          They were silent and respectful, as they stood behind Gu Changge, not
          daring to speak.</span

          Ruoyin inhaled deeply after hearing his words, finally calm. She
          stared at the Immortal Stone before her, which looked shiny and clear.
          There was some sort of mysterious mist flowing inside, which seemed to
          be able to liquefy at any moment. Inside this stone, there was a
          terrifying energy, which even she could feel from a distance.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge remained smiling, his gaze peaceful and undisturbed. The
          Nihility Destiny Physique&#8217;s power lay in Nilithy and its
          abstract existence, which does not appear in the fates within the
          Heavenly Path. Thus, making it ever more enigmatic.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge guessed that if he let her go, she would be discovered by
          cultivators from other forces who would take her back with them. After
          all, anyone could see how talented she was. It would not immediately
          be clear what physique she had to them, but it was obvious she was
          talented and would grow to be extremely powerful. Thus, the
          cultivation techniques and resources he mentioned before would just
          fall on her lap, and be a none issue. However, she didn&#8217;t know
          of this. Similarly, she did not know about her great aptitude for
          cultivating, which would cause innumerable forces to want to take her
          in as a disciple.

          >[And the day the Nihility Destiny Physique is complete, will be when
          her Fortuity will completely mature…] Gu Changge&#8217;s smile was
          mild, which was the same as usual, without any peculiarities. .

          >His gaze landed on Xiao Ruoyin, who remained in her spot, as she did
          not know what to do. Thus, he gently explained, &#8220;Lay your hand
          on the test stone. Seven colours might show red, orange, yellow,
          green, blue, indigo, and violet; The more colours you get, with violet
          being the highest point, the greater your aptitude for cultivating. If
          you don&#8217;t possess an ounce of talent for cultivating, the stone
          wouldn&#8217;t show any reaction.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin nodded at this with understanding. She did not hesitate
          any longer, and anxiously placed her hand on the stone.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!* Almost instantly after her hand touched it, the stone emitted
          a vibrating hum and a blinding light shone from the top. It was a
          flaming red at first, followed by orange, yellow, green… Almost
          instantly, the stone was illuminated by the seven colours. It looked
          extremely bright and brilliant.</span

      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;How terrifying. If this girl started cultivating earlier, she
          might already be in the Sacred Realm like Lady Yanyu.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sight shocked those from the Continent. Their eyes were wide with
          shock and envy as they stared at her and exclaimed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Did I succeed?&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin was shocked by this and did
          not know how to react for some time. From the remarks the others made,
          her aptitude seemed to be exceptional. Thus, her heart was filled with
          happiness and excitement. Even if she didn&#8217;t like surprises,
          this surprise was something she was delighted about. She had only
          hoped to possess some talent for cultivating. She did not expect that
          she was that gifted. Thus, she could not help but break out a wide
          smile from the pure joy she felt.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Gu, I didn&#8217;t disappoint you, did I?&#8221;
          Xiao Ruoyin then looked towards Gu Changge, her eyes sparkling with
          some strange emotion. Her tone sounded relieved. She hadn&#8217;t
          expected to want to share this joyful news with him first, as he was
          just a benefactor who she had just known earlier that day.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why would I be disappointed? I&#8217;m really happy that
          you’re so gifted&#8221; he replied with a smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;En. en. But, I can’t thank you enough for giving me this
          opportunity, Young Master Gu.&#8221; She nodded, feeling an
          unprecedented feeling of joy and relief.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You’re more gifted than many of the other young prodigies. You
          just need to work hard in cultivating, and you’ll eventually catch up
          to them. Not being inferior to them in the slightest.&#8221; He smiled
          once again.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ll find a Master for you who you can follow for your
          cultivation.&#8221; Gu Changge was planning to send a message to Yan
          Ji to come. He had heard before this that she had entered retreat.
          Thus, it was likely that she was trying to breakthrough to the Sacred
          King Realm. Once she did, she would be a great choice as Xiao Ruoyin’s
          Master. Someone who could monitor her and was one of his most trusted
          servants. Basically, the most ideal person to leave this task
          to.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Ah, sorry for the trouble.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin nodded. She now
          held no suspicion towards him at all. She was not even worried about
          what kind of Master Gu Changge would find for her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s no trouble at all. Given your aptitude, you will be
          fought over everywhere else. This may count as me finding an excellent
          disciple for the power backing me.&#8221; Gu Changge said with a smile
          while looking extremely charming and aloof, causing no one to doubt
          his words.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I understand. I will cultivate properly and repay the favour
          you gave me, when I have the chance.&#8221; She sounded touched. She
          internally questioned how such a perfect man could exist. He was
          perfect not just in looks, aura, and manners, but even in character as
          well.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;When I start training with my Master, will I have the
          opportunity to see you?&#8221; She suddenly recalled something
          important and looked up at him with her scarlet eyes. It sounded like
          a question that took a lot of courage to ask but it was her real
          feelings. She had no motives towards him; it was just that she would
          be more relieved if she could see him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had already seen him instinctively as a reliable person. When she
          first came to this world, she had lived in this mysterious and chaotic
          world without any support. Now, after she had met such a benefactor,
          she wanted to hold on to him tightly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge smiled. &#8220;Of course. I see you are already excited,
          so I&#8217;ll pass down a powerful cultivation technique to
          you.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Really?&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin was surprised and pleased.
          &#8220;Thank you, Young Master Gu.&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In her mind, cultivation techniques were extremely valuable as were
          they extremely mysterious. A secret kept by each individual force, and
          not to be passed down to others.</span

          finger as he spoke.</span

          >Indistinctly, she saw an extremely ancient and complex cultivation
          technique opening up right before her eyes. Each word shone as bright
          as the stars in the sky.</span

          >&#8220;Is that the cultivation technique you use?&#8221; she
          murmured, feeling some sense of familiarity. It was as if she had felt
          like this once before.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge made a profound smile and took her to the underground
          dungeon to release her friends as promised. [Naturally, this
          cultivation technique is not something that simple. You’ll realise
          that in due time.]</span

          >Meanwhile, Jiang Chen had stirred to wakefulness within the dim
          underground dungeon. His body felt like it had been rolled over by an
          enormous rock, with every cell and organ of his body feeling like it
          had been reduced to pieces. The sharp pain made him need to forcibly
          inhale, with his face turned pale and sweaty.</span

          Where&#8217;s Ruoyin? Has something happened to her?&#8221; Jiang Chen
          shook his head. He immediately came to attention, looking around the
          room for Xiao Ruoyin. However, there was no sign of her at all in the
          dungeon, where all his companions currently were. His heart thudded as
          the feeling of uneasiness became worse.</span

          unconscious! Who knows what would happen in that period of time? She’s

          away from here and the whole scene was just an act to fool us.&#8221;
          Another woman spoke up, her outfit extremely stylish and her face
          covered with light flawless makeup. She looked a little dishevelled
          though, due to their lengthy imprisonment, but it was clear she had
          fine features.

          well as many adoring fans, yet she was extremely interested in Jiang
          Chen. Jiang Chen, however, only had eyes for Xiao Ruoyin, so Wang Ning
          made sure to oppose the other Xiao Ruoyin whenever possible. Her words
          sounded almost mocking but also expressed the feelings of many others
          who fell silent. After all, Xiao Ruoyin had never told them she knew

          favoured by that man in white and already left this place to enjoy
          herself. Why would she care about us? What are you thinking when you
          continue to defend her in this manner? She doesn’t care about you at
          all. You better believe that the noble and revered girl of your dreams

          Jiang Chen who had become stricken; even Niu Tian and the others
          hadn&#8217;t expected her to say such things. It was kind of true,
          though; they were on the verge of death and didn&#8217;t even know if
          they could live until tomorrow. So, who would care about scruples
          here? Much less someone else’s face! Thus, when they heard what she
          said, all of them became silent. They did not even know if Xiao Ruoyin
          was dead or alive, and were in no position to care about it since
          their own fates were uncertain.</span

          becoming quiet. Jiang Chen&#8217;s expression was dark, his fists
          clenched as he searched for words to say. He still did not believe
          Xiao Ruoyin would abandon them to their deaths. Rather, he believes
          she had her own hardships. Still, Wang Ning&#8217;s words unsettled
          him, and he was worried about how he was going to face Xiao Ruoyin if

          was tall and slender with a handsome face and dark raven hair. Light
          seemed to swirl around him and his sleeves fluttered as he walked,
          making him resemble a deity walking amongst mortals. A woman in a
          white dress accompanied him; her face did not have any makeup on it
          but even so, her features were beautiful and flawless. Her hair was
          down and with her long legs, her beauty was otherworldly. The two of
          them looked almost compatible as they moved through the dungeon.</span

          they were seeing. It might have been an illusion, as the woman in
          white was obviously Xiao Ruoyin. However, her clothes had now changed
          and her complexion looked much healthier than before, just like a
          flower blooming in an empty valley.</span

          had become paler. Recalling what Wang Ning had said, he clenched his
          fists so tightly that his nails dug into his palms unknowingly. He
          stared hard at her, seeking an explanation for why things had suddenly
          gone this way. [Hadn&#8217;t she been captured? Why does she look so
          spotless and unharmed?]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, Xiao Ruoyin only glanced at him briefly without any
          explanation. Gu Changge glanced at every single person in the cell,
          pausing momentarily at Jiang Chen. The others felt a terrifying
          pressure around them and became so uneasy that their backs became damp
          with sweat.</span

          >*Buzz!* In the next moment, a bright light flashed through the void,
          and the mysterious black iron chain attached to the celled opened.
          They fell to the floor with a heavy thud, and then the doors of the
          cell immediately opened. Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, Wang Ning, and the rest
          witnessed this with puzzlement.

          everyone live. Everything before this had been a
          misunderstanding,&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin explained in their language after
          stepping towards them calmly.

          Everyone is safe now and we can leave this dungeon.&#8221; Xiao
          Ruoyin&#8217;s gaze lingered on Jiang Chen for a moment but did not
          say anything else, instead informing the others that they were safe
          and would not be locked in this cell any longer.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Really? That&#8217;s amazing. It must have been Goddess Xiao
          who saved us. I did say that she&#8217;s beautiful and kind-hearted.
          How could she possibly forget about us when she has made it
          big?&#8221; An awkward expression flashed across her features at the
          words &#8216;made it big&#8217;, but she couldn&#8217;t argue against
          it. If she hadn&#8217;t met Gu Changge, she wouldn&#8217;t have begun
          her journey on the road of cultivation and instead remained a
          prisoner. That description was kind of true.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          unhappy complaints about Xiao Ruoyin disappeared like a puff of air.
          Nothing else was more important than their own lives!</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Exactly. How could we be saved without her? A certain someone
          kept complaining about her, saying that she didn&#8217;t care whether
          we were alive or dead…&#8221; One man looked mockingly at a
          sour-looking Wang Ning, copying her tone from before. Wang Ning looked
          sour as she hadn&#8217;t expected Xiao Ruoyin to rescue them. This was
          something she completely hadn&#8217;t expected.</span
        >
      </p>

          that she would save you? It&#8217;s just an easy task for her.&#8221;
          Wang Ning, angry at being mocked, retorted quickly as she refused to
          accept Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s kindness. She refused to believe that
          nothing had happened between Xiao Ruoyin and the man in white. After
          all, why else would he release them unharmed?
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Wang Ning, what are you talking about? Ruoyin was kind enough
          to save us and now you are second-guessing her intentions?&#8221; Niu
          Tian interrupted her while frowning in annoyance.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Wang Ning was wary of the tall and stocky man as she knew he
          wasn&#8217;t the type of person who wouldn&#8217;t act violently just
          because she was a woman. She snorted coldly and shut her mouth
          instead.</span

          repay you when we get the chance.&#8221; Niu Tian glanced at the
          silent Jiang Chen, then smiled humbly as he talked to her. He was
          quite closely acquainted with her due to her relationship with Jiang
          Chen.</span

          >&#8220;It&#8217;s fine.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin shook her head in answer,
          knowing that they had all misunderstood the situation. She would have
          to make Gu Changge wait for a long time if she explained everything
          now, so she remained quiet. She planned on explaining everything when
          they had the time.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I know. I believe her.&#8221; Jiang Chen forced a smile as if
          he had gotten over the situation. He understood the woes she had and
          so did not want to waste her effort. His eyes were still fixed on her
          though, as if waiting for an explanation.

          classmates knew that with the disparity in their statuses, and they
          couldn&#8217;t possibly hope that a man such as him would care about
          them. In fact, it was fortunate enough for them that he released them
          alive.

          had gone through after she left the dungeon, but they did not dare
          enquire about it. It was obvious that she was a different person from
          before, and the respectful gazes from the guards outside the dungeon
          proved that her status had truly changed. This made the others
          envious, yet Jiang Chen&#8217;s mouth felt dry and bitter. His
          uneasiness worsened. [Why did her status change so much in an instant?
          Why is it as though we are no longer on the same level?]

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          something while smiling. There was something bright flickering within
          her scarlet eyes, which Jiang Chen took to be admiration and respect.
          That feeling made his heart hurt excruciatingly. Thus, he reassured
          himself repeatedly that she was just faking it to please the man in
          white and save them all.</span

          bearing now much softened.</span

          agreement while looking happy. She didn&#8217;t know why she had done

          >&#8220;Young Master…&#8221; Hei Yanyu looked at him with confusion,
          wanting to say something yet hesitating. She did not understand his
          actions or his attitude towards Xiao Ruoyin. To her, the woman was
          certainly extremely gifted, but it was far from enough to make him
          this concerned. Besides, she knew his character; he was cold and
          cruel, never doing anything which did not benefit him. Yet, he had
          wasted so much effort on such a time-consuming and trivial task. That
          meant that he might have some other use for that woman.</span

          His smile faded away and his expression became cold and calm once
          more.</span

      <p>

          >&#8220;Alright,&#8221; Hei Yanyu answered, feeling relieved. To be
          honest, he had been so good to Xiao Ruoyin that she was a little
          jealous of the other woman. She even questioned why she couldn&#8217;t
          get the same treatment? Nonetheless, it was now obvious that Gu
          Changge had other hidden motives for doing so, which made her feel
          much better.</span

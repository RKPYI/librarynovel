        <h4>Chapter 234-1: Finally it‚Äôs time to reap benefits, The Immortal Lun Sect wouldnt last (1)</h4>
        <p> "Not good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" </p>
        <p> Zhao Yi's expression changed, and turned a little pale, "These warriors are all God Kings, and there are
            also many cultivators in Quasi-Sacred and Sacred Realm." </p>
        <p> Her words trembled. </p>
        <p> Not to mention Sacred and Quasi-Sacred, even the ones in the Great Sacred Realm had appeared, and they
            wanted to kill Jiang Yang. </p>
        <p> A Great Sacred Realm cultivator was already the pinnacle of power in the Heavenly Star Realm as it was
            today. </p>
        <p> Except for the Immortal Lun Sect, the rest of the forces absolutely did not have a Great Sacred Realm
            cultivator, and their background was much worse. </p>
        <p> But now, with a wave of the opponent's hand, there were many strong cultivators appearing to kill Jiang
            Yang. </p>
        <p> Just now she thought that this group of people was here to greet Jiang Yang, but she didn't expect that the
            other party was already waiting here, planning to kill Jiang Yang. </p>
        <p> This scene made Jiang Yang frown. Although it was unexpected, it didn't go deep. </p>
        <p> "How dare you attack me! You will regret it." </p>
        <p> He said lightly to Yue Mingkong, at this time, he thought that Yue Mingkong was the descendant of the Human
            Ancestor Hall. </p>
        <p> "Stop talking nonsense, you must die today!" </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong's response was very short and indifferent. Between the sky and the earth, a thick fog began to
            appear as the surroundings blurred, like a chaotic mist, shrouding the place. </p>
        <p> At the same time, she unfolded a golden decree! </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <p> The world was shaking! </p>
        <p> From the decree, there was a sword intent rising into the sky! </p>
        <p> In the blink of an eye, a sword traversed the sky, chaos filled the air, as thick as a mountain, like
            billions of stars erupting at once. </p>
        <p> That vast and terrifying energy was enough to destroy everything and the aftermath alone turned many peaks
            around the valley into dust. </p>
        <p> At the same time she acted, wanting to kill Jiang Yang and take his life! </p>
        <p> <strong>Rumble!</strong> </p>
        <p> Her robe spread out, the radiance was bright, and the five-color divine light rushed to the sky. The giant
            mountains next to it were lifted up, and then turned into powder in the air. </p>
        <p> "This‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" </p>
        <p> "Aren't you a descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall?" </p>
        <p> Seeing this, Jiang Yang frowned and then his calm expression suddenly changed. </p>
        <p> He was not stupid, no matter how he looked at this time, he felt that the other party had nothing to do with
            the Human Ancestor hall. </p>
        <p> It was purely intended to kill him. </p>
        <p> All his previous guesses were wrong! </p>
        <p> And he actually stupidly sent himself to the door? </p>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> This made Jiang Yang's expression a bit ugly and things were out of his control again. </p>
        <p> Before that, who told him that there was the secret method of the Human Ancestor Hall? </p>
        <p> "Damn it, who is trying to trick me?" </p>
        <p> At this time, Jiang Yang didn't have time to react. With his current state, it was impossible to resist such
            a blow. </p>
        <p> Not to mention that there was a group of Golden Armored Warriors around. </p>
        <p> It was a net of heaven and earth! </p>
        <p> <strong>Buzz!!</strong> Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé</p>
        <p> Thinking of this, Jiang Yang's complexion also became very cold and he began to pinch his fingers together.
        </p>
        <p> Rays of light rose behind him one after another. </p>
        <p> It was brilliant and dazzling, atmospheric and majestic, as if the sun had risen. </p>
        <p> That was a golden seal, incomparably blinding, that suddenly appeared in the high sky, and then suspended
            there. With wisps of divine light, it was made of the most powerful laws. </p>
        <p> With this, even the continents could easily collapse. </p>
        <p> It was just that with his current strength, it was difficult to use the Supreme weapon at its full power.
        </p>
        <p> "Immortal Lun Seal?" </p>
        <p> Almost immediately, Yue Mingkong recognized this weapon, the Supreme power in it was awakening, to explode
            the might of the Supreme weapon! </p>
        <p> In the entire Heavenly Star Realm, there was definitely only one of these! </p>
        <p> It was the Supreme weapon of Immortal Lun! </p>
        <p> But she didn't panic, instead she became colder and colder. </p>
        <p> <strong>Clang!</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>Clang!</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>Clang!</strong> </p>
        <p> With a sound like a heavenly weapon being forged! </p>
        <p> An aura of divinity and transcendence permeated this place. </p>
        <p> She sacrificed an incomparably Sacred Golden Divine sword which the gods and goddesses used to revive on
            their own and did not need her to use it. </p>
        <p> "Quasi-Supreme weapon‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ You are rather well prepared‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" </p>
        <p> "Who the hell wants to kill me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" </p>
        <p> Jiang Yang's expression changed once again, and the Immortal Lun Seal, which he used to carry around to
            protect his life, seemed to be useless. </p>
        <p> <strong>Rumble!</strong>
        <div id="pf-9473-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1" })</script>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p> Soon, the place instantly erupted terrifying incomparable fluctuations, as if one star after another
            exploded, more like one star field after another turned into dust. </p>
        <p> It was more like a billion chaos waves slapping, like a heavy universe smashing down, directly making the
            void here shatter! </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <p> In the next moment, Jiang Yang spat blood and flew backwards. Covered in blood, his body exploded and
            smashed a large mountain. His injuries were extremely heavy and he looked incomparably wretched. </p>
        <p> Not only did he suffer from the attack of Yue Mingkong, but he also had to watch out for the golden-armored
            warriors attacking around him. </p>
        <p> He had the Supreme weapon with him, but it was difficult to use one ten thousandth of its power. </p>
        <p> He couldn't even resist the opponent's Quasi-Supreme weapon! </p>
        <p> "Who the hell are you?" </p>
        <p> "Why are you attacking me?" </p>
        <p> Jiang Yang coldly shouted, wanting to know where Yue Mingkong came from. </p>
        <p> But Yue Mingkong was not moved as she still attacked, feeling that today might be her only chance to wipe
            him out here and remove this big trouble for Gu Changge! </p>
        <p> And this time, Jiang Yang also made the most correct choice‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ He once again gritted his teeth, reluctantly
            broke the seal on the Reincarnation Seal, and then fled to the distance! </p>
        <p> Jiang Yang stepped on the great momentum of this place and broke through the immediate obstruction with the
            Immortal Lun Seal. Except for Yue Mingkong who was holding the Quasi-Supreme weapon, the rest of them could
            not stop him at all. </p>
        <p> "Jiang Yang, save me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" </p>
        <p> He even had the means to take the incomparably miserable Zhao Yi on the other side with him, intending to
            break out of the heavy siege. </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong naturally noticed Jiang Yang's move to break the Reincarnation Seal. </p>
        <p> For the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, the Reincarnation Seal was something more important than life.
        </p>
        <p> Because not every reincarnation could cultivate the Reincarnation Seal. </p>
        <p> This showed that Jiang Yang had panicked and confused himself, unable to prioritize! </p>
        <p> "Pass my order to the Sacred Mountains and forbidden areas to launch a secret revolt, targeting directly at
            the Immortal Lun Sect‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" </p>
        <p> "Its disciples are the thief of the Sacred Mountain‚Äôs spiritual objects, make them hand over Jiang Yang!"
        </p>
        <p> Then, Yue Mingkong's eyes became cold, her jade hand waved and instructed the people behind her. </p>
        <p> She intended to delay the return of the Human Ancestor, now that she shattered his Reincarnation Seal to
            borrow power, that was just what she wanted! </p>
        <p> After that, Yue Mingkong herself continued to chase and attack, not intending to let Jiang Yang go. </p>
        <p> If she could really kill him, that would be great. </p>
        <p> ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ </p>
        <p> And just when many cultivators and forces in the outside world panicked, talking wildly. </p>
        <p> Deep inside the Netherland Heavenly Pond. </p>
        <p> The Immortal mist was indistinct, appearing incomparably blurred, the pool water was clear, among which an
            incomparably tall Green Lotus was growing, the Lotus leaves were like face pots, absorbing the essence of
            heaven and earth, the sun and moon and stars. </p>
        <p> Wisps were flowing here, as if into a blanket of waterfalls. </p>
        <p> Accompanied by the monstrous demonic aura. </p>
        <p> A vague and slender figure, entwined with an Immortal and demonic aura, was seated here. </p>
        <p> Above his head, there was a big treasure vase floating, the dark light was flickering, and the big vein
            intertwined into the heaven and earth scriptures, which looked mysterious and terrifying. </p>
        <p> If a cultivator saw this scene, he would be shocked beyond belief. </p>
        <p> It would be hard to believe that deep in the Netherland Heavenly Pond, there was still someone there.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 234-2: Finally it‚Äôs time to reap benefits, The Immortal Lun Sect wouldnt last (2)</h4>
        <p> Of course this figure was naturally Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> He closed his eyes slightly, there were black and white divine lights flowing out from his eyes. </p>
        <p> A black rune was struck by his hand, branded in eight directions, like a small bright black sun, intending
            to turn the momentum of this place. </p>
        <p> Soon, after completing these. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge opened his eyes, looking somewhat puzzled. </p>
        <p> "Surprisingly, I somehow received Jiang Yang's Luck points again. It seems that Yue Mingkong's plan has
            succeeded, with her methods. Even if Jiang Yang wants to escape, I'm afraid he will have to lose a layer of
            skin." </p>
        <p> "In that case, it is also considered a blow to Jiang Yang's luck." </p>
        <p> Gu Changge also planned to have Yue Mingkong help him stall Jiang Yang for a few more days. </p>
        <p> It was just that, from the system's prompt, it seemed that he had underestimated Yue Mingkong's tactics.
        </p>
        <p> By this time, Jiang Yang had already been hunted by her. </p>
        <p> Under Gu Changge's calculation, Jiang Yang thought that the heir of the Human Ancestor Hall was looking for
            him, so he left the Immortal Lun Sect where he had been cowering and came outside. </p>
        <p> As a regressor, Yue Mingkong should know a lot about Jiang Yang's methods, and under her layers of
            arrangement, Jiang Yang would have to honestly admit his fate even if he was the reincarnation of the Human
            Ancestor. </p>
        <p> But with the means of Yue Mingkong, if she wanted to kill Jiang Yang, it was very difficult. </p>
        <p> "But it seems that the Human Ancestor has gone to great lengths for the things in the Heavenly Pond, to the
            extent that he even destroyed his Reincarnation Seal, tsk tsk ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" </p>
        <p> "Just the outermost layer had a whole three Great Sacred Realm vicious beasts, a Great Sacred Realm headless
            horseman guard‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" </p>
        <p> "It's just a pity that this little tactic can stop others, but not me." </p>
        <p> Gu Changge swept over the many runes nearby and did not touch them. </p>
        <p> These days, the outside world had caused those sensations, naturally, he also noticed them. </p>
        <p> With his current means, it was actually not difficult for him to sneak into the deepest part. </p>
        <p> When he was within the Ancient Immortal Continent, he had snuck in front of the eyes of countless old demons
            and old antiquities. </p>
        <p> He was also able to calmly venture inside the Immortal Gate and snatch the Immortal Spirit away, without
            anyone noticing. </p>
        <p> The arrangement within the Netherland Heavenly Pond was actually much worse than the one inside the Immortal
            Gate. </p>
        <p> After all, the environment of heaven and earth was completely different, the rules of this place would not
            allow too much power beyond the burden of this world. </p>
        <p> It could be said that the difficulty instantly dropped many times. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge himself was proficient with spatial talent and incomparably good at concealment. </p>
        <p> So he thought about it and created the illusion that he had fallen outside, which by the way could conceal
            the rest of the Human Ancestor's arrangement. </p>
        <p> On the other hand, he could also let the outside beings and cultivators know that they should not come up
            and disturb his plans. </p>
        <p> Of course, Gu Changge also took his plan into consideration. Wasn't Jiang Yang going to scheme against him?
        </p>
        <p> Then this was exactly what he wanted, he could just take advantage of this time to cut off the opportunity
            that Jiang Yang had worked so hard to plan for many lifetimes, wouldn't that be wonderful? </p>
        <p> Also for the breakup between Yaoyao and Jiang Yang, he tore the dough and poured the last oil. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge now only had to sit here and reap the benefits, waiting for Jiang Yang to come here to deliver
            his head and reap the last wave of his remaining points. </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> Afterwards, the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd appeared and took the initiative to recover. </p>
        <p> With the monstrous demonic power, it wiped out many of the runes in front of him. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge continued to take action, changing the general laws and making these runes for his use. </p>
        <p> In the deepest part. </p>
        <p> A very special Green Lotus was propping up the Lotus leaves, and strands of Chaotic energy were entangled on
            it, it was deeply rooted in the bottom of the lake, as if it wouldn‚Äôt sway even if the sky and the earth
            were dead, and the universe was dead. </p>
        <p> Nirvana Green Lotus. </p>
        <p> It was just that it was not mature yet. </p>
        <p> Looking at this thing from a distance, various thoughts flashed in Gu Changge's mind. </p>
        <p> One last buzz!! </p>
        <p> He chose to move forward, even if it was not mature, he had to occupy it first! </p>
        <p> The Great Dao treasure bottle emerged actively, defending him against its terrifying pressure. </p>
        <p> His bones rattled. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge even heard the rumbling sounds of the ancient worlds spinning. </p>
        <p> As if it could crush people to pieces. </p>
        <p> But as the Great Dao treasure bottle fell, the Lotus leaves spread out one by one, and he fell into it one
            step at a time, and then he sat cross-legged. </p>
        <p> The Lotus leaves closed, and all the aura fluctuations gradually disappeared. </p>
        <p> On the open and boundless lake, soon only a Green Lotus was left standing and taking root. </p>
        <p> It was silent. </p>
        <p> And Gu Changge's current state was very strange. </p>
        <p> His demonic heart throbbed, blood spurted out, and made a terrifying sound like a giant drum. </p>
        <p> At the same time he felt a desire to devour it! </p>
        <p> In a trance, Gu Changge saw a thumb-sized lotus seed with mysterious ancient traces wrapped around its
            surface. </p>
        <p> It seemed to be the embodiment of the Great Dao, and it was also the cohesion of the laws. </p>
        <p> Like floating in the boundless void. </p>
        <p> Surrounded by a Chaotic aura, at the beginning of time, it could even display the traces from the long river
            of time. </p>
        <p> The prototypes of the worlds, as the lotus seeds fell, bloomed in the Chaos, and then evolved into a vast
            world. </p>
        <p> But in the end, as he opened his mouth and swallowed this lotus seed, the terrifying black hole engulfed the
            universe. </p>
        <p> Many pictures began to collapse and shatter. </p>
        <p> His Inner World, at this time, began to evolve. </p>
        <p> Level up! </p>
        <p> His Inner World had transformed into the Inner Universe! </p>
        <p> Gu Changge's most direct feeling was that he could control the power of the world! </p>
        <div id="pf-9473-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> The palm of his hand contained the universe, his fist embraced the universe! </p>
        <p> Even his cultivation base had broken through to the Great Sacred Realm! </p>
        <p> "What's going on? What happened?" </p>
        <p> "This aura‚Ä¶ Could it be that thing‚Ä¶ Was it finally acquired by this devil?" </p>
        <p> "Has the plan of the Human Ancestor become a gift for someone else?" </p>
        <p> Jiang Chuchu, who was in the Inner World, saw that the Inner World was being submerged by the turbulent
            Chaotic energy, and only the Heavenly Court standing in the sky remained unchanged. </p>
        <p> At this moment, she couldn't help but be shocked and couldn't keep calm. </p>
        <p> In the end, her complexion turned pale and she sat down on the bluestone like a slump. </p>
        <p> She was driven to distraction. </p>
        <p> "Impossible, haven't I already warned the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor? Are all his tricks useless?"
        </p>
        <p> Jiang Chuchu couldn't believe what she saw. R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on nùíê/v/ùíÜ/l(b)iùíè(.)cùíêm</p>
        <p> Or was it that Gu Changge had become so powerful that he could ignore Human Ancestor's many tricks? </p>
        <p> She couldn't stop it at all. </p>
        <p> Everything was evolving in the direction Gu Changge said. </p>
        <p> ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ </p>
        <p> In the next few days, a major event that swept the entire Heavenly Domain happened again, alarming many
            forces and ethnic groups. </p>
        <p> Countless cultivators and creatures were so frightened that their faces turned pale. </p>
        <p> A terrifying secret revolt suddenly occurred. </p>
        <p> There were no signs. </p>
        <p> In the major Sacred Mountains and forbidden areas, there were ancient beings who said that there was a young
            disciple in the Immortal Lun Sect who stole their Sacred object and asked the Immortal Lun Sect to hand him
            over. </p>
        <p> Many terrifying old antiques, whose cultivation base had reached the Sacred Realm, had begun to recover, and
            they were approaching the mountain gate of Immortal Lun Sect. </p>
        <p> Many people speculated that this incident might just be an excuse, and that the disciple was just a small
            lead. </p>
        <p> In fact, the major Sacred Mountains and forbidden areas had always wanted to attack the Immortal Lun Sect.
        </p>
        <p> It was just that it hadn't started yet. </p>
        <p> "Now even the Immortal Lun Sect can't last for long‚Ä¶ Why did the phantom left by the Immortal Lun
            disappear?" </p>
        <p> In the hall of Immortal Lun Sect. </p>
        <p> The atmosphere was depressing and heavy. </p>
        <p> Jiang Yang, who used many means along the way to escape back to the Immortal Lun Sect with heavy injuries,
            felt a strong malice right away. </p>
        <p> The major Sacred Mountains and forbidden areas were forced to come, they were obviously ordered by the
            mysterious woman who almost got rid of him that day. </p>
        <p> Jiang Yang originally planned to arouse the phantom of the Ancestor of Immortal Lun Sect and cooperate with
            Immortal Lun Sect to fight against the mysterious woman, but he failed. </p>
        <p> Because the phantom of the Ancestor Immortal Lun seemed to have disappeared, and he was not moved by him at
            all! </p>
        <p> This incident made his identity in the Immortal Lun Sect suddenly reversed. </p>
        <p> Moreover, the matter of him stealing the Immortal Lun Seal was noticed by many elders in the Immortal Lun
            Sect. </p>
        <p> Under the internal and external troubles, there were almost big problems. </p>
        <p> This made Jiang Yang's complexion very ugly, and he was no longer as indifferent as before. He felt that
            someone was secretly plotting against him! </p>
        <p> "No, at this time, I have to go to the Netherland Heavenly Pond‚Ä¶" </p>
        <p> "Immortal Lun Sect wouldn't last‚Ä¶"</p>

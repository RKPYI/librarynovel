        <h4>Chapter 169: Plotting Against the Ancient Immortal Clans; The Frightened Tiangou Clan!</h4>
        <p> At this moment, it wasn’t just Hei Yanyu… </p>
        <p> Even the other natives and cultivators were shocked, their eyes widening at this unbelievable turn of
            events, </p>
        <p> For Yu Jing’s aura to disappear was simply unprecedented. </p>
        <p> <b>“Yu Jing… is dead? Could Gu Changge truly be so strong despite being seriously injured?” </b> </p>
        <p> <b>“If he can’t be killed even after a Sacred-grade Artifact has been used, then he too must have one!” </b>
        </p>
        <p> <b>“His methods run deep!” </b> </p>
        <p> They trembled, terrified. </p>
        <p> The eyes of the other Tiangou clansmen widened as well, standing petrified. </p>
        <p> This was too big a blow for them to handle. </p>
        <p> Yu Jing was the most outstanding genius of the Tiangou Clan, her Cultivation Base was in the middle stage of
            the False God Realm. </p>
        <p> ‘Even after using a Sacred-grade Artifact, she was killed by Gu Changge, despite the latter being seriously
            injured? Could it be that he used some sort of trick?’ </p>
        <p> They were dumbfounded. </p>
        <p> <b>Boom!</b> </p>
        <p> The surging flames floated up and down on the horizon, before quickly receding, as the terrifying aura of
            the Saint began to fade as well. </p>
        <p> The Sacred-grade Artifact, which looked like a giant sun of heavenly fire, fell at extreme speeds, crashing
            down on a mountain peak. </p>
        <p> Amidst the dust and ashes, Gu Changge calmly sat, and yet… all behold him would intuitively feel his current
            weakness. </p>
        <p> It appeared as though he’d lost nearly all of his Blood Essence. </p>
        <p> To say that his face was as white as paper was insufficient. </p>
        <p> In spite of his current appearance, everyone simply looked on with shock and admiration in their hearts.
        </p>
        <p> In fact, much of the younger generation were enthusiastic, unable to control themselves as they shouted,
            <b>“So strong! The Young Master Changge is simply invincible!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“So what if the Ancient Immortal Races dared to push people around? Even in this state, the Young Master
                Changge can suppress all his enemies!” </b> </p>
        <p> <b>“After all, he’s a Young Asura!”</b> </p>
        <p> This scene excited many. </p>
        <p> <b>“Master!” </b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Protect the Master!” </b> </p>
        <p> At that moment, however, divine rainbows from all sides of heaven and earth rushed over, landing near Gu
            Changge to protect him. They were his followers. </p>
        <p> Nobody expected that Yu Jing, the wielder of a Sacred–grade Artifact, would die at the hands of a seriously
            injured Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> Even a Sacred-grade Artifact couldn't help her. </p>
        <p> It only went to show that Gu Changge had an Artifact of the same grade in his hands. </p>
        <p> And yet, the gravity of his achievement was no lesser. </p>
        <p> After all, to activate a Sacred-grade Artifact, to unleash its power was beyond the capabilities of ordinary
            folk. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge's actions today have made him a hero in the hearts of many Young Geniuses! </p>
        <p> <b>“Master, are you okay?” </b> </p>
        <p> In the face of his follower’s concerns, Gu Changge looked calm and unharmed. </p>
        <p> <b>“I’m alright. I just won’t be able to use my Cultivation for a while.”</b> He replied thoughtfully. </p>
        <p> ‘Let’s just take advantage of this. After all, I’ll need to lay low for the next step.’ </p>
        <p> <b>“We are to blame. We are mere waste wood that cannot even help carry Master’s burdens.”</b> They felt
            even more guilty when they heard Gu Changge’s words. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge shook his head and replied with a calm expression, <b>“You are not to blame for this matter. I
                underestimated the strength of the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts. Otherwise, things would
                never have reached this point.” </b> </p>
        <p> After that, he looked at the Tiangou clansmen ahead, his eyes flashing with strange colours. </p>
        <p> <b>“Kill them all; leave no one behind.”</b> He indifferently ordered. </p>
        <p> <b>“As Master wishes.”</b> </p>
        <p> A group of followers quickly rushed to follow the order, encircling and killing the rest of the still dazed
            Tiangou clansmen. </p>
        <p> A large battle broke out once more. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge silently closed his eyes and ate some Medicine Pills, casually healing his ‘wounds’. </p>
        <p> At this moment, the possibility that some idiots would dare take action against him was slim. </p>
        <p> No… if that happened, he might have a second burst of Blood Essence, or he could use more of those pills.
        </p>
        <p> Moreover, secret methods are known that way for a reason. No one knows the specifics of these techniques.
        </p>
        <p> As such, Gu Changge could make up whatever he pleased. </p>
        <p> If anyone asked, he had plenty of reasons to give. </p>
        <p> On the other hand, he had now set the stage for the Ancient Immortal Clans, even managing to kickstart this
            little play. </p>
        <p> All he needs to do is to enjoy the show, as the waters slowly yet surely become muddier. </p>
        <p> From Gu Changge’s point of view, the most important part was that he now had the perfect opportunity to
            devour the Ancient Immortal Continent whole. </p>
        <div id="pf-9472-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49", id: "pf-9472-1" })</script>
        </div>
        <p> Later on, he’ll be sending out a few of his people to report to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family. </p>
        <p> He’d also included his mother’s Primordial Divine Sect to take full advantage of the situation. </p>
        <p> He should be the first to eat, getting the biggest, juiciest piece of meat. </p>
        <p> ‘Sure enough, Gu Changge's schemes run deep. Yu Jing’s fight only had one outcome from the beginning.’ </p>
        <p> ’With today’s events, Gu Changge’s image has now also risen to even greater heights.’ </p>
        <p> On the other side, Gu Xianer frowned as she watched all of this unfold. She was more than familiar with Gu
            Changge’s many methods, not surprised in the slightest at this situation. </p>
        <p> She then bitterly gazed at Gu Changge’s directions, making sure to remember all the wicked things he’s done
            today. Then, she turned into a divine rainbow, soaring in the sky as she left. </p>
        <p> She was sure that as long as she was with Gu Changge, nothing good would come out of it. </p>
        <p> She had already planned to stay away from Gu Changge, lest she be manipulated yet again. </p>
        <p> Right now, she was too confused to be close to him. </p>
        <p> ‘What sort of attitude should I have for him?’ </p>
        <p> Such thoughts made her feel a bit reluctant to face Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> ‘What does he mean by saying that I shouldn’t have any sentiments towards him?’ </p>
        <p> ‘Obviously, there are times when he treats me well.’ </p>
        <p> ‘So why does he feel so distant sometimes? So cold and uncaring like a block of ice?’ </p>
        <p> She couldn't figure out which one was the real Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er shook her head and expelled these thoughts from her mind. </p>
        <p> She felt that it was necessary to return to the Immortal Gu Family once she had left the Ancient Immortal
            Continent. </p>
        <p> ——— </p>
        <p> <b>“Miss, should we really leave?” </b> </p>
        <p> <b>“With Gu Changge having run out of gas, this is the perfect opportunity for us.” </b> </p>
        <p> The many natives standing near Hei Yanyu asked her. </p>
        <p> From their point of view, it was an excellent opportunity. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was bound to be extremely weak in such a state. </p>
        <p> No matter how strong Gu Changge was, if they were to rush forward at this instant, then he wouldn’t last
            very long. </p>
        <p> What kind of storms could he truly make in such a state? </p>
        <p> A Young Genius of the Ancient Serpent Clan immediately shook his head and suggested, <b>“We should retreat,
                for now. We’ve already aggravated the masses as it is. The outside cultivators would be sure to keep a
                tighter watch on this area, and they would not sit idly. Besides, do you really think that just because
                Gu Changge has been reduced to such a state that he has no other cards he can play?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Perhaps this appearance is meant to deceive us? Perhaps he wants us to take the initiative, so that we
                can deliver our heads right to his door?”</b> </p>
        <p> His words were reasonable, the revelation of which sent a chill down the backs of many Young Creatures. </p>
        <p> The Young Genius of the Divine Crocodile Clan spoke with a pale face, <b>“Gu Changge's methods and schemes
                are too terrifying.”</b> </p>
        <p> Hei Yanyu, who was silent until now, said, <b>“First, we must think carefully on how we can withstand the
                anger of the outside world. With Gu Changge’s schemes, the anger and hatred of the outside world’s
                cultivators should have reached its peak.”</b> </p>
        <p> She looked deeply at the young man from afar. It was like staring at the stars and moon in the distance, her
            eyes full of jealousy and admiration. </p>
        <p> Compared to Long Teng, Gu Changge was far more terrible, enough to make her tremble slightly. </p>
        <p> With just a few words, he’d pitted the Ancient Immortal Races against the entirety of the outside world.
        </p>
        <p> His heart is as black as coal! </p>
        <p> He not only pointed a knife at their throats, he made a mockery of them. </p>
        <p> <b>“Long Teng’s death at his hands is now beyond doubt.” </b> DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on
            no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com</p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge is simply monstrous, and there is no need to fight him.” </b> </p>
        <p> Hei Yanyu left with her people. </p>
        <p> She had a feeling that a major event was about to take place, shaking the very foundations of the Ancient
            Immortal Continent and all the clans. </p>
        <p> Today’s events would soon spread like fire across the Ancient Immortal Continent, its muddy affairs turning
            chaotic. </p>
        <p> Most cultivators of the outside world felt a deep anger as they burst with righteous indignation. </p>
        <p> The Tiangou Clan used an artifact of the Sacred-grade to openly slaughter a group of Young Supremes,
            trampling over their prior agreements. </p>
        <p> At this moment, not even the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace could protect the Ancient Immortal Races. </p>
        <p> The matter quickly grew and became a hot topic that ignited the anger and hatred of all who heard it. </p>
        <p> Regardless of the Ancient Immortal Races’ current combined might, it is impossible for them to withstand the
            anger of the entire world. </p>
        <p> Let alone Gu Changge’s terrifying background, his actions have made him into a hero. </p>
        <p> No one dared say any more, let alone words of slander. </p>
        <p> To fight against the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts, to create a peaceful world for the people to
            cultivate, and to restore peace for all… </p>
        <p> All these factors combined made it impossible for them to be sceptical of Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> On the contrary, they felt angered by the Tiangou Clan. To take advantage of his injury and attempt to kill
            him, even using a Sacred-grade Artifact in their attempt to do so… </p>
        <p> Such shameless behaviour invited the wrath of many. </p>
        <p> At the same time, a gloomy atmosphere descended upon the people of the Tiangou Clan. </p>
        <p> When they’d heard the news, their current patriarch raged, levelling an entire mountain range that span
            across thousands of miles. </p>
        <p> Yu Jing’s death was one thing, but this… </p>
        <p> Yu Jing used the Sacred-grade Artifact, breaking the former arrangement that both sides had agreed upon.
        </p>
        <p> This incident had practically pushed the Tiangou Clan to extinction. </p>
        <p> <b>“Damn it! From beginning to end, Yu Jing was played like a fool by Gu Changge.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“This Gu Changge is obviously just a junior, so why are his methods so vicious and sophisticated?”</b>
        <div id="pf-9473-1">
            <script>window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || []; window.pubfuturetag.push({ unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68", id: "pf-9473-1" })</script>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p> Many elders gathered within the magnificent palace, carrying dark expressions. </p>
        <p> They were very angry… </p>
        <p> But at the same time, they were afraid. </p>
        <p> The Tiangou Clan was manipulated by Gu Changge! </p>
        <p> They weren’t stupid, and the conclusion was clear to see with a little analysis. </p>
        <p> ‘Yu Jing must’ve thought that she could kill Gu Changge due to his weakened state, so she brought out the
            Divine Artifact without hesitation.’ </p>
        <p> ‘This Gu Changge obviously has a strong ace-in-the-hole that can resist the power of the Sacred-grade
            Artifact. But before that, he acted weak, his methods “exhausted”, luring Yu Jing.’ </p>
        <p> For the elders, it was clear that this matter was all part of his plan. </p>
        <p> He wanted the Tiangou Clan to take the initiative and break the agreement between the two factions. </p>
        <p> In doing so, the Daoist Sects of the outside world – including the Immortal Gu Family that backed Gu Changge
            – now had an excuse to intervene in the affairs of the Ancient Immortal Continent. </p>
        <p> When that time comes, who would dare refuse them? </p>
        <p> Not even the True Dragon Clan would dare object. </p>
        <p> An Ancient Immortal Family… how strong, how terrifying did a family have to be to be crowned with the title
            of “Immortal”? </p>
        <p> For clans such as the Tiangou, to oppose such a family would be impossible. </p>
        <p> Unless the entirety of the Ancient Immortal Races were to unite, they would have no chance at facing such a
            foe! </p>
        <p> ‘That Gu Changge took great pains to make a logical excuse!’ </p>
        <p> It was at this moment that a frightened old woman said, <b>“Damn it! How could Yu Jing be so stupid? We
                shouldn’t have given her the Sacred-grade Artifact. If it weren’t for her, we wouldn’t be dangling over
                the abyss!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Alas, we must set aside that matter for now. Right now, it is best that we come up with a solution
                first. Gu Changge’s plan includes drags into the water not just our clan, but the rest of the Ancient
                Immortal Races as well.”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“The rest of the races will not just sit back and watch. This will be the greatest danger that we have
                ever faced since ancient times. Even if we can’t weather the storm, then I’m afraid the entire clan is
                in danger of extinction.</b>” An elder spoke with a solemn tone. </p>
        <p> He had a very high status in the Tiangou Clan, and his words had a great weight to them. </p>
        <p> He was also Yu Jing's grandfather. </p>
        <p> The reason why Yu Jing was permitted to wield the Sacred-grade Artifact was all thanks to him. </p>
        <p> He was worried for Yu Jing’s life, thinking that she would be in grave danger when she encountered Gu
            Changge. As such, he bestowed her with a Sacred-grade Artifact. </p>
        <p> However, Yu ing used this Divine Artifact to bring untold disaster upon the entire Tiangou Clan. </p>
        <p> <b>“This Gu Changge is young, yet his mind is as vicious as an Ancient Freaks who has slumbered for over ten
                thousand years. I would not suffer him, but we must act and let him know that we are not people who can
                so casually provoke.” </b> </p>
        <p> When he spoke, there was a cold glint in his eyes. </p>
        <p> <b>“We must exercise caution when dealing with this matter. At any rate, we still have time. If we directly
                act against Gu Changge, it would be our doom. Do not forget that Gu Changge has another first-rate
                identity…”</b> Another Elder shook his head as he interrupted him. </p>
        <p> <b>“The Heir of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace!”</b> </p>
        <p> As soon as these words were uttered, the entire hall went silent as everyone felt a chill slowly creeping up
            their spines. </p>
        <p> He was but a young man, and yet he had forced their entire clan into a life-and-death crisis. </p>
        <p> In the past, they wouldn’t have even considered such a thing. </p>
        <p> <b>“Let's discuss it with the True Dragon Clan. They have to come forward. After all, Yu Jing’s attack on Gu
                Changge is a matter inseparable from Long Teng.”</b>” </p>
        <p> Thus, their eyes flickered slightly, feeling that this matter could drag the Dragon Race down. </p>
        <p> If they were to face the wrath of the Immortal Gu Family, they may as well be bold. </p>
        <p> Unlike the sorrow and silence of the Tiangou Clan’s people, the dragon islands where the True Dragon Clan
            resided was now solemn. </p>
        <p> When the many Young Geniuses of the outside world began to contact their backers, they immediately realised
            that something was wrong. </p>
        <p> The Ancient Immortal Races were now facing a great crisis. </p>
        <p> At that moment, one could hear chants echoing throughout this brilliant place. </p>
        <p> The members of the True Dragon Clan were all gathered here, hundreds of thousands of densely packed figures,
            kneeling on the ground. </p>
        <p> They looked enthusiastic and sincere, saluting the ancient Immortal Temple in the front, chanting words and
            singing prayers to the old immortals. </p>
        <p> Many people even cut their wrists and let the blood pour with divine brilliance on the stone statue in front
            of them. </p>
        <p> That ancient stone statue is a supreme being with overwhelming strength who looks down on everything, its
            draconic horns threatening to pierce the very sky. </p>
        <p> <b>Buzz!</b> </p>
        <p> Strange waves filled the sky. </p>
        <p> <b>“True Dragon, grant us your blessing.”</b> </p>
        <p> An Elder of the True Dragon Clan, shouted with a frantic look. </p>
        <p> <b>“True Dragon, bless us!”</b> </p>
        <p> All the people below frantically shouted in a crazed manner. </p>
        <p> Rather than wait to be attacked by the outside world's Daoist Sects, they preferred to go on the offensive.
        </p>
        <p> Their ancestor, the True Dragon, was alive and well. As long as they had even a wisp of its true strength,
            they could frighten the great Daoist Sects and salvage their current situation. </p>
        <p> ‘And in the future…’ </p>
        <p> The turbulent situation in the Ancient Immortal Continent continued as chaos ensued. </p>
        <p> Most of the younger generation was so angry that they contacted the sects behind them, one after another. It
            was only inevitable that those sects would intervene in the affairs of the Ancient Immortal Continent. </p>
        <p> In the meantime, the native creatures were all required to return home, for fear that they would be hunted
            down by the outside world’s Young Geniuses. </p>
        <p> As for the one responsible for this incident, Gu Changge leisurely recuperated in the same ruins as before,
            during which Ye Langtian, Chi Ling, Peng Fei and others came to visit him. </p>
        <p> He fooled around with various tricks and schemes for a while. </p>
        <p> In contrast, the other Young Supremes were filled with righteous indignation, their anger and hatred for the
            Ancient Immortal Races having reached an unprecedented peak. </p>
        <p> During this period of time, Gu Changge began to fade into the background, rarely appearing to the outside
            world. </p>
        <p> It is said that, within the gathering places of the Ancient Immortal Continent’s major clans, lay the
            shadowy figures of the Inheritors of the Demonic Arts. There, many ancestral tombs and strong men were
            robbed. </p>
        <p> The Inheritors of the Forbidden Demonic Arts appeared all over the place. To the fright of many, some would
            have you believe that the Cultivation Base of the inheritor has grown to monstrous degrees… </p>

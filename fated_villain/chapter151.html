      <h4>
        Chapter 151: Truthfully, I Love Killing People Indiscriminately; This
        Cat And Mouse Game Is Somewhat Intriguing.
      </h4>
      <p>
        In the pavilion, the middle-aged woman with golden wings felt chills all
        over as even her very soul trembled at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet she didn’t even dare to turn her head around, for fear that the
        Young Creatures behind her would see her pale and horrified face.
      </p>
      <p>‘Gu Changge?!’</p>
      <p>‘How did he find me?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘And when did he arrive? So many natives of the Ancient Immortal
        Continent, but no one saw him enter?’
      </p>
      <p>The golden-winged woman felt chills all around her body.</p>
      <p>
        Her origins stemmed from the Golden Crow Clan, though she only had a
        trace of the Golden Crow blood flowing in her veins and not the complete
        bloodline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with her strength only being in the Heavenly God Realm, those in
        the same realm could not be compared to her. People regarded her as a
        strong leader.
      </p>
      <p>However, facing Gu Changge, her heart pounded as fear consumed her.</p>
      <p>This young man was powerful and impossibly scary.</p>
      <p>
        Especially since she had just spoken slanderous words about Gu Changge
        behind his back.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge definitely heard her.</p>
      <p>
        The frightened, middle-aged woman was extremely desperate at this
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>“Why don’t you continue? Satisfy my curiosity.”</p>
      <p>Gu Changge asked without the slightest change of tone in his voice.</p>
      <p>
        Then he casually found a place to sit down, with a faint smile on his
        face, as if he had returned to his own home and was simply relaxing.
      </p>
      <p>Not an unnatural or embarrassing scene at all.</p>
      <p>The Young Creatures in the pavilion were a little confused now.</p>
      <p>
        Why did a human suddenly walk in? They still had yet to even react to
        the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of them have only heard of Gu Changge’s name, but no one has
        actually seen his face, leaving them without the terror and awe that
        should be present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of them had also speculated that Gu Changge was a hideous and ugly
        person, so they didn’t even manage to associate him with the handsome
        young man in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Who are you? How did you come in?” At that moment, the woman with wings
        and a pretty face asked with a frown.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of the creatures here had a favourable impression of the human
        race.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the native creatures who have always attached great importance to
        the inheritance of blood, the human race was lowly and despicable,
        unable to compare with their ancient and noble clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the opening of the Immortal Ancient Continent, this feeling of
        disgust only compounded as a large number of human races poured into
        their realm. They were sick of seeing humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I walked in. The door is there, and no one stopped me.” Gu Changge
        replied matter-of-factly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, as someone with the Void Talent, who could possibly block his
        path?
      </p>
      <p>
        None, unless an existence from the Sacred Realm restrained the space.
      </p>
      <p>
        But how many Sacred Realm cultivators would there be in such a small
        city? He can do whatever he wanted here without repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing that no one intercepted Gu Changge, many young creatures frowned
        with a hint of disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>‘Attending this gathering is impossible without an invitation.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Yet where did the invitation letter of this human come from, or was the
        servant at the door muddled and make a grave error?’
      </p>
      <p>
        “Gu...” The golden-winged middle-aged woman’s voice trembled slightly.
        She was about to speak but was interrupted by a smiling Gu Changge
        instead.
      </p>
      <p>“I’m just an old acquaintance of many days, no need to greet me.”</p>
      <p>
        After chasing the golden-winged woman over such distances and for so
        long, saying that they were old acquaintances was indeed not wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s words made her show a smile that was uglier than crying.
      </p>
      <p>“Sir, you are joking...”</p>
      <p>
        She could feel cold sweat on her back, the kind of fear one felt when
        facing a peerless beast. She felt so overwhelmed that she couldn’t even
        speak properly.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was more than capable of killing all of them.</p>
      <p>
        Their lives were pinched between Gu Changge’s fingers. With the
        slightest bit of force, they would all be reduced to mists of blood
        floating in the breeze. The woman didn’t dare reveal Gu Changge’s
        identity now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Gu Changge’s purpose here was a mystery, but it was certain
        that he held no good intentions toward them.
      </p>
      <p>“Third Aunt, who is he?”</p>
      <p>
        A young woman who also had golden wings asked in a very dissatisfied
        tone, just barely holding herself back from directly driving Gu Changge
        out.
      </p>
      <p>“Xue’er...”</p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged woman smiled bitterly. She was terrified and did not
        know what to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn’t seem to notice the aggravated expressions of these
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        He poured himself a glass of wine, raised it to his lips, and took a
        sip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge couldn’t help but smile and praise, “This wine is not bad, it
        actually contains a variety of nourishing immortal fruits...”
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, someone suddenly snapped back with a look of contempt,
        “This wine is only available in our Immortal Ancient Continent. You
        won’t find it anywhere in the outside world.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded in agreement, “Yeah, but it doesn’t matter. I’ll
        manage to drink it somehow.”
      </p>
      <p>People could not understand the meaning of his words.</p>
      <p>Yet, for some unknown reason, they felt extremely uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>This young man possessed an aura that made them feel terrified.</p>
      <p>
        “Just who are you? Why are you at our banquet?” One couldn’t help but
        shout. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>
        They couldn’t see through Gu Changge’s strength, but seeing as he was
        about the same age as them, they mistakenly believed that he shouldn’t
        be stronger than themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the cultivation of outsiders was always notably inferior to
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Lord Long Teng was ahead by a whole major realm than his opponent
        back then. If it hadn’t been for the enemy’s use of despicable means,
        how could he have been killed so easily?
      </p>
      <p>This was the everlasting regret in their hearts.</p>
      <p>
        Hence, the native beings didn’t even have the slightest sympathy for
        this strange man in front of them, and could not wait to strike him
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It doesn’t matter who I am. What matters is what you lot said just now,
        which interests me a lot.” Gu Changge smiled ever so casually.
      </p>
      <p>He glanced at everyone in front of him with intrigue.</p>
      <p>A game of cat and mouse is truly fun.</p>
      <p>
        Not wanting anyone to destroy his amusement, he glanced at the
        middle-aged woman with an inexplicable meaning in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged woman soon understood his actions, and her face turned
        even paler.
      </p>
      <p>‘Dare to say who I am, and all of you here will die.’</p>
      <p>This was what Gu Changge’s word meant to her.</p>
      <p>She was shaking all over with uncontrollable fear.</p>
      <p>“What’s wrong with you, Third Aunt?”</p>
      <p>
        The younger woman who spoke just now had noticed her abnormality and
        asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged woman hurriedly ceased her trembling upon hearing this,
        shaking her head and replying, “I’m fine, I’m fine...”
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, the young creatures present were not stupid, and it was
        obvious that they had sensed an abnormality. This matter was not
        overlooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Why did an expert of the Golden Crow Clan become so frightened as soon
        as the young man arrived?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This is the territory of the Ancient Immortal Races. No matter how
        arrogant this person is, what would he dare do to us?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Some creatures felt disdain in their hearts, thinking that no matter how
        terrible the man in front of them is, would he dare to make trouble on
        enemy territory?
      </p>
      <p>
        “So what? We were talking about that despicable guy named Gu Changge
        just now, and that we will kill him and avenge Lord Long Teng!”
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        A beautiful-looking woman with feathers suddenly shouted bitterly, full
        of anger and killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        “That young genius of your human race. During a fair match, he plotted
        and killed Lord Long Teng by utilizing underhanded methods. We’ll all
        remember this hatred!”
      </p>
      <p>The rest of the creatures also began babbling.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, it seemed that all the aggro was tacked onto Gu Changge,
        and everyone looked as if they wanted to attack him on the spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn’t notice, however, that when they spoke, the middle-aged woman
        shook like a sieve and turned her face away from them as if to cut off
        her relationship with them.
      </p>
      <p>“Oh? What shameless methods did this Gu Changge use?”</p>
      <p>
        Listening to their swears and curses, Gu Changge’s face didn’t change or
        shift at all, and he instead continued asking about the matter with
        great interest.
      </p>
      <p>There was no aura of a great villain anywhere to be found.</p>
      <p>
        “Humph. When that b*****d fought, he first initiated a sneak attack.
        Then he threatened the life of a creature from our Immortal Ancient
        Races, asking Lord Long Teng not to resist, or he would kill them.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Lord Long Teng saw the bigger picture and so he did not resist.
        Otherwise, with that b*****d’s mere False God Realm cultivation, how
        could he have even injured Lord Long Teng?”
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as they said this, everyone brimmed with righteous indignation,
        it was as if their anger had been ignited, filled with fury and
        murderous intent.
      </p>
      <p>The entire pavilion almost burst with their collective hatred.</p>
      <p>
        “Oh, if that is the case, then Gu Changge really is a despicable and
        shameless villain.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge raised his glass and took another sip of wine, nodding in
        agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing his agreeance, everyone was suddenly a little stunned. They
        thought that he, as a member of the human race, would justify Gu
        Changge’s actions.
      </p>
      <p>They never expected him to agree with them.</p>
      <p>For a while, they didn’t know what to say.</p>
      <p>
        Some creatures even softened their attitude towards the strange man.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It seems that Gu Changge is not considered a good person even in the
        human race. I really don’t know where his Young Asura title came from,
        but he doesn’t deserve this kind of treatment!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The woman with feathers spoke with lingering hatred, wanting to smash Gu
        Changge’s body into tens of thousands of pieces and then feed the chunks
        to the dogs!
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, the golden-winged middle-aged woman looked more and more
        lifeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        She felt that Gu Changge’s aura had locked her in, and if she moved even
        a little, she would face a thunderous blow so powerful from Gu Changge
        that she would enough to kill her ten times over.
      </p>
      <p>She didn’t even dare to speak.</p>
      <p>“However, I think you are a little misguided.”</p>
      <p>Gu Changge opened his mouth with a smile.</p>
      <p>
        The expression on his face made even his provoking sentence feel like a
        spring breeze.
      </p>
      <p>“Which point is wrong?” Someone felt taken aback.</p>
      <p>
        “Gu Changge is indeed despicable and shameless, but he actually likes
        killing innocent people the most. Especially those who slander him
        behind his back, he would show no mercy at all.”
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge replied with a faint smile.</p>
      <p>“Isn’t that right?”</p>
      <p>
        He turned around and asked the golden-winged middle-aged woman behind
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged woman received a great shock when she heard the
        question, turned around from her position of ‘not caring about the
        world’, and squeezing out an ugly smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Young master, what are you talking about? It’s all fake, all fake.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “These rumours are false, maliciously spread around by some idiots to
        slander Gu Changge. At that time, Long Teng simply had no power to
        resist, as if an ant...”
      </p>
      <p>She kept talking ceaselessly.</p>
      <p>
        However, these contradicting words instantly caused the eyes of the
        Young Creatures in front to widen, and they wondered whether they were
        hallucinating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone flushed with anger and shouted, “What nonsense are you talking
        about? How could Lord Long Teng possibly be defeated in a head-on
        confrontation?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “How is it possible? What you’re spouting are mere fairy tales, an
        impossibility that could not happen!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Master Long Teng was born invincible, destined to push the world
        around. He is the young leader of the Ancient Races! He can’t be
        defeated, not by the hands of the human race!”
      </p>
      <p>Many shouted, feeling as though their faith was being insulted.</p>
      <p>
        These words made the golden-winged middle-aged woman shake
        uncontrollably.
      </p>
      <p>She wanted to order them to stop, but it was too late.</p>
      <p>
        “Right, of course. Exactly what nonsense are you sprouting, you old hag?
        I, Gu Changge, am just a despicable villain. How can I be as strong as
        you say? Aren’t I simply an ant in front of the ‘great’ Long Teng?”
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Gu Changge also stared at her and spoke.</p>
      <p>
        The smile on his face did not diminish, and he became even more casual
        with his speech.
      </p>
      <p>‘What?!’</p>
      <p>
        These words suddenly stunned the young creatures in front of them,
        dumbfounding them.
      </p>
      <p>They almost didn’t react.</p>
      <p>
        The woman who hated Gu Changge to her bones also looked stupid and
        sluggish. She pointed her finger at him shakily and was speechless for a
        while.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You... what did you say?” She was so shocked that she couldn’t believe
        it.
      </p>
      <p>Did they hear him right?</p>
      <p>The young man in front of them is actually... Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>
        In response, the group of creatures immediately widened their eyes,
        their bodies were icy cold, and they froze in place, like falling into
        an icy cellar.
      </p>
      <p>Plummeting from Heaven straight to Hell.</p>
      <p>They scolded Gu Changge in front of Gu Changge?</p>
      <p>Their scalps were tingling. Unbelievable!</p>
      <p>
        “Didn’t you say you wanted to kill me to avenge Long Teng? Am I not
        right in front of you now?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said with the playful look of a cat toying with a cornered
        mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as the words fell, he waved his sleeves, and the entire pavilion
        rumbled. As if a thick fog had risen, countless runes flashed
        mysteriously with an otherworldly charm.
      </p>
      <p>“Don’t!”</p>
      <p>
        The winged woman who scolded Gu Changge was terrified, horrified, and
        baulked in desperation as she was bombarded by a terrifying force.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest finally reacted and realized that a deadly battle today was
        inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>“What...”</p>
      <p>“Fight him! Avenge Lord Long Teng!”</p>
      <p>“Kill!”</p>
      <p>
        This group of Young Creatures were both angry and frightened at the same
        time, finding the space blocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their only way to survive was to kill the Gu Changge in front of them;
        otherwise, they won’t be able to escape at all, and would die without
        even a complete corpse!
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>All kinds of divine lights emerged.</p>
      <p>
        Across all four directions, the air blurred with an endless haze. Some
        people sacrificed Divine Artifacts and some utilized precious runes.
        Precious artifacts and protective talismans soared across the sky. They
        screamed aloud, showing their strongest means, wanting to break out of
        the pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, they seemed to have become fearless soldiers unafraid of
        death, as if they were going to fight to the bitter end with the villain
        known as Gu Changge!
      </p>
      <p>“Gu Changge, if you must attack, then come at me! Let them leave!”</p>
      <p>All face was torn between the two sides.</p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged woman threw away her concerns, blocking Gu Changge’s
        path as she spoke with a trembling tone. There was no turning back.
      </p>
      <p>A strong aura began to rise from her.</p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly God Realm Cultivation Base revealed itself! Surging with
        infinite might, the Heavenly God Dharma Body acted like a galaxy, so
        vast that it seemed to rush out of this pavilion and appear outside in
        the starry skies.

          });
        </script>

      <p>“Spare them? And who will spare me?” Gu Changge smiled viciously.</p>
      <p>Hum!</p>
      <p>Divine light as heavy as billions of worlds!</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge slapped his palm down, turning the sky inside out as the
        universe shattered, like hundreds of millions of stars fell down at
        once!
      </p>
      <p>Puff!</p>
      <p>
        The golden-winged middle-aged woman suddenly coughed up blood,
        experiencing the sensation of being struck by lightning. With an audible
        bang, she was slapped to the floor. Who knew how many bones were broken
        by that attack?
      </p>
      <p>“How are you so strong...”</p>
      <p>Her expression was of despair and disbelief.</p>
      <p>
        After all, she is a Heavenly God Realm cultivator. She is normally so
        powerful that she can easily slaughter a city by lifting a finger!
      </p>
      <p>
        She knew that she might not be Gu Changge’s opponent, but that should
        also be after Gu Changge used many means and even some trump cards.
      </p>
      <p>Yet, when truly facing Gu Changge, she couldn’t even handle a slap?</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, her soul trembled as she felt incredibly distraught.
      </p>
      <p>‘It was no accident that this Young Asura killed Long Teng.’</p>
      <p>‘He is unfathomably powerful!’</p>
      <p>
        Even those of the older generation might not be his opponent, much less
        the current younger generation. He was simply unmatched, unparalleled in
        his generation.
      </p>
      <p>“How is this possible?”</p>
      <p>“What?! Even Third Aunt is not his opponent?”</p>
      <p>
        “Third Aunt is in the Heavenly God Realm! Could it be that Lord Long
        Teng was really beaten?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Witnessing this scene with their own eyes, all the creatures panicked.
        Most of the powerful beings within their ranks were almost killed by Gu
        Changge’s palm.
      </p>
      <p>What were they in comparison?</p>
      <p>“A pity. I wanted to play with you for a bit longer.”</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked regretful, but there was not much regret in his tone
        at all.
      </p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>He didn’t bother wasting any more time and struck a quick blow.</p>
      <p>
        The big palm straddled the space in front and crossed it in an instant,
        splitting the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this blocked space, the transmission of movement and sound was not
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>So why not have a bit of fun?</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>
        A terrifying aura emerged and revolved, changing into a huge grinding
        disc, enough to crush everything. The force of rotation was so strong
        that it made people faint!
      </p>
      <p>“Argh!”</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to die!”</p>
      <p>A beautiful scene accompanied by the screams of many.</p>
      <p>
        They collapsed one after another, puffing into innumerable blood mists.
        No matter how the Young Creatures resisted, it was useless, for the only
        way out… was death.
      </p>
      <p>The difference was too vast!</p>
      <p>
        Except for the one person who survived, the rest of the natives present
        all perished.
      </p>
      <p>
        The surviving person was a frightened, pale, young woman with golden
        feathers growing on her body, looking at Gu Changge in horror.
      </p>
      <p>“Please don’t kill me.” She shook in fear.</p>
      <p>
        She never imagined it. Everyone’s power added up was still not equal to
        Gu Changge’s random slap. This person was simply too terrifying,
        impossible to oppose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked at her and spoke lightly, “No worries, I won’t kill
        you yet.”
      </p>
      <p>“Why are you doing this?”</p>
      <p>
        On the other side, the golden-winged middle-aged woman who was struck
        down previously, asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        She aimed to sacrifice her Divine Artifact to forge an escape route, but
        Gu Changge swiftly struck again, shattering it in the void with a bang,
        turning her artifact into ashes!
      </p>
      <p>‘Smashed to pieces with a single palm?’</p>
      <p>She looked pale and bloodless.</p>
      <p>“You saw something you shouldn’t have. Can you blame me?”</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled casually. After all, doing this was as simple as
        shooting a group of ants to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I can swear with my Dao Heart that I won’t say anything. Please spare
        my life!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The golden-winged middle-aged woman begged in despair. She did not know
        that those slandering words of hers would cause a disaster of such
        untold magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>She knelt on the ground, pleading for mercy, wishing to survive.</p>
      <p>Nobody wants to die. It was simple logic.</p>
      <p>
        “Rather than oaths made on Dao Hearts, I am one who believes in the
        phrase ‘Dead men tell no tales’.” Gu Changge smiled lightly, not ready
        to let her go so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had always acted meticulously without leaving the slightest hidden
        danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he acted, slapping the woman to death with one palm, destroying
        both body and primordial spirit.
      </p>
      <p>Just like that, this fight was done.</p>
      <p>
        He did not choose to leave early. Instead, he was waiting for just the
        right moment…
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn’t plan to deal with this gruesome scene either;
        otherwise, how would people know that he had done such a ‘good deed’.
      </p>
      <p>
        The woman left alive by him was just about frightened to the point of
        stupidity. And to think this was the same girl who wanted to kill Gu
        Changge to avenge her Lord Long Teng.
      </p>
      <p>Now she was on the verge of pissing herself out of fear.</p>
      <p>
        “Speaking of which, it’s about time someone noticed the anomaly here.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge estimated the time and then broke the runic pattern that
        shrouded the vicinity, letting a sudden strong smell of blood waft out
        into the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, many creatures on the street noticed it.</p>
      <p>“What is this extremely potent and bloody smell?”</p>
      <p>“What happened?”</p>
      <p>“What the hell? Why is there such a strong blood scent?”</p>
      <p>
        Many were shocked and rushed in the direction where the stench came
        from.
      </p>
      <p>“Damn it!”</p>
      <p>
        A powerful creature noticed the situation in the pavilion and roared in
        anger.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone stared in dead silence.</p>
      <p>
        As the blood mist drifted away, the picturesque scene of a young man
        slowly slapping to death an arrogant daughter of heaven—who belonged to
        one of the feathered tribes, appeared.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing their arrival, he seemed a little surprised.</p>
      <p>“Was I found out?”</p>
      <p>
        Following his rhetorical question, the void in front of the young man’s
        eyes blurred for a while as he turned around, stepped into it, and
        vanished from view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him, a large group of strong men from all ethnic groups of the
        Ancient Immortal Continent ran forward, but there was no time to stop
        him. Their faces turned blue as they roared at the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Damn it! Coming to our territory and killing our people! You’re
        COURTING DEATH!”
      </p>
      <p>They roared, mad with hatred, making for a startling sight.</p>
      <p>All the clans worked as one and the same, sharing the same sky!</p>
      <p>This grudge must be avenged!</p>
      <p>
        However, they didn’t even see who the young man was, nor what he looked
        like.
      </p>
      <p>So how was this vengeance supposed to be wrought?</p>
      <p>=+=</p>

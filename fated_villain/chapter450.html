      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Hmm?&#8221; Just then, a female Elder with faint dark green eyes
        suddenly turned around and looked towards a direction, saying,
        &#8220;Someone&#8217;s behind us.&#8221;<span id="more-30330"></span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        With that, a faint dark green glow that seemingly had Life Force
        coursing through erupted from her body. It took everyone a second to
        react to the Elder&#8217;s words, and they very quickly pulled out
        various weapons at the ready as they stared at the space behind them.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The Elder was known as Grandma Lu Cui, a peerless master of the Lu
        Family with the ‘God of Life’ Bloodline.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Because of her innate ability to sense and control nature, she was able
        to turn the many plants here into her &#8216;eyes&#8217; and sense
        images that no other beings of her level could.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Hence, the group dared not make little of the situation but stared
        cautiously behind them as they took out their godly weapons, which
        glowed as they appeared in mid-air, displaying their great powers, at
        the ready to fight.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The only ones who would appear at this time would be the cultivators of
        the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Who goes there!? Why hide!? Show yourself!&#8221; The Huo Family
        Elder flew into a rage as scarlet divine light shone in his eyes. With a
        fling of his arms, the divine light transformed into a sea of fire, and
        he shot it into the space behind them.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;What great perception. To think you can sense our
        presence…&#8221; sneered an unfamiliar voice as a group of cultivators
        and living beings in various clothing, shrouded in divine light,
        appeared from behind a boulder not far away. They were of the various
        forces of the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The one who had spoken was a middle-aged man who didn&#8217;t appear to
        be of the human race as he had a grey horn on his head, and as he spoke,
        he too extended his arm to launch an attack, nullifying the Huo Family
        Elder&#8217;s attack.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;The Upper Realm. I knew it! How dare you people sneak into our
        territory!&#8221; The others of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains
        bore maliciously into the group that suddenly appeared while Grandma Lu
        Cui&#8217;s heart skipped a beat as she swept her gaze across the
        cultivators and living beings in front of her.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      [Judging from their aura, they are from different forces. It&#8217;s
      obvious the few young ones at the back are more distinguished when
      they&#8217;re protected by the cultivators in the front.]
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This thought was especially true for the beautiful, shapely young woman
        in blue. She had luscious hair, fair and flawless skin, and big,
        gleaming eyes. And the gazes of the other young men at her were of
        concealed admiration.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;This wasteland called the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains will
        soon become ours anyway, so why bother about whose territory is
        it?&#8221; The middle-aged man sneered as he swept his condescending
        glance across those of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This was the general attitude of the Upper Realm towards the Eight
        Wastelands and Ten Domains, for the latter had nothing on the Upper
        Realm, be it in cultivation environment or cultivation resources. Hence,
        in the eyes of many Upper Realm young prodigies, the Eight Wastelands
        and Ten Domains were nothing more than a wasteland one could breach.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Anger flashed across the Huo Family Elder and Grandma Lu Cui after
        hearing the middle-aged man&#8217;s words. The young prodigies behind
        the two, too, were furious, seeing that they had been looked down upon
        by the Upper Realm like this.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        After all, how could they not be when their foes had not only waltzed
        into their territory but even acted so arrogantly?!
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;What? Have we hit a sore spot?&#8221; the middle-aged man gibed.
        &#8220;Have you people forgotten how many of your fellow cultivators
        have died in the previous tag team battle? Which of your cultivators of
        the same level are any match for us!?&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        His words angered the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains&#8217; natives
        further as their countenances turned grim. It was a scar they
        couldn&#8217;t get rid of, so how could they not be furious when
        someone, their enemy even more so, brought it up again?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The older cultivators might be able to swallow the humiliation, but the
        young ones certainly couldn&#8217;t. How could they when they had been
        mocked again and again!?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;You people asked for it!&#8221; A few young ones boomed as they
        went forth to fight. However, several of their Elders held them back,
        warning them against acting rashly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Sure, they outnumbered the group of Upper Realms men and were even on
        their turf, but the latter evidently came prepared and shouldn&#8217;t
        be underestimated.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;What? Are you asking for death?&#8221; asked one of the few young
        men from the Upper Realm plainly, who had, too, gone forth.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Their auras were powerful, and an intense glow enveloped their bodies.
        In fact, some of them were enveloped in a dark glow that veiled their
        faces, which was a sign of incredible power.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It was evident that they were no simple cultivators and were even
        renowned young prodigies in the Upper Realm when they could enter the
        Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Hmph!&#8221; The young ones from the Eight Wastelands and Ten
        Domains snorted with seething rage.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      [Don&#8217;t do anything rash,] an Elder transmitted his inner voice to
      the young ones as his gaze darted around, having already devised a plan.
      [We&#8217;ll only consider attacking after knowing what they have. Since
      this is our territory, we certainly won&#8217;t let them act too
      arrogantly.]
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        After all, this void space was still within the Eight Wastelands and Ten
        Domains, and they had even brought along an artifact that could alert
        the outside-world just to be on the safe side.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Once that supreme treasure launched a devastating attack, this entire
        space would be obliterated, and those within would assuredly die.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>They feared no death; the question was if the Upper Realms men did.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Just then, a tall, handsome young man with a faint astral glow shook his
        head and stopped his fellow men from the Upper Realms.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;We&#8217;re here to secure the supreme treasure, not to fight.
        What do you say we do, Lady Gu?&#8221; he asked while looking toward the
        young woman in blue with a smile that made him look gentlemanly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The young woman in blue nodded in agreement. &#8220;We&#8217;ll do as
        you say, Brother Song.&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The others, too, nodded and quieted down, no longer ridiculing the Eight
        Wastelands and Ten Domains natives.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The young man who had spoken up was clearly reputable. He was Song
        Yunfei, a young prodigy from Supreme Cave Heaven and a minor celebrity
        that outmatched many back in the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It was also evident that he was trying to woo the young woman in blue as
        he intended to please the beauty by revealing Supreme Cave
        Heaven&#8217;s secrets and gathering men to search for the treasure.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Song Yunfei knew his Sect Master, Chu Hao, had also come with his fellow
        Supreme Cave Heaven cultivators, so he wasn&#8217;t worried at all that
        the others would seize the supreme treasure for themselves after
        disclosing the secret. However, he didn&#8217;t foresee encountering
        cultivators from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Followingly, the two groups parted ways and didn&#8217;t engage in a
        fight, for they didn&#8217;t want to battle it out when they had more
        important plans.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        While the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains cultivators rushed to
        rendezvous with Lin Wu&#8217;s group, they were also keeping a wary eye
        on the Upper Realm group, worried that they would suddenly attack, and
        it wasn&#8217;t after seeing the latter head in the opposite direction
        that they relaxed.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        However, Song Yunfei and the others didn&#8217;t leave far before
        stopping again, and the young woman in blue wondered with a frown,
        &#8220;I have a nagging feeling that that group of people are up to
        something; they&#8217;re probably desperately looking for something.
        That&#8217;s why they chose to evade us.&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;In that case, why don&#8217;t we follow them and see what
        they&#8217;re after?&#8221; Song Yunfei smiled in response.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        He knew they wouldn&#8217;t be able to retrieve the Supreme Dao Diagram
        anyway, even if they actually managed to find it at this time. So why
        not see what the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains&#8217; natives were up
        to?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        At that, the young woman in blue pondered for a moment before nodding in
        agreement.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        She was also aware that Song Yunfei wasn&#8217;t worried she would be
        able to claim the Supreme Dao Diagram for herself even if he willingly
        told her about it. Hence, finding the other lost supreme treasure would
        be a more reliable plan at this point.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Can it be something to do with the inheritance of that mysterious
        cultivator who died fighting the Supreme Cave Heaven Ancestor?&#8221;
        mused another young prodigy as his gaze shifted.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we see for ourselves? It&#8217;s not like they
        can cause anything really damaging,&#8221; said Song Yunfei confidently
        with a wave of his hand, desperately wanting to uphold his image in
        front of the beautiful young woman in blue.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        She was someone of the direct branch from the Immortal Gu Family. Not
        only was she stunning, but she was also of noble status, so it was
        difficult for most to meet her.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        He could consider himself incredibly lucky if he managed to seize this
        opportunity, win her heart, and in turn, enter the Immortal Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        What was she compared to a disciple from Supreme Cave Heaven? All the
        Upper Realm forces now knew just how mysterious and unfathomably
        powerful the Immortal Gu Family were.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, somewhere not far away, a scarlet glow was interweaving in
        the sky like a malicious bloody cloud and, even more so, like endless
        armoured horses galloping away from it, wanting to transform the earth
        into a massive ancient battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Two enormous mountains made up this mysterious-looking valley that
        seemingly existed since beyond time with the brilliant glows and
        multicoloured mists that shrouded it.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If one had an aerial view of the place, it would look like an inverted
        gourd.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        What was more, many gourd vines had also rooted themselves in between
        the crevices of the two mountains aside as they swayed to the direction
        of the wind, bearing glowing gourds of various colours, all the size of
        a palm.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        And on this day, a brilliant light that filled the place burst out as
        though an incredibly powerful object was reviving, returning to light.
        Such terrifying energy was practically like a massive tide, surging
        greatly with incredible animosity.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Right then, Lin Wu, Lu Luo, and the others were standing in the Gourd
        Valley with grave looks on their faces.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The Elders, especially, gazed apprehensively behind them, worried that
        someone would rush over, for the abnormal phenomenon here was genuinely
        too shocking. They wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it stirred those
        hundreds of thousands of kilometres away.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        They, too, never expected such a massive commotion from their search for
        the Spirit Gourd Master&#8217;s lost mythical gourd.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Lin Wu, you head into the valley. We&#8217;ll wait for you
        here,&#8221; said Lu Luo gravely, knowing it was she who triggered the
        anomaly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Be careful, Brother Lin Wu. You&#8217;re our hope.&#8221; The
        other young cultivators also wore grave expressions on their faces.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Though they, too, wished to retrieve the treasure in the valley, they
        also knew probably no one else other than Lin Wu had the ability and
        right to do so, and what they could do was only stay here and buy Lin Wu
        some time by holding up those who came after noticing the commotion.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        At that, Lin Wu nodded and said gravely, &#8220;I know. You guys be
        careful too.&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>With a flash, he rushed ahead into the Gourd Valley.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, an amber glow appeared in his palm. It was a gourd
        leaf that had already withered, and it looked as though it had been
        carved from a yellow jade with the way it glowed softly. It was indeed a
        mythical item, and it was this thing that triggered the shocking
        phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Lin Wu had actually gotten the leaf by chance.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This leaf came from the mythical gourd owned by the Spirit Gourd Master,
        and only through this leaf could anyone find this place.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Now, Lin Wu was confident that the lost mythical gourd was lying asleep
        in the depths of the Gourd Valley, and he would be able to find and
        retrieve that mythical gourd with time.

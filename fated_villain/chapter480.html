          face couldn&#8217;t be seen as he was enveloped entirely in mist.
          However, one could still make out that he had very long hair and a

          Shoal?&#8221; The Successor of Holy King Palace, the most enigmatic of
          them all, had shown himself as well right then. He was enveloped in a
          misty glow that looked like time fragments, and although he stood
          physically next to his fellow disciples, it looked as though he was in
          a different dimension.</span

          second, he grunted involuntarily, and his body jolted while blood
          trickled down from the corner of his lips. He was forced to

          his reverence deepened. He was shaking, but it was barely noticeable.
          He couldn&#8217;t believe Gu Changge could seriously injure him and
          even nearly shatter his soul with just one gaze.</span

          all impassive and aloof. She seemed to despise Gu Changge very much in
          the eyes of many, and it made everyone, especially some prodigal
          damsels, envious. Nevertheless, the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s little
          princess was probably the only one in this world who dared to treat Gu

          never humble herself before her cousin, not even showing a sliver of
          joy, especially when they were in front of a crowd. If anything, she
          wished nothing more than for people to think they were at complete

          going to fight with the youths from the Eight Wastelands and Ten

          >Gu Xianer was first stunned when she heard what Gu Changge said, but
          the reaction was quickly replaced by distrust. She could already
          consider herself lucky if Gu Changge didn&#8217;t snatch her treasures
          for himself. In her mind, all the treasures she obtained from him were
          ‘done through her own abilities’.</span

          with a smile. &#8220;This is a divine dress I got after obliterating
          the Nine Great Mountains. Though its spirituality is gone, it&#8217;s
          still an invaluable protective artifact. And this. This is the
          Primeval True Feather of a Demon Overlord. Its power, once activated,

          erratically. If it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that the dress was in Gu

          treasures, and yet you still tempt me with them!?] Even her big red
          bird by her leg was gawking at the two priceless treasures as it
          flapped its wings. Evidently, nothing needed to be said to know just
          how precious these two treasures were.</span

          >&#8220;Alright then,&#8221; sighed Gu Changge with pity. &#8220;Since

          >Gu Xianer glared daggers at him at once. One would suspect if
          she&#8217;d snatch them right away. But Gu Changge seemed to have
          turned a blind eye to her reaction.</span

          >&#8220;I don&#8217;t need them, but since you&#8217;ve decided to
          give them to me, I should still accept your well wishes,&#8221; said
          the young woman with reluctance on the surface while feeling vexed on
          the inside.</span

          >&#8220;But if you don&#8217;t need them, I think it&#8217;s better to
          give them to someone who needs them more. After all, the battle at the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains is so dangerous this time, anybody
          can die.&#8221; Gu Changge grinned. But after catching his
          cousin&#8217;s piercing gaze, he decided not to tease her anymore.
          &#8220;But there&#8217;s no harm in having more
          protection.&#8221;</span

          If it weren&#8217;t for the many eyes on them, she&#8217;d have long
          sunken her teeth into this bastard she calls brother.</span

          >In actuality, Gu Changge had long decided to give her both the divine
          dress as well as the Primeval True Feather.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Initially, he had planned to refine the Primeval True Feather into
          the Immortal-Killing Gourd, but later, he realised it was rather
          redundant, as the gourd&#8217;s power was already leagues above the
          True Feather. Moreover, he personally had no use for the
          feather.</span

          Zijin, in a light blue dress, approached them with an amiable smile.

          >&#8220;I really am jealous of you, Xianer. To think you have such a
          sweet brother!&#8221; commented An Yan, the young lady of the Hidden
          An Clan, with a beaming glimmer in her eyes. Her hair glowed
          beautifully as she approached Gu Xianer from afar.</span

          >She chatted away with Gu Xianer, looking rather envious at the
          mention of the scene a few minutes ago. It was as though all she could
          see was Gu Xianer, as she didn&#8217;t give a damn about the
          others.</span

          Changge at once. Instead, she merely said hi out of politeness.</span

          Have they cowered too much to appear? Why did they accept the

          disinterested in the battle.</span

          stationed there to prevent the Upper Realm from taking them by
          surprise put up a brave front, keeping their heads held high.
          &#8220;Our people are on their way! What is there for us to fear?! We

          groundless stupidity. Do you honestly think a True Dragon and a vermin
          are in the same league? You can’t really think you have a chance at
          winning this battle, do you? This very land had buried countless of
          your Ancestors back then. We had killed each and every one of them and
          chucked their corpses here. Are you all intending to join them?&#8221;

          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, who were rushing over even though
          they were enraged and unwilling.</span

          Upper Realm who had just spoken lifted his head and looked
          contemptuously into the distance. Fleets of ancient battleships were
          traversing the sky towards their direction, and behind them followed
          many divine rainbows as well.</span

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This world fears him…&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal&#8217;s voice noticeably shook as thoughts stormed into his mind. [Young Master Gu must not be the compassionate man he pretends to be, and he&#8217;s by no means a good man!]</span><span id="more-34809"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Perhaps this is his true motive. And by destroying the entrance, does he intend to slaughter everyone here?&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal uncontrollably trembled as unconcealable shock arose in her glistening eyes underneath her mask.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having searched the souls of the formidable cultivators from the Upper Realm, she understood how terrifying Gu Changge&#8217;s background was in the Upper Realm. The True Daoists&#8217; fearful attitude towards him further indicated so. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if all the True Daoists were to die here, Gu Changge probably wouldn&#8217;t be affected at all. Since he entered this world and destroyed the entrance, he must have come prepared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Might the strange disturbance in the outside world be his doing?] Shivering, the Snow Sword Immortal thought of another possibility. In that instant, she felt that Gu Changge was more frightening than what she knew of him, and there was no way she could ever fathom his purpose and thoughts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge traversed through the sky, disregarding the stunned, frantic expressions of Abundance Sword Immortal and the rest. Essentially, he had not the slightest interest in the Earth Sword Immortals, and it would only be a waste of time if he were to slaughter them and absorb their Sources.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, he had been exploiting the Earth Sword Immortals to find this place for him. Now that they lost their last bit of value, their lives no longer mattered to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* In front, a vast, weighty aura was surging, capable of instilling fear into any living beings in this world. That was the wrath of the World’’s Will, harbouring an aura and intimidation that could obliterate the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this small world, endless, dense silver lights were wafting, and those lights were the vast lightning sea, striking from the depths of the sky towards the bottommost spots. The lightning bolts were massive, spreading to no end, as if they were from a pool of lightning that was hidden in the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extremely ferocious, resembling a lightning dragon the size of a gigantic mountain that exposed its teeth and swung its claws, the lightning speedily flashed across the sky with a terrorising aura of devastation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless fiery stars emerged around the bodies of the Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty and the others as they were swiftly speeding through the sky towards the lakeside of the Mirror Lake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the lightning couldn&#8217;t inflict any effective damage on them, they could sense unfamiliar Principles spreading in this world. Although the Tower of Blessing was not far from them and it seemed as though they were only one step away, they could never close the distance despite having travelled so far, and they remained the same distance from the tower.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, they understood that it was a kind of supreme Space Principles, and they must shatter those Principles in order to reach Mirror Lake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It appears the Principles of Nature of this world won&#8217;t be easy to deal with, they lingered upon the refinement of the Heavenly Dao here and are capable of resisting us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an icy glare, a True Daoist, whose body was covered in a billion traces of crimson mists, thrusted his palm and extinguished the lightning. He attempted to shatter the Principles of this world, only to see the fractured space reverting to its original state. As a matter of fact, he was a powerful True Daoist whose cultivation was unequalled. In the Upper Realm, he could effortlessly destroy Star Territories. Yet, in this world, he couldn&#8217;t even blast through the space barrier, and was unable to break through this world&#8217;s Principles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His face grew taut as he was in dismay. He struck his palm once again. This time, a peerless aura surged as innumerable starlights amassed. The Divine Principles were aggressively vaporised, and the void was eventually penetrated. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that didn&#8217;t persist for long. The shattered void recovered and grew even sturdier than before as vague auras of Immortality appeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stop attacking! This place is indeed strange, but it is certainly enhanced by the Heavenly Dao here, which allows it to mend itself…&#8221; The Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty shook his head as he stopped the others. At the same time, his gaze grew solemn, and he seemed less condescending as he was previously.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right at that moment, a True Daoist suddenly noticed what happened behind him and widened his eyes in stupefaction. When he observed carefully, he realised that the approaching figures were awfully familiar, and that left him in dismay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge! Why is he here as well?&#8221; Another True Daoist expressed his shock. His eyes bore gleaming divine lights as he peered at the scene behind him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if the lightning bolts were being wiped out, the region behind was nothing but empty, while Gu Changge and his trustworthy subordinate of the Quasi-Nirvana Realm casually walked over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As expected, he came with a goal in mind, and not for the &#8216;merriness&#8217; as he claimed. We must keep our guard up.&#8221; The eyes of the Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty flickered, becoming exceedingly fearful and wary as numerous thoughts arose in his mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the other True Daoists&#8217; faces grew taut. However, they had yet to notice that the entrance of this world was destroyed, and they were simply assuming that Gu Changge&#8217;s goal was the same as theirs—to seize the World Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The lightning of this world completely avoids him…&#8221; As the Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty noticed the detail, he grew even more cautious and anxious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by Gu Changge&#8217;s behavioural pattern, he was certainly not a good man, and the Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was confident that Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t refrain from taking action against them if both parties were to clash. After all, there was no telling how many True Daoists Gu Changge had murdered on his path.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is bad…&#8221; The eyes of the Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty glimmered as he began to think of a way to retreat. Finally, the only solution he could come up with was to partner up with the other True Daoists to resist Gu Changge. If he were to give up on the World Source, which was highly likely to be hidden in this small world, he would be full of remorse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, he cast his divine sense to secretly warn the other True Daoists to be wary of Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t dare to take all of us at once, would he?&#8221; Hearing that, the rest of the True Daoists were dumbfounded, somewhat in disbelief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, they were each representative of their respective Immortal Forces. If Gu Changge were to rashly attack them, he would be declaring war against the Forces behind them. Although they were no match for Gu Changge, they could still easily escape, unless Gu Changge manage to trap them within this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Either way, we must remain cautious. For Gu Changge to reach his current state, he&#8217;s definitely not a man of altruism. The Forces that had dared to get in his way have all been obliterated,&#8221; a True Daoist of Sky Emperor Mountain whispered, sharing the same perspective as the Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, dear Seniors, have you been waiting for me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right when the True Daoists were feeling perturbed, a gentle chuckle suddenly sounded behind them, where Gu Changge swiftly appeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing his voice, the True Daoists were frightened as their pupils contracted. Given their strength, they were unable to clearly see how Gu Changge got here with just one step. It was as if the Principles of this world had no effect against him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, why have you joined us?&#8221; a True Daoist asked with an awkward expression. Oddly, as he stood so closely to Gu Changge, he felt a chill up his spine and a freezing sensation throughout his body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that the World Source is contained here, so I figured I should come see for myself. I suppose all of us share the same goal, yes?&#8221; Gu Changge faintly grinned with a leisurely expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know you&#8217;d be interested in such a thing, Young Master Changge.&#8221; The True Daoist of Godly Spirit Mountain awkwardly laughed to conceal the insecurity in his heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The others too grew silent, surprised by how Gu Changge stopped hiding his motive and honestly confessed that he came for the World Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This place is a small world born from the refinement of the Heavenly Dao of this world. It is highly possible that the World Source is hidden here…&#8221; the Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty softly stated as he shook his head, as if he ignored Gu Changge&#8217;s motive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In that case, shall we split the World Source equally once we get it? What do you think of that, Young Master Gu?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the True Daoists felt unsettled and one of them came up with a solution. Since Gu Changge decided to interfere, they could only surrender a portion of the World Source and offer to distribute it evenly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Split it equally?&#8221; Gu Changge seemed surprised before revealing a grin on his dashing face. He then shook his head and replied, &#8220;Perhaps you have some misunderstanding regarding your strengths?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221; Upon those words, the face of the True Daoist who gave the suggestion froze and grew dark. He never expected Gu Changge to reject him and insult them so blatantly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, the other True Daoists also furrowed their brows as their guardedness reached its maximum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Split it equally with me? Do you think you&#8217;re worthy?&#8221; Gu Changge retained his subtle grin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, what are you saying? Do you mean to seize the World Source for your own?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the True Daoists&#8217; faces grew cold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems you&#8217;re not fools,&#8221; Gu Changge casually answered as he gazed at the True Daoists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than the Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty who was relatively stronger, the remaining True Daoists were only at the early stages. Either way, they were all hardly a challenge to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;s hostile. We must not submit to death so easily!&#8221; The face of the Imperial Ancestor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty dramatically changed as soon as he sensed something was up. As he angrily shouted, he strenuously endured the lightning sea and engaged Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a purple-gold crown on his head, he appeared intimidating. He conjured a Purple Gold Divine Sword and slashed an overpowering sword light. His Divine Principles shattered the lightning sea like a chain, emitting a blaring noise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Without any hesitation, the other True Daoists accordingly displayed terrifying abilities. Traces of light rained down, vibrant and glaring, as if the world was turned around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of them dared to lower their guards as their opponent was Gu Changge himself, who took the lives of countless True Daoists in the war against the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even to this day, Gu Changge&#8217;s strength remained mysterious and was fathomless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re actually quite bold to attack me.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s face remained serene. Dense five-coloured Chaotic lights swirled around his body as alarming shockwaves intertwined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising his hand, he conjured the Immortal-Killing Gourd in which a crimson glow flashed across, as if an Immortal Sword was being unsheathed. At the speed of light, it pierced through everything as it speedily charged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following loud thumps, blood splattered in the sky as a fine head suddenly dropped. Its eyes were widely open, containing fear, dejection and extreme incredulity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn! It&#8217;s the gourd that can take down True Daoists effortlessly!&#8221; One of the True Daoists was stupefied as he recognised the weapon that emitted radiant lights during the war against Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains and murdered numerous True Daoists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right away, the others quickly retreated, not daring to brave the weapon&#8217;s attack as they understood the gourd&#8217;s terror. The Sword Qi it released could break through all defences and instantly destroy any soul.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Gu Changge conjured the Immortal-Killing Gourd, an ebony gleam emerged in his palm. As he swung the Eight Barren Demon Halberd, all the World Principles before him exploded and disintegrated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The True Daoists were stunned once again. Although they didn&#8217;t recognise the weapon, they could detect the destructive power it emitted and its world-annihilating aura. Not daring to bear any more irrelevant thoughts, they could only give everything they could to defend themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When True Daoists were in a battle, even a tiny shockwave from it was an unimaginably terrorising disaster to all surrounding living beings. Fortunately, they were fighting in a small world that had its own unique Principles with no other living beings around. Otherwise, there would be a horrifying calamity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and the other Earth Sword Immortals who were observing the battle, felt even more terrified. Such a feeling came from the depths of their souls. Even though they were very far away, they could feel their muscles falling apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had never expected that Gu Changge was actually intent on killing everybody including the group of True Daoists right in this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by the situation, Gu Changge was ever so calm, as though he didn&#8217;t resort to his full power, while his opponents were arduously resisting him and some of them even perished.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How frightening. How truly frighteningly strong…&#8221; Deeply scared, an Earth Sword Immortal muttered with his trembling voice. The True Daoists who slaughtered their peers as if they were puny ants couldn&#8217;t even withstand a palm from Gu Changge, and that was unbelievable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Once again, endless lights erupted. A swing of the Eight Barren Demon Halberd tore up everything and its force was unstoppable. The giant palms that zoomed across the sky were broken down by the halberd&#8217;s energy as the horrendous sound thundered across the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the True Daoists roared angrily as their bodies burned. The Principles they use seemed as though they were about to rip the sky apart. Such power was absolute and unparalleled, such that even Dharma Bodies were nothing compared to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The True Daoists gave everything they could, exhibiting their most powerful abilities that the world had never seen. Otherwise, they would definitely be murdered by Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood rained every as many bodies exploded and heads crumbled. Bone dust of pure white stained by blood scattered everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right when the horrifying war broke out, inside the silver lake beside the Tower of Blessings, an enormous spiral appeared, absorbing dense mists as if it was linked to another world. As if the entire lake was vaporising, the ground began to shake. The water of the lake circled in reverse as they were absorbed into the depths of the spiral.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that brief moment, one could see the water level of the region speedily dropping as parts of an abandoned city that had slumbered underneath the lake was revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing in the depths of the abandoned city&#8217;s town square, Lin En visibly grew excited as the key in his hands brightly glowed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each corner of the square stood bronze columns that were made of unknown materials. Their surface emitted vague gleams and around them. Pale skeletons from an unknown time were chained up in a worshipping posture towards the altar in the centre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Heavenly Dao Sword is right here…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filled with unconcealable exhilaration, Lin En&#8217;s gaze fell upon the blood-stained bronze Divine Sword in the middle of an altar. As he slowly walked over, he could feel the key in his hand resonating with the bronze Divine Sword.</span></p>

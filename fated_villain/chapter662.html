        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of killing the Sky Emperor Mountain True Daoist, Gu Changge erased his soul and turned him into a puppet.</span><span id="more-34827"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire process only had a single hitch. Naturally, the True Daoist tried the futile attempt of running away, but he was faced with Gu Changge. Naturally, he was taken down very quickly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the puppet wasn&#8217;t as powerful as Gu Changge would like it to be, it was still built on someone in the Nirvana Realm. To the cultivators who had yet to advance into this level, defeating them would still be a massive challenge. After all, a True Daoist could obliterate them with just one simple attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this was done, Gu Changge left and searched for the other True Daoists who had been tracking him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very quickly, he found a True Daoist from Thousand Sacred Mountain in another deserted area. Naturally, this other man was quickly turned into a puppet as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, someone had a bad feeling, and he immediately ran away grimly after sensing his heart tighten for no reason. Try as he might, given the Gu Changge’s cultivation level, the young man was basically invincible, and his divine sense was even more terrifying. He could sense the True Daoist in two breaths and chase after the latter after breaking through tens of millions of kilometres of space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond terrified, the pursued True Daoist begged and pleaded to be spared. However, Gu Changge remained unfazed as he wiped the former&#8217;s soul out as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just half a day, he already had five True Daoist puppets at his disposal. In fact, Gu Changge was already steps away from reaching the Advanced Nirvana Realm. Hence, common True Daoist Sources weren&#8217;t very effective in helping his advancement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from certain unique Sources like the World Source, Chaos Source, and Primal Source, to name a few, only the Sources from Remnant Immortals and beyond would be effective on him. Thus, the best use for these cultivators was to turn them into puppets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s a major issue that the souls of these True Daoists have been wiped out. No doubt the Upper Realm will burst into another uproar once word gets out… This issue will certainly give me a lot of trouble. But, there are ways to resolve all of this,] Gu Changge mused as a strange feeling flashed across his eyes before he left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was thinking he could use this chaos to make the current Upper Realm even more chaotic. The Eternal Overcast, Successor of Demonic Arts, and the Immortal Path, which would emerge soon…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It just so happened that my Inner Universe is almost full. Perhaps it&#8217;s time this Dark Heaven ends,&#8221; said Gu Changge plainly as he teleported away, then appeared elsewhere tens of millions of kilometres away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His divine sense swept across the sky and many ancient stars of life before finding and tracking the True Daoist from the Lake of Origin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, Gu Changge threw an arm out and conjured three readied True Daoist puppets that flew towards that Star Territory and hunted the True Daoist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one of the ancient stars in the Star Territory, which was massive and thriving with life, with at least trillions of living beings inside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surrounding ancient forest was lush and tall, with many Forces having a sense of desolation, standing tall for aeons. Still, under Gu Changge&#8217;s divine sense, the strongest cultivators in this ancient star had only reached the Sacred Emperor Realm. There weren&#8217;t even any beings that had advanced to the Quasi-Nirvana Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there were countless ancient stars similar to this one. Hence it wasn&#8217;t strange at all that the strongest cultivator had only reached the Sacred Emperor Realm. Not all Forces could produce a True Daoist, after all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, a slender-looking woman in green with a terrifying phenomenon exuding out of her eyes was frowning outside of this ancient star. Her divine sense swept all across the land.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She appeared young, yet a sense of ancientness exuded from her. Her cultivation age certainly exceeded millions of years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The true body of the True Daoist from the Lake of Origin wasn&#8217;t actually human but a Sacred Spiritual Herb created from heaven and earth and nurtured for hundreds of thousands of years. The moment she took shape, she already possessed the power of a Sacred Emperor, and after another few million years of painstaking cultivation, she finally became a True Daoist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a Sacred Spirit Herb being born of heaven and earth, she grew up favoured by heaven and earth, containing much Fortuity. In fact, there were rumours that a cultivator would suffer misfortune and even be punished by heaven if they attacked a Sacred Spirit like her, not to mention that they were all extremely powerful and had terrifying talent. Common cultivators were no match for them at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, many would steer clear if they saw a Sacred Spirit being born. They wanted nothing to do with the latter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I, the Devil Ivy Supreme Being, have lived for millions of years, and yet I would lose a few men in black?! How humiliating it&#8217;d be if word got out.&#8221; The woman in green&#8217;s eyes was icy. They contained unabashedly vast and majestic divine senses as she swept her gaze across the many stars below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn&#8217;t believe, as a True Daoist, she had actually lost the group of men-in-black she was chasing, and it infuriated her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there were beings residing in the ancient star beneath her, she had always been domineering and audacious. Hence, she didn&#8217;t care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, she cast a terrifying coercion upon the star, attempting to find any sign of the men in black.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terrifying turbulence instantly engulfed the entire ancient star with a thundering boom. The earth tumbled, and the sky shook as the atmosphere crumbled in massive chunks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly all living on the star were shaken. They trembled in fear as their blood drained from their faces. They couldn&#8217;t fathom why a terrifying True Daoist would descend upon their land.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disturbance startled the strongest cultivators of each Force, and they charged towards the sky in fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many hermit Sacred King Realm experts, too, were alarmed, and they stirred from their retreat to rush into the air with great apprehension.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Senior. May we know what has brought you here to our lands?&#8221; They carefully asked the Devil Ivy Supreme Being with held breaths for fear of angering the True Daoist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Have any of you seen a group of men-in-black around? I&#8217;m looking for them,&#8221; the Devil Ivy Supreme Being asked impassively. She might be a woman, but the intimidation she exuded was fear-inducing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the cultivators of this ancient star were taken aback before heaving a sigh of relief, for they quickly realised this True Daoist was hunting someone down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we have not seen any men in black, Senior,&#8221; they solemnly told the truth at once, not daring to lie or hide anything from her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They haven&#8217;t come here?! Where can they be, then?&#8221; The Devil Ivy Supreme Being locked her brows into a tight furrow. She didn&#8217;t think these cultivators would lie to her. Besides, she could tell at once, given her cultivation level. Thus, she was baffled by the men-in-black&#8217;s disappearance. [To think they&#8217;ve slipped past everyone&#8217;s divine senses.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, an Elder asked with a quivering voice, seemingly terrified, while looking into the stars. &#8220;Senior, is that the group of men-in-black you&#8217;re looking for?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Devil Ivy Supreme Being&#8217;s countenance also turned awful as incredulity overcame her. She sensed earth-crumbling, sky-shattering intimidation coming at her as a horrifying bank-bursting-like howl rushed in that direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, three blurry figures within a black mist stood outside of the Star Territory and looked impassively towards them like massacring demons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s them!&#8221; The Devil Ivy Supreme Being&#8217;s pupils contracted. Judging from their auras, they were definitely the men in black that attempted to assassinate them in the Capital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She genuinely couldn&#8217;t believe how bold these figures were. Not only had they given up running away, but they had even come to kill her. Furthermore, their abilities also surprised her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Three True Daoists… If they fight, their aura alone will wipe out all of existence within the radius…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene struck fear within all from this ancient star, believing a massive battle would break out later. To them, this would be a fatal catastrophe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The turbulence created by a beetle between True Daoists would certainly be catastrophic, as they could destroy an entire Star Territory and break a galaxy as they launched an attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, not just their ancient star, even the surrounding ones would get destroyed one after another. They wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance against the shockwaves created by a True Daoist battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Comply with Master&#8217;s order and kill her.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, the three men in black charged towards the Devil Ivy Supreme Being emotionlessly as the black mist surged around them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it! To think they&#8217;re really True Daoists…&#8221; The Devil Ivy Supreme Being&#8217;s countenance slightly shifted as she thought things had become tricky. She couldn&#8217;t believe all three of them were True Daoists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in the Capital of the Great Yu Dynasty, she had only thought these men in black behaved incredibly oddly and were indiscernible. But now, she had a feeling they would be able to catch her if she attempted to run away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only option she had now was to fight them and alert the other True Daoists chasing these men in black to come and help her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly after the thought crossed her mind, a green aura exuded from her body as endless shine sweeps wreathed around her and finally converged into a terrifying ocean-like storm before striking the three figures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly an unimaginable battle broke out, and a massive star crumbled and exploded into dust, destroyed by the turbulence from the battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Devil Ivy Supreme Being flitted from one place to another like she was traversing time and space. Her entire body shone brightly with powerful energy as she fought the three True Daoists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, she wasn&#8217;t at a disadvantage. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She transformed into a green lightning bolt that cut across space and launched an all-out battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dao clashed, and Principles evolved as thunder rumbled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black mist was massive and endless rays shot out from the few of them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interweaving Dao dimmed the stars and moons, and the great turbulence surged terrifyingly like a king sun.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the situation didn&#8217;t last long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Devil Ivy Supreme Being fell into a disadvantage very quickly and kept coughing up blood. A plethora of cracks appeared on her body, and she looked like she would explode any moment. She was no match for their combined attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Impossible…&#8221; Fear and regret enveloped her face, as she realised the three men in black could each hold their own in a one-on-one fight against her. As such, any True Daoist would die under a besiege.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Who are these people!? Where the hell do they come from?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Spears made of light cut across as though splitting the universe apart. A massive, black hand stretched across space and slammed onto her, causing her to cough up blood continuously. Even her Dao Artifact had cracked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a terrifying sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* The surrounding stars exploded, and a few ancient stars harbouring life, too, turned into dust because of the shockwave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trillions residing within them were obliterated before they could even cry in terror, and it horrified many cultivators of the surrounding ancient stars, thinking the end of the world was coming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sliver of the shockwave from a True Daoist battle was enough to disintegrate stars and scorch the galaxy, not to mention the common cultivators. Even their souls would instantly turn to dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, countless were praying that someone could stop this battle and save them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Imbecile. How dare you hunt down people from Dark Heaven?&#8221; monotone a black figure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dark Heaven…. What is that… Am I going to die here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was already impossible for the Devil Ivy Supreme Being to maintain her original shape as her body had already exploded from the trio&#8217;s combined attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, she had already fallen into despair. She could even sense her soul dimming, extinguishing any second. Moreover, she saw no hope as no one came to her rescue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She rued the moment. Had she known this would be her fate, she wouldn&#8217;t have chased after the men in black.</span></p>

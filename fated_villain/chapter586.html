        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Gu Changge’s point of view, the Ji Siblings’ problem was actually very simple. It could be resolved with just a single sentence from him, stating that the Ji Family was under his wing. </span><span id="more-32769"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be enough to make their enemies tremble in fear and dare not attack the Ji Family. Thus, when he allowed Ji Chuyue to stay, it was tantamount to agreeing to their request of sending a signal to the outside world. Afterall, there were many Forces eyeing the Ji Family. Now that Ji Chuyue and Ji Yaoxing had suddenly left the Ji Family and came to the Gu Family, many hid and watched their every move. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Ji Chuyue stayed here, while Ji Yaoxing returned alone. What would this mean? As the princess of the Ji Family who was out and about, Ji Chuyue was a representative of the Ji Family. She had reached marriageable age without being engaged and had moved in with the Gu family. Even a fool would know what this meant. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Yaoxing and Ji Chuyue weren’t fools and instantly understood Gu Changge’s intentions. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Young Master Gu” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Ji Family will forever remember your kindness.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expressions of the Ji Siblings were filled with utmost appreciation as their voices quavered, clueless as to how to fully express their gratitude.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before they came, they were already mentally prepared for Gu Changge’s rejection. Who would’ve thought that he would agree? This act of kindness alone was enough for all the members of the Ji Family to remember forever. Not to mention, Gu Changge was the one who helped the siblings escape Kun Mountain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We owe Young Master Gu too much.] Ji Yaoxing thought to himself as he glanced at his sister who was blushing. Ji Chuyue understood what her brother meant and nodded shyly. Her cheeks felt hot and her heart beat faster. She didn’t even dare to raise her head to look at Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Senior Ji Shengchu once showed great kindness to all living beings. Now that the Ji Family is in trouble, how can I stand by and just watch?” Gu Changge didn’t turn back, but sighed, as if he felt sorry for what happened to the Ji Family. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Yaoxing continued, “No matter what, the Ji Family will forever remember the fact that Young Master Gu is willing to lend a helping hand to the Gu Family at such a point in time.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before, he had always been arrogant and thought that there was no one stronger than him in this generation. Although he carried a humble appearance, he had always thought that if the Ji Family regained its past power and influence, he would definitely become one of the most powerful young prodigies in the world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, he was afraid of Gu Changge due to his power and status, but now, he was filled with pure admiration towards him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smiled and waved his sleeve, “Don’t be like this, brother Yaoxing. This is just a piece of cake.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge told them not to take things so seriously, both were extremely grateful towards him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he had obtained Gu Changge’s reassurance, the knot in Ji Yaoxing’s heart finally came undone. He let out a long sigh of relief as he left. Finally, his face, which had been filled with sorrow the whole day, had a smile filled with confidence. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brother…” Seeing her brother leave, Ji Chuyue suddenly felt uneasy. She was at a loss and didn’t even know where to put her hands. Afterall, Gu Changge and her were the only ones left in this palace. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge’s Divine Island was where he usually cultivated. From young, Ji Chuyue was spoiled. Although she didn’t have the temper of a spoiled young lady, she had never served anyone. Now that she stood behind Gu Changge, it felt as though a beam of lights shone on her back. She was restless and was at a loss as to what to do. Since he had asked her to stay… </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, her head was filled with what Gu Changge said just now. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following her muddled thoughts, her little pair of hands twisted together. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first time she saw Gu Changge was at Purple Mountains, when she was searching for the Tower of World Denomination. Back then, Gu Changge and his fiancee, the Fourth Princess of the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty, Yue Mingkong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purple Mountains was also where she first met Jiang Chen. When she found out that he couldn’t join the Heavenly Ruin Gate due to his age and poor cultivation level. Thus, she gave him a chance. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also then when Jiang Chen confessed to her how he was a Successor of a Divine Source Master and could help her find the Tower of World Denomination. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ji Chuyue’s priority back then was to restore the Ji Family’s former glory, she naturally chose to believe Jiang Chen. At that time, she thought that as the Successor of the Gu Family, Gu Changge was too powerful to be from the same world as her. Even though she was respectful towards him, she was still indifferent towards him. Even after she found out that he was looking for the Tower of World Domination, she went behind his back and went to Purple Mountains with Jiang Chen. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that was the incident that made her realise what true power meant. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After their trail and scheme was found out by Chen Ning’er, the Ji Family was coerced into giving Gu Changge the Wheel of World Domination, which they had painstakingly gotten. They sent it as an offering to appease his anger, afraid of offending him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, there wasn’t much of an exchange between Ji Chuyue and Gu Changge. Never in her wildest dreams would she have thought that Gu Changge would become the saviour of the Ji Family or that she would be so shy and nervous as she stood behind him today. All of this could just be written off as a joke of fate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was clear that after what happened at Kun Mountain, she had already developed an indescribable admiration towards this man. He was a perfect young man without any flaws. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue believed that in this world, as long as women have had contact with him, it would be impossible for them not to develop such thoughts. Despite him teasing her in front of Jiang Chen at Dark Kun City, she was never truly angry. All she felt was a little uncomfortable and embarrassed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry. After today, all Forces won’t dare to do anything to the Ji Family.” Gu Changge laughed, as if he had felt Ji Chuyue’s nervousness. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she listened to his soft voice that felt unnaturally warm, Ji Chuyue unconsciously became more unrelaxed. “Okay,” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue nodded like a chicken pecking at rice. She replied in a mosquito-like voice, “Chuyue doesn’t know how to repay Young Master Gu’s kindness…” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge laughed and turned around to interrupt her, “So you plan to repay me with your body?” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue never expected Gu Changge to be so direct. Her cheeks grew redder and she looked down, shyer than before. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was suddenly reminded of something an old grandma said back then. About what to do when she meets a man who has shown great kindness towards her based on his appearance. If the man looks average, then she should be his slave in her next life. If he looks handsome, then she should repay him with her body. Back then, she innocently thought that the old grandma was just joking, but today, she didn’t know why such thoughts would come to her mind as she looked at Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young Master Gu, I don’t think you lack a woman like Chuyue by your side, but if you don’t mind…” She lifted her head and carefully observed Gu Changge’s expression, as if she was afraid of saying something wrong that would cause him to be unhappy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Gu Changge laughed without a care. [If Jiang Chen was alive to see this scene, I wonder how he would feel?] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, Ji Chuyue’s Fortuity wasn’t low at all. In fact, she might’ve been one of Jiang Chen’s heroines. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, now that Jiang Chen was dead, there was no need for Gu Changge to care about what would happen to her in the future. If this was in the past, Gu Changge would’ve thought about accumulating some Fortuity or Fatum, but now he temporarily doesn’t need all of this. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come here and chat.” Gu Changge smiled gently as he urged Ji Chuyue to come closer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes…Young Master Gu.” Ji Chuyue stammered slightly as she walked towards him with her head buried, revealing her white and slender neck, like a frightened little deer in a forest. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you still remember what I said to you at Dark Kun City?” Gu Changge smiled as he reached out to caress her hair. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I still… still remember.” Ji Chuyue nodded her head. Of course she wouldn’t forget the scene that day. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, do you know why your brother insisted on you coming?” As if interested, Gu Changge asked. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Ji Chuyue didn’t dare to lie. She could only reply honestly in a quivering voice, “Because…brother wanted me to curry favour with Young Master Gu, so that you will save our Ji Family.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh? Looks like you’re quite honest.” Gu Changge laughed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue thought that he wanted to blame her brother, thus she quickly looked up at him and explained, “ Young Master Gu, we’re really grateful that you didn’t give us a hard time and even agreed to help us…: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I don’t think you came here willingly. Don’t worry, I won’t force you to stay here, you may return to the Ji Family after some time.” As he listened to her, Gu Changge replied with the same gentle smile. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ji Chuyue didn’t think that Gu Changge would say that. She was stunned and her heart became sour and complicated for a while. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her eyes, this was another way for Gu Changge to reject her. After all, how could she be forced or unwilling to do something like this? Even though their family was in peril, her brother would never mistreat her and force her to be with someone who would do harm to her. Even if it was for the sake of the Family, there was a line that even they would not cross.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chuyue knows that she’s clumsy, dumb and doesn’t know how to please Young Master Gu, but she can learn all of these. The things that Qingxuan and the rest can do, Chuyue can also do too. I’m definitely not inferior to them.” As if she had deliberated for a long time, Ji Chuyue suddenly mustered up the courage and looked up at Gu Changge, wanting him to give her a chance. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all Gu Changge did was laugh at her. [If you want to learn, you can take the time to learn, but I dont’ have the time to entertain you.]  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Ji Yaoxing returned to the Ji Family, the matters of the Ji Family were naturally resolved. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, in the Upper Realm, no Force dared to provoke Gu Changge. Since he wants to protect the Ji Family, no one dared to even think about touching the Ji Family. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following days, Ji Chuyue seemed to have also adapted to her new lifestyle. She had put aside her status as the Ji Family’s princess and had started to ask the maids who usually served Gu Changge about his various habits and preferences. She believed that if given time, even water droplets would create a hole in the hardest rock. She believed that one day, she would definitely move Gu Changge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not long after, Gu Changge left the Gu Family with Ah Da and headed for the territory where the Mortal Palace was located. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn’t in a hurry since he hadn’t received any news about the owner of the Sword of World Domination from Yue Mingkong. Coincidentally, at that time, the Eternal Overcast crisis was getting even more dire. Thus, Gu Changge used his identity as the Mortal One as justification for his trip there. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Jiang Chuchu had found a few areas where the Eternal Overcast had spread, causing chaos. It was just that, with her current abilities, she couldn’t do anything about it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if Gu Changge wanted to obtain Eternal Overcast Sources, he would have to go to her. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, in the heart of the Sky Domain within the Upper Realm, inside one of the most prosperous ancient territories, a palace stood tall in the skies. It was majestic and sacred, like a palace built from the legends. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built with magnificent and intricate craftsmanship, its walls were covered in flawlessly glazed white jade tiles. Its eaves were made out of millions-year-old purple gold sandalwood and its floors were pure obsidian star marble. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was grand yet simple, majestic yet solemn. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within it, there was a thick sea of celestial energy, just like in the Celestial Realm. The palace overlooked the ancient city and endless rivers. As runes intertwined above, the main hall rose and fell with the sun and the moon. Every moment, it reflected the light of the stars, the heavens and earth. It was like the home of a supreme god. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge celestial plaque was hung in front of the main hall. With purple as its base and Divine Gold as characters, two ancient words were written, ‘Mortal Palace’. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tens of thousands of silver threads from between the heavens and earth, frantically rushed and converged into this place, making it appear sacred and white. These silver threads were the worship and congratulations of all the living beings between heaven and earth. It was for the Mortal One’s great achievements. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, a stunning woman, who wore immaculate white robes and a veil, took a seat in the main hall. Her skin was fair and delicate, her eyebrows were pieces of art. Her eyes were pristine black gems that shone with a lustre. Still, her expression was calm. Besides calmness, there were no other emotions. It was as though she was born without emotions and desires. This was one of the two Saintess of the Mortal Palace, Jiang Chuchu. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of her, there was a Golden Fortuity Crown, where all the silver threads rushed into. She was using this Golden Fortuity Cauldron to cultivate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a rumbling ocean, strange sounds of karma resonated throughout the palace. This was the artifact that Gu Changge had left in the Mortal Palace. Turns out, Jiang Chuchu had found it and used it to cultivate, allowing her to make tremendous progress. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she cultivated, many strange sights materialised in the air. One by one, blurry shadows of Immortals, which were grand yet mysterious, floated behind her. It was as if they had travelled across time and space. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, an old woman in white robes rushed in hurriedly, with a worried expression, “Saintess, there is news of an Eternal Overcast outbreak in the southwest direction of the Sky Domain! The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty has already sent their men to investigate! Should we also send someone to take a look?” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she listened, Jiang Chuchu furrowed her brows. She stopped cultivating and asked, “How many crises have occurred due to the Eternal Overcast in just this month alone?” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she sped up on her cultivation efforts every day and night, she was still powerless in the face of the sudden news of these crises. </span></p>

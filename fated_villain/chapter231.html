      <h4>
        Chapter 231-1: If it was Changge what would he do, Call out to the
        Master to listen (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        "It seems that this Jiang Yang is not that stupid, surprisingly, he did
        not fall for it, I made so many arrangements, is it really going to be a
        waste of time?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside a magnificent and ancient building, in the middle of the
        courtyard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong was standing with her arms folded, in a simple plain robe
        with wide sleeves, wearing a veil, many emotions were flashing through
        her cool eyes, and her delicate eyebrows were gently frowning.
      </p>
      <p>
        It had been a total of three days since she sent the letter to Jiang
        Yang.
      </p>
      <p>But there was no response from Jiang Yang.</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong had sent people to keep an eye on the Immortal Lun Sect,
        but they also did not see Jiang Yang leave, and he had been cowering,
        refusing to appear.
      </p>
      <p>This was a bit out of her expectation.</p>
      <p>
        It was reasonable that Jiang Yang would want to see someone from the
        Upper Realm to find him, he would be happy to meet her, and step into
        her long-established trap place.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he didn't. Jiang Yang's caution was worthy of his identity as the
        reincarnation of the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Yue Mingkong sigh slightly in her heart, things were getting a
        little tricky.
      </p>
      <p>She also began to think seriously.</p>
      <p>If it was Gu Changge, what would he do at this time?</p>
      <p>
        With that guy's character, even if it was the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor, he would definitely attack, without caring about anything
        else.
      </p>
      <p>But Yue Mingkong also did not want to let him get involved.</p>
      <p>
        She had to be the one to bear the revenge, to let Gu Changge develop
        peacefully for a period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Changge‚Äôs usual means are meticulously seamless. If it‚Äôs him, there
        probably would not be a problem like this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Compared to him, I am really
        still far behind."
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong couldn't help but shake her head.</p>
      <p>
        "Now, I've already alerted the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor in
        advance, that mysterious Immortal, whether it's an enemy or friend is
        also unclear, things are getting more and more out of hand."
      </p>
      <p>
        She said softly to herself, "Could it be that at this time, I can only
        lead people to attack the Immortal Lun Sect and overthrow it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        But after thinking thoroughly, Yue Mingkong dismissed this possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the Ancestor of the Immortal Lun Sect back then was the Immortal
        Lun Supreme, the many means left behind by a Supreme must be far beyond
        her imagination.

      </div>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang was hiding in the land of Immortal Lun Sect and refused to
        come out.
      </p>
      <p>
        She quietly came down to the Lower Realm, and if she openly attacked the
        Immortal Lun Sect, it would definitely cause a big commotion. If the
        cultivators of the Human Ancestor Hall rushed to this realm, then it
        would definitely expose her existence and whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If I can find the secret method of the Human Ancestor Hall, perhaps I
        can make Jiang Yang believe me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>In the end, Yue Mingkong thought of the only way.</p>
      <p>
        But the inheritance of the Human Ancestor Hall had always been
        mysterious and was only passed on to its heirs.
      </p>
      <p>And how could she possibly know its secret method.</p>
      <p>
        "Forget it, I‚Äôll just try it again, if Jiang Yang still doesn't arrive,
        then I will have to unleash a secret revolt, thus overthrowing the
        Immortal Lun Sect‚Ä¶‚Ä¶" ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Yue Mingkong's expression became steeply cold and
        profound, and did not fluctuate in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that she was secretly controlling several forbidden areas and Sacred
        Mountains in the Heavenly Domain, unleashing a secret revolt and
        ravaging the world was just a matter of her words.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point in time, using the secret revolt as a distraction would be
        a good way to conceal her intention to overthrow the Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ a secret revolt would definitely affect all of the forces
        and creatures in the Heavenly Domain, no one would be spared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a price might be great, involving all creatures in the Heavenly
        Domain would cause an unparalleled and terrifying scourge that would
        lead to the destruction of all living beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        But since she chose to stand by Gu Changge's side, she already didn't
        care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Yue Mingkong waved her hand, and the maid behind her
        respectfully handed over a paper and pen.
      </p>
      <p>
        She began to write as a cultivator of the Human Ancestor Hall, to Jiang
        Yang to agree on a meeting place.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Gu Changge also quickly found her location, based on
        the runes left on Yue Mingkong's hand at the birthday banquet.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his skills, he could bypass many eyes to get close to the residence
        where Yue Mingkong currently was.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Gu Changge a little satisfied, it seemed that Yue Mingkong was
        still very cautious, not negligent in the slightest after arriving at
        the Lower Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, Gu Changge casually found a pavilion nearby and his figure
        emerged there.
      </p>
      <p>His distance to Yue Mingkong's residence was less than 300 miles.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, he would definitely not go to look for Yue Mingkong, thus
        revealing his whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was still waiting to reap the benefits, and if Yue Mingkong
        learned that he had also come to the Lower Realm, he would inevitably
        have to explain to her again, arousing her suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>Now it was hard to get Yue Mingkong to drop her guard against him.</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>Gu Changge did not intend to ruin it just like that.</p>
      <p>
        "Yue Mingkong still intends to give a final notice to Jiang Yang? The
        first time Jiang Yang did not believe it, what use would it be the
        second time? This way, Jiang Yang would not believe her without the
        slightest evidence."
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, Gu Changge noticed that some cultivators left this place
        and headed for the direction of Immortal Lun Sect.
      </p>
      <p>This scene fell in his eyes and made him smile.</p>
      <p>
        This Yue Mingkong was still as stupid as ever, trying to use such a
        crude method.
      </p>
      <p>But soon, Gu Changge remembered its purpose.</p>
      <p>He did not come here to laugh at Yue Mingkong, but to help her.</p>
      <p>
        Wasn't it the lack of definite evidence that she came from the Human
        Ancestor Hall?
      </p>
      <p>This was simple.</p>
      <p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, Gu Changge's figure appeared in the Inner World.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, why are you here again?"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu, who was still sitting cross-legged on the bluestone,
        suddenly opened her eyes. She was dressed in dusty and aloof white
        clothes, three thousand blue silks were hanging down, and her skin was
        white and delicate, like a flawless jade.
      </p>
      <p>
        On her beautiful face, her brows were tightly wrinkled, her eyes were
        cold, and she stared at the man in front of her, as if she wanted to see
        through him.
      </p>
      <p>"I came to my own world. Do I still need to tell you the reason?"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge sneered indifferently.</p>
      <p>
        Then he walked up to her on his own, and stopped just a step away from
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was looking down with a bit of satisfaction as if appreciating that
        she belonged to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        This look made Jiang Chuchu uncomfortable, feeling that she was not a
        person at this moment, but a personal item of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>This made her frown even tighter and made her expression colder.</p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for the fact that she couldn't beat Gu Changge, she might
        have already made a move now and would have attacked him.
      </p>
      <p>The more she was trapped here, the more she felt uneasy.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had already asked a lot of things about the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor from her mouth, although those things did not involve
        the whereabouts of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>But it still made her uneasy.</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 231-2: If it was Changge what would he do, Call out to the
        Master to listen (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Because according to Gu Changge's expression, he didn't care at all, as
        if he had already decided on the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor,
        and everything was under his control.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Jiang Chuchu knew a lot about Gu Changge, and the more
        she did, the more uneasy she became, and it even gave birth to a trace
        of fear that should not have been there.
      </p>
      <p>
        This big demon had the title of the most dazzling strongest person in
        the current younger generation. The forces behind him were beyond
        imagination, but he was the hidden inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she knew that it would be unbearable, her soul trembled,
        and her heart burst, and she was terrified.
      </p>
      <p>
        It already took a lot of courage for her to face Gu Changge so calmly.
      </p>
      <p>"Why?"</p>
      <p>
        "Aren't you mine now? The way you look at me‚Ä¶ it makes me
        uncomfortable."
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing Jiang Chuchu's silent expression, Gu Changge couldn't help but
        let out a faint smile, as if he could see through her thoughts, "If you
        look at me like this again, maybe you will regret it later."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu felt a chill on her back, gritted her teeth,
        and was forced by Gu Changge's power.
      </p>
      <p>She had to lower her head and not look at Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        "That's right, be obedient and sensible, and ask me a word or two,
        Master, will listen to you, maybe I'll consider letting you out when I'm
        in a good mood‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge looked at her, with a faint smile on his face.</p>
      <p>
        With a wave of his hand, a stone table and a stone chair suddenly
        appeared behind him and a tea set made of jade was placed on it.
      </p>
      <p>Then, he sat down in relief.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Changge's words, Jiang Chuchu trembled and felt a little
        humiliated.
      </p>
      <p>"Don't think about it!"</p>
      <p>Call him Master?</p>
      <p>
        She couldn't say such words even if she was beaten to death, especially
        for a big demon like Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>As for letting her out?</p>
      <p>
        She would not believe Gu Changge's words. At this time, unless Gu
        Changge was stupid, he would not release her.
      </p>
      <p>"Now, I'm a little thirsty."</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge seemed to not care about her expression at all,
        and smiled lightly to himself, "At this time, Holy Maiden Chuchu won't
        show her tea skills?"
      </p>
      <p>"I just wonder if this Gu will be lucky enough to have a drink?"</p>
      <p>Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu glared at him coldly and angrily.</p>
      <p>
        As a Holy Maiden of the Human Ancestor Hall, she had a detached status
        and was admired by all forces. Why would she ever make tea for others?
      </p>
      <p>But under Gu Changge's casual expression.</p>
      <p>She did not dare to refuse!</p>
      <p>
        After all, she definitely didn't want to experience other things that
        were more humiliating than making tea.
      </p>
      <p>Making tea was a trivial matter.</p>
      <p>Since Gu Changge wanted to drink it, how about giving him a drink?</p>
      <p>
        Immediately, Jiang Chuchu began to pour water for Gu Changge to make
        tea, and it could be seen that she was indeed doing this for the first
        time. She had never learned it before.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        After all, she was the reincarnation of an Ancient Immortal, and she was
        destined to be aloof.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, the tea was brewed.</p>
      <p>There was a cloud of mist along with an elegant tea fragrance.</p>
      <p>"This tea‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at the tea she carefully brewed, shook his head, and
        said a little disappointedly, "What a waste of my 800,000-year-old
        Wuling tea and Immortal leaves."
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing Jiang Chuchu's obviously unsightly cold expression, he didn't
        care at all, then raised his glass to his mouth and drank it all in one
        gulp.
      </p>
      <p>Tsk.</p>
      <p>"It looks like you really can't."</p>
      <p>
        "Although it's a little hard to drink, it's not that I can't drink it.
        It's okay."
      </p>
      <p>"But it doesn't matter, you can learn it slowly in the future!"</p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded and made a comment.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Jiang Chuchu was stunned for a moment, but she didn't
        expect that Gu Changge would actually drink it, she thought it was a
        method of Gu Changge which he deliberately used to humiliate her.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, why would he let her make tea?</p>
      <p>
        It was hard to believe that someone as deep as Gu Changge still had the
        time to be stupid and really thought that she knew how to make tea?
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's expression showed a trace of obvious disbelief, and even
        felt that the terrifying power in him was dissipated for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge didn't seem as scary as she thought.</p>
      <p>However, she quickly realized what Gu Changge said just now.</p>
      <p><i>You can learn later?</i></p>
      <p>Could it be that he was really ready to use herself as a maid?</p>
      <p>This made Jiang Chuchu's expression not very good-looking.</p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, what's your purpose? If you want to humiliate me, you've
        already done it."
      </p>
      <p>At that moment, Jiang Chuchu asked aloud.</p>
      <p>Her expression changed from anger to calmness.</p>
      <p>
        She also didn't know why in front of Gu Changge, she couldn't keep her
        mind as calm as before, which would not be disturbed by external things.
      </p>
      <p>"Humiliate you? No, I'm not that boring."</p>
      <p>
        "I don't understand why you always think of me as so scary? I just want
        to see how you're doing in the Inner World. I think you're alone here,
        and you don't even have anyone to talk to. It's inevitable that you'll
        be a little lonely."
      </p>
      <p>"I simply thought about having a word with you, lest you go crazy."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge looked at Jiang Chuchu, and said with some
        regret and helplessness, as if he was deeply misunderstood.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In front of me, you should stop pretending to be compassionate. A big
        demon like you is indifferent and heartless, but there is still a little
        humanity in your heart?"
      </p>
      <p>However, Jiang Chuchu was unmoved and looked at him calmly.</p>
      <p>
        Those pure water-like eyes seemed to reflect Gu Changge's true face.

        "Humanity? What the hell did I do? What made you think that I have no
        humanity?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that it is human nature to be slaughtered by the others and
        wait for others to take their life?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge sneered when he heard these words, looking very disdainful
        about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Jiang Chuchu was a little stunned for a while, and it was
        difficult to refute.
      </p>
      <p>She fell silent.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was right, would he really do nothing at this time and wait
        for the Human Ancestor to arrive and take his life?
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, she felt that Gu Changge was arguing. As the inheritor of
        demonic arts, he was destined to have such a day.
      </p>
      <p>This path was chosen by him.</p>
      <p>
        "But‚Ä¶ this is not the reason for you to harm the common people." At that
        moment, Jiang Chuchu spoke again and said coldly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Excuse me, Holy Maiden Chuchu, when did you see me killing the common
        people?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you say that, during your cultivation, when you encounter any
        opportunity, you pay attention to the word, and you don't fight or grab
        it, then how else do you cultivate?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge just laughed, "Others want to snatch everything from me, but
        my identity and my status is better than theirs, so they failed and
        died. And everything you saw, it's only after I survived‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"Everything I do is to survive."</p>
      <p>"It's hard to survive, is there anything wrong?"</p>
      <p>
        Speaking of this, his expression gradually became indifferent, revealing
        an aura that made Jiang Chuchu's heart palpitate.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Gu Changge's words, she felt a completely different belief than
        before.
      </p>
      <p>Was it wrong to live?</p>
      <p>That was right.</p>
      <p>
        For a time, she felt that the Dao heart that she had cultivated for so
        many years was shaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge noticed the change in Jiang Chuchu's expression, and a
        strange color flashed in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, he waved his hand, and said with some sullen interest,
        "Forget it, you probably don't understand what I said today."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was stunned when she heard these words, then she looked at
        him with a complicated expression, and asked, "Why did you suddenly tell
        me all of this?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge didn't seem too lazy to explain, "Because I'm
        in a good mood."
      </p>
      <p>Good mood?</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was stunned again. Why was Gu Changge in a good mood?
        Wasn't he busy with the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor during this
        time?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or did he already know the whereabouts or clues of the reincarnation of
        the Human Ancestor?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Jiang Chuchu's head buzzed and became a little blank.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrifying cold air jumped up from her back again, making her hands
        and feet feel cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, Gu Changge's words made her head dizzy, but now he suddenly
        became very clear.
      </p>
      <p>"Good mood?"</p>
      <p>And soon, she reacted.</p>
      <p>
        So Jiang Chuchu maintained her superficial expression, and there was
        nothing unusual compared to just now.
      </p>
      <p>"Since you're in a good mood, why don't you let me go?"</p>
      <p>She spoke lightly, but it was only a tentative question.</p>
      <p>
        She wanted to take the opportunity to know something from him, and
        wanted to know what Gu Changge's attitude towards her was now.
      </p>
      <p>From this, she could also guess what the situation outside was.</p>

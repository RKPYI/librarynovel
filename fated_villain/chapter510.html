          interested gaze. In his eyes, he could see the change in Fortuity
          within Luo Feng. Amid the latter&#8217;s Fortuity, there was also a
          substantial amount of Fortuity from the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. As such, there was only one possibility—Luo Feng&#8217;s true

          red robe, and subconsciously asked. She could see that the current Luo
          Feng was hugely different from the one she knew. It seems like the
          current Luo Feng was no longer the fool everyone assumed.</span

          suddenly say those words to Luo Feng. All she knew was that he was no
          longer the simple fool she knew him to be, and he surely had a
          solution.</span

          dumbfounded members of the Luo Clan turned to Luo Feng. They

          obviously different compared to how he was before. His gaze was deeper
          and he was no longer drooling. As he stood still, there was an
          exceptional aura surrounding him.</span

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span><span id="more-34804"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many ancient battleships glided past and hovered in the sky above Ancient Arcane Ruins. Each ship was like a horrifying continent surrounded by thick fog that shrouded everything. Numerous knights armed with weapons like divine swords, Heavenly Daggers, and others were riding fierce beasts as they shot over like a gust of eerie, cold wind. The way they oozed killing intent made them appear like an army of bloody armoured riders from the depths of hell who were here to harvest all lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Cultivators and living beings from the Thirteen States of the Profound Sword World had come around the Ancient Arcane Ruins. They were pale from fear as they gasped, &#8220;Are these Otherworldly Sky Demons planning to kill all of us?&#8221; This was the first time many of the young generations had witnessed the true face of the so-called Otherworldly Sky Demon as they had never travelled to the frontier border to fight against the demons before. They thought their souls were going to freeze under the kind of indifferent murderous intent. In fact, they were shivering so much that they couldn&#8217;t pick up the courage to fight back at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a gap as big as a Heavenly Barrier. Knowing this, they all fell silent from despair.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are powerful. I&#8217;m afraid that even the weakest among them is at least from the Eight Realm…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There may even be living beings from the Ninth Realm or higher…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abundance Sword Immortal and everyone else&#8217;s faces were solemn as they stared at those petrifying ancient battleships. Their gazes were on a few figures who stood tall like a few Devil Mountains, instilling fear in everyone. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though their energies were only of the Ninth Realm, and they had yet to step into the Earth Sword Immortal Realm, their aura and imperiousness felt like a shapeless Devil Mountain pressing on their chests, turning their limbs cold. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abundance Sword Immortal and the rest felt this way due to the suppression of the Principles of Nature here. They might not stand a chance to win, or even survive, if they had to face these scary living beings without the suppression of the Principles of Nature. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tall, vague figure with red horns on its head and wings on its back emerged on the ancient battleship. He was surrounded by a green godly glow, and his eyes were scarlet when he spoke in a cold voice dripping with condescension and disdain. &#8220;You ants, are you still blind to the situation even now? Your world would have been completely destroyed with a palm if our world&#8217;s supreme existence had made a move.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing more than a futile attempt to resist. This world will soon be stained with a red colour of despair,&#8221; someone mocked. The sound of footsteps resounded again in the thick black fog, and another ghostly figure appeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn&#8217;t bother beating around the bush when they uttered those words that resounded in the sky. Hearing that, everyone in Profound Sword World turned ashen from the aggrievance and anger. However, they could only clench their fists and endure it as much as they could. Although this was the peak of the humiliation, no one dared to stand up and protest. Even Abundance Sword Immortal and the others were silent the whole time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as expected of ones born to be slaves. No one is resisting even at this point! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haha</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!&#8221; The terrifying figure who spoke just now taunted again and laughed wantonly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Forget it. There is no need to talk to these ants. They are going to be annihilated after we found that thing. They are not worthy of our attention.&#8221; Another voice that sounded as flat and indifferent as it was proud rang out. It sounded as though the life and death of the living beings in this world had already been decided.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at this moment, a roar that resounded in every direction suddenly came from the ruins. &#8220;Darn it. You&#8217;re pushing it. I&#8217;m not going to let you off easy!&#8221; An elderly man wearing a green Daoist robe and carrying a Daoist sword behind him finally couldn&#8217;t bear it anymore. With anger and killing intent in his eyes, he took a step towards the sky. He was clearly a being from the Earth Sword Immortal Realm from the way he put on a show of great coercion and strength as soon as he appeared. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, many Cultivators of the Upper Realm couldn&#8217;t help feeling elated. The gloomy feeling in their hearts seemed to vanish into a puff of smoke. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They, too, had courageous and upright members of their own. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abundance Sword Immortal&#8217;s complexion changed slightly. He hadn&#8217;t expected this robed elder whom he knew would rush over to fight this group of Otherworldly Sky Demons. In the end, he could only softly sigh, &#8220;Brother Zhao…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t let your emotions get the better of you!&#8221; Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s face under the mask also fell. Even though she wanted to stop the elderly man, she was too late when he boomed, &#8220;Charge!&#8221; The green sword glow floating around his body then transformed into a peerless divine sword.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, there were anomalies which caused unimaginable fluctuations between the sky and the earth. They immediately rushed towards the mist-shrouded terrifying figure who didn&#8217;t hold back at ridiculing Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmph</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what a reckless fool!&#8221; Seeing this, the figure sneered and indifferently raised his palm before pressing it down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a cold voice huffed from the depths of a copper ancient battleship at this moment. &#8220;You foolish ants. You are still blind to the situation even now.&#8221; The voice sounded light and somewhat lacking in emotions, and yet it was like a peerless Sound of Heaven that boomed in everyone&#8217;s ears. Even Abundance Sword Immortal and the others&#8217; life forces tumbled, and they could barely find their footing. The rest of the people felt their souls tremble and their bodies threaten to burst as blood flowed from the seven apertures in their heads. They were left completely mortified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My lord!&#8221; The face of the terrifying figure who attacked just now also changed into an incomparably respectful one as he turned to salute in the direction of the ancient battleship&#8217;s depths. He was only at the Sacred King Realm, but the one who was speaking now was a real True Daoist whose cultivation was unparalleled and could suppress the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The many figures standing on the ancient battleship turned respectful. They were no longer as aloof and proud as before. Hailing from Godly Spirit Mountain, a formidable faction in the Upper Realm, these figures looked very different from the human race. The one who spoke was one of their ancient ancestors. And as his voice sounded, a big, withered hand suddenly emerged from the depths of the copper ancient battleship shrouded in Mist of Chaos, breaking everything open. The knuckles of the hand surrounded by grey mist were distinct like eagle claws. However, the surrounding void collapsed because of its energy, turning every inch into nothingness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Fwoomp!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All it took was a forward movement for the space containing endless World Principles here to collapse and explode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What—&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The void was stagnating as time froze. The enraged look on the robed elder&#8217;s face was instantly replaced by one of fear, and his eyes were filled with despair. In just an instant, his Dao sword shattered with a click. His body was then cut open. As he bled profusely, his soul broke into pieces, and he died on the spot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Earth Sword Immortal had fallen like a powerless fledgling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This horrifying scene happened right in front of the many Cultivators there. Seeing this, they couldn&#8217;t stop shuddering as they felt a sense of hopelessness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brother Zhao…&#8221; Abundance Sword Immortal&#8217;s eyes were filled with grief. He wanted to stand up to avenge the elder, but his feet felt as if they were filled with lead. He couldn&#8217;t move at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the Earth Sword Immortals had also turned pale from fear. As a matter of fact, their strengths weren&#8217;t that different from that of this person. It could even be said that they stood at the pinnacle of this world. They could rarely meet someone worthy of being an opponent. And yet, they were as puny as ants in the face of an Otherworldly Sky Demon whose face couldn&#8217;t be seen clearly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn&#8217;t even know how many existences like this were there in those ancient battleships.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He is too strong. Could this be the Realm of Absolute Detachment?] Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s charming face was also a little pale as she clenched her fists tight. She could feel a surge of pressure that sucked the breath out of her. In that instant, Ancient Arcane Ruins grew dead silent, and no one said a word as they trembled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Too weak. Is this the strongest Cultivator in this world? It seems that we can terminate everyone with one palm if there was no suppression of the World&#8217;s Will here,&#8221; the ancient figure who attacked from the Godly Spirit Mountain&#8217;s copper ancient battleship muttered to himself in a merciless voice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the hovering ancient battleships of other factions and forces in another direction, there were also fluctuations of divine sense which were incomparably vast and exuberant. The energy which revived in it was somewhat stronger than that of the person who attacked just now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone from Profound Sword World could not see even a hint of hope to live when they saw this. They had completely fallen into despair. Because of the suppression of the World&#8217;s Will before, these existences did not dare come here as they pleased. However, the Heavenly Secrets in the Ancient Arcane Ruins were extremely chaotic, and the Principles were vague and broken. The existences took advantage of the loopholes and came here while showing unmatched terrifying strength enough to obliterate everything here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the vast fluctuations in the sky subsided. The various factions in the Upper Realm did not immediately send knights to sweep everything away. Instead, they communicated with each other through their divine senses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had other plans in mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmph</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is only a matter of time before our world overturn the situation. It is a law of nature for evil to never prevail over good.&#8221; Seeing this scene, Parting North Sword Immortal, who had been silent all this time, snorted coldly with murderous intent emerging from the depths of his eyes. Still, he had to hold himself back now despite struggling to do so. He didn&#8217;t dare to act rashly for fear of being hit by his opponent&#8217;s deadly attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Earth Sword Immortals could tell that these Otherworldly Sky Demons who had descended here did not plan to fight them just yet. They seemed to also be looking for the location of Mirror Lake, and they were reluctant to destroy everything. They might even be afraid of something here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What were you saying, girl?&#8221; Too afraid to vent his anger at the Otherworldly Sky Demons, Parting North Sword Immortal gloomily looked over at Ah Qing again. He knew that she, just like his grandson, was one of the Four Heroes of Profound Sword World. However, her father had disappeared after going to the crack beyond the sky, and no one knew whether he was still alive. Parting North Sword Immortal would definitely be wary if her father was still around, but nothing was holding him back now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing didn&#8217;t think Parting North Sword Immortal would still be hung up on this. Under everyone&#8217;s startled gazes, she crinkled her sleek brows and nonchalantly answered him. &#8220;Xuan Dea has given her heart to Young Master Gu. Do you think that your grandson is comparable to Young Master Gu, Parting North Sword Immortal?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was immediately a red tint on Princess Xuan Dea&#8217;s alluring and surprised face when she heard that. She obviously didn&#8217;t expect Ah Qing to say something like this in front of everyone at an important time like this. It was true that she admired Gu Changge, but she kept it at that. She couldn&#8217;t possibly be in the mood to think about romance when Profound Sword World was in the midst of such a catastrophe. What&#8217;s more, she knew that a man of Gu Changge&#8217;s background and status would never be short on prodigal damsels. She never expected much because she thought that she hadn&#8217;t caught his eye.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What?! Young Master Gu?!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was an immediate uproar at this place. Although most Cultivators had never seen Gu Changge in person, they knew about him. They had heard about how he ripped apart the incarnation of the World&#8217;s Will outside Shu Sect with his bare hands and killed several Earth Sword Immortals outside Ancient Mulberry City with just a few thrusts of his palm. His strength had already reached an unimaginable level.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That Gu fellow, you mean?&#8221; Chen Li also had a look of astonishment and disbelief on his face while he was filled with indignation. He never thought that Ah Qing would say something to involve Gu Changge. Judging from his background, Gu Changge was from the Upper Realm, which meant that he was from the same group as the Otherworldly Sky Demons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow Sword Immortal, Abundance Sword Immortal, and the others were also extremely shocked before they fell silent again. Leaving his position and identity aside, he was indeed extremely attractive to women in terms of appearance and temperament.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parting North Sword Immortal&#8217;s expression froze when he heard this. Naturally, he knew who Gu Changge was. However, there was no way he would calmly take an insult in front of everyone. He couldn&#8217;t afford to be embarrassed like this. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Young Master Gu you speak of is an ally of the Otherworldly Sky Demons. How can you be sure of what intentions he has for coming to this world?&#8221; He lectured her as a teacher would. &#8220;You youngsters should not be fooled by appearances.&#8221; Even though his tone was calm, he was extremely blunt. It almost sounded as if he was saying that Gu Changge had ulterior motives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow Sword Immortal, Abundance Sword Immortal, and the others frowned realising what he meant. However, they couldn&#8217;t say much, considering his seniority.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing immediately frowned and explained, &#8220;Young Master Gu is a good man. He holds no ill intentions towards us—&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have more life experiences than you lot.&#8221; Parting North Sword Immortal interrupted with a snigger. &#8220;Surely you are not doubting my judgement? Don&#8217;t forget how many Earth Sword Immortals have met their doom outside of Ancient Mulberry City because of them. They were the pillars of strength in our world!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The looks on the faces of those around this place grew sombre at the thought of the Earth Sword Immortals who were killed. Just like the Parting North Sword Immortal said, Earth Sword Immortals were the pillars of strength of the Profound Sword World. It was a huge loss to their world whenever there was one less Earth Sword Immortal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Princess Xuan Dea couldn&#8217;t help glaring at the elderly man with her beautiful eyes and breaking her silence when she heard this. &#8220;Those people had it coming. They wouldn&#8217;t have been killed if they hadn&#8217;t gone and provoked Young Master Gu.&#8221; She might be afraid of the Parting North Sword Immortal&#8217;s power, but she couldn&#8217;t let him accuse Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are questioning me, then?&#8221; The Parting North Sword Immortal&#8217;s eyes turned cold as a piercing sword aura circulated within them. Everyone&#8217;s faces promptly fell when they saw the change in the man. Princess Xuan Dea&#8217;s small face, especially, turned ashen. After being hurt by the sword aura, she couldn&#8217;t help taking a few steps back as a stream of blood trickled from the corners of her mouth. She would have been heavily injured if it weren&#8217;t for the secret treasure protecting her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess&#8230;&#8221; The faces of the people from the Southern Light Empire fell drastically, and they quickly stood in front of Princess Xuan Dea while looking at the Parting North Sword Immortal with anxious and frightful eyes, worried he would kill her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal and the Abundance Sword Immortal also hurried ahead and tried to stop him. &#8220;Please go easy on her, Senior Beili—&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before they could finish their sentence, a calm voice suddenly came from the sky not far away. &#8220;So what if she is?&#8221; The voice wasn&#8217;t too loud, but it spread throughout the Ancient Arcane Ruins. Almost all the cultivators heard the words, and they felt their hearts twitch as their expressions changed drastically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, the sound of footsteps could be heard, and there were layers of ripples in the void. The next moment, there seemed to be a portal emerging there before a slender figure sauntered out of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a Sword Technique that only Core Disciples of the Shu Sect know of. If it is passed on to outsiders privately, the disciple will definitely be chased off and killed by the Shu Sect. They won&#8217;t be able to escape death no matter where they try to hide. I am sure he is a Core Disciple of the Shu Sect. I can feel the aura of a Sword Spirit on him&#8230;&#8221; Ah Qing commented as she stood by the window and watched the fight.</span><span id="more-33859"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raging battle went on till the end of the long street as the two figures fought with all their might, sending tremors in all directions with their parries alone. The light and shadow intertwined as various ancient runes evolved from the clash, making the place blurry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The onlookers were all palpitating, and they kept their distance. It was hard for them to believe that this was a battle between two prodigies of the younger generations. They might have believed it if the ones fighting were from the older generation instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Demon God Palace’s Young Master was a well-known peerless young prodigy. Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, on the other hand, had only appeared out of nowhere recently. He used to keep a low profile, but his strength shouldn&#8217;t be underestimated, considering how he didn&#8217;t falter even after he exchanged hundreds of moves with the Young Master of the Demon God Palace. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eyes of many young prodigies watching this wavered. They couldn&#8217;t help feeling that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao would make a troublesome enemy in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems like it was no accident Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was reborn in this world.] Gu Changge put down the cup in his hand as his eyes suddenly shone with interest. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In that case, the Secret Technique he used to create the Primordial Foetal Sword of World Domination should have come from the Shu Sect. The source of it is Ah Qing&#8217;s world. The reason he came here as soon as possible is to pass through that Space Rift and return to his original world.] Thinking of this, Gu Changge suddenly moved and disappeared, only to reappear where Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and the Young Master of the Demon God Palace were fighting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya, Yu Ming, and everyone else who was paying close attention to this battle immediately bowed. &#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge!&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They weren&#8217;t aware of when Gu Changge had appeared here. Even the looks on the faces of many from the older generations around them changed. None of them dared to be discourteous towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are at the most critical moment of conquering that huge new world. Why fight over trivial matters, my fellow brothers? Why don&#8217;t you cease the fight for my sake? Resolve the conflict some other time?&#8221; Gu Changge looked at the two who were fighting with a smile on his lips.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was taken aback momentarily upon hearing that. They didn&#8217;t expect Gu Changge to get involved and talk them out of it at this time. Naturally, no one would dare to continue fighting after he had said those words. Anyone who did would be disrespecting him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, too, didn&#8217;t expect Gu Changge to appear and dissuade them from fighting. Despite the look of uncertainty on his face, he followed along and didn&#8217;t continue to fight. Instead, he stepped aside and looked at the Young Master of the Demon God Palace indifferently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the Young Master of the Demon God Palace was called the Mad Demon God, he didn&#8217;t dare go against Gu Changge&#8217;s wishes either. He hesitantly retreated to the other side and respectfully pressed his hands together. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare continue, now that you have personally told us to stop, Young Master Changge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mad Demon God was what everyone called him, and his name reflected his temperament. As one with a rebellious nature, he didn&#8217;t respect even the Ancient Beings of the Demon God Palace. In fact, he was like a crazed demon who only wanted to pick fights with every young prodigy. However, he was obedient in front of Gu Changge as he didn&#8217;t want to offend him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mad Demon God&#8217;s gaze soon darted in Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s direction. &#8220;Let&#8217;s show some respect to Young Master Changge today. We will fight to our hearts&#8217; content next time.&#8221; He then cupped his hands at Gu Changge who stood beside him and turned into a divine rainbow that promptly left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao only snorted in annoyance. There wouldn&#8217;t have been such a huge commotion that attracted even Gu Changge if the Mad Demon God hadn&#8217;t started to suddenly fight him. His initial plan was to quietly follow the Great Yu Army through the Space Rift and then go to the Shu Sect to find a solution. Yet, he just had to bump into Gu Changge now… </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be hard for him to explain himself if Gu Changge ended up thinking that he wanted to take advantage of the chaos and escape with the Sword of World Domination, disregarding Tuo Ba Qing Yu&#8217;s safety. But now that he had met Gu Changge, he could try to sound out how his sister was doing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was sure that the person who sent someone to take his sister away was Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly knowing what Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was thinking, Gu Changge let out a small smile and reassured him, &#8220;It seems that you still have doubts about me. Don&#8217;t worry. I don&#8217;t have the slightest hint of malice towards you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao inwardly scoffed at his words, but he didn&#8217;t let his emotions show as he cupped his hands. &#8220;Thank you for getting putting an end to that embarrassing display, Young Master Changge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge smiled lightly and replied, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do much, Brother Tuo Ba. There is no need to thank me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao took a glance at Yu Feiya and the rest of them before he uttered, &#8220;I will make sure to repay you for your help, Young Master Changge. I&#8217;m afraid I will have to leave now, as I have something to attend to.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He quickly began to leave so as to not disrupt tomorrow&#8217;s plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t forget about it, Brother Tuo Ba,&#8221; Gu Changge replied casually.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course.&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao cupped his hands before he turned around and left. He knew that this was Gu Changge reminding him not to forget about the Sword of World Domination and the deadline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Yu Feiya, Yu Ming, and the others, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao seemed to still be brooding over what happened in the palace back then. Although he was imprisoned by Emperor Yu and had now been released, many of the things that happened had been spread to the public, causing quite a stir.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, many people sawt Tuo Ba Xiao Yao as a toad wanting to eat swan meat. He was someone Gu Changge had praised, yet he said things that messed up his whole future. It was only normal for him to feel embarrassed with Gu Changge around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya&#8217;s younger brother, Yu Ming, still had the same stubborn look on his face. When he saw Tuo Ba Xiao Yao leaving without greeting them, he let out an upset huff before he complained, &#8220;It seems like he has given up after what happened that day at the palace. Looks like he won’t pester you anymore, sister.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya softly sighed, &#8220;Xiao Yao seems to have something on his mind. He must have gotten into some kind of trouble. But why is he here? Is he going to the other world as well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She, too, didn&#8217;t go to Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and greet him. She understood one thing after Emperor Yu confined her last time—she shouldn&#8217;t get too close to Tuo Ba Xiao Yao if she didn&#8217;t want ger father to show his displeasure towards Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dressed in white, and with flowy black hair, she strode over in a dignified and graceful manner to ask Gu Changge, &#8220;Are you also going to the other world as well, Young Master Changge?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am,&#8221; he replied nonchalantly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya couldn&#8217;t help her curiosity when she heard that Gu Changge was going. She extended him an invitation. &#8220;No cultivator has ever set foot in that world before. There are too many unknowns and possible dangers. Considering that, how about we go together, Young Master Changge?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was because of Emperor Yu&#8217;s order that she would lead the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s younger generation there. [But Gu Changge is obviously alone this time, and there is no one from the Immortal Gu Family around him. Why is he going there?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am used to being untied to anything. I&#8217;m afraid I won&#8217;t be able to agree to your invitation, Princess Feiya,&#8221; Gu Changge rejected her with a faint smile on his face. The purpose of his visit to that world was different from that of Yu Feiya and her group. Having them with him would only bring him unnecessary troubles. Furthermore, he had Ah Qing with him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya looked taken aback when she heard that. [How many times has he rejected me now?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she was bright, it was still difficult for her to immediately understand why Gu Changge rejected her. It was obviously much safer to go together to a world full of unknowns. Gu Changge might be strong, but he might not be able to resolve all crises. [Does he keep rejecting me because he hates me?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s big battle on the long street was just an insignificant episode to the many surrounding Forces who watched it unfold. Naturally, it was because their attention was on the world that they were about to go to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past few days had been rather chaotic because of the clutter of information that had been revealed about the other world. Many Ancient Beings speculated that there may be a Great Dao of the Sword in that ancient big world, which was the reason for the robust Sword Dao there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the most central area of the border region, which was filled with stars, turbulent and vast energy like an abyss, accompanied by dazzling divine light erupted as if a thick and majestic world had rolled over and crushed the place. A large rift in space that was thousands of kilometres long appeared there, and the surroundings were filled with various chaotic energies and storms. Many broken stars floated in the air as they revolved around the huge rift in space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinary cultivators didn&#8217;t have the courage to even approach the fringe area for fear of being crushed to death and turned into ash by the sheer energy here. Both their bodies and souls could easily be destroyed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place seemed to be a cosmic tunnel opened up by a supreme Immortal King. After all, it was a mysterious and vast path that could take one to another world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, many ancient battleships with bright runes surged, resisting the scholastic space fluctuations of this place, as they forcibly crossed over and entered the huge rift. These ancient warships were filled with powerful figures wearing battle armour and holding onto mighty weapons. Their murderous aura seemed to soar to the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Space Rift wide open, the various Forces had dispatched armies to conquer this Great World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profound Sword World was a boundless landmass. However, one would have to look at it from a high altitude to see that it was actually an ancient living star. Apart from its vast land, it was surrounded by oceans and various islands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The land was divided into Thirteen States, and the territory of each state was limitless. Even a person with a high cultivation level would struggle to reach the ends of one state. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in each state, there were many Forces of various sizes which, like the roots of a tree, depended on each other to survive. Still, some had survived the test of time and could be considered as an Immortal Force. For example, Shu Sect, Kong Mountain, Sword Cliff&#8230; These Forces had long-standing histories, and every disciple who trained under them was heroic and powerful, earning the admiration of the people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those leading such Forces were the slumbering Earth Sword Immortals, with lifespans of more than ten thousand years. These beings were so powerful that it was difficult to describe their magnificence with words. A slash from their swords could send a chill throughout the Thirteen States, and everyone would bow their heads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, following the drastic changes in the Outer Territory half a year ago, many Otherworldly Sky Demons descended and tried to seize this world. The once-glorious land was now filled with turmoil and chaos from wars instead. Even the Earth Sword Immortalswere severely injured by the Otherworldly Sky Demons’ great experts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless lived in fear every day. They were worried about how they would be enslaved or slaughtered by the Otherworldly Sky Demons if this world should fall.</span></p>

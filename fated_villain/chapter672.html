        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You will never abandon me…right?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu looked at him with bright and hopeful eyes, as if afraid of him denying it. She had grown up in Mortal Palace and had been taught to be righteous, moralistic, and serve the masses while living for the purpose of preserving the Great Dao and Mortal Palace.</span><span id="more-34837"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had thought that way before meeting Gu Changge, but something had penetrated through her shields to provide her with curiosity and joy like beams of light. From then on, she realised that there wasn&#8217;t just good and evil in this world, since judging someone just by that was too simplistic and decisive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the many Domains of the Upper Realm, Gu Changge’s true face was that of an unredeemable devil, yet he had always shown up to help her deal with everything when she was in danger or in trouble. Could she describe him as evil then? Thus, she showed favour towards him even though she knew doing so would break the rules of Mortal Palace and betray her Masters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I came to see you just to tell you that in case you overthink things.&#8221; Gu Changge seemed to sigh and tucked her hair behind her ear. &#8220;You&#8217;ve gotten so thin now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-what did you want to tell me?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu was frozen to the spot, her gaze lowered as she allowed him to tuck her hair back. She felt strange. She held onto an expectation, even though she knew their relationship could never be publicised. However, he had come from so far away because he was worried about her overthinking things, which showed how important she was to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You should&#8217;ve heard about the marriage between me and Mingkong, but I need to explain some details to you.&#8221; He shook his head. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he didn&#8217;t deal with this properly, Jiang Chuchu might quarrel with Yue Mingkong in the future. Mortal Palace might have an extraordinary status but its power was inferior to Forces such as the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty. If they quarrelled just because of such a minor issue, it would put Gu Changge at a disadvantage. He didn&#8217;t want to experience such a thing, plus it was uncertain if he would still be in the Upper Realm then.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Details?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu blinked, listening quietly to what he was about to say.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yue Mingkong might hold great power, but ruling the enormous Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty at her age has caused discontent. She lacks the support of a strong formidable force, and those people will never shut up if I haven&#8217;t assisted her.&#8221; Gu Changge sighed as he gave the explanation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So your betrothal is just to solidify her current status and stabilise her reign?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu suddenly understood after hearing his words. After all, he and Yue Mingkong had merely been betrothed prior to this and couldn&#8217;t change much even with such a relationship. However, that would be incomparable to when they got married. All the higher ups in the royal court, who had been critical of Yue Mingkong, could only stay quiet without daring to say anything. That made her feel a lot better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the relationship between us, the Upper Realm will undergo a tumultuous change. I may have to leave the Upper Realm in the near future, so I have to inform you about several things. Of course, I don&#8217;t want you to worry either.&#8221; He nodded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You promised to marry me before. When would that be?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu might be naive when it came to romance, but that didn&#8217;t mean she was stupid. She wanted to get a clear answer from him right now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When there are no more hindrances in the Upper Realm,&#8221; murmured Gu Changge quietly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu made a noise of assent and nodded, a blush rising to her cheeks. While she felt a little faint, her happiness was able to override that. She knew that he had another secret identity which would make him the greatest public enemy once it was exposed. Even with Mortal Palace and the Immortal Gu Family supporting him, it would be hard to fight against the rest of the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll wait for you.&#8221; She gazed at him, knowing that she couldn&#8217;t help him much with her current strength. However, she would be able to help him properly someday, just like how Yue Mingkong could currently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Trust me, that day isn&#8217;t so far away.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and pulled her into his embrace. While he remained quiet, his actions spoke volumes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He remained in Mortal Palace during the next few days, acting lovey-dovey with her in a carefree manner. Many Elders of Mortal Palace knew of his visit but weren&#8217;t brave enough to ask any questions, so they could only act oblivious. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu was a Saintess and had a close relationship with Gu Changge, so who would dare criticise her? Even the ancient beings who were considered historical figures tolerated this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that period, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t remain idle besides cultivating and discussing Dao with Jiang Chuchu. The Golden Fortuity Cauldron he had placed here long ago had already gathered plenty of Power of Faith, which was enough to let Dark Heavens make another grand appearance. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, he had other plans too. The Upper Realm was the centre of the various worlds, connected to billions of Lower Realms Worlds, which might possess many beings equivalent to Fortuitous Ones. He could try accepting these Fortuitous Ones as his followers and thus strengthen the might of Dark Heaven. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, many of those Fortuitous Ones had died at his hand and there were plenty more that would continue to appear from different parts of the world. He was already very familiar with the process as well, so it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult to find Fortuitous Ones in those different Lower Realm Worlds. It might sound insane to recruit followers from every realm, but it was easy for him now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Forming a Dharma Body made from the Power of Faith isn&#8217;t useful to me now. Still, the Power of Faith can be some kind of medium which I can use to create something like a ‘cheat’. Let&#8217;s make it rain cheats into this world.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge looked thoughtful as he sat cross-legged in the shimmering silver palace. Terrifying phenomena played out within his gaze while overpowering energy surged around him as if ancient worlds were hovering around him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golden Fortuity Cauldron sat at the centre of the palace, old and historical yet standing tall and strong as billions of wisps of silver-coloured Power of Faith flowed around it. All of that was the Power of Faith which had been gathered by Mortal Palace over the eras, with an unfathomable amount of it manifesting to form a giant ocean.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a shift in his thoughts, strange Principles emanated from the space before him before an invisible and indistinct net was cast out which instantly travelled billions of kilometres. The inhabitants of the Upper Realm could all sense a disembodied voice telling them to chant a certain superior being&#8217;s true name and find a certain organisation, to be granted Immortality. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that very moment, billions of silver light beams fell into the Lower Realm, like silver raindrops. In those Lower Realm Worlds, infinitely far away from the Upper Realm, a youth suddenly found a mysterious ancient ring, while another found a broken jade bracelet. Meanwhile, others wandered into strange lakes but acquired strange techniques…</span></p>

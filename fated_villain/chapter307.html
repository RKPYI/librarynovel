<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The horrifying Sacred Emperor Realm power clashed, shaking the whole world. The aftermath of the clash seemed so vast that it formed another galaxy, completely engulfing Heaven itself. </span><span id="more-28387"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an extremely terrifying scene. These two Sacred Emperor Grade artifacts had also seemed to be able to be used again. Yet, the divine power they exhibited was so powerful that all those below shuddered, unable to help themselves from kneeling down on the ground. After all, their strike was enough to sink the entire sky, and even a trace of it leaking out would be enough to kill everyone below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it was only reasonable that those who were fast enough, hurriedly retreated with completely pale faces.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Successor of Demonic Arts has a Sacred King Grade artifact in his hand. It is also the kind that can be used repeatedly. No wonder he is so fearless. Even if someone discovers his tracks, he can just kill them and then escape&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, not even the Elders of the Immortal Academy could see through his disguise!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Regardless, the Successor of Demonic Arts will definitely be punished this time. He can no longer escape!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pure hatred and anger were burning in the eyes of the many young prodigies. Even though they couldn&#8217;t charge in head on and hunt him down like Prince Shen and Chosen Monk Jin Chan, they were sticking close to the Eternal Overcast Mist, surrounding it to make sure no one could escape. Thus, if the Successor of Demonic Arts were to try and escape, he would be forced to go deeper into the Land of Eternal Overcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble* All kinds of runes in the sky began to tremble, turning into a tremendous force.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Gu Changge&#8217;s silhouette swiftly disappeared, the two Sacred King Grade artifacts floated mid-air, across each other. The Great Seal of Mountains and Rivers almost regained its original consciousness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The divine consciousness that dwelled in it was no longer the original. Not after Gu Changge&#8217;s had infused his Demonic Arts in it, making it only obeyed him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the current Great Seal of Mountains and Rivers was taken by Gu Changge from the Mortal One’s reincarnation, Jiang Yang, when Gu Changge was in the Lower Realm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was supposed to be the omnipotent Celestial Seal which contained the mountains and rivers, billions of stars, and all kinds of earthly miracles. However, out of worry that it wouldn&#8217;t go unnoticed by a chance encounter with the Celestia Sacred Emperor, he had changed the Celestial Seal&#8217;s appearance by covering up its initial Source, shaping it into what was now called the Great Seal of Mountains and Rivers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Celestia Sacred Emperor wasn&#8217;t dead yet, and he could even be the last powerful remnant left behind by the Mortal One that could be considered to be his trump card. However, since the Mortal One has been completely eliminated by him, and the so-called Celestia Sacred Emperor had not made his appearance, Gu Changge did not pay him much heed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How exactly did he get the Great Seal of Mountains and Rivers?’ This was a question which the Immortal Gu Family didn&#8217;t have an answer to either. They only thought that Gu Changge had been blessed, and had obtained a Sacred Emperor Grade artifact from somewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People outside their family, however, thought it was given to Gu Changge by the Immortal Gu Family. Over time, many just found out that he had come to possess a Sacred Emperor Grade artifact and he could even use it to show Sacred Emperor Realm might.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had even fearlessly fought with Chu Hao, who was at the peak of the Sacred King Realm when they were at the Vermilion Bird Empire. Therefore, no one found it odd when Chosen Monk Jin Chan and Prince Shen asked Gu Changge to stay and fend off the Golden Ancient Bell. Everyone already knew the reason. After all, Gu Changge was the only one capable of this. Had it been Prince Shen and Chosen Monk Jin Chan who had matched against the Sacred Emperor Grade artifact, they might not have won even if they had tried everything they could.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Has Brother Changge gone in?&#8221; Two beautiful and dashing figures, Ying Yu and Yin Mei, flew in the form of divine rainbows through the sky before they appeared behind the group of young prodigies. The one who asked was Ying Mei, whose face had concern written all over it. She was worried about Gu Changge&#8217;s safety as she looked at the monstrous grey fog in front of her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sight of her worrying made the young prodigies around her envious. After all, no Gifted Lady had ever cared about their safety like this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gifted Lady, Young Master Changge has just charged in,&#8221; one of the young prodigies answered with a nod.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another prodigy couldn&#8217;t help his curiosity as he asked, &#8220;What has gotten you all flustered?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yin Mei&#8217;s face turned pale when she heard the words. Her delicate body trembled slightly as she spoke, completely worried, &#8220;This is bad. Young Master Changge might have fallen for their scheme. There is a big possibility that the ones the Successor of Demonic Arts is after isn&#8217;t me, but them…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What!?&#8221; Ying Yu, who was beside her, was greatly taken aback. Disbelief was clearly in her eyes as they widened. [Why did she not tell me earlier!? Was it because she just thought of this possibility?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean, Yin Mei? What scheme are you talking about?&#8221; she couldn&#8217;t help but ask in a low voice.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young prodigies&#8217; faces immediately fell as well after she said those words. Eyes filled with dread and uncertainty, they quietly thought to themselves, afraid to say their concerns out loud. [Gu Changge, Prince Shen and Chosen Monk Jin Chan have been plotted against? But Gu Changge is the kind who has thought of everything. Did he really fall into the enemy&#8217;s trap? Even if he has, Prince Shen and Chosen Monk Jin Chan are fairly skilled themselves as well!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Yin Mei sucked in a deep breath, in an attempt to calm herself down before she finally spoke again. &#8220;I tried to recall when the Successor of Demonic Arts attacked me. He actually made me react on purpose rather than kill me, ensuring that I could escape. It was not because luck was on my side. Furthermore, there were many people who came to the teahouse when it happened. Wasn&#8217;t he supposed to be afraid he would be noticed when he behaved so openly?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many would have taken notice of him as soon as they detected his aura.&#8221; Yin Mei&#8217;s remarks silenced many. After thinking about the situation at that time, carefully, something did</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">certainly seem odd. The Successor of Demonic Arts had always been cautious, which was why it didn&#8217;t make much sense for him to make a move right when he would most likely expose himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You mean to say, he did it all on purpose?&#8221; Ying Yu only felt a chill that made her shiver creep up her spine. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He then took the opportunity to catch the attention of everyone, and he even spewed ridiculous words at the time… telling Brother Changge to come out… His objective is clear. He aims to get Brother Changge and the others to notice him. He must have heard that Brother Changge and the others were rushing over. It also just so happens that there are no Elders keeping an eye out over here at the moment…”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now even Brother Changge&#8217;s Sacred Emperor Grade artifact has been kept outside of Land of Eternal Overcast!&#8221; Yin Mei exclaimed as she nodded. As she spoke, her face turned even paler, and her delicate body shook before tears came out of her eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brother Changge must stay safe! He only went in because of me…&#8221; Hearing the sincerity and worry in her voice, Ying Yu and the others gradually fell silent as their expressions changed drastically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In that case, it sounds like everything has been planned out by the Successor of Demonic Arts from the start,&#8221; one of the young prodigies croaked. His mouth felt dry, and he couldn&#8217;t help feel goosebumps all over his body. &#8220;His goal is to gather everyone here. After all… he has an entire organisation backing him up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many began to come back to their senses. They wondered why Ying Shuang had fled all the way without fighting back. [It was not because he was weak. He was just acting as bait to get Prince Shen and everyone else here!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Successor of Demonic Arts is a mad man. I can&#8217;t believe he came up with a plan to lure everyone here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could he be planning to exterminate all the young prodigies?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This must be a counterattack he has planned!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thought of it made some people in the crowd shiver involuntarily, as the blood was drained from their faces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am afraid Brother Changge and the others will meet their doom this time. The Successor of Demonic Arts must be confident in having the upper hand to make such a plan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This won&#8217;t do! We have to let the Immortal Academy know about what is happening here! It is pointless for us to go in if the Elders aren&#8217;t with us!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the young prodigies fell silent, but still, none dared to make a move to move into the grey fog.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yin Mei was the first one who wanted to go after Gu Changge. &#8220;I am going in to look for Brother Changge. He has hurt his Source the last time he fought against the Successor of Demonic Arts just to save me…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before she could even take a step, Ying Yu held onto her with a frown on her face. &#8220;You can&#8217;t go!&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her voice was cold and demanding. &#8220;With your abilities, you will only make things harder for him.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What am I supposed to do then!? I am going! If something were to happen to him…&#8221; Eyes red, Yin Mei was on the verge of crying. Even the nine fox tails behind her had lost their white lustre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many became quiet when they saw this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there were many of them that were lamenting. They had a feeling that Gu Changge had already won Yin Mei&#8217;s heart when he rescued her from the Successor of Demonic Arts, back when they were at the Celestial Ancient Continent. This made them envious and regretful, but still none of them made a move.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the young prodigies was quiet for a brief moment before he sighed, &#8220;We can only wait for the Elders from the Immortal Academy to come… Senior Brother Changge and the others aren&#8217;t easy opponents. I am sure they will be fine.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side where the grey fog surged into the sky, many Eternal Overcast creatures were throwing themselves at Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the moment they wanted to get close to him, he would casually wave his hand, causing the void to collapse and a terrifying big palm print to appear. Everything within ten kilometres would be annihilated from this one wave of his hand. It could even be said that this space was his domain, but it was just his application of Void Principles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large number of Eternal Overcast creatures couldn&#8217;t even get into the area around him as they would explode like popping balloons, destroying both their body and soul.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ying Shuang should have made his escape to the east by now. Prince Shen is the one who is after him. Since Chosen Monk Jin Chan is in another direction, I will let him off for now.] Gu Changge had a slight smile on his face as he took his time moving through the void.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One after another, there were marks which looked like the Great Dao interweaving under his feet before he quickly disappeared into the distance that seemed so close, yet so far away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He narrowed his eyes slightly, and he could clearly see the many flows of World Principles, and auras. Of course, he could also see Prince Shen and Chosen Monk Jin Chan&#8217;s tracks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stop right there, Ying Shuang! Where do you think you can run off to?&#8221; At the same time, a battle had commenced in the depths of the grey fog.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many mountain peaks that had long been infertile, burst apart under the terrifying fluctuations. There were many runes that were intertwined and spread out across in all directions. It was a magnificent sight to behold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince Shen angrily roared as he drove his Four-Spirit Battle Chariot and hurried over. His towering build and dazzling hair, as though he was on fire, was eye-catching.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was launching one attack after another at Ying Shuang in front of him, all of which were unrestrained and powerful. With a punch, the runes all over his body ignited like beautiful fireworks. It even caused the sky to loudly rumble, as if a big sun was being rolled along.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This kind of power could not be shown by those in the Early Stage of the Sacred Realm. It could only be shown by those in the Peak!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, he was like a young god surrounded by many manifestations. The imposing and domineering Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise all roared as they seemed to come to life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I told you! I am not the Successor of the Demonic Arts! I have been framed!&#8221; Infuriated from being wrongfully chased after, Ying Shuang angrily yelled, expression dark. He swiftly took out a green dagger and drove it at Prince Shen, in an attempt to resist the latter&#8217;s punch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, he was not the real Ying Shuang. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince Shen’s attack instantly shattered the dagger, prompting Ying Shuang to cough out blood and take a few steps back. He looked extremely pathetic with his dishevelled hair. In fact, without the protection of the Golden Ancient Bell, he was, at most, just little stronger than the average young prodigies in the Sacred Emperor Realm. He was no match for ancient monstrocity like Prince Shen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that all you got?&#8221; Prince Shen scoffed, his eyes cold. As he stood firmly on his chariot, like an unparalleled king whose brilliance overflowed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have told you again and again! I am not the Successor of the Demonic Arts! I have been framed! Gu Changge is the one you are looking for!&#8221; Ying Shuang spat as he coughed up more blood. He had a sour expression on his face after failing to defend himself against Prince Shen&#8217;s punch. He had just realised the difference between their might, despite both of them being in the Sacred Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, if he had been the real Prince Ying, he wouldn&#8217;t be beaten up so one-sidedly even if he couldn&#8217;t win against Prince Shen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha! You are still denying the fact and hiding your real skills! I don&#8217;t know what you are planning, but I will end you today. As long as I kill you, I can prove that I am better than Gu Changge! All his glory and fame will come to me!&#8221; Prince Shen had no regard for Ying Shuang&#8217;s current state. After he threw his words out, he unhesitantly charged forward to kill Ying Shuang.</span></p>

        <h4>Chapter 200: Sugar Daddy; One became Emperor, one became Horse-feeder.</h4>
        <p> Looking at Gu Xian'er with a blown-up look. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge's expression was rather plain, not surprised at all. </p>
        <p> However, when Gu Xian'er was about to rush over to fight him desperately, his expression moved slightly, he
            flicked his sleeves, and the void in front of him was blurred. </p>
        <p> A spatial channel appeared. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er felt the sky spinning. </p>
        <p> The scenery in front of her changed drastically, the magnificent mountains and rivers, the belts like
            rivers, and the emerald lakes quickly moved away. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge's aura came from behind her. </p>
        <p> When she reacted, she realized that Gu Changge had wrapped around her waist and quickly walked through the
            spatial channel. </p>
        <p> <b>Buzz!! </b> </p>
        <p> At this moment, Gu Xian'er's head became blank. </p>
        <p> She even forgot to think about where Gu Changge was taking her. </p>
        <p> She could feel the gentle and rhythmic breath of Gu Changge from behind her, like warm sunshine in clear
            winter-spring, with a faint cold touch. </p>
        <p> The next moment, the scene changed, mountains and rivers reversed. </p>
        <p> It suddenly became noisy with loud voices coming from all directions. </p>
        <p> The two of them had already disappeared from the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace and came to a very noisy
            street in the Heavenly Dao Ancient City. </p>
        <p> On the sides of the streets, cultivators of various forces and creatures were walking in and out of majestic
            and grand palaces and pavilions. </p>
        <p> The sudden appearance of Gu Changge obviously caused a great sensation here. </p>
        <p> Many creatures and cultivators looked at him in shock with their eyes widening and frozen in place. </p>
        <p> <b>“It’s… Young Master Changge!” </b> </p>
        <p> A cultivator exclaimed. </p>
        <p> Almost instantly, the surroundings around Gu Changge and Gu Xian'er cleared in an instant. </p>
        <p> During this period of time, Gu Changge's power shook the entire Immeasurable Heaven, leaving no one who
            hadn't heard of him. </p>
        <p> Any appearance outside nowadays would cause a great shock. </p>
        <p> Soon, they were surrounded by many cultivators and creatures who heard of the news. </p>
        <p> Many Young Geniuses from extraordinary origins looked there with reverence and whispered, <b>“Is this Young
                Master Changge? I didn't expect to see him in person today!” </b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Is the woman next to Young Master Changge his cousin? She is a beauty, she’s gonna become a disaster in
                future, starting fights everywhere because of her beauty.”</b> </p>
        <p> [Kshn: That flat board? I don’t believe it.] </p>
        <p> Many young women's eyes were attracted to Gu Xian'er, and they seemed very envious for a while. </p>
        <p> <b>“What are you in a daze for?” </b> </p>
        <p> At this moment, Gu Changge didn't care about the people nearby, and spoke lightly, interrupting Gu Xian'er's
            daze. </p>
        <p> She recovered quickly, but she didn't expect Gu Changge to bring her here suddenly. </p>
        <p> The breath just now made her heart beat so fast that she felt a little nostalgic and unwilling to let go.
        </p>
        <p> <b>“Why did you bring me here?” </b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er swept around, a little puzzled. </p>
        <p> This was obviously a square market that can be seen everywhere in major ancient cities, nothing special.
        </p>
        <p> She didn't understand Gu Changge's intentions. </p>
        <p> <strong>“What else do you think? You reek of poverty.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge glanced at her, frowned, and said in a cold tone. </p>
        <p> <b>“Are you gonna wear that blue dress for a lifetime? My Gu Family will lose face if you appear like that
                when you go back.” </b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge left Gu Xian’er hanging for a long time so now, it was time for her to realise how good he was to
            her. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge thought carefully. </p>
        <p> A simple girl like Gu Xian'er can't always be bullied, she has to taste the sweetness sometimes too. </p>
        <p> Otherwise, Gu Changge wouldn't go through the trouble to bring Gu Xian'er to such a place personally. </p>
        <p> Thi approach was similar to what used to happen in his previous world. People like Gu Xian’er, who is a fan
            of money can be tricked easily by letting them understand what being wealthy is. </p>
        <p> Being a sugar daddy sometimes wasn’t bad. </p>
        <p> It just so happens that the wealth on Gu Changge's body was so much that it could shock the world. </p>
        <p> <b>“Poor…” </b> </p>
        <p> Hearing this, Gu Xian'er suddenly became a little unhappy. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge truly couldn't speak any good words. </p>
        <p> Reeks of poverty? </p>
        <p> Wearing a dress for a lifetime? </p>
        <p> These sentences obviously hit her sore point. She just likes the colour blue. How could it be possible for
            her to wear one piece for a lifetime as Gu Changge said? </p>
        <p> It seemed that she didn't like to be clean but still smelled fragrant. </p>
        <p> ‘No, don’t make a mistake Xian’er. This is the perfect opportunity to get revenge on Gu Changge for all the
            bullying!’ </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er told herself so. </p>
        <p> Afterwards, she scolded Gu Changge bitterly in her heart, which made her feel better. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge looked calm as if he hadn't noticed the change in Gu Xian'er's expression. </p>
        <p> And then, Gu Changge took Gu Xian'er into and out of various high-end pavilions, wherever he went, Gu
            Xian'er usually had the highest level of treatment that she couldn't get on normal days. </p>
        <p> This made her itchy with hate, knowing that Gu Changge was deliberately showing off. </p>
        <p> But it was just envy! </p>
        <p> The Purple Gold Card of the Ten Thousand Dao Commercial Alliance, the Purple Order of the Sacred Pill Sect.
        </p>
        <p> From clothing, Divine Weapons, Scripture, and Relics, to the Elixir of Sacred Medicine </p>
        <p> As long as Gu Xian'er saw it, Gu Changge bought it at once without hesitation and he didn't even see what it
            was. </p>
        <p> This attitude made Gu Xian'er suspect that did Gu Changge finally got a conscience, and planned to
            compensate her? </p>
        <p> Adhering to the idea that Gu Changge must bleed heavily. </p>
        <p> At the end of the day, Gu Xian'er's eyes widened and she couldn't stop spending money, her small hands
            trembled slightly. </p>
        <p> She finally found that money was really omnipotent. </p>
        <p> And this was only a fraction of Gu Changge's huge wealth, not even a fraction to be exact. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er's envious eyes were all green, and she couldn't wait to rob Gu Changge directly. </p>
        <p> She usually doesn't dare to look at the wide-sleeved Immortal Clothes, embroidered with a variety of
            Immortal materials, exquisite and gorgeous, like the intertwined stars on Nine Heavens, radiant and
            colourful, it was an invaluable treasure. </p>
        <p> There were rumours that it was left by a certain female Supreme from the Immortal Period. </p>
        <p> But it was very expensive, and besides being good-looking, it wasn’t really useful. </p>
        <p> However, she didn’t care about those things today. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge only noticed the movement in her eyes, and immediately bought it without hesitation. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian'er couldn't help but get shocked of this wealth. </p>
        <p> At this time, she finally discovered Gu Changge's sinister intentions. From now on, she can no longer be as
            diligent and thrifty as before. </p>
        <p> She will definitely be short of money. </p>
        <p> Was it possible for her to go back to being an old sap if she could get all these if she just hugged Gu
            Changge's thigh? </p>
        <p> After all, after eating the delicacies of mountains and seas, who can still eat leftovers? </p>
        <p> ‘This guy is so bad! He dares calculate these kinds of things too!’ </p>
        <p> <b>“Gu Changge, you are so despicable.”</b> Gu Xian'er couldn't help being angry. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge didn't expect this lass to see through his intentions, it seems that her head was still in place.
        </p>
        <p> <b>“Then? Are you going to return everything you bought?”</b> he asked flatly. </p>
        <p> <b>“I'm not.”</b>

        </div> Gu Xian'er glared at him quickly. </p>
        <p> ‘He wants me to drop all these and go back empty-handed? Hah! Not happening.’ </p>
        <p> ‘There’s a reason why I’m getting these things so why should I return them?’ </p>

        <p> <b>[At the same time] </b> </p>
        <p> <b>[Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family, Ancient Royal Family]</b> </p>
        <p> There was an extremely magnificent room in the palace pavilion and beside it was a relatively rudimentary
            stable. </p>
        <p> There was a stunned young boy with plain clothes and a youthful face, strikingly white, who reacted
            suddenly. </p>
        <p> He had the look of someone who just recovered from a long period of daze. </p>
        <p> <b>“Why am I here?”</b> </p>
        <p> The boy was muttering to himself. </p>
        <p> He had a confused expression for a while before he suddenly covered his head and it started to feel like
            exploding. </p>
        <p> <b>“Argh!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“It hurts!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“It hurts so much!”</b> </p>
        <p> All kinds of memories started flowing into his mind, like broken fragments, beginning to reunite and
            regroup. </p>
        <p> After a long time, the boy widened his eyes in shock and looked around for some time, staring at the strange
            environment in front of him. </p>
        <p> He was still cultivating in the Emperor's Hall just now but in the next moment, his vision went black…and
            this is where he ended up; being a stable boy in charge of scrubbing and feeding the sky horses. </p>
        <p> <b>“Why did I suddenly become a stable boy? Even this face is not mine? Except for my memories, I have
                nothing.”</b> </p>
        <p> The boy's expression was full of various complex emotions including shock, unwillingness, and disbelief.
        </p>
        <p> He was muttering, he couldn't believe that all this would be true. </p>
        <p> <b>“Could it be that a senior is joking with me? My father is Emperor Ying…”</b> the young man's face sank,
            and he said to the invisible void in front of him. </p>
        <p> Although his face was ordinary, there was a terrifying aura around him. </p>
        <p> This terrifying aura can only be possessed by those of the upper ranks. Only someone like them could display
            such an aura. </p>
        <p> However, even after the young man’s words were finished, there was still a dead silence in the void in front
            of him. </p>
        <p> Except for the stable behind him, the surrounding was so quiet he could even hear his breathing. </p>
        <p> His words didn't make any difference. </p>
        <p> <b>“Why did I suddenly become a different person? I don't even have any of his memories, is there any reason
                behind this?”</b> </p>
        <p> The expression of the boy suddenly became very ugly, and he couldn't help clenching his fists. </p>
        <p> <b>“Could it be that my and this stable boy’s soul got exchanged; he became me, and I became him?”</b> The
            boy calmed down quickly and analysed it seriously. </p>
        <p> But the more he analysed, the more upset he became, and the angrier he started to get. </p>
        <p> He couldn't understand what exactly was this at all. </p>
        <p> How can the soul of the two people get exchanged, he had no idea about it. </p>
        <p> Even in the heyday of his father's ancestors, it was impossible to have such a method. </p>
        <p> He was the son of an Emperor, the most talented in the past, always invincible… </p>
        <p> But his father felt that his enlightenment at that time would affect his subsequent achievements, so he
            sealed him up ever since. </p>
        <p> He has been cultivating in the Emperor’s Palace, not even taking half a step outside, and has never
            encountered an enemy. </p>
        <p> <b>“Why did I suddenly encounter such an unpredictable method?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Could it be that my father's enemy did it?”</b> The young man was unwilling to reconcile but he was a
            noble man, his identity and bloodline were indescribable, and no one in this world could match up to him.
        </p>
        <p> As long as he appeared in the outside world, he would be able to dominate the various Ancient Immortl Races
            of the Immortal Period, having unmatched achievements. </p>
        <p> [Kshn: Is it only me or the author just boasted about his own MC again indirectly?] </p>
        <p> But now, having to be stripped of his good qualities and become a low-status stable boy, how can he be
            willing? </p>
        <p> <b>“Don't let this emperor know which thief dares to take everything from me…”</b> He muttered with a cold
            voice while gritting his teeth. </p>
        <p> Just as he gritted his teeth, a little maid's voice came from outside the stable. </p>
        <p> <b>“Chu Fan, have you fed Young Miss’ Heavenly Horse? She is going to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family to

        </p>
        <p> Hearing that, the young man named “Chu Fan” clenched his fists even more tightly. </p>

            Miss Yin Mei. </p>

        <p> Many cultivators who came to give gifts couldn’t help but talk at this moment and were very shocked at each
            gift. </p>
        <p> In contrast, the things they brought seemed very crude. </p>
        <p> At this moment… </p>
        <p> <b>Screech! </b> </p>
        <p> Suddenly there was a cry of Phoenix from the east. </p>
        <p> A Nine-headed Black Divine Phoenix was pulling a chariot, flying at great altitude. </p>
        <p> Many guests turned toward the sound, their eyes glued to it. </p>
        <p> <b>“Which Daoist force is this? They can cause such a scene in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family.” </b> </p>
        <p> <b>“If there’s no one to stop, that doesn’t mean you can go on a rampage!” </b> </p>
        <p> <b>“And no one has stopped them yet?” </b> </p>
        <p> Some Young Supremes from far away were shocked. </p>
        <p> Many people next to them, who came here for the first time, were also obviously shocked and puzzled. </p>
        <p> The Gu Family member who was leading the way for them couldn't help but smile and said, <b>“That is Princess
                Mingkong's chariot, she is the Young Master Changge’s fiance….”</b> </p>
        <p> Hearing this, everyone was stunned. </p>
        <p> Many Young Supremes couldn't help but look in admiration. </p>
        <p> They naturally heard the name Yue Mingkong. </p>
        <p> She was famous in the whole Upper Realm but they could only admire her from far away. </p>
        <p> With the arrival of the Divine Phoenix, a terrible pressure permeated the surroundings. </p>
        <p> And soon, all the cultivators of the Daoist Sects and Immortal Clans rushed to the Inner Island. </p>
        <p> On the Divine Islands below, there were Immortal Mists and Lights rushing into the sky, and there were waves
            of Immortal sound echoing, making it extremely mysterious and shocking. </p>
        <p> A Sacred Bridge emerged with a burst of flowers with fragrance. </p>
        <p> The crystal clear sound of Immortal Rain and Dao chants were heard in unison, revealing a Mysterious Dao
            Vision. </p>
        <p> [Kshn: Even I have no idea what the author is saying at this point. I think he just randomly selected words
            and created a vision.] </p>
        <p> <b>“Guests, please!”</b> </p>
        <p> Many Gu Family members showed up, smiling, to welcome Yue Mingkong. </p>
        <p> <b>“This is just the tip of the iceberg of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family's heritage! It really can't be
                underestimated!!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“This kind of vision is much more ancient than that of our Immortal Wang Family.” </b> </p>
        <p> Dressed up in men's clothing, Wang Zijin, with Xiu'er, was following the guests of the Immortal Wang Family.
            As she stepped inside, she couldn't help but laugh softly when she saw the surroundings. </p>
        <p> Soon, all the guests who came here first boarded the Sacred Bridge. </p>
        <p> The light of the bridge below their feet was shining as if crossing the space before arriving at the
            destination. </p>
        <p> In front of them was the Holy Land. </p>
        <p> The clouds were ethereal, and in the high sky, the people vaguely saw a huge Palace. </p>
        <p> The white clouds and Immortal Mist were ethereal, vaguely blocking the majestic Palace. </p>
        <p> In front of the Palace, Gu Changge, who had already returned to the Ancient Immortal Gu Family, was dressed
            in a clean white robe, making him look transcendent and otherworldly. </p>
        <p> With a smile on his face, he was greeting many of his peers. </p>
        <p> <b>“Brother Gu! We will meet again!”</b> Upon seeing this, Wang Zijin couldn't help but step forward and
            speak with a smile. </p>
        <p> [Kshn: Me, who is criticised for not being able to do anything, doing all the work alone. :sob:] </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been questioning Purple Mansion regarding Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s whereabouts, but even they are clueless about it. And of course, we haven&#8217;t forgotten about Qing Xiaoyi, but Sky King Zhi Yang is nowhere to be found, which makes it even harder to locate the little girl. It is as though we are looking for a needle in a haystack. And I am not saying that out of indolence, but the task is simply impossible to achieve,&#8221; an Elder claimed with a sigh.</span><span id="more-28409"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being in the Sacred Emperor Realm, it would prove difficult, impossible, even, for them to locate someone who was deliberately being concealed. They also attempted to triangulate Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s whereabouts with her brother&#8217;s blood, but the effort was in vain as the two were no biological siblings. Eventually, the Elders were left with no choice but to give up the task.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the young prodigies nearby were taken aback as they felt a wondrous sensation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is going to be good.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As usual, Young Master Changge won&#8217;t let this off so easily.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, Purple Mansion, the Immortal Sect behind Sky King Zhi Yang, was aware of his whereabouts, given that he learned his techniques from Purple Mansion, and the faction only needed to put in a little bit of effort to track him down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems Purple Mansion has decided to protect Sky King Zhi Yang.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They indeed possess the capabilities to do that, as an Immortal Sect.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young prodigies turned to one another and acknowledged the look in one another&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the Elder&#8217;s words, Qing Feng revealed a bitter look and said, &#8220;There is no way Purple Mansion would care about an insignificant person like me. To them, forget my sister&#8217;s abduction, they wouldn&#8217;t care even if she were killed as they are just that domineering and almighty of a Sect. In their eyes, Sky King Zhi Yang is the hope of their future, while my sister and I are nothing but unimportant, dispensable bugs.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, many grew silent as they felt the sorrow of an unremarkable nobody. His sister was abducted yet he was too helpless to bring her back, let alone having the right to resist. At once, the crowd grew quiet as they remembered that Purple Mansion was a ferocious force that would rather offend other forces as long as Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s safety was secured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s alleged connection to the Successor of Demonic Arts was merely a possibility, and that &#8216;possibility&#8217; could easily be erased by those in Purple Mansion at any time. By then, no one would dare to upset Purple Mansion over the matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then it seems Purple Mansion is hiding Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s whereabouts on purpose. Do they really intend to offend the entire world in order to protect Sky King Zhi Yang?&#8221; After a moment of contemplation, Gu Changge heaved a sigh and assured, &#8220;But don&#8217;t you worry. Since I&#8217;ve promised to help, I won&#8217;t go back on my words. Judging by the rampancy of Sky King Zhi Yang and Purple Mansion, it&#8217;s highly likely that the Successor of Demonic Arts&#8217;s infiltration into the Immortal Academy is related to Sky King Zhi Yang.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, the crowd was stunned by Gu Changge&#8217;s persistence in spite of his injuries, seeing how he still remembered such a detail. Many assumed that he would concentrate on healing in peace without caring about the matter, but now it appeared that Gu Changge was determined to draw Sky King Zhi Yang out in the open.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge never forgets his promises! Such honourableness is admirable!&#8221; The crowd of young prodigies expressed their astoundment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, Young Master Changge.&#8221; Immense gratitude surged on Qing Feng&#8217;s face as he understood Gu Changge&#8217;s message, to which Gu Changge simply waved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, a few Elders looked at one another with bitter grins as they didn&#8217;t dare to interfere with the matter. Essentially, if they were to wound up offending both parties, they would only be drawing deaths upon themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, after the crowd paid their respect to Gu Changge, they gradually departed as only Gu Xianer and her hesitating look remained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now that we&#8217;re alone, you may cut to the chase.&#8221; With a calm look, Gu Changge lifted his teacup and took a sip. Apart from Gu Xianer, only Ji Qingxuan was next to him, waiting to serve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, do you think you&#8217;ll be able to handle the matter given your situation?&#8221; Gu Xianer asked with a frown, concerned about Gu Changge&#8217;s injuries, which he himself didn&#8217;t seem to be bothered by.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s there to worry about? It&#8217;s just one Sky King Zhi Yang to deal with,&#8221; Gu Changge indifferently answered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Xianer&#8217;s brows remained tense. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to force yourself. If I hadn&#8217;t promised Qing Feng back then, you wouldn&#8217;t have been dragged into this…&#8221; She sounded rather remorseful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, Gu Changge chuckled as he put down his tea cup, leisurely saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself and think I&#8217;m doing this for you. I’ve also made a promise. Besides, Sky King Zhi Yang is an obstacle in my way, and I suspect that he&#8217;s been working with the Successor of Demonic Arts from the beginning. Perhaps I may even find the Successor of Demonic Arts thanks to him. Gu Xianer, you better fix this assumptive personality of yours, or I&#8217;ll sell you off one day. Hell, you might even have to count my money for me.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fine, I got ahead of myself. It&#8217;s your body, not mine anyway. Do you think I give a crap about your injuries?&#8221; Gu Xianer brushed off Gu Changge&#8217;s derisive remarks and coldly glared at him. In that instant, her eyes were as sharp as icicles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finished, she turned around. As her unstained garment swayed, celestial energy swept and she immediately left the palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That brat is hopeless… She was way cuter when she was my punching bag.] Gu Changge subtly shook his head as he instructed Ji Qingxuan to refill his cup of tea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s Juniors still in Black Tortoise Empire?&#8221; Gu Changge glanced at her and faintly questioned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, they have yet to leave. Young Master, do you intend to attack them?&#8221; Ji Qingxuan nodded as she curiously asked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purple Mansion was an enormous force whose legacy and existence had persisted for millenia, and it was considered as the most successful among Immortal forces. That was also why many Elders felt conflicted to intervene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Hidden Ji Family was also an ancient force, their influence deteriorated, though even if they remained prosperous, there was still no way they could beat Purple Mansion and their terrifying, ancient powers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Attack them? No, how can I attack them in such a peaceful time? I simply wish to invite them over for some tea,&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly claimed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazed, Ji Qingxuan nodded. Although she didn&#8217;t spend as much time with Gu Changge as her sister, Su Qingge, she was smart and tactful enough to understand insinuations without any explanation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, she grew to understand more of Gu Changge&#8217;s personality and habits. For some reason, she could sense that Gu Changge already discovered something was off about her but he never exposed her. From his usual way of speech, she always felt that enthralling sensation, as though he was constantly toying with his prey, and those were the most nerve-wracking moments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, she always had her back soaked in cold sweat and her guard up all the time. Eventually, when she was caught red-handed by Gu Changge, the man swiftly dismissed it without getting deep into it. Thereupon, she felt as though she was walking on a cliff, whereby a negligent slip would cost her her life. Though, she believes that Gu Changge was doing that on purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having followed Gu Changge for a while, she realised that the rumours and perception towards him were all false, be it &#8216;gentle and compassionate&#8217; or &#8216;oppressing and aggressive&#8217;,  &#8216;enigmatic&#8217; was the only word fit to describe him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Relay my instructions. Visit the post of the disciples of Purple Mansion and invite them over. If they refuse, then they&#8217;d be leaving me no choice but to slaughter every one of them.&#8221; With that, Gu Changge spoke once again, telling Ji Qingxuan to pass on his instructions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not daring to delay the order, Ji Qingxuan immediately went to tend to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge was rubbing his teacup made of white jade. As his eyes deepened, he began contemplating other matters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late, other than the fact that major forces started to pay attention to the existence of the Successor of Demonic Arts, sending their men to search for him, the occurrence of another matter shocked the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, two ancient beings from Sky Emperor Mountain and Buddhist Mountain got into a fight. Based on the rumours, those two once failed to achieve the Great Dao, and there was hardly any disparity between their current cultivation levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle took place at a region infinitely far away, but shockwaves and destructions from their fight haunted the places within a million kilometres around them as the stars a hundred thousand kilometres away from them were turned into dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, the outcome of the battle was known to no one. While some claimed that the cultivator of Buddhist Mountain triumphed, others stated that the expert of Sky Emperor Mountain was more powerful. Either way, those were nothing but hearsays.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the incident, Jin Chan, the Chosen Monk, was also shoved to the spotlight as many were informed by countless young prodigies regarding the details of the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turned out, Sky Emperor Mountain and Buddhist Mountain going to battle all started with Jin Chan. As a monk, not only was he apathetic, but he even schemed against Prince Shen, causing the latter to fall into the hands of the Successor of Demonic Arts. Therefore, many began to refer to Jin Chan as the Demonic Monk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Demonic Monk? It appears Sky Emperor Mountain has yet to get over their anger. Perhaps I can provide them with a place to vent.&#8221; Thinking of Purple Mansion, Gu Changge decided that he needed to look for a fool to start a conflict for him, and after a moment of contemplation, he figured Sky Emperor Mountain was the best choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As long as Sky Emperor Mountain&#8217;s resentment still persists, they&#8217;ll be sure to notice Purple Mansion. Let’s drop them a hint.&#8221; Upon a chuckle, Gu Changge put down his chess piece. The entire chess board began changing, as if it was surrounded by anomalies of the world, mysterious and unpredictable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Checkmate!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, in a mountain range not far away from the Black Tortoise Empire filled with piling strange rocks and hazardous cliffs along with dense ancient woods whose branches covered the skies, thick mists were wafting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the air, there were subtle gleams continuously flickering. Upon an assiduous look, one would notice that the gleam belonged to concealed, mysterious runes, which were scattered all over the place, forming an invisible array.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, even if a Sacred Emperor Realm expert were to scan the region with their divine senses, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to find anything strange as the level of the hidden array was immeasurable. Besides that, there were also magic tools discreetly hidden around the mountain range.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the region surrounded by the array was an abandoned ruined site, wherein collapsed palaces, buildings, and religious temples were filled with worts, seemingly ancient and historical.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within, there was a heroic-looking man in purple sitting with his legs crossed. His black hair was resting on his shoulders while an aura of decency wafted around his features. At the same time, traces of lights that fell from the skies were absorbed into the pattern between his brows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, there were also quite a number of young prodigies nearby the man in purple, including those of human races and ancient races. Their auras were overwhelming as they were guarding the man in purple, vigilantly keeping watch at their surroundings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indubitably, the man in purple was Sky King Zhi Yang, who was refining the sun rays as he was figuring out a way to solve the issues with his Foreseeing Eye. Contrary to the public&#8217;s beliefs, Sky King Zhi Yang never ventured too far away from the Black Tortoise Empire.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, is there something special about that girl?&#8221;
                Now that there was no one else in the room, Yan Ji cut to the straight and asked with her gaze upon Gu
                Changge.</span><span id="more-28955"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge did not disclose much about Xiao Ruoyin and simply stated
                that he found Xiao Ruoyin to be an excellent disciple for Yan Ji to mentor, Yan Ji figured that he must
                possess a certain intention for the girl. Judging by his personality, there was no way he would go such
                a length for a girl. Realising that, Yan Ji couldn&#8217;t help but feel envious.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, her emotions were only temporary since she was aware that the
                &#8216;cheap&#8217; disciple must possess a certain unique physique, and Gu Changge merely wished to
                refine her before eventually consuming her. In other words, Xiao Ruoyin was nothing but a pitiful
                artifact.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She&#8217;s quite special. She&#8217;ll be useful to me in the
                future.&#8221; Having nothing to hide from Yan Ji, Gu Changge smilingly answered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then I shall teach her all I know.&#8221; Yan Ji nodded.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Honestly, you don&#8217;t have to do that. Perhaps after being used
                for a while, she&#8217;ll remember something. And all you have to do is let her understand that what we
                do is all for her sake.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s grin deepened.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Yan Ji came to a realisation. &#8220;Is she a reincarnation of
                a certain being?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Gu Changge simply laughed it off without answering, but Yan Ji
                was sharp enough to understand what she should do with the piece of information.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while. Your cultivation level has tremendously
                grown.&#8221; With that, he gently wrapped his arm around Yan Ji&#8217;s waist and initiated a casual
                chat to catch up with her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Yan Ji shot him a glance. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been cultivating all day
                with sufficient guides and resources. Even a good-for-nothing is bound to achieve a breakthrough, you
                know.&#8221; Nevertheless, despite having broken through to the Sacred King Realm, she was still unable
                to detect Gu Changge&#8217;s cultivation level, as if it was constantly concealed by a layer of fog. It
                was enigmatic and unpredictable as ever.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing the disconcertment in her voice, Gu Changge faintly smiled.
                &#8220;And that is why I assigned you to a task, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are those mortals acquainted with that cheap disciple of mine?&#8221;
                Yan Ji was rather curious about Jiang Chen and the rest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, they came from a distant land in the Lower Realm as a group. They
                were coincidentally teleported all the way here,&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly explained.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, Yan Ji tilted her head and stared at Gu Changge with her
                crystalline eyes. &#8220;Young Master Gu?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? I&#8217;m listening.&#8221; Gu Changge retained his smile.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m happy that you haven&#8217;t forgotten about
                me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Gu Changge&#8217;s stay in the ancient battleship after he left the
                Capital of the Vermilion Bird Empire, the whole Empire still remain restless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere far away, protective arrays in the territory of Purple Mansion were
                being sieged as forces were charging towards them, creating a world-shocking war. Ashes piled into
                mountains while blood streamed into rivers, and lying all over the place were corpses.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, countless cities were brought to ruin as a result of the war.
                The terrifying chaos in the world left every single being fearing for their lives as the terror of the
                Immortal War continue to blow the minds of all the factions in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As condescending as ever, the ten Sacred Emperor Realm Masters of the
                Immortal Gu Family appeared, and no opposition could resist them. In spite of Purple Mansion&#8217;s
                continuous retaliation, the ten remained completely fine, resulting in Purple Mansion’s complete defeat.
                Eventually, all those from Purple Mansion in the Sacred Emperor Realm, were slaughtered. Underneath
                where they were, were puddles of blood as their Sacred Emperor Grade artifacts broke into pieces before
                falling onto the battlefield.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this war, Sky Emperor Mountain, Ancient Ye Family, Endless Fire Kingdom,
                and the rest of the attacking forces faced grave losses as those of Purple Mansion were ready to
                sacrifice themselves in this battle. Alas, the number of experts sent by the Immortal Gu Family was too
                great. &#8216;Limitless&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t even overstate the force as their shadows covered the sky
                while their terror knew no bounds. As such, it was Sky Emperor Mountain and the relatively smaller
                forces who encountered Purple Mansion&#8217;s encirclement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert of Purple Mansion broke out from
                their ultimate arrays, and displayed their peerless abilities, but that, sadly, such resistance
                didn&#8217;t persist for long.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The observing cultivators noticed that experts in the Nirvana Realm appeared
                from the ancient battleships, which belonged to the Immortal Gu Family. They then joined the war, from
                the outer territory of Purple Mansion. Thereupon, the fear-striking war escalated into someone even
                those in the Sacred Emperor Realm could not control. At once, starry skies shattered and countless rifts
                opened up in the air, as if they were about to collapse, leaving behind a frightening sight.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that they were unable to retaliate, the formidable experts of Purple
                Mansion intended to retreat to their Sect, but before they could flee, auras of those in the Nirvana
                Realm rushed out from the military forces of the Immortal Gu Family. As such, before the Quasi-Nirvana
                Beings of Purple Mansion could escape to safety, they instantly perished in the war.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Immortal War went on, almost all forces in the Upper Realm were paying
                full attention to it, only to be traumatised with extreme fear. The aggression of Gu Changge and the
                Immortal Gu Family were completely the same—unimaginably terrifying. Given such overbearing might,
                Purple Mansion was unable to defend themselves, and it was only a matter of time until they eventually
                fell.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, cultivators also noticed a huge army of cultivators in
                Purple Mansion disappearing into portals, leaving no trace behind. Some inferred that those cultivators
                were planning to rescue Sky King Zhi Yang in secret.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late, the Vermilion Bird Emperor had been so perturbed that his hair
                grew white, watching the massive empire he built facing destruction, and it might actually be at the
                brink of destruction. In only a few days, almost all families and Sects moved out of Vermilion Bird
                Empire. Not even lone cultivators chose to stay. Even if Gu Changge were to relocate Sky King Zhi Yang,
                it would be too late as the ruination of Vermilion Bird Empire was virtually inevitable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, the Vermilion Bird Emperor was reluctant to have his empire fall under
                his reign. He decided to hold on to it regardless of the consequences, or he would be too embarrassed to
                face his ancestors. Thus, all he could do was beg Chu Hao for help, but Chu Hao&#8217;s hands were tied
                as well.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, Chu Hao&#8217;s actions drove Tang Wan away, and since then,
                meeting with her had become difficult as she spared him no chances. Despite his plea for assistance,
                Tang Wan had not the slightest intention to even see him as the incident back then tore them
                apart.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having been left with no choice, Chu Hao could only find out where Sky King
                Zhi Yang might possibly be by asking around, as his brave plan was to get Sky King Zhi Yang out of
                Vermilion Bird Empire. By claiming that he was assigned to guard Sky King Zhi Yang upon Gu
                Changge&#8217;s instruction, he might just be able to avoid a disaster.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given he was in the Sacred King Realm and he had the help of his Uncle
                Master, Bai Yang, who in the Sacred Emperor Realm, keeping watch over Sky King Zhi Yang wouldn&#8217;t
                not even cause him to break a sweat. When he enacts his plan, even if Gu Changge were to be displeased
                with his actions, there was nothing he could really do about Sky King Zhi Yang anymore, since the latter
                would be away from the Empire by that time. Furthermore, even if Chu Hao faces backlash, it was still
                better to act first rather than beg for mercy now. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Chu Hao was looking into Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s location of
                confinement, another disguised man was also doing the same, and that disguised man was none other than
                Qin Wuya. Although he successfully recruited the ancient being from the Lake of Reincarnation to assist
                him, his one and only opportunity, as well as all his effort up until now, would go in vain should he
                fail to uncover Sky King Zhi Yang&#8217;s whereabouts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, despite failing to locate Sky King Zhi Yang, Qin Wuya
                coincidentally bumped into Tang Wan, and he found the encounter somewhat wondrous. However, as he was
                preoccupied by urgent matters, he refrained from directly meeting up with her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now that all eyes are on Purple Mansion, this is the perfect opportunity for
                me to rescue Junior Brother. Once I save him, I&#8217;ll reconcile with you, Wan’er!] Staring at the
                glamorous figure from afar, Qin Wuya muttered in his heart. Little did he know, the instant he turned
                around, Tang Wan, too, turned around and gazed at his back with a troubled expression.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why are you two so insistent on opposing such a fearsome man?] Tang Wan
                heaved a sigh. According to Gu Changge&#8217;s order, a huge net was cast, awaiting to capture the two
                men upon their trespass. Sadly, in spite of her reluctance, her actions were not her own to
                control.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, in a spacious region filled with grand Mystic Mountains and
                spectacular pavilions, Divine Beasts roared as Divine Birds flapped their wings. At that moment, after
                explaining the procedure of testing aptitude and physiques to her peers, Xiao Ruoyin arrived at the
                trial area, along with Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, and the rest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the group was visibly thrilled. Especially after hearing that Xiao
                Ruoyin possessed excellent aptitude, as seven colours shone on the test stone, which means that she was
                more talented than ordinary young prodigies. Such news made the group grow even more excited and
                eager.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their eyes, since Xiao Ruoyin travelled to this world together with them,
                they should be approximately at her level. Thinking how they could become Immortal-like beings that
                could display all sorts of mighty abilities, they were overwhelmed by exhilaration.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the group, even Jiang Chen grew somewhat enthusiastic. Initially, he
                knew nothing about his aptitude, but after referring to the aritfact spirit of the Celestial Boat of
                Creation in his mind, he was told that he was powerful. Hearing that, he felt rather relieved and joyful
                as he could now comfortably release all his frustrations.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since this world is about comparing strength and Talents, if it turns out my
                aptitude is more potent than that of Young Master Gu, I may be able to steal his spotlight. And
                that&#8217;s pretty good, I&#8217;ll say! Although Ruoyin was proven to possess excellent aptitude, I
                doubt I&#8217;ll be inferior to her.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wonder how great my aptitude will be? If I don&#8217;t even have the
                right to cultivate, I&#8217;ll be embarrassed to death,&#8221; Niu Tian nervously stated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Jiang Chen comforted him, &#8220;You have a robust body.
                I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be able to cultivate. Don&#8217;t stress yourself.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the two were chatting, someone among them walked forward, and it was a man
                named Song Ming. He shared an ordinary relationship with Jiang Chen and Niu Tian, but he was certainly
                Wang Ning&#8217;s lapdog.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, Jiang Chen and Niu Tian had their eyes fixated at Song Ming,
                watching as he nervously put his hands on the test stone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, the blinding lights everyone anticipated did not show up;
                let alone blinding lights, there wasn&#8217;t even a trace of a single glow.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sight left the group stunned, and even Xiao Ruoyin revealed a scowl.
                Nonetheless, she spoke nothing about it since aptitude varied based on each individual, so none could
                predict the outcome without actually giving it a test.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could the test stone be faulty?&#8221; Song Ming widened his eyes in
                disbelief as his lips shivered, and he could barely stand right upon this shocking result. [Without any
                aptitude to cultivate, what am I to do in this world? Does that mean my dreams of cultivating are
                shattered?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The stone stone, faulty? Ridiculous! If you don&#8217;t have aptitude
                for cultivating, you just can’t. It is as simple as that. And without aptitude to cultivate, you are
                nothing but garbage in this world,&#8221; The muscular person beside him scornfully scoffed, seemingly
                indifferent.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fearfully glancing at the muscular person, Song Ming walked away,
                disappointed, and he couldn&#8217;t feel any more hopeless.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, those behind him started to grow restless. After all, strength was
                all that mattered in this cruel world. Many were guessing that Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s exceptional talents
                were the only reason she gained Gu Changge&#8217;s favour.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the next four people approached the test stone, only to be disconcerted
                by the outcome as there was not the slightest change in the test stone.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, and the rest furrowed their brows. Even Xiao
                Ruoyin&#8217;s face turned into a hideous grimace as she felt helpless for her peers.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, it was the woman named Wang Ning&#8217;s turn. Judging by her
                captivating face, she, too, was anxious and distressed as her back was soaked in cold sweat.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* Finally, the test stone showed a slight change as a dim, crimson
                gleam surged, but the gleam quickly faded away.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, her eyes suddenly glistened as she almost jumped around in joy
                and excitement. &#8220;I have the aptitude to cultivate! I can cultivate!&#8221; She euphorically
                exclaimed with her trembling voice as her anxious heart could finally ease down. At the same time, the
                others were shooting jealous gazes at her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you getting excited over such an insignificant glow? Even the
                worst Sects in the world wouldn&#8217;t want such someone untalented like you. You&#8217;re as garbage
                as the last one.&#8221; Then, the muscular person at the side mocked as condescension persisted in his
                eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, Wang Ning was dumbstruck. [Even the worst Sects
                wouldn&#8217;t want me? How am I going to gather the resources to cultivate then?] With that in mind,
                Wang Ning lost all her optimism as the glimmer of hope she momentarily had earlier vanished. It was as
                though she fell from the Heavens right into the deepest level of the abyss.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Xiao Ruoyin couldn&#8217;t help but feel sympathetic for Wang Ning,
                even though the latter used to pick on her every chance she had. To be frank, Xiao Ruoyin might feel as
                hopeless as Wang Ning and the rest if she, like them, didn&#8217;t have any aptitude for
                cultivating.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right when Wang Ning and the rest were dwelling in their dejection and
                disaffection, Niu Tian took a deep breath and stepped forward.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh!* The test stone emitted a crimson glow which quickly died away. It
                was the same scenario as when Wang Ning tested her aptitude.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, for some reason, Wang Ning and the rest felt relieved seeing
                that they were deemed equal as Niu Tian. Despite being good acquaintances, they couldn&#8217;t accept
                anyone among them to be better than them, and such was the true reflection of mankind.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I suppose this is fate,&#8221; Niu Tian bitterly stated, and he was as
                disappointed as his peers. As one&#8217;s Talents might mean everything in this world, there
                wasn&#8217;t much difference between those who possessed a little and those who possessed none at
                all.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uhh…&#8221; At that moment, Jiang Chen failed to find a way to comfort
                his friend as he revealed a solemn expression. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Niu Tian. I promise you,
                I&#8217;ll find a way for you to cultivate.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen still remembered the word of the Artifact Spirit, who claimed that
                he possessed formidable Talents and all he needed to do was focus on cultivating, and by the time he
                grew stronger, he could find a way to help his own acquaintances.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Niu Tian forced a bitter grin, thinking that Jiang Chen was just
                trying to console him, and he didn&#8217;t give it any more thought.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Wang Ning and the rest were somewhat upset by Jiang Chen&#8217;s
                words, given how he sounded as if he was certain that he would have the aptitude to cultivate, and his
                calm manner made it even worse.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jiang Chen, do you think you&#8217;ll be as lucky as Goddess Xiao?
                Talk about the future, huh? I&#8217;m sure our aptitude to cultivate are all the same. Unless you are
                Goddess Xiao, you should stop dreaming.&#8221; Immediately, Song Ming unorthodoxly laughed aloud as he
                mocked Jiang Chen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, none among the group stopped Song Ming. After all, if Jiang
                Chen were to be proven to possess exceptional aptitude, the rest would definitely feel unfair and be
                filled with immense jealousy, thinking that Jiang Chen didn&#8217;t deserve to be more outstanding than
                them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Such ludicrous belittlement. Just you wait.&#8221; Since Jiang Chen
                already knew the result, he acted composedly, and he was only frowning at the true colours of his
                peers.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, he proceeded towards the test stone with a leisurely look,
                unlike his hopeless, depressed acquaintances.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, something didn&#8217;t feel right for Xiao Ruoyin as she
                wondered why Jiang Chen was so confident that he would be able to cultivate. Though she, too, wished
                that Jiang Chen would be able to take on the Path of Cultivation. Otherwise, by the time she cultivated
                to be strong enough to prove fruitful, her peers would have been dry skeletons, and she would no longer
                have anyone to talk to.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How is Jiang Chen so confident? Or is he just trying to act tough at such a
                moment?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Ruoyin tensed her brows as displeasure surged in her heart. She once
                thought Jiang Chen was a mature, reliable, trustworthy person, but his behaviour today suggested that
                her impression of him might have been wrong, since he would never pull off such a mindless stunt. Unless
                his self-assurance led to a display of terrifying Talents, he would undoubtedly become a laughing stock
                for the rest of the group.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in a magnificent pavilion far away, Gu Changge and Yan Ji were
                standing next to each other by the window, observing everything that was happening.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Quite fascinating. Though, I do wonder what kind of expression he
                would make after this?&#8221; Gu Changge carried a subtle, enthralling grin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, you&#8217;ve had your men rig the test stone,
                haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; At that moment, Yan Ji discerned what was off. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the few that took the test earlier, two of them, in fact, possessed
                decent aptitude, yet the test stone only reacted with a weak glow, and that pretty much explained
                everything. However, to the group of students, their aptitude to cultivate was crucial to determine
                their future. Still, none of them would have known that the test stone they were using was indeed
                rigged.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course. If I hadn&#8217;t done that, that guy right there would
                have been a show-off.&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled and casually confessed as if he didn&#8217;t do
                anything wrong. To these students, his little gesture could reshape their entire future. As a matter of
                fact, none of them except his prey, Jiang Chen, would live long enough to have a future since he had no
                intentions of letting them off.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can see that the boy named Jiang Chen seems to possess some kind of
                unique physique.&#8221; Yan Ji nodded as she saw nothing wrong with that, since the group of students
                owe Gu Changge their lives, so it was only natural that he got to decide their fate.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the trial area, as Jiang Chen confidently, calmly, put his hands on the
                test stone, everyone else were fully attentive to him, eager to find out whether Jiang Chen&#8217;s
                claim of his peers being belittling would backfire on him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, a moment passed, but the test stone remained intact, showing not
                the tiniest change.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weirded out, Jiang Chen revealed a scowl, though his hands remained on the
                test stone. &#8220;Impossible!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hastily, he questioned the Artifact Spirit of Celestial Boat of Creation in
                his mind. [What&#8217;s happening? I thought you said my aptitude is excellent? Why didn&#8217;t the
                test stone show any sign of glowing?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jiang Chen, how much longer do you intend to put your hands there?
                Light doesn&#8217;t pop up the longer you put your hands on the stone. Just accept that you&#8217;re
                talentless. You don&#8217;t have to act all tough. &#8216;Belittlement,&#8217; he said? What a damn
                joke.&#8221; Song Ming, whom Jiang Chen took a jab at, disdainfully mocked once again, while the others
                also revealed gloating faces.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jiang Chen, you don&#8217;t have to force it if you don&#8217;t have
                any aptitude to cultivate…&#8221; Obviously upset, Xiao Ruoyin said with a scowl. She was aware that Gu
                Changge was watching them from afar, and Jiang Chen&#8217;s actions indubitably embarrassed her.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the surrounding chatter, cold sweat started dripping down Jiang
                Chen&#8217;s face that was filled with awkwardness and perturbation as things didn&#8217;t go his way,
                which led to him suspecting that the Artifact Spirit might have deceived him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Jiang Chen, someone fiddled with the test stone. It&#8217;s faulty.
                Someone is deliberately trying to humiliate you.&gt; Then, the Artifact Spirit claimed with anger in its
                voice.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see, so it&#8217;s the test stone that&#8217;s faulty.] Hearing that,
                Jiang Chen was reassured, and he already figured out who was the one who pulled off such a ruthless
                move.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he swiftly collected his emotions and stated, &#8220;The test stone
                is broken. Change it to another one and I&#8217;ll have another go.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the rest of the students were stupefied, and when they regained
                their senses, even Niu Tian was at a loss for words. [The test stone is broken? What excuse is that? Is
                he perhaps possessed by some sort of demon?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to die of laughter, Jiang Chen. That&#8217;s the
                reason you&#8217;re giving us? And here I thought you were going to have the aptitude to cultivate, but
                you&#8217;re the same as me. The test stone is broken, you say? Maybe the next one is broken as
                well.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, the trial area was filled with chortles of mockery.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, Jiang Chen was visibly vexed and frustrated in spite of having
                trained his patience.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jiang Chen, do you have any idea what you&#8217;re saying? I used this
                exact same test stone back when I tested for my aptitude. How can it be faulty?&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin was
                speechless towards Jiang Chen&#8217;s action as she was surprised by how he would resort to such a
                blatant excuse after discovering that he had no aptitude to cultivate.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The test stone is truly faulty. Why don&#8217;t you give it another
                try?&#8221; Jiang Chen glared at Xiao Ruoyin, attempting to defend himself, but she was no longer in any
                mood to entertain him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand that you can&#8217;t accept the fact, but that is simply
                the reality of this cruel world. Even without the aptitude to cultivate, you can still live as an
                ordinary person just fine. I trust your capabilities. Even as an ordinary person, I&#8217;m sure
                you&#8217;ll still live better than the rest,&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin replied after calming herself
                down.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jiang Chen was about to respond, the muscular person extended his arm and
                stopped him. With a cold face and a disparaging tone, he then scoffed, &#8220;Lady Xiao no longer shares
                the same world as you bunch of trash. Dreaming to be Immortals when you don&#8217;t even have the
                aptitude to cultivate? By the time you take your last breath, Lady Xiao will still retain her impeccable
                beauty, and there won&#8217;t be any change in her face. Now, I&#8217;ve made this very clear, and if
                you still insist, you&#8217;ll be sorry that I have to resort to force.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right after he said that, a frightening aura surged around his body, leaving
                the faces of Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, and the rest blanching as they almost fell to their knees.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Xiao Ruoyin felt somewhat sorrowful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Gu Changge appeared out of nowhere with a smile, saying,
                &#8220;The world is full of such heartbreaking instances. Some bonds are meant to break, and trying to
                mend it would be nothing but disadvantageous to one&#8217;s future of cultivation.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Xiao Ruoyin remained wordless for a while before taking a final
                glimpse at Jiang Chen and the rest. &#8220;Take care.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, she turned around and walked towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ruoyin…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xiao Ruoyin…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, and the rest were shocked. The next second, they were
                surrounded by a spine-chilling aura as beings covered in heavenly light encircled them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Get them out of here,&#8221; Gu Changge blandly ordered.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen knew that the Ancient Divine Tomb was completely different from
                other tombs. After all, there were few clans that could title themselves ‘Godly’ and this tomb belonged
                to them. It was a far cry from the graves of those in the Partial-Enlightened Realm and True Enlightened
                Realm.</span><span id="more-29438"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunities contained in this kind of tomb were beyond imagination. He
                believed that he could gain considerably with help from the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of
                Creation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jiang Chen dwelled in his daydream, a jolly-looking monk suddenly
                appeared in front of him. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kind sir, where did you get your items from?&#8221; he asked while
                pointing at the fragments of weapons on display on the floor. The monk who stood there with his oily
                face wasn&#8217;t very young. He also had on a tattered cassock as he held a broken alms
                bowl.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen didn&#8217;t even need to think before he blurted out,
                &#8220;I picked them up from here and there, of course.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; the monk asked again, in which Jiang Chen
                nodded. &#8220;Of course.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monk chuckled when he heard Jiang Chen&#8217;s confident answer.
                &#8220;Heh, in that case, why don&#8217;t you follow this poor ol&#8217; monk, since you and I are fated
                to meet&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen&#8217;s head immediately shot up as he peered at the monk wearily.
                &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; He quietly held the weapon in his sleeve.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had carefully selected the items he had on display for sale, and
                he was confident there would be nothing odd about them. However, the monk in front of him must have
                noticed something, otherwise he wouldn&#8217;t say this to Jiang Chen.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the monk heard this, his eyes fell on Jiang Chen&#8217;s face. He seemed
                very interested when he noticed Jiang Chen&#8217;s cultivation level. &#8220;You are a skilled young
                man. I just happen to have a job that I can have your assistance with. And don&#8217;t worry, you will
                be compensated fairly.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chu&#8217;s heart sank, and he felt that the cultivation level
                of the monk in front of him was unfathomable. [What kind of assistance does he need?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Monks don&#8217;t tell lies, please rest assured. I have never
                deceived anyone in my life.&#8221; Seeing Jiang Chen fall silent, the monk reassured him. &#8220;I will
                have to apologise beforehand if you still find it hard to trust me.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen immediately knew what the monk meant. The monk was going
                to get violent if he continued to reject.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen couldn&#8217;t help but let out a bitter laugh. &#8220;I
                am but a normal person reselling these trinkets. Why do you have to do this, sir?&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, no. You are no simple person to me. Your cultivation level
                might not be high, but you managed to enter tombs with such terrifying Yin Energy and find these weapon
                fragments. No ordinary person can do what you did.&#8221; The monk ignored Jiang Chen&#8217;s
                self-depreciation as he laughed and went straight to the point, pointing out what made Jiang Chen stand
                out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jiang Chen felt his heart sink again, but still his expression
                remained the same. In fact, he did get into trouble many times when he went to raid tombs. The danger in
                it was what would scare ordinary cultivators out of their wits, and even put them in harm&#8217;s way.
                Even though Jiang Chen had gathered a good amount of loot after such raids, he had nearly lost his life
                more than once. He wouldn&#8217;t have escaped unscathed if it wasn&#8217;t for the help of the Artifact
                Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This monk must be someone skilled.] As Jiang Chen thought that, he
                had no choice but to leave this place with the monk. He had also abandoned his stall, which was fine.
                After all, nothing there had high value. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monk led him on a confusing path before they arrived at a
                magnificent mansion. There, he saw a powerful monk in charge of guarding the gate. The monk&#8217;s body
                was covered in divine brilliance, and he had frightening vitality and aura.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After arriving here, the attitude of the first monk was visibly a lot
                more cautious. He dared not be as casual as before.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He muttered in a low voice, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t run your mouth
                later, kind sir. Even I can&#8217;t help you if you cross someone here.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen&#8217;s expression also turned solemn. He felt aggrieved
                for suddenly getting involved in such a thing for no reason. Still, he couldn&#8217;t help asking in an
                equally quiet voice. &#8220;Who are we meeting?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monk turned to glance at him, and only explained in order to make
                sure Jiang Chen was more mindful of his behaviour.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Godly Illusion Clan.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen&#8217;s pupils shrank when he heard that. His face soon
                fell when he suddenly thought of something. Over the past few days, news that an Ancient Divine Tomb was
                about to appear, had caused a commotion everywhere. He had also heard that the so-called Ancient Divine
                Tomb actually buried a Master from the Godly Illusion Clan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Godly Illusion Clan was a mysterious clan. They were an extremely
                rare clan in the Upper Realm, and the number of clansmen in it was not large. However, one could easily
                imagine how strong they were to be coined a Godly Clan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not impossible for them to become the strongest clan in the
                Upper Realm if they had more members in their clan. Furthermore, the person he was meeting now was part
                of the Godly Illusion Clan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This made Jiang Chen&#8217;s heart skip a beat as he was taken over
                by overwhelming nervousness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monk must still be worried as he turned his head to Jiang Chen
                again and reminded him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense when we go in.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chen only nodded in reply, his palms were now drenched in cold
                sweat.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faintly, he saw divine light shining in the depths of the mansion, and there
                was an incomparably noble and slender figure sitting upright in there. The figure&#8217;s gaze seemed to
                penetrate through him, seeing through him completely.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Jiang Chen step into this place, the elderly man in black
                robes who had been hiding in the sky all this time only looked on without following him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gu Changge was dispatching a terrifying army to search for the
                remnants of Bandit Thirteen in Immortal Academy, within the academy somewhere else, there were numerous
                Elders with blurred faces shrouded in Chaos Energy in a palace discussing some matters.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The appearance of the Ancient Divine Tomb of the Godly Illusion Clan
                this time is a good training opportunity for the prodigies of our academy.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Trial of resolving the Eternal Overcast crisis was ruined
                by the Successor of Demonic Arts last time. I hope everything goes smoothly this
                time.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How about we appoint the King with Six Crowns as the team
                leader this time? Gu Changge has grown so much the Immortal Academy can no longer accommodate him. He
                probably won&#8217;t take this kind of trial to heart.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elders started to discuss who would be the leader for the Trial
                this time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t because Gu Changge was unqualified that they had
                excluded him from the list of candidates. The problem was whether or not he was willing to take the
                role.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Ancient Divine Tomb was a precious opportunity to the rest of
                the disciples, but it was not worth mentioning to the current Gu Changge.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the decision was made, and as soon as the news came out, it
                immediately caused a stir among the disciples of Immortal Academy.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appearance of an Ancient Divine Tomb naturally meant
                opportunities and dangers. Furthermore, the leader of the trail this time was the King with Six Crowns
                and not Gu Changge.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news surprised many. They were wondering if Gu Changge had been
                overly showy recently that prompted Immortal Academy to suppress him so that he wouldn&#8217;t be too
                powerful a figure in the academy. However, the speculation was soon proven wrong when an Elder announced
                that Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t participating in the trial this time.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The many disciples only realised then that Gu Changge was on a whole
                other level compared to them now. He could no longer be treated as any other disciples of Immortal
                Academy. Unknowingly, there was now an invisible gap between them and Gu Changge.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s status in the Immortal Academy had reached the
                point where he was on equal footing with all the Elders, who were in the Sacred Emperor Realm. Over the
                next few days, Immortal Academy was overflowing with sky-piercing divine rainbows, filled with
                excitement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disciples had started training for the Trial.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The King with Six Crowns, Phoenix Lady, Yue Mingkong, Gu Xianer,
                Jiang Chuchu, Wang Zijin, Chosen Monk Jin Chan and others would all enter the Ancient Divine Tomb this
                time and compete for their own opportunities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge didn&#8217;t care when he heard the news. Just as the
                Elders thought, he would refuse even if they let him participate in the Trial.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Trial of this level was only a waste of time to him.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he was more interested in was the whereabouts of the remnants of
                Bandit Thirteen. Of course, it would be an entirely different matter if there were great treasures
                inside the Ancient Divine Tomb.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge and Yue Mingkong were in a palace when she asked out of
                curiosity, &#8220;Are you really not interested in the Godly Illusion Clan&#8217;s Ancient Divine
                Tomb?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From her memory, the Ancient Divine Tomb of the Godly Illusion Clan had a
                Divinity Crystal, which is equivalent to a Sacred Emperor Grade Dao Fruit. Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t
                usually let an opportunity like this slip.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He smiled when he heard her question. &#8220;For the time being, I am
                more interested in catching that remnants of Bandit Thirteen. I will drop by if something good appears
                in the tomb.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will help you keep an eye out.&#8221; Yue Mingkong
                nodded.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt relieved after hearing her reply. &#8220;I will leave it to
                you then,&#8221; he smiled.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She lightly shook her head. &#8220;It is only natural that I do
                this.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they weren&#8217;t officially married yet, she already considered
                herself his wife.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then left, and not long after that, Gu Changge received another
                news from a follower who respectfully reported,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, we have tracked down the mysterious military
                advisor running Bandit Thirteen. Our forces have been dispatched to stop them.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing that, Gu Changge stood up, his eyes narrowed.
                &#8220;Where?&#8221; he demanded.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are now in Northcreek Ancient City. The teleportation
                arrays around the area have been blocked by us, and everyone has been prevented from entering or leaving
                the city.&#8221; The follower then confidently added, &#8220;They won&#8217;t be able to run away from
                us even if they grew a pair of wings.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright. Well done.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded, waved his
                sleeves, and stepped away from this place. Afterwards, his mighty figure rose into the sky before he
                opened a Space Tunnel and hurried into the void.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terrifying momentum that resounded in the air shocked all the
                disciples and Elders of Immortal Academy, who watched this scene speechless. They soon started to guess
                amongst themselves where Gu Changge had gone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There must be news of the whereabouts of the remnants of
                Bandit Thirteen,&#8221; Wang Zijin stated.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu, who was beside her, glanced at her before she calmly
                replied, &#8220;You seem to know Gu Changge very well.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Instead of saying that I know him well,&#8221; Wang Zijin
                smiled, &#8220;it is more like I can guess what he is up to.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed to be provoking Jiang Chuchu with her dimpled smile when
                she teased, &#8220;You are realising now that I know him better than you do, huh?&#8221; </span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring her provocation, Jiang Chuchu turned around and
                left.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Xianer, who had just broke through to the Sacred Realm, dazedly
                stared at Gu Changge leading people away before she lowered her melancholic eyes.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northcreek Ancient City. This was a majestic and magnificent Ancient
                City with a population of several billion. Its circumference was nearly one hundred thousand kilometres
                like a beast crawling on the ground, whereas the city wall alone stretched like mountains without
                bounds.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, dark clouds covered the outside the four gates of
                Northcreek Ancient City. Among the clouds were colourful feathers on wings that flapped. Likewise,
                scales that flickered light when they bouncing off.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All kinds of powerful and terrifying beings were in the sky,
                completely blocking all directions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soaring through the clouds and riding the clouds, their bodies alone
                were like hills. The purple lightning and red rays of sunlight only made them look more
                intimidating.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, it was difficult for anyone to take a step out of or
                into the city. Anyone who put up a fight was killed right there and then.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only a while ago that someone had resisted out of
                dissatisfaction, but was slapped to death in the sky, and his body and soul disappeared on the spot.
                This left everyone else terror-stricken. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one knew why there was suddenly such an army up in the sky.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the City Lord of Northcreek was now outside the city wall,
                carefully wiping the cold sweat from his forehead without daring to utter a word. He could tell who the
                leader behind the terrifying army in front of him was. Thus, he needed to deal with them carefully, not
                daring to offend them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, those behind the City Lord were all famous figures in
                Northcreek Ancient City. They, too, were cautious as they huddled together. None dared to let their
                dissatisfaction show on their faces.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The huge ancient city was dead quiet now, as everyone was crippled by
                worry that they would receive a blow that would annihilate them all. After all, the force outside the
                city was so terrifyingly mighty it had covered the sky and blocked out the sun.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention an Ancient City, even a small Sect could be easily
                destroyed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, someone with the appearance resembling a Yaksha stood
                up among the red rays of light. As he opened his mouth and sneered, his voice echoed in the sky.
                &#8220;My Master has issued an order. Anyone who dares to shelter remnants of Bandit Thirteen will be
                regarded as enemies, and you will have to face the consequences of your actions.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it! Bandit Thirteen!&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How dare those accursed bandits drag us down with
                them!&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many only understood what was going on after they heard this
                person&#8217;s words. [It’s all because of Bandit Thirteen]!</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Upper Realm had been in an uproar because of Gu Changge&#8217;s
                hunt of Bandit Thirteen. Thus, they could easily guess who was the ‘Master&#8217; this Yaksha looking
                person was talking about.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many smiled wryly. There was no one other than Gu Changge who was so
                powerful in the Upper Realm. He had even dispatched such a terrifying force in order to hunt down and
                kill a single person.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also started to relax more after finding out this mighty force’s
                intentions. Surely it had nothing to do with them common folks if Gu Changge was only here to catch the
                bandits. Since they weren&#8217;t hiding the bandit, they had nothing to worry about. Still, they hoped
                they wouldn&#8217;t be harmed for something that had nothing to do with them.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relieved, the City Lord of Northcreek reassured the people,
                &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, everyone. Since remnants of Bandit Thirteen have appeared in Northcreek
                Ancient City, I will cooperate with you to search them out and ease Young Master Changge&#8217;s
                worries.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City Lord also despised Bandit Thirteen.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of all the places those rotten bandits could go, he just had to come
                to Northcreek Ancient City. What a jinx!] </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing the City Lord&#8217;s words, the important figures behind him
                also started to voice out about how they had no intention to cover for Bandit Thirteen. &#8220;I would
                have sent people to search everywhere if I had known that such trash was in this city. That way, I
                wouldn&#8217;t have bothered Young Master Changge with dispatching such a large force to to deal with
                them. If someone is protecting the remnant of Bandit Thirteen, we will definitely capture them and kill
                them without mercy.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many youths were shocked after hearing this. They couldn&#8217;t even
                see these important people on a normal day. But today, they had all appeared, and even made promises
                because Gu Changge wanted to search for the remnants of Bandit Thirteen.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, the force sent over to this city was so formidable no one
                would have imagined they would one day witness this.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing how sensible the leaders were, the Yaksha-like person showed a faint
                smile and hummed, &#8220;Now that we have heard the words of the City Lord of Northcreek, I can assure
                everyone that we are not unreasonable people. Our Master ordered me to come here only to catch the
                remnants of Bandit Thirteen. We hope not to cause trouble for everyone in Northcreek Ancient
                City.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City Lord of Northcreek firmly stated again, &#8220;Please,
                don&#8217;t worry. We will cooperate with the investigation as best we can. We won&#8217;t let go of
                anyone who is suspicious.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwards, the imposing army descended Northcreek Ancient City and
                began to search through every building. The entire ancient city was in a commotion as everyone grew
                anxious, for fear that someone they knew was hiding the remnants of Bandit Thirteen.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in Raindrop Pavilion at Nephrite Breeze Pavilion.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a brothel in Northcreek Ancient City. It was usually a lively
                place overflowing with beautiful young women, along the fragrance of makeup and powder. However, it was
                exceptionally quiet today.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a private room on the inside of the building, a middle-aged man
                with a pale complexion couldn&#8217;t help coughing up blood as he sat in a wheelchair. He had a black
                cloth over his eyes. Other than that, his lower limbs were useless, as he had lost his
                mobility.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is no ordinary physical injury. It would be difficult to heal
                even with Sacred Herbs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like his eyes, this was the repercussion from peeking into too
                many of Heavenly Secrets. It would be difficult to heal in his lifetime. Behind the middle-aged man, a
                young man with a sad expression couldn&#8217;t help but lament, &#8220;Master, is there nothing we can
                do other than let fate take us?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had been living in hiding these days. Not a second had passed
                where they didn&#8217;t fear for their lives. They had to be on their toes and live like street rats in
                the dark. This kind of life made him despair. He didn&#8217;t understand why his Master, who could
                predict the future with great accuracy, would be hunted down one day.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no longer a place for them in the enormous Upper
                Realm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words must have agitated the middle-aged man so much he coughed
                up blood again. He only lightly shook his head. It was as though he had expected this to
                happen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think Gu Changge would get to us so soon,&#8221; the
                older man sighed in a calm voice. &#8220;I thought we could hide for a few more days. All of this is my
                fault. None of this would have happened if it wasn&#8217;t for my greed.”</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Leave me, child. Take Lian&#8217;er with you. I am the one Gu
                Changge is after. This has nothing to do with you and Lian&#8217;er.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then took out 2 items from his torso. &#8220;This is a secret
                treasure I refined back then. After the two of you use it, hide in the void and leave quietly. No one
                will be able to notice your traces. I want you to take the opportunity to escape to the Demon World,
                find a man named Jun Bufan, and give him this kit.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were a very ordinary kit and a very ordinary jade talisman that
                had nothing unusual about it. No one would notice even if they were thrown on the ground.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, the middle-aged man was handing over these two items to
                them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the young man was a woman with a graceful figure. With her
                skin as white as snow, hair as dark as coal, she had an enchanting appearance. Despite the unwilling
                look on her face, she chose not to say anything.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, the young man&#8217;s eyes started to turn red, and he
                looked as though his heart was breaking. It was as though he would start crying anytime now. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What will you do if we leave, Master? You are gravely injured now. You
                will die once you are caught by Gu Changge if we leave.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My disciple,&#8221; the middle-aged man let out a relieved
                smile. Still, his words were firm, not giving any room for doubt. &#8220;You have already learned what
                you should from me. You will live well even without me. There is no need for you to sacrifice your life
                here because of me.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then turned to the exquisite woman, and his voice was now laced
                with guilt. &#8220;Lian&#8217;er, I have wronged you and your mother, but you have to understand that I
                had no other choice. I stayed away for so many years not because I didn&#8217;t want to see you. I
                didn&#8217;t want to get you involved in all this mess. It must have been difficult for you, having to
                build Nephrite Breeze Pavilion by yourself from the ground up.&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though his eyes could no longer see, he knew that his daughter
                was looking at him. This reassured the middle-aged man somehow.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who would have thought that the Master behind the well-known
                assassin&#8217;s guild, ‘Nephrite Breeze Pavilion’ would be the daughter of the Demon Master, Bai
                Kun?</span></p>

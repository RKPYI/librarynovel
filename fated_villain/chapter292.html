<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, more people arrived at the scene from different directions. The incident was no longer as simple as it was upon Gu Changge&#8217;s appearance. Therefore, those that were uninterested earlier, too, hurried over, not wanting to miss the fantastic show.</span><span id="more-28055"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Who in the world has so much courage to upset Young Master Changge? They must either be sick of life or sick in the head to seek death.] At once, the faces of the audience were filled with sarcasm and mockery, staring at the trembling Wang Xiao and Old Xuan, as though they were watching a show. In the people&#8217;s eyes, there was unconcealable condescension, as if they were looking at a pair of monkeys.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The woman seems to be Young Master Changge&#8217;s servant. As such, they didn&#8217;t just mistake somebody else, but they also severely injured her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Things are going to get interesting. Though, it&#8217;s unexpected that the two look so similar. It is as though they were shaped from the same mould, and none would doubt them even if they claim to be twins.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Astonished, many young prodigies summarised the incident earlier in precision. Even passersby could already tell what exactly was happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In other words, Wang Xiao, you mistook another woman as Junior Sister Ji, and said some offensive words to her. When conflict broke out, you called for Old Xuan to severely injure her. Is that it?&#8221; Listening to the chatter of the nearby cultivators, Chu Hao furrowed his brows as he got the gist of the incident. Thereupon, his eyes grew sterner as he felt distressed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Settling the matter today would not be easy, since the victim was no ordinary woman. She was Gu Changge&#8217;s servant, and that position alone was enough to instil fear into the hearts of many young prodigies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, in the vast Upper Realm, countless prodigal damsels craved to be Gu Changge&#8217;s servant, only to find themselves unqualified. For a woman to become Gu Changge&#8217;s servant, she must be truly special compared to the rest or somehow draw Gu Changge&#8217;s adoration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Xiao&#8217;s family, the Hidden Wang Family, would not dare to upset Gu Changge, let alone Wang Xiao was just a direct descendant of the main branch of the Wang Family. and what he was facing was pretty much self-inflicted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are we going to do, Old Xuan? I&#8217;m finished, aren&#8217;t I….&#8221; Wang Xiao disregarded Chu Hao&#8217;s question. In that instant, his face turned ever so pale. His voice was shaking, and his hands were shivering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge only passed by without taking a glance at him, his daunting aura was much more terrifying than that of the Wang Family&#8217;s Ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems we&#8217;re out of luck today…&#8221; Old Xuan&#8217;s voice was also full of bitterness and regret.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, at that moment, it wasn&#8217;t just Wang Xiao and Old Xuan, who felt uneasy knowing their doom was approaching, but Su Qingge as well, especially after sensing the uncanniness in the way Gu Changge looked at her. She wasn&#8217;t sure whether Gu Changge could tell that she and Ji Qingxuan had switched identities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if he figured it out but didn&#8217;t bother to expose her, that would only mean Gu Changge&#8217;s disappointment for her reached its limit, given how she lied to him again and again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For quite a while, Su Qingge felt troubled and anxious, wondering what she should do if Ji Qingxuan were to take her place as Gu Changge&#8217;s servant forever. To confess, or to beg for Gu Changge&#8217;s forgiveness? Nonetheless, prior to this, Gu Changge had warned her not to lie to him ever again, which meant that he wished not to see her hiding any secrets from him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ji Qingxuan must have her own plan, which is probably to replace you since she&#8217;ll never be able to get close to Gu Changge and become his right hand by herself. What a crafty little sister you have.] The other soul in Su Qingge fascinatedly stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Su Qingge ignored the voice. She wasn&#8217;t sure whether the decision to switch identities with Ji Qingxuan was right or wrong, as she couldn&#8217;t foresee the consequences it would bring.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let&#8217;s hope Young Master doesn&#8217;t notice.] Su Qingge thought in her heart, [May the matter steer away from the worst outcome.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Gu Changge walked to the ruins of the collapsed pavilion. His face was calm, without a wrinkle on it, so there was no telling how he felt. Yet, his followers behind him couldn&#8217;t help but silently tremble in fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, the entire region grew silent as even the audience, who were in discussion, sensed that the atmosphere was odd. Startled, they hastily shut their mouths, afraid that they would upset Gu Changge. Although Gu Changge was a compassionate man according to the rumours, that was only when he wasn&#8217;t provoked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tell me what happened.&#8221; Then, Gu Changge&#8217;s bland voice sounded, without a raise in intensity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, for some reason, many felt a chill up their spines, overwhelmed by a chilly sensation. Although Gu Changge, without asking much, simply requested the details of the incident, many were aware that he was angered by the matter as a horrifying aura that resembled a raging thunderstorm began to surge nearby.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Wang Xiao&#8217;s legs turned jelly, he almost fell to the ground. If the annoyed Chu Hao did not hold him up, he would have dropped to his knees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Young Master Changge. This is what happened…&#8221; Accordingly, a cultivator that witnessed the entire incident respectfully replied Gu Changge, explaining the matter without omitting the slightest details, including how the pompous Wang Xiao persisted to be aggressive despite the fact that the woman in white already claimed to be Gu Changge&#8217;s servant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the cultivator continued clarifying. Even after the woman in white told Wang Xiao that he got the wrong person, he didn&#8217;t seem to care, after which he ordered his guardian to critically injure the woman in white.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having heard all that, Gu Changge remained wordless while his face remained serene, as if he wasn&#8217;t bothered by the story. His feet didn&#8217;t stop walking either as he was moving towards the ruins.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, the crowd witnessed how the woman in white was fatally injured by the Sword Qi, and how she was sent crashing into pavilions, demolishing the buildings. However, after some time, the woman in white had yet to reappear. Many guessed that her injuries were graver than expected, or that she was dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arriving at the possibility of her death, the crowd grew restless as there was no telling whether tiny Vermilion Bird Empire could take on Gu Changge&#8217;s scorching fury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master…&#8221; Then, as the crowd was making their guesses, they saw a woman covered in blood limping her way out of the ruins with her beauty intact. Though, her white garment was stained by blood, and she was clearly feeble with how strenuous it was for her to walk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you alright?&#8221; Gu Changge looked at her, ignoring the blood on her clothes, as he gently carried her. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you so careless?&#8221; There was nothing but genuine worry and compassion in his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am fine, Young Master. I am sorry for worrying you.&#8221; Subtly shaking her head, Ji Qingxuan responded with her tranquil voice, while adrenaline was rushing throughout her body. She won the bet. The man that lifted her up was the unrivalled young prodigy who held the greatest and most terrifying influence in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before this, she wouldn&#8217;t have the chance to approach Gu Changge, let alone quietly laying in his embrace as she was now. Ever since she was a child, this was her first time being so close to a man, but she felt not a hint of discomfort, wishing the moment could go on forever. She was nervous and insecure, fearing that Gu Changge might see through her, but she quickly regained her composure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge, as if he was concerned about her, was focused on checking on her injuries without thinking much. As such, envy surged in Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s heart. Ever since she was born, it was the first time anyone feigned such sympathy for her. Though, she was aware that Gu Changge was treating her as her sister.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Qingge is so lucky…] Despite bearing that in mind, Ji Qingxuan did not reveal any strange expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master, are my injuries very bad?&#8221; She softly asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are pretty bad. All of your organs have been crushed.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded and stated with his usual, serene voice. &#8220;But don&#8217;t worry, it is not fatal.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm…&#8221; Ji Qingxuan nodded as she silently lay in his arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Su Qingge couldn&#8217;t help but feel sour. Although she was aware that the woman in Gu Changge&#8217;s arms was her sister, and their decision to switch identities was consensual, she couldn&#8217;t help but be overtaken by her emotions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tell me, how do you two wish to die?&#8221; Then, Gu Changge finally turned to the completely white face, Wang Xiao and Old Xuan. Without beating around the bush, he directly asked how they wished to die.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon such an aggressive, indifferent attitude, Ji Qingxuan felt like she was suffocating. [So, this is the feeling when one has power and influence. The thing I had been seeking. If I had power and influence, would mother be locked up like this? If I had power and influence, would I be a pawn of marriage? Would Wang Xiao and Old Xuan have mistreated me? Daring to harm me and making light of my life? In the end, all that matters is power and influence.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, mercy please! I am to blame! I must have been blind to have mistaken this lady as my Junior Sister. I didn&#8217;t do it on purpose. Please, Young Master Changge, show some generosity and forgive me this time! I didn&#8217;t mean to do what I did. As you have seen, Young Master Changge, this lady looked exactly the same as Junior Sister Ji. I did not know!&#8221; Hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s words, Wang Xiao was shocked out of his mind. As his face paled, he hastily knelt down and begged for mercy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I asked how you wish to die, not what your excuses are.&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s voice was calm, but somewhat chilling. &#8220;What don&#8217;t you understand about it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge…&#8221; Wang Xiao was absolutely dumbfounded. His entire body was soaked in cold sweat, while his soul and voice were violently trembling. He could sense that Gu Changge clearlywanted him dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Xiao had always been the one to bully others, never expecting to be bullied one day. He simply injured Gu Changge&#8217;s servant, only to be bitten back by Gu Changge himself. As such, his heart was filled with tremendous frustration and reluctance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? Do you want me to do it myself?&#8221; Gu Changge faintly asked with a freezing expression. To him, Wang Xiao, in spite of his identity, was nothing but a puny ant he could kill with a step of a foot anytime he wished.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge! Mercy, please! I won&#8217;t do it again! I&#8217;ll apologise to the lady and I&#8217;ll compensate her!&#8221; Along his fear-filled pleading, Wang Xiao immediately dropped to his knees out of fear for death, knowing the force behind him wouldn&#8217;t be able to subdue Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, he turned to Ji Qingxuan and said with a shivering voice, &#8220;Miss, I was blind earlier and mistook you for someone else. Please sympathise with me and forgive me!&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At such a moment, his pride and dignity were by no means more important than his life itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, the crowd was no less afraid than Wang Xiao. None dared to speak up and interrupt the exchange. At the end of the day, Wang Xiao did this unto himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Ji Qingxuan gazed at Wang Xiao with her icy eyes, but there was nothing but joy in her heart. After all, seeing the person she resented the most being so pathetic, and humiliated in front of her was something she never dared to dream of.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Qingge, how do you wish to deal with him?&#8221; Accordingly, Gu Changge turned to Ji Qingxuan and asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Ji Qingxuan was somewhat taken aback before softly answering, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it your way…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge nodded. &#8220;Very well. Then I shall murder him and bring you justice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm…&#8221; Ji Qingxuan&#8217;s heart skipped a beat. Although Gu Changge&#8217;s words were out of concern for her, she thought of something deeper. [If he were to discover that I switched identities with Su Qingge, the consequences would be unfathomable. This man was simply too frightening.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, Wang Xiao&#8217;s face drastically changed. His soul and body was shivering. Fighting for his chance at survival, he yelled. &#8220;It&#8217;s Old Xuan! Old Xuan was the one who injured her! I&#8217;m not even her opponent…&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, he threw everything under the bus for the sake of surviving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised by Wang Xiao&#8217;s unexpected shifting of blame, Old Xuan was stunned. Disappointment and helplessness gushed in her heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Elderest Senior Brother Chu Hao, please save me…&#8221; Nonetheless, Wang Xiao didn&#8217;t care about Old Xuan as he speedily turned to Chu Hao with his pleading eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Wang Xiao was aware, Chu Hao possessed formidable strength and was given a powerful artifact by Supreme Cave Heaven. Hence, judging by his capabilities, he would be able to save him. Besides, Chu Hao gained the respect of the entire Supreme Cave Heaven, so even if he were to go up against Gu Changge, Supreme Cave Heaven would still stand with him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wang Xiao…&#8221; Visibly conflicted, Chu Hao tensed his brows even tighter. He was dragged into the matter out of nowhere, but if something were to happen to Wang Xiao, he would have to take on the responsibility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, he was the Eldest Senior Brother, so if he decided to ignore Wang Xiao after how the latter begged him for help right in the public eye, he would be drawing the hatred of the Hidden Wang Family, a threat Vermilion Bird Empire couldn&#8217;t afford to offend. Yet, at the same time, he didn&#8217;t want to offend Gu Changge as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, I shall take responsibility for my actions as I was the one who harmed her. This old one is willing to pay for what I have done unto the young lady, as a gesture of sincerity.” Right when Chu Hao was contemplating, Old Xuan advanced and cut in. No matter what happened, there must be an explanation to the matter. And as he was Wang Xiao&#8217;s guardian, he was obliged to protect Wang Xiao when he was in trouble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, a dense aura of the Sacred Lord Realm surged around Old Xuan&#8217;s arms. Immediately, two fogs of bloody mists erupted and his arms exploded. He chose to sacrifice both of his arms to express his remorse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crowd was left stupefied. Someone in the Peak Sacred Lord Realm, who was half a step away from entering the Sacred King Realm was driven by Gu Changge into sacrificing both his arms to show his sincerity. As a matter of fact, to every faction, those in the Peak Sacred Lord Realm were regarded as the indispensable pillars of their respective factions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master…&#8221; Ji Qingxuan was somewhat dazed. She wanted Wang Xiao to pay for his actions, but she didn&#8217;t expect his guardian to be involved as well. Essentially, to the Hidden Wang Family, cultivators in the Peak Sacred Lord Realm were in no way less important than Wang Xiao. And Wang Xiao having such a dedicated guardian was all thanks to his influential uncle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is far from enough.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, what left Ji Qingxuan even more dumbfounded was how upon the gesture of the Peak Sacred Lord Realm expert, not only did Gu Changge seem unaffected, but he even thought that to be insufficient. Ji Qingxuan felt like she had underestimated Gu Changge&#8217;s ruthlessness, yet it was his ruthlessness that enchanted and intoxicated her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge…&#8221; Hearing that, Old Xuan grew frustrated as he clenched his teeth. He then decided to destroy his Source. Along with a dense aura, an alarming shockwave came from his Dantian. Right away, as if Old Xuan&#8217;s body was struck by lightning, his face turned bleach while blood flowed down the corner of his lips. Thereupon, the frightening might of Peak Sacred Lord Realm instantaneously waned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, many visibly grew even more shocked as their hearts shivered upon witnessing the terrorizing aggression of Gu Changge. There was no one other than Gu Changge among the younger generation that could force an expert in the Peak Sacred Lord Realm to destroy their own Source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Old Xuan destroyed his Source, Gu Changge finally nodded without saying a word.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Old Xuan heaved a sigh of relief, not daring to bear any disdain towards Gu Changge. In that instant, even if Gu Changge suddenly decided to kill him, no one would come to his rescue, and he believed that a youth like Gu Changge must have certain methods to subdue him, and the cultivation level of Peak Sacred Lord Realm was hardly significant to the young man.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Old Xuan still remembered rumours about how Gu Changge used his Sacred Emperor Grade Weapon in the Eternal Overcast Battlefield to fight against the Successor of Demonic Arts and eventually driving him away. It had been so long since the event stated in the rumour, and Gu Changge&#8217;s strength would only grow since then.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senior Chu Hao, please save me! I don&#8217;t want to die…&#8221; Seeing how his guardian no longer cared about him after sacrificing his Source, Wang Xiao panicked. His face turned completely white out of fear. He turned to Chu Hao as if he was his final resort.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uhh…&#8221; Chu Hao felt immensely helpless and conflicted. At this point, there was no way he could pull himself out of the matter as that would only offend both parties, and for that, he was deeply disturbed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;About this, Young Master Changge, could you perhaps forgive Wang Xiao once for my sake? I am the Eldest Senior Disciple of Supreme Cave Heaven, and also the Third Prince of Vermilion Bird Empire.&#8221; With that, Chu Hao finally stepped up in front of Wang Xiao and defended him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he stood out, major turmoil broke out as the nearby cultivators from the Vermilion Bird Empire recognised him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Third Prince of Vermilion Bird Empire, who left numberless legends in the empire, was the role model of the younger generation, and those who were unaware of Chu Hao&#8217;s return were stunned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chu Hao, you&#8217;re finally back…&#8221; In a pavilion nearby, an elegant, gentle woman was focused on the exchange. She was surprised by Chu Hao&#8217;s revelation, unspeakable joy and yearning gushed in her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, the Fortuitous One finally cracked?] Gu Changge&#8217;s heart slightly raised in temp as he had been waiting for this moment. Though, he retained his coldness and blandly asked, &#8220;Are you asking to protect him, and oppose me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please do not misunderstand, Young Master Changge. I have no intention of opposing you. But I, as Wang Xiao&#8217;s Eldest Senior Brother, I cannot simply leave him troubled by the situation he is now under,&#8221; Chu Hao solemnly stated, seemingly somewhat helpless as he had to bring up the fact that he was from Supreme Cave Heaven.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge&#8217;s background was unparalleled, Supreme Cave Heaven, the force behind Chu Hao, was not to be taken lightly. In the future, it was highly possible that Chu Hao would succeed the position as the Sect Master of Supreme Cave Heaven.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chu Hao was calculating the trade off and believed rescuing Wang Xiao was worth it. Even though it might anger Gu Changge, the Immortal Gu Family wouldn&#8217;t get back at Vermilion Bird Empire over such a trivial matter. However, that could not be said to be the same for the Hidden Wang Family. After all, the disparity of power between the two forces was simply too great.</span></p>

          in the Immortal Academy. Why don&#8217;t I bring you around? I&#8217;m
          sure you, as a recent visitor, aren&#8217;t quite familiar with the
          different regions.&#8221; At that moment, Xi Yao asked with a smile.
          Her aura was filled with nobleness and generosity, fitting her image
          perfectly.</span

          changed, shining towards the mountain. The lakes were as clear as
          crystal while the mountains were emerald. Somewhere far away was
          filled with Chaos Energy and the energy of nature, as if it was the
          realm of gods.</span

          illuminating the sky, a terrifying bloody aura spread the clouds
          apart, as if it could pierce through the sky. Those aura was an
          occurrence caused by the cultivation of young prodigies and
          monstrosities of Immortal Academy.</span

          fragrance wafted into their noses, giving off a refreshing sensation
          as if it was the water flowing from the glaciers of the Nine Realms,
          invigorating yet enthralling.</span

          wondering why he would ask such a question. Nonetheless, she quickly
          understood Gu Changge&#8217;s unspoken message, after which she grew
          visibly fascinated, realising that he was teasing her. [He must be
          saying that he&#8217;s trying to keep himself composed, and the reason
          he kept quiet was because he was controlling his urges, but why? Is it
          because I&#8217;m standing too close to him?]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Truth be told, it was the first time Xi Yao stood so close to a man
          in six thousand years. Even her fiance, who was poisoned by her, was
          never as close. Nevertheless, even she couldn&#8217;t fathom what it
          was that drew her to offer accompanying Gu Changge to his
          destination.</span

          successfully suppressed. [Is he asking me to keep a distance? In other
          words, he&#8217;s saying that I&#8217;m attractive to him. What an
          unorthodox excuse!]

          emotion surged in her eyes. She couldn&#8217;t quite grasp what Gu
          Changge was implying. However, after taking a few assiduous glimpse at
          him, she nodded an answered, and that was when she realised her
          response wasn&#8217;t up to her, but she was willingly being
          manipulated by Gu Changge.</span

          was also the reason she visited Immortal Academy to look for her
          Master to shed some light for her. Nonetheless, after hearing Gu

          up in his mind, though he retained his composure, after which he
          casually asked, &#8220;I assume the five Overlords have been a thorn
          in the flesh, yes? After all, the legacies of the Demon World are
          still standing today. Among all of the Six Demon Overlords, only the
          whereabouts of the Lunar Demon Overlord is known, while the other five
          remain nowhere to be seen. I wonder if the forces they left behind are
          going through some kind of reawakening.&#8221;</span

          her brows. &#8220;It&#8217;s fair to think that they are the cause of
          these disturbances. Though, almost all of the Successors of those five

          he wouldn&#8217;t be much of an issue. If Gu Changge could defeat the

          in heaven. Of course, there were also countless mythical beasts,
          sacred herbs, and divine springs.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After instructing Su Qingge and his other followers to pick a place
          to stay, he swiftly left as he sensed the aura of his scapegoat, Ying
          Shuang, who actually came to Immortal Academy. Back then, he let Ying
          Shuang go to use him as bait to draw out the Organisation of Forbidden
          Demonic Arts.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t quite knowledgeable about the
          organisation, he figured he could seize it for his use, but if the
          organisation turned out useless, there was no need for it to exist as
          well. Essentially, such an organisation could be impactful on his next
          plans.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In a flash, Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival at Immortal Academy was spread
          across the world. Young prodigies who heard about it felt rather
          complicated. As of now, any young cultivator that was oblivious to Gu
          Changge&#8217;s existence would surely be ridiculed, which showed how
          much the younger generation respected him. Even the rest of the Ten
          Great Ranked Disciples dared not to belittle him.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, in a divine glow-filled manor that was covered in purple
          steam, there was a young man with a crevice on his forehead donning a
          purple robe. With his hands resting behind his back, he softly said,
          &#8220;Oh, dear Junior, I await your arrival at Immortal Academy. In
          my previous life, I prayed to the gods everyday, yet that was not
          sufficient for you to even take a glimpse at me.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Once upon a time, you would never stop pursuing the Great Dao,
          and once upon a time, I would never stop chasing after you. If this is
          my reincarnation, my destiny, then only one of us can live on. It
          would be your greatest regret for not turning around for me. Now, I
          wonder which one is stronger, your Celestial Bone, or my Chaos Dao
          Bone!&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although his tone was gentle, it was filled with reluctance and
          hatred. The purplish energy that was whirling around his body, like
          dense Chaos Energy, resembled an ancient universe. An astral
          projection was rotating along the flow time on his robe, emitting
          thunderous grumble and a frightening aura.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Whoosh!* Suddenly, the crevice on his forehead let out a blinding
          light as he opened his third eye, turning everything in his sight
          ambiguous, followed by a terrifying vision. The Foreseeing Eye was of
          utmost terror. The instant he revealed his third eye, purple Chaos
          Energy swirled and enigmatic traces of time flickered as torn up
          pictures occurred before him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was a mysteriously dim underground prison, unreal and vague.
          Nonetheless, for some reason, his heart trembled at the sight.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the gloomy, damp underground prison cell, a dashing woman in green
          was covered in scars as her limbs were chained up onto the wall; her
          expression was full of persistence, coldness, determination, and
          resentment.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In front of him, a young man with no expression was holding a dagger,
          filling the stone bowl in his hand with blood before chugging it down
          right before the woman in green.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What a bland taste for blood.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The man in purple could barely hear such a sentence.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Immediately, his vision turned dark. As if his mind was about to blow
          up, the crevice on his forehead was tearing apart, revealing traces of
          blood; his face blanched as his Source was damaged. Essentially, using
          the Foreseeing Eye to peek into the future was absolutely difficult
          given his current strength. Regardless, he managed to take a brief
          glance at the gruesome interaction.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Impossible.&#8221; The man in purple was dumbfounded,
          clenching his fists in disbelief as he wondered why he saw the
          fragmented vision in the future. After witnessing the love of his
          life, the woman who pursued the Great Dao all her life, facing such a
          tragic ending, he couldn&#8217;t believe what he just saw.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, he had been waiting forever for this life. He was born
          with wisdom and blessed with the Chaos Dao Bone; he was the Successor
          of a powerful force whose strength was unparalleled. After all, the
          reason he sealed himself for so long was solely to await her
          reincarnation.</span

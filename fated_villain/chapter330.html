          at this point, Gu Xianer may not believe your words. She trusts Gu

          how could Zhi Yang let Gu Xianer stayed by Gu Changge&#8217;s side for
          a moment longer. He felt tormented and incomparably worried. He was
          afraid that the sliver of the broken future he had glimpsed would
          become reality and be displayed bloodily in front of him. Although Gu
          Xianer did not care about him once, her heart was not distracted, and
          she only cared about pursuit of the Great Dao, he did not mind.</span

          was the disciple with the most outstanding Talents in the Borderless
          Sect since ancient times. With her great Talents, there was even a
          possibility that she would reach an Immortal Palace and look over all

          Unlike today, the Celestial Realm was indistinct and hard to find,
          where even the Immortals have become legendary existences. At that
          time, the Immortals often appeared in the mortal world, visiting
          friends and discussing the ways of the Great Dao and the Immortal
          Palaces high above, ruling all.</span

          collapse and turn that era into dust, Zhi Yang knew that he would
          never have the qualifications to stand by his Junior Sister’s side. He
          would not be able to do anything for her, let alone dream of standing
          by her side. After all, Dao Xian was a person destined to become an
          Immortal.</span

          eyes, apart from the Great Dao, could not accommodate anyone. But now,
          he was at ease, no longer persistent on the matter. Because he
          realised that Dao Xian had always been like that, it was how she was
          and that was the real her.</span

          become an Immortal, and she would not be disturbed by external
          objects. She would not stop for anyone, let alone for someone who just
          wanted to take glances at her. Nonetheless, that was the Junior Sister
          that he had long admired.</span

          Brother? As long as we can make Junior Sister recover the memories of
          her past life, then she will definitely believe us. I must save her
          from Gu Changge&#8217;s evil clutches!&#8221; Subsequently, Sky King
          Zhi Yang&#8217;s eyes shone a divine light as he spoke in a deep
          voice, that he had a feeling that this matter was not as dire as it
          seemed, and that the possibility of there being no hope could be
          wrong.</span

          and force her to drink the water from the Lake of
          Reincarnation?&#8221; Qin Wuya asked with a frown. Other than this
          solution, he could not think of any other solution that Sky King Zhi
          Yang could have. But, if Gu Xianer chooses to resist, the more
          suspicious they would be to her. Likewise, the harder it would be for
          them to clear their names. [Haa… even so, it still has to be done,
          huh?]</span

          Junior Sister still does not believe us, what other choice do we have?
          We are doing this for her own good. I believe she will forgive us when
          the time comes. We have to cut off all means of retreat and just go
          for it. Otherwise, we will never see any hope of the situation turning
          around for the better&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang said, with a smear of
          gloom and lonely hostility on his face.</span

          nodded. &#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s do as you say. I&#8217;ll take
          the initiative to reveal my whereabouts and lure her here. You take
          care to set up the concealment array here. It&#8217;s best not to let
          Gu Changge discover any clues.&#8221; After saying that, he moved and
          became a divine rainbow, leaving the area and heading outside the

          back, his purple robe fluttering, his face cold and sullen. Compared
          to before, it was like he was suddenly a new person. Afterwards, he

          thick mist floating about, creating a foggy atmosphere and no border
          in sight. Many insects and beasts were prowling about, and the
          branches of the trees reached so high that they covered the sky,

          area one by one, it was better because it was meticulous, and almost
          no stone would be unturned.</span

          >&#8220;Hmm? This is?&#8221; Suddenly, Gu Xianer frowned, her gaze
          looking up, and noticed a faint aura fluctuating from what was
          supposed to be empty space. Although it was very stealthy, it could
          not be concealed from her powerful perception.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, Gu Xianer was now on the verge of breaking through to the
          Quasi-Sacred Realm.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her primordial spirit was also exceptionally powerful. After all,
          since she ate a variety of heavenly treasures that boosts one&#8217;s
          divine senses during her childhood, and had a variety of secret
          cultivation methods that she had been practising, which also improves
          one’s divine sense. Thus, her primordial spirit was much more powerful
          than her peers.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At this time, its power allowed her to immediately sense something
          was there, at that empty space, and the unusual aura emitting from
          that location.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Could there be someone else here?] Having that thought, Gu Xianer’s
          figure flickered, quietly concealing her breath as she rushed toward
          the direction of the aura fluctuation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, she noticed a hidden plain. There, a man with an ordinary face
          and a medium build was sitting. He was emitting a divine glow as runes
          were flickering around his body, creating divine lights of various
          colours. He was obviously suffering from heavy injuries and currently
          healing.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;This person is… that’s who Sky King Zhi Yang calls ‘Eldest
          Senior Brother’. He’s the mysterious man who came out from the
          Wondrous Stone.&#8221; Gu Xianer quickly recognized this person and
          her eyes narrowed. She subconsciously brandished a talisman from her
          sleeves. She was aware of the recent rumours, that it was indeed this
          person in front of her, that went to assassinate Gu Changge. However,
          he ended up blowing up an ancient treasure, and used that opportunity
          to flee.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          be in this place, healing.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[It seemed that in that battle against Gu Changge, he got badly
          injured.] Thinking of this, Gu Xianer didn’t want to inadvertently
          alert the enemy, so she carefully concealed her presence.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was pondering, [Sky King Zhi Yang and him definitely have some
          kind of inseparable relationship. As long as I quietly followed behind
          him, wouldn’t I be able to find where Sky King Zhi Yang is
          hiding?]</span

          >And just as Gu Xian&#8217;er pondered, the figure in front of her
          suddenly opened his eyes, and a long dragon made of Qi and blood
          erupted, emitting a rumbling thunder&#8230;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He frowned and slowly got up, muttering under his breath. &#8220;This
          injury will take some time to heal. Gu Changge is truly the real
          Successor of Demonic Arts… Do you really think that if you can deceive
          the world, you can deceive me? You took Qing Xiaoyi away and ended up
          framing Zhi Yang. Now, you even plan to get someone else to do your
          dirty work. What a ruthless man If we don&#8217;t deal with him, he
          will truly be a terrifying scourge in the world.&#8221;

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Qin Wuya&#8217;s brow was furrowed and his face was solemn, and he
          couldn&#8217;t help but whisper, &#8220;The most urgent task is to
          rendezvous with Zhi Yang and discuss with him how to solve this
          problem. Junior Sister Dao Xian is also really too trusting of him,
          simply not knowing of Gu Changge&#8217;s malicious intentions. The
          future is not likely to suffer under Gu Changge&#8217;s poisonous
          hands&#8230;&#8221; After saying that, his figure swept towards the
          front, and in a flash, had disappeared.</span

          real Successor of Demonic Arts?&#8221; However, Gu Xian&#8217;er, who
          was hiding behind, was frozen in place at this moment, stunned, her
          expression filled with disbelief, not expecting to hear such words.
          She only felt her head buzzing, like she had been hit by a yellow
          bell, and it became blank.</span

          just questioned reality. [Gu Changge is the real Successor of Demonic
          Arts? The culprit behind everything? The most terrifying scourge in
          the world? I-I don’t believe this…]</span

          the right moment, that means he would have to know that I would be
          here. Likewise, he must have known I was just standing here, listening
          to him. But, how? Also, shouldn&#8217;t he be hiding after noticing
          I’m here? Isn’t he afraid that I would contact Gu Changge and go after
          him? Or, was this all just a coincidence? Or was&#8230; everything Qin

          of Demonic Arts, how could there be no trace of it at all? If he is
          the Successor of Demonic Arts, how could he be repeatedly injured
          several times by the Successor of Demonic Arts. Qin Wuya must have
          misunderstood something. He must have deliberately said this, knowing

          uneasy. She didn&#8217;t know why she was so disappointed, worried,
          and even had a sense of fear that seemed to appear out of nowhere. She
          even didn&#8217;t notice that her face was actually a little pale. At

          place and prevent anyone from leaving the area. Nothing that breathes

      <h4>Chapter 239: What an amazing harvest, Gu Changge, just kill me</h4>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>The terrifying aura even suppressed the chaotic air.</p>
      <p>The space here made a cracking sound.</p>
      <p>
        After all, this was the real Great Dao treasure bottle, the divine light
        was surging as it was condensed with Dao, and it was falling and
        suppressing everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if the Reincarnation Seal glowed and tried to resist, it was also
        overwhelmed by the black light.
      </p>
      <p>"Ahh……"</p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang let out a scream, and the voice quickly disappeared and he
        gradually became lifeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Including the Reincarnation Seal of the Human Ancestor that became dim,
        and was shrouded in black light, the Immortal meaning was bright,
        showing a rare balance.
      </p>
      <p>This balance was quickly broken.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, this devouring process would not be simple, and it would even
        take time to slowly digest it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it was the accumulation of the Dao Fruit of Human Ancestor
        over the years. Even if the Great Dao treasure bottle could swallow it,
        it had to go through a process.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Gu Changge also heard the prompt sound from the system in
        his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moment he made his move, he had already used the Luck Plundering
        Card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Yang was beaten into this state, and it was a good time to
        plunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, the plunder is successful, and you have obtained all the Luck
        from the reincarnation of Jiang Yang, the Son of Luck and the
        reincarnation of the Human Ancestor, and obtained 8,000 Luck points and
        40,000 Destiny value."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, you successfully killed the reincarnation of Human Ancestor, the
        Son of Luck, and triggered the protocol of clear drop of Luck. Rewarding
        an extra treasure chest of Heaven."
      </p>
      <p>"Ding……"</p>
      <p>A series of system prompt sounds came.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge didn't care much about his Luck and Destiny.</p>
      <p>
        What he cared most about now was the extra treasure chest of Heaven he
        received after the Human Ancestor's death.
      </p>
      <p>Dao fruit? Reincarnation Seal? Or something else?</p>
      <p>"Do you want to open the Treasure Chest of Heaven?"</p>
      <p>"Open."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge didn't hesitate at all.</p>
      <p>
        A familiar golden treasure chest fell out, but this time the treasure
        chest had an extra purple halo compared to the other treasure chests.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It actually brought purple luck…" Gu Changge was a little surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that the Human Ancestor's Luck had indeed reached a relatively
        high level in the system.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>Soon, only Gu Changge could see that in front of him.</p>
      <p>
        A layer of golden light erupted, followed by a layer of mysterious
        lines, simple and atmospheric, flowing slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were three things floating up and down, shrouded in a dense layer
        of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ding, congratulations to the host for obtaining the Reincarnation Seal
        x1, the Purple Crown of Luck x1, and the Guidance Dao fruit x1."
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>Huh? Reincarnation Seal?</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
      <p>
        He remembered the Reincarnation Seal that he had condensed when he
        absorbed the reincarnation Dao platform left by the Heavenly Lord of
        Reincarnation in the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>This kind of thing was a life-saving item.</p>
      <p>
        That was to say, now he had another life, unless he encountered the same
        inheritor of demonic art as him, who also had the Great Dao treasure
        bottle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it was just a metaphor, this kind of thing was impossible.
      </p>
      <p>And as his mind moved.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge felt that a vague and mysterious mark disappear in his True
        Spirit and then slowly landed on it.
      </p>
      <p>"One more life, two Reincarnation Seals, and one more trump card."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge was quite satisfied.</p>
      <p>As for the Purple Crown of Luck, what was this?</p>
      <p>
        Afterward, when Gu Changge checked its introduction, his expression
        became somewhat inexplicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Purple Crown of Luck turned out to be a mysterious item of Luck,
        even if his Luck was black, it was not controlled by this side of
        Heaven, representing unpredictable and unknown.
      </p>
      <p>But he could still use it.</p>
      <p>
        When wearing the Purple Crown of Luck, he could have the Luck of the
        purple level.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as Gu Changge knew, Purple Luck was the highest level of Luck he
        knew so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there were requirements for wearing items, as well as
        intervals, and there were many restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a critical time, it might be a prop with an extraordinary effect.
      </p>
      <p>After Gu Changge accepted it and didn't care much.</p>
      <p>Finally, he looked at the Guidance Dao Fruit he received.</p>
      <p>
        Judging from the name, it was quite strange. The surface was covered
        with a strange and simple rune, which was deep and boundless.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that this is the talent of the Human Ancestor. The talent of
        Guiding is related to the soul. Using the method of Dao Fruit is
        actually an extension of this talent…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge understood the function of this Guidance Dao Fruit, and
        was a little surprised.
      </p>
      <p>Then he chose to fuse with it.</p>
      <p>
        This was a strange talent, and it belonged to the soul alone, and could
        lead others to the fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this Dao Fruit naturally included cultivation base, Ture Spirit and
        so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of which, copying talent with a different name, of course, was
        not guaranteed to succeed, it was a test of Luck.
      </p>
      <p>However……</p>
      <p>
        The Purple Crown of Luck and the Dao Fruit of Guidance could be
        combined.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was really a necessary means of digging a hole and throwing a pot.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No wonder the Human Ancestor's divine soul could hold so many
        Reincarnation Seals. It turns out that there was such a talent."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge felt an inexplicable aura that permeated his soul.</p>
      <p>
        In the inheritance of the Ancient Heavenly Lord of Reincarnation, there
        were methods of concealment and there were also methods of imitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, based on these methods, on the day of the Ancient
        Immortal Gu family banquet, he threw the black cauldron of the inheritor
        of demonic art on the head of Heavenly Emperor's family and his son Ying
        Shuang.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now that there was the Guidance Dao Fruit, this was even simpler.

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Gu Changge wanted to trick people and throw the pot, which was a
        thousand times more convenient.
      </p>
      <p>He felt that it was tailor-made for him.</p>
      <p>The harvest this time was amazing.</p>
      <p>"You killed the Human Ancestor…"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Jiang Chuchu seemed to have just recovered after seeing Gu
        Changge taking away the Great Dao treasure bottle.
      </p>
      <p>Her voice trembled slightly.</p>
      <p>Her face was pale, and was filled with fear and disbelief.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing Human Ancestor die in front of her with her own eyes, she
        couldn't do anything but watch him die.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made her feel that her beliefs and the world were collapsing, and
        the majestic palace in her spiritual sea was even beginning to shine,
        and there was a tendency to break through.
      </p>
      <p>"Kill or get killed."</p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that I should be waiting for him to kill me?" Gu Changge
        glanced at her and said casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu had a hard time accepting this scene, and she was full of
        guilt, regret, loss, doubts…
      </p>
      <p>
        If she had been braver and fought against Gu Changge just now, would the
        ending have changed?
      </p>
      <p>Would the Human Ancestor still die?</p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge seemed to know what she was thinking, and said
        lightly, "No, you would have died here just like him."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu's face turned pale, she was not afraid of death, but what
        Gu Changge said made her feel palpitations and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge changed the subject at this time, "However, I won't
        kill you, after all, I promised you."
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, he showed an intriguing smile again and continued,
      </p>
      <p>
        "Besides, you are my woman anyway, and I won't do anything to kill my
        own woman."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Chuchu was stunned when she heard these words, she didn't expect
        Gu Changge to suddenly say that since she was his woman, so he would not
        kill herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, she was a little silent, with a complicated expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, for the outside world, there was a descendant of the Human
        Ancestor hall walking around the world. Since Gu Changge had the means
        to make the Human Ancestor disappear silently, wouldn't it be easy to
        make her disappear silently?
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, she didn't doubt the truth of Gu Changge's words, and it
        didn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Human Ancestor is dead…" she murmured, remembering the purpose of the
        Human Ancestor Hall since its existence, and now even the Human Ancestor
        was dead.
      </p>
      <p>Did the Human Ancestor Hall still need to exist?</p>
      <p>How would she explain to the world at that time?</p>
      <p>
        The Human Ancestor Hall will fall from the altar, and it would be
        irreversible since then, and it would be difficult to return to its
        former glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Jiang Chuchu's expression was even more miserable.
      </p>
      <p>She didn't know what to do next.</p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, just kill me…"</p>
      <p>
        Simply, she opened her mouth, her eyes fixed on Gu Changge, intending to
        beg for death, not knowing the purpose of her future cultivation
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, from the moment she was born, she was taught that she must
        work hard for the glory of the Human Ancestor Hall in her entire life,
        and to be a descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall, she must shoulder her
        responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>Human Ancestor was now dead.</p>
      <p>
        It was conceivable that the Human Ancestor Hall would soon fall apart.
        Where would she go then?
      </p>
      <p>
        "What a poor fellow, do you plan to live for the Human Ancestor Hall all
        your life?"
      </p>
      <p>"I said, I won't kill you."</p>
      <p>"However, I have a way to help you."</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge showed some pity, and reached out to help her
        pin the falling strands of silky hair behind her ears.

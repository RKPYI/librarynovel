      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: TSUNDERE TO YANDERE CONFIRMED]</p>
      <p><b>Whoosh! </b></p>
      <p>A stream of light swept past from the base of the Supreme Peak.</p>
      <p>
        It was Gu Xian'er, who was passing by. She grunted coldly at the Palace
        on the mountain peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        She then turned around and headed for the place she usually cultivated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this made some of the followers behind Gu Xian'er feel a bit
        helpless and bitter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time she returned, Gu Xian'er would never forget to come to the
        base of the Supreme Peak and yell at Gu Changge inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, Gu Changge would appear with a frown and smack Gu
        Xian'er onto the ground to make her understand the consequences of
        acting so spoiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it seemed as though Gu Xian'er had gotten used to the feeling
        of being beaten up by Gu Changge from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After receiving a beating, she could feel her cultivation show faint
        signs of breakthrough.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength of Gu Changge was still as unfathomable as it was at the
        beginning, still enough to easily suppress her.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Gu Xian'er confronted Gu Changge, she discovered that these
        confrontations were far more effective than cultivating on her own.
      </p>
      <p>She was astonished, to say the least.</p>
      <p>[Kshn: I’m astonished too!]</p>
      <p>
        Thus, she thought of being Gu Changge’s sandbag… however, she was beaten
        until her butt ached. Gu Changge was ruthless, his hands showing no
        mercy as each slap was packed full of pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge appeared to have grown bored with Gu Xian'er.
        Eventually, he simply ignored her provocations.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how much Gu Xian'er provoked him, he remained indifferent and
        never showed up.
      </p>
      <p>This made Gu Xian'er very uncomfortable and frustrated.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's attitude towards her was getting colder and colder.</p>
      <p>The more it changed, the more Gu Xian'er intended to provoke him.</p>
      <p>
        However, these days, her status has also changed beyond recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        So much so that many young and powerful people have come to find her
        with the intention of becoming her followers.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was used to cultivating alone, so for her to suddenly gain so many
        followers…
      </p>
      <p>It was still a bit difficult to believe, let alone adapt to.</p>
      <p>
        However, some of these followers had actually come for Gu Changge,
        wanting to take advantage of her identity and meet him.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were also some who were planning to play nice with her and get
        closer. But, from time to time, they would inquire about various things
        regarding Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such pretentious behavior made Gu Xian'er extremely annoyed and
        irritated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the many daughters of heaven[1], without taking look at themselves
        in a mirror, dared to shamelessly inquire about Gu Changge's affairs?
      </p>
      <p>[1: They are not Favoured Daughters of Heaven.]</p>
      <p>Although she didn’t say it out loud, she was obviously unhappy.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was also aware that all these changes were brought about by
        the day when Gu Changge revealed everything in front of everyone, the
        day when he had acknowledged her status as a descendant of the Gu Family
        in front of the entire Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to that, she was just an unknown little girl. And when people
        mentioned her, they instantly thought of the brilliant Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, there were many who remembered that the distance Gu Xian'er had
        traveled on the Road of Heavenly Dao was – in fact – not much worse than
        Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>This meant her talent was no less than Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Not only that, but she cultivated without her Dao Bones, a painstaking
        endeavor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such determination and perseverance was worthy of the admiration from
        all cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>However, Gu Changge’s radiance inevitably overshadowed Gu Xian’er.</p>
      <p>
        On the contrary, Gu Changge, who openly admitted his past mistakes, grew
        even more radiant than before. His reputation has once again soared to
        new heights.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Xian'er knew what the word “propaganda” was, she would definitely
        be spitting curses at Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p>
      <p>
        ‘The Sea King Palace and the Ancient Immortal Continent, it’s about time
        to wrap it all up…’
      </p>
      <p>‘Coincidentally, this came at a great time.’</p>
      <p>
        Sensing something, Gu Changge, who was writing a letter in the palace,
        couldn't help but show a peculiar smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        A silver glint flashed across his eyes, as visions of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent flashed by.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vast land of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan was brimming with
        prosperity.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was almost as if Gu Changge’s arrival that day was only a nightmare;
        it had no effect on them whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan thought that Gu Changge
        would send them to slaughter the other Ancient Immortal Clans, to fight
        for resources and territory for him so that he may further expand his
        influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge did nothing of the sort, nor did he reveal anything
        about himself. He simply remained in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
        This puzzled the entire Black Heavenly Eagle Clan, but at the same time,
        their minds were put at ease. They already had the slave seal in their
        bodies, so to submit to yet another master wasn’t so unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, he was a hands-off owner who didn't do anything to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such good results naturally made them happy and they slowly stopped
        caring about Gu Changge's control over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Thinking that everything is fine… what’s the point in keeping them if I
        don’t eventually use them?’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge, knowing their thoughts, couldn't help but smirk.</p>
      <p>It was simply not the time to use them yet.</p>
      <p>
        The Black Heavenly Eagle Clan, as his servants, remained in the Ancient
        Immortal Continent. No one had discovered even the slightest
        abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, as an extremely famous and powerful clan within the Ancient
        Immortal Continent, the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan's heritage was still
        extremely terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tiangou Clan, which had already been eradicated, was also nowhere
        near comparable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without the Immortal Binding Art, it would have been quite difficult for
        Gu Changge to take control of this clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, he laid down a huge terrifying net that was
        spreading rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In just half a month, it had already engulfed all kinds of creatures,
        its range growing to an extremely terrifying degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary reason for this was that the Immortal Binding Art had not
        been exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan was growing at a speed
        that was visible to the naked eye, overtaking the rest of the clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the other clans such as the Ancient Serpent and Divine Crocodile
        took notice. Naturally, they were quite greedy when they found out.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their eyes, the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan had definitely obtained
        many good things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Black Heavenly Eagle Clan was not aware that the means Gu Changge
        used to control them was the Immortal Binding Art, which they had
        regarded as an Ancient Technique.
      </p>
      <p>They always thought of it as the effect of the slave seal.</p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Serpent and the Divine Crocodile Clans had also been put
        under the slave seal by the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation, so how could
        they possibly escape from Gu Changge's control?
      </p>
      <p>
        So in the eyes of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan, these two groups were
        in the same boat as them, like fish on a cutting board.
      </p>
      <p>Naturally, there was little caution against the two groups.</p>
      <p>
        During this time, the pawn Hei Ming, was “kind” enough to quietly pass
        on the technique to the rest of his friends, with the intention of
        spreading it around.
      </p>
      <p>By doing so, the string left by Gu Changge, spread quickly.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Gu Changge himself didn't expect that the chess piece he laid down so
        casually would bring him such huge benefits later on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge's figure shifted, stepping into the void. He was
        planning on going to the Ancient Immortal Continent for the climax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the Ancient Serpent and Divine Crocodile Clans so desperately
        wanted the Immortal Binding “Technique” of the Black Heavenly Eagle
        Clan…
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge would naturally come to the rescue and fulfill their wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This part of Gu Changge’s plan was actually quite simple. He only needed
        to arrange a few “coincidences” to make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>Once that’s done, he need only wait in the shadows for a bit.</p>
      <p>
        And so he waited, half a month passed at the Heavenly Dao Immortal
        Palace. The time for the arrangement had finally come.
      </p>
      <p>And as for what needs to be done?</p>
      <p>That was a simple matter too.</p>
      <p>
        For instance, one of the Black Heavenly Eagle clansmen happened to get
        “drunk” while drinking and chit-chatting with his friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        He “accidentally” spilled the truth, revealing the deepest secret of
        their clan as of late, the mysterious technique suspected of being an
        Ancient Technique!
      </p>
      <p>
        Coincidentally, the experts of the Ancient Serpent and Divine Crocodile
        Clans were passing by and happened to overhear this “confidential”
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all these accidents and coincidences brought together, it was only
        inevitable… The secrets of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan were finally
        uncovered by the Ancient Serpent and Divine Crocodile Clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Technique they coveted could be pried out from the mouth of
        the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan!
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the two clans took the risk of capturing a Black Heavenly
        Eagle clan member, using various means to question him and reveal the
        truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coincidentally, this member was unable to bear the torture, finally
        revealing the Ancient Technique.
      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: If I have to write “coincidence” one more time…]</p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Technique was extremely precious, so naturally, the Black
        Heavenly Eagle Clan would put a seal in the mind of the clan members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, another coincidence was needed to ensure this seal was not
        triggered.
      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: *rages*]</p>
      <p>
        Although how it came to be was strange, it was enough to dispel the
        worries of the Ancient Serpent and Divine Crocodile Clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their good fortune only meant that they were fated to obtain the Ancient
        Technique!
      </p>
      <p>
        How could they possibly give up an Ancient Technique when it's right in
        front of their eyes?
      </p>
      <p>
        With this series of schemes, Gu Changge was able to spread the Immortal
        Binding Art to those two clans and take control of their life and death
        with little effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using the Immortal Binding Art, he didn’t have to leave the Heavenly
        Dao Immortal Palace by even half a step these days. He simply controlled
        the entire situation from millions of miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
        And to think that this all came to be by controlling a single member of
        the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan… Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on
        no/v/elbin(.)c/om
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Binding Art is poisonous. Once it touches a cultivator or
        creature, they will get infected, enjoying a cultivation speed many
        times faster than the norm. Some would even reach enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>Naturally, they couldn’t give it up.</p>
      <p>The time for Gu Changge to use these pawns had come.</p>
      <p>
        ‘The Great Elder went to the TrueDragon Clan, so they’ll be preoccupied
        for a while. They won’t submit easily, and there’s even a chance that
        they’ll unite the rest of the clans in order to subjugate the various
        Daoist lineages that descended on the Ancient Immortal Continent.’
      </p>
      <p>’This counterattack, truly does carry a sense of loneliness…’</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's figure soon disappeared into the void.</p>
      <p>
        He had been manipulating the Ancient Immortal Races, and the appearance
        of the Great Elder was only the first step of his plan, the opening act
        one might say.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, the Ancient Immortal Continent was anything but quiet, as
        many of the Ancient Freaks rushed to the Immortal Road in search of
        Fairy Spirit. Earth-shattering battles broke out, sending waves in all
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>They wouldn’t be deterred so easily.</p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, the Ancient Immortal Races were oppressed,
        and they didn't dare to fight back without the leadership of the True
        Dragon Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        This moment was the perfect opportunity for Gu Changge to take advantage
        of the fire and pillage.

      <p>
        By “coincidence”, they managed to successfully interrogate a Black

        the terrifying phantom high in the sky.

      </p>
      <p>
        He was surrounded by a dense ashy mist, yet his aura retained its
        terrifying might.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the area surrounding Dragon Island, numerous powerful figures from
        various clans and Daoist Sects gathered.
      </p>
      <p>
        They all had different expressions, schemers with gleaming eyes, while
        others merely swept across, planning to fish in the muddy waters.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Today's matter appears to be unavoidable.” </b></p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder said with a calm face. His aura was calm but carried
        enough might to overwhelm the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Back then, you promised to protect my clan. However, it seems as
          though the passage of time has eroded the value of your word.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The vague figure was furious; his eyes held a chilling gaze.</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

      <p>
        He wasn't the True Dragon of the past, merely one of the few descendants
        of the True Dragon. Besides, the True Spirit of the True Dragon's
        descendants was not a physical entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's precisely why he was hesitant; he might not be the Great Elder’s
        match.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Is there no room for negotiation?”</b> The vague figure asked. Until
        now, he’d never once considered fighting the Great Elder, fully aware of
        the old man’s prowess.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“No, I have already given my word to a junior. The True Dragon Clan
          must submit to him now, in accordance with his plan.”</b
        >
        He was aware of what Gu Changge had done that day, so he would certainly
        keep his promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder's words caused many of the surrounding creatures and
        cultivators to be shocked, leaving them in a state of disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, they were all puzzled by the appearance of the Great Elder.
        This only doubled when they discovered his intent to oppress the Ancient
        Immortal Races, leaving many of the strongest Ancient Immortal Races
        perplexed. This caught them by surprise, and – even now – they found it
        difficult to accept this turn of events.
      </p>
      <p>At that moment, when they heard these words, they all understood.</p>
      <p>
        The junior mentioned by the Great Elder should be none other than Gu
        Changge!
      </p>
      <p>
        For Gu Changge to have coerced even the Great Elder, someone who had
        always protected the Ancient Immortal Races, to such an extent was so
        astonishing that they were left dumbfounded.
      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: This author <b>loves</b> his shock factor.]</p>
      <p>
        The ancient and long-standing True Dragon Clan was now being cornered to
        such an extent.
      </p>
      <p>If the Great Elder didn't say it himself, who would’ve believed it?</p>
      <p>‘But how on earth did Gu Changge manage to do it?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘He is simply too terrifying, simply unlike any other young man at all!’
      </p>
      <p>Many people couldn't help but shiver in their hearts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“The same junior who killed my clan's descendent?”</b> The vague
        figure coldly snorted; he was clearly aware of this matter as well.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Irrelevant.”</b> The Great Elder said indifferently.</p>
      <p>
        Then, he struck out with killing intent, moving forward with a single
        palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though his palm was initially only the size of a millstone, it quickly
        expanded. Billions of divine lights flashed, like a river of stars
        falling, as though heaven and earth were collapsing and rapidly
        descending in his opponent’s direction!
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p><b>“Come and fight!”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“Even if we are not from the same generation, this Emperor</b>[2]<b>
          is invincible within the same realm!”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        [2: He talks about himself as Emperor because he rules the True Dragon
        Clan which rules every other Clan.]
      </p>
      <p>
        As he spoke, the vague figure's aura grew even more frightening. The sky
        was filled with divine clouds, forming a red haze that pierced through
        the heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stepped forward, carrying the Dao of ten thousand men in his body,
        like the lord of heaven and earth, dominating the eight directions.
      </p>
      <p>Without any hesitation, he directly used his strongest technique.</p>
      <p>
        All the creatures and cultivators, with frightened expressions,
        retreated one after another. However, there were still many who,
        unfortunately, burst into bits and pieces under the palm. They were
        reduced to dust, as both their bodies and souls perished!
      </p>
      <p>
        Another tremendous battle had broken out. Regardless of its outcome, the
        Ancient Immortal Continent will surely descend into chaos once more!
      </p>
      <p>— — —</p>
      <p>
        On the way to the Ancient Immortal Continent, Gu Changge was carefully
        thinking about his next plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Favored Son of Heaven, Ye Ling, had been taken care of. Going by his
        prior experiences, he simply assumed that a new one would appear for him
        to harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the Favored Sons of Heaven keep pouring in like water.
        However, this supposedly “ironclad” assumption wasn’t as correct as he
        thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given that he has received no prompt from the system, this could only
        mean that he has yet to be approached by a Favored Son of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, it was up to Gu Changge to take the initiative and seek them
        out.
      </p>
      <p>
        But how many people with great fortune exist in the vast and boundless
        Upper Realm? Among these people with great fortune, how many of them can
        be considered a Favored Son of Heaven?
      </p>
      <p>
        The number was simply too large, which in Gu Changge's eyes, were all
        leeks waiting to be harvested.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only that but there were hundreds of millions of people with a great
        fortune in the Lower Realm.
      </p>
      <p>How many of them can he face?</p>
      <p>
        ‘Perhaps I can rely on the almighty Destiny Points, to establish a
        mysterious kingdom, like a certain temple that I knew in my previous
        life. Otherwise, I’d have to personally harvest these leeks myself. Who
        knows how long that would take?’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge thought about it seriously once more.</p>
      <p>
        His strength alone was ultimately limited, while the leeks waiting for
        him to harvest were unlimited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, he didn’t feel like doing it himself. He not only has to go
        through the trouble of refining a “doppelganger” of sorts, but he also
        has to go to the Lower Realms to search for people with great fortune.
      </p>
      <p>‘Too troublesome, and the timeline is vague.’</p>
      <p>
        The Black Heavenly Eagle Clan's Hei Ming gave Gu Changge a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he can pretend to be a Supreme Being, then why not expand his
        boundaries and pretend to be Almighty God Himself?
      </p>
      <p>
        Being both the Supreme Being and Almighty God didn’t seem to be a
        problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The Chosen One sounds too clichéd. In the future, I should call my
        leeks the Heavenly Destined, a grander title.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The Heavenly Destined shall serve me and plunder the fortune of those
        in the Lower Realms.’
      </p>
      <p>
        [Kshn: He is talking about how Hei Ming thought he was a Chosen One, the
        people he’ll scam like this now will be called Heavenly Destined.]
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded.</p>
      <p>
        After all, he had the world seed. With his guidance, it will gradually
        grow to become even wider and even more magnificent than before.
      </p>
      <p>In ancient times, the Jade Emperor had a residence similar to this.</p>
      <p>
        Four heavenly gates stood in the four directions East, West, North and
        South, grandiose and towering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the heavenly gates was magnificent, boundless and could support
        the four corners of heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it needed to be full of flair. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able
        to trick the leeks into coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's intention was simple: gather leeks to determine how to
        harvest the fortune of other leeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once he gathers enough Destiny Points, Gu Changge will exchange them in
        the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: The system usually sells techniques around the 5,000
        Destiny Point mark. With this scheme, he can pay for it even if it's ten
        or a hundred times higher than its normal price!
      </p>
      <p>And so on.</p>
      <p>
        However, with Gu Changge's current number of Destiny Points, this seemed
        highly improbable.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are just his plans for the future, whether he can reach that point
        or not remains to be seen. After all, his goal wasn’t limited to the
        Immeasurable Heavens, let alone the Upper Realm. No, he wanted all the
        Heavenly Realms.
      </p>
      <p>
        And for that goal, he urgently needed a large number of Destiny Points.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Perhaps I should keep an eye on Mingkong's movements. In addition to
        all the effort I’ve spent on her, I’ve also made several moves on my
        end,, there's no way she wouldn't notice…’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge understood this matter very thoroughly.</p>
      <p>
        If Yue Mingkong still had murderous intent for him even now, it would
        simply be too abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, Yue Mingkong probably felt quite guilty.</p>
      <p>
        And in Gu Changge's opinion, Yue Mingkong's movements may lead to the
        discovery of the next Favored Son of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        He hoped that this Favored Son of Heaven would provide him with a great
        number of Fortune Value and Destiny Points.
      </p>
      <p>If not, it would be difficult to carry out all his current plans.</p>

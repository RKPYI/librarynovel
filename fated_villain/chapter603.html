        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, silence enveloped the palace. The female dancers cowered in fear and the ministers kept quiet as they watched Tuo Ba Xiao Yao being taken away by the enraged Emperor Yu&#8217;s guards.</span><span id="more-33848"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it was merely a minor setback, they could already feel Emperor Yu&#8217;s wrath as his awfully gloomy face was overflowing with frightening fury. Even his favourite princes dared not to speak a word to him at the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Yu Feiya worriedly watched as Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was taken away and grew silent. She couldn&#8217;t tell why he would anger Emperor Yu at such a moment. His confession was a ferocious slap to Emperor Yu&#8217;s face, and there was no way her father, the Emperor of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, would forgive him for that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, she grew disappointed and helpless, not knowing how to deal with what was to come next.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had been rash for not considering the consequences of his actions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Feiya, it seems you have been hiding a lot of things from me.&#8221; Emperor Yu regained his composure and shot Yu Feiya a bland glare. He was no fool. He could tell by Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s attitude that his daughter&#8217;s relationship with Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was deeper than mere acquaintances. Nonetheless, never once had she mentioned it to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Emperor Yu couldn&#8217;t help but feel disappointed. Essentially, in his eyes, Yu Feiya had always been an obedient, well-behaved daughter, and not someone who would have kept so many secrets from him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When has she learnt to keep so many secrets from me? Is it just for the sake of another man?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya&#8217;s face blanched as she muttered, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to hide it from you, father. I did it for a reason…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she was about to explain, Emperor Yu interrupted her with a wave of a hand and coldly stated, &#8220;Save your explanation. Starting today, you are grounded. Without my permission, you are not to take even half a step out of the palace.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, Yu Feiya&#8217;s face grew even paler. She was in dismay. Her body trembled as if she was struck by lightning. In her entire life, it was her first time being grounded by her father. Furthermore, she was forbidden to take half a step out of the palace. With that, she understood that Emperor Yu was truly angered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, father…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, she still wouldn&#8217;t defy her father&#8217;s wish at that moment. Thus, she lowered her head and softly replied, and her eyes seemed rather dull.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, she took a glance beside her and saw the subtle grin on Gu Changge&#8217;s face. It was as if he was observing her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, she felt a strange, inexplicable sensation, as though everything that happened in the palace was all orchestrated by Gu Changge, and if it weren&#8217;t for him, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao wouldn&#8217;t have displeased Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I apologise for this embarrassing scene. Even I failed to see such a thing coming. How humiliating.&#8221; With that, Emperor Yu turned to Gu Changge and shook his head as he sighed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, Gu Changge withdrew his scrutinising gaze on Yu Feiya&#8217;s expression. Things were now escalating pretty much as he had predicted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, he let out a chuckle before shaking his head. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a surprise that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao would say such a thing in front of so many people. I was rather fond of how skilled he is, but now I&#8217;m afraid that he would only be a burden.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did Tuo Ba Xiao Yao denied Emperor Yu&#8217;s desire to grant him an arranged marriage, but he also claimed that Yu Feiya, the First Princess, was his beloved. That was no longer an act of treachery, but an act of seeking death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Gu Changge&#8217;s perspective, he knew the truth. The important thing was now that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was imprisoned, his plans would only go smoother.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty prison was recognised to be impeccable, containing its enemies that were True Daoists in its depths, Gu Changge could still easily sneak in and out of it at will. Therefore, no one would suspect him in the slightest even if Tuo Ba Xiao Yao were to die in prison.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After such an incident, everyone in the banquet, including Emperor Yu and the rest lost their festive moods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Tuo Ba Family were visibly dejected as their faces grew dull. After such an atrocity, it was unquestionable that their family would be ostracised by Emperor Yu and they would no longer be treated with any respect as their future held not prosperity but peril.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Tuo Ba Ling Qiong and Tuo Ba Qing Yu were worried about Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, they had no choice but to keep their agitation under control. They felt urged to inform their father about the matter, but Tuo Ba Xiao Yao repeatedly advised them not to spread the word to anyone else, including their parents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, Jia Luo, the Prince of the Eternal Overcast Royal family, brought up the marriage once again. Essentially, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s public declaration irritated him, and he was concerned that Emperor Yu might refuse to grant him the marriage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Yu Feiya wasn&#8217;t really the woman he adored, he was certain that his marriage with her was unchangeably decided. However, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s unexpected interference in the matter made him feel as though he had been thoroughly disrespected. Regardless, in his eyes, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was merely a pawn of a general. Nothing much to be worried about. Be it cultivation strength or identity, he could by no means rival him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, Emperor Yu could easily tell who to pick between the two of them as long as he was wise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Prince Jia Luo, regarding the marriage you mentioned, I shall consider it and give you a final answer in five days.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Jia Luo&#8217;s proposal, Emperor Yu answered flawlessly as he had yet to come to a solid conclusion. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be frank, as he was still undecided about the matter. Thus, he decided to hold Jia Luo off for a few days and discuss the matter with him later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, he also had another idea. During the Hunting Event, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had displayed terrifying strength that shouldn&#8217;t be achievable by someone of his cultivation level. As such, he was certain that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao must be hiding some sort of secret unknown to anyone else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;ll have to interrogate him once I have the time.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the banquet came to an end, everyone timidly departed, while the group from the Eternal Overcast Royal Family was escorted by servants to their respective chambers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, Gu Changge, along with Jiang Chuchu, excused themselves and returned to their chamber. In fact, he wasn&#8217;t in a rush to investigate Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s situation. If his prediction was right, Yu Tianzheng must be waiting for him in his chamber.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when the Hunting Event was ongoing, he ordered Yu Tianzheng to give up on his assassination attempt. It would be ruining all his years of scheming. Hence, Yu Tianzheng must be filled with reluctance, dying to ask him about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In that case, I shall make him a little more cooperative…] Gu Changge squinted his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, he would have to carefully plan around such a good pawn. Now that he knew about the identity of the holder of the Sword of World Domination, seizing the sword was no longer that urgent to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, he managed to catch some opportunities in the vast Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Have you always known about Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and Princess Yu Feiya’s relationship?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu walked beside Gu Changge and softly asked. She donned a white robe and a veil that revealed only her captivating eyes. She was extraordinary as usual. Her silky hair swayed, as if it was welcoming the returning of a goddess.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After having witnessed the incident in the palace, she could naturally tell that Gu Changge spoke those words deliberately in order to get Tuo Ba Xiao Yao to upset Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theoretically, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and Gu Changge should be strangers to each other, as they had never met. Yet, Gu Changge&#8217;s knowing look left her puzzled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. I have known about it. Otherwise, would I have bothered to arrange that marriage for him?&#8221; Gu Changge grinned as he wrapped his arm around her slender waist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu revealed an expression of &#8216;I knew it!&#8217;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that she was about to ask more questions, Gu Changge subconsciously chuckled and explained, &#8220;Tuo Ba Xiao Yao is in possession of the Sword of World Domination. He had been hiding himself for years in order to avoid catching my eye. Though, I&#8217;ve already seen through him during the Hunting Event. By possessing the Sword of World Domination, he would only be risking his own life. Alas, not only does he not realise it, but he even attempted to oppose me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Sword of World Domination?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu blinked her eyes with a pondering look.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indubitably, she was aware of the Seven Tools of World Domination and the fact that Gu Changge was in possession of a number of them. [No wonder he specifically targeted Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. So that&#8217;s the reason…]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, she was moved by how Gu Changge honestly disclosed such a secret to her. After all, he wasn&#8217;t exactly someone who would speak the truth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have to tell me that, to be honest.&#8221; Jiang Chuchu raised her head and glanced at Gu Changge with her glistening eyes before turning away as if nothing happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yet I wanted to tell you,&#8221; Gu Changge said with a smile as he put her soft, little hand onto his chest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No one told you to do that. I—I wasn&#8217;t even asking anyway!&#8221; Jiang Chuchu could feel her heart suddenly palpitating. As blush slowly surged on her face. She wanted to pull herself out of Gu Changge&#8217;s grasp, yet the man&#8217;s firm grip left her somewhat bashful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you doing… The guards are staring at us…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And? Am I not holding you tight enough?&#8221; Gu Changge softly chuckled. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been my wife for so long. Why are you still being so shy?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who&#8217;s your wife? In fact, Yue Mingkong is your actual fiancee.&#8221; Jiang Chuchu felt the urge to roll her eyes on him to feign her frustration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, she could feel that her face underneath the veil must be as red as a beet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the public eye, she was the pure, sacred Saintess of Mortal Palace—someone unstained, extraordinary, and as clean as a mirror; someone who wouldn&#8217;t be affected by any external factor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If Mingkong&#8217;s my fianc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">é</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e, then who are you to me?&#8221; Gu Changge retained his subtle grin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221; Hearing the question, Jiang Chuchu grew even more flustered, though unexpected disappointment arose in her heart. [Indeed, Yue Mingkong is his recognised fianc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">é</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e, so who am I to him?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heaving a sigh, Gu Changge added, &#8220;I know. You shall be a maid solely for me to bully. Not only will I be bullying you, but many others as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You dare bully me!?&#8221; Although Jiang Chuchu was trying to collect her emotions, after hearing those words, she couldn&#8217;t help but feel upset as she shook herself out of Gu Changge&#8217;s grasp.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, you shall not be a bullied maid.&#8221; Gu Changge chuckled as he revealed a tender, sympathetic look.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Jiang Chuchu couldn&#8217;t help but think that he was only here today to tease her. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You will marry me one day, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; She lowered her gaze as her voice gradually softened.</span></p>

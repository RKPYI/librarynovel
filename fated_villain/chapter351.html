          have no quarrel with her, so why did she do this… No, this
          wasn&#8217;t her plan. She&#8217;s innocent and will never do such a
          thing. It must have been Young Master Gu… Damn it! Why is he doing
          this when we have no hatred between us?] Niu Tian, Jiang Chen&#8217;s

          ground. He couldn&#8217;t believe that these well-behaved beings had
          suddenly attacked them. Now, even worse, they were trying to kill them
          all, bringing them to this remote forest first before attacking so
          there would be no evidence. They really wanted his companions to all
          be killed. Even if they managed to escape such beings, they might
          never escape the forest, which was brimming with danger and most
          likely would end up dying here.</span

          person!] Niu Tian gritted his teeth, never feeling such hate for
          someone else before. He recalled what Jiang Chen had said; it might be
          true that the test stone had been tampered with so everyone could be
          kicked out and eventually killed. That way, Xiao Ruoyin wouldn&#8217;t
          be able to find any trace of them after she had successfully started
          cultivating.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very quickly after, he heard a terrible scream, which came from one
          of his companions. This made him turn pale. Fortunately, Jiang Chen
          had reacted faster than him, though these beings didn&#8217;t seem to
          be in a rush to hunt them. Instead, they were allowing their victims
          to flee, as if they were cats waiting to catch their prey. That meant
          everyone wouldn&#8217;t be caught immedaitely.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As he went deeper into the forest, he noticed that the fog was
          becoming much denser. Trees towered into the sky while further away,
          grey smoke with strong corrosive properties appeared. Niu Tian could
          feel his skin sting, even feeling like it was about to split open as
          blood began to flow from his skin. However, the blood was strange, as
          it wasn&#8217;t the normal shade of red but had a tinge of gold. He
          didn&#8217;t notice that, and continued to run.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!* Suddenly, he could feel a terrifying aura above him. Black
          fog churned and armour-like scales glimmered as if a frightening being
          was circling above him. The aura was enough to make him choke on his
          breath.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Damn it! They&#8217;ve caught up to me.] Niu Tian&#8217;s expression
          became stricken as he had no time to react. He dived straight into the
          swamp in front of him, not daring to move a muscle amongst the rotting
          leaves and mud around him. He held his breath as he waited for the
          being to leave.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;ve already noticed you. Do you think you can
          escape?&#8221; That being seemed to have noticed him though, his
          expression full of cruel mockery. A red bolt of lightning shot from
          his mouth, flashing above the swamp and landing on Niu Tian&#8217;s
          body. Very quickly, terrifying cracks and crevices began to
          appear.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Poof!* </span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Niu Tian became desperate after seeing such a powerful attack. He had
          the feeling that this shot would reduce him to nothing, and destroy
          him entirely just like with his companions. However, he didn&#8217;t
          expect strange energy to suddenly rise within him, moving along his
          limbs and torso as it surged from every cell of his body. It
          materialised as a light golden mist which surrounded him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the bolt of lightning landed, the ground and mountains began to
          shake as if going to explode. However, he only grunted and spat a
          mouthful of blood, sustaining a few broken bones and organs but
          otherwise, was relatively unharmed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[What was that just now?] Niu Tian was shocked but reacted quickly,
          getting to his feet and stumbling forward. He had been stunned when
          that strange power surged from him as he hadn&#8217;t expected such a
          change to occur. [Does my body have some kind of secret?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Hmm? What happened? Was this the strange change Master Changge
          wanted us to report? Well, I&#8217;ll give him a chance to flee once
          more.&#8221; The terrifying being hovering in the sky had been taken
          aback as well, eyes narrowing in interest. That attack didn&#8217;t
          have even one per cent of its original power but should be more than
          enough to kill a mortal. There was probably something extraordinary
          about Niu Tian.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The being continued pursuing Niu Tian leisurely on a black cloud,
          taunting him so he continued running. This was an ordinary mortal who
          he could catch up to within a split second&#8217;s thought; it had
          been Gu Changge&#8217;s orders to let the mortals flee this way. As
          for the reason, he couldn&#8217;t figure it out, as he should never
          guess how frivolous his Young Master was.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Fuck me! There&#8217;s a cliff in front of me!!] Niu Tian
          didn&#8217;t run for long as he soon became desperate once more. A
          terrifying wind blew from the churning clouds in front of him, strong
          enough to probably blow one&#8217;s skeleton to pieces. There was a
          bottomless valley about ten metres away from him and if he fell into
          it, he would definitely become a pile of minced meat judging by his
          current physical condition.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There was a cliff in front of him and a pursuing soldier behind him.
          This made him turn pale with helplessness and he couldn&#8217;t decide
          whether to wait here for death to take him or jump off. Even so, there
          might be a slim chance at survival if he chose the latter.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you running?&#8221; The black fog slowly
          blocked out the light, as the being showed himself. His tone was
          intrigued, sounding like a cat ready to catch a mouse.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why are you hunting me when there&#8217;s no hatred between
          us?&#8221; Niu Tian gritted his teeth and forced himself to calm down
          before shouting at the being with frustration and anger.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8216;Why should I need a reason to kill a mere bug? I gave you
          enough time to flee so you could survive but I ended up catching up to
          you. Now, how would you like to die?&#8221; The being laughed, not
          saying anything else. His hand moved forward, emitting a bright light
          while the black mist swirled as the being prepared to strike him to
          death.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I will rather jump off this cliff than die by your hand! Tell
          your Young Master this! If I manage to survive, I will repay what he
          has done to me!&#8221; Seeing this, Niu Tian became extremely brave.
          He quickly turned and ran towards the cliff, not afraid of the fact
          that he would fall into a deep valley which would end up crushing his
          body.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;He actually chose to jump. I don’t think I can explain this
          properly to Young Master. He has already ordered us to give them a
          chance to survive. So, I am acting in accordance to his order if I
          cannot catch him. But still…&#8221; The being frowned, expression
          ugly. He hadn&#8217;t anticipated the cat-and-mouse game to turn out
          this way. To him, Niu Tian might be a little special but might end up
          dying anyway if he fell into the valley.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that thought, he rode his cloud up into the sky, preparing to
          return and report to Gu Changge.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen, meanwhile, did not know what had transpired to his best
          friend, Niu Tian, as he was already having a hard time trying to
          survive. He had run as hard as he could but he was still just a
          mortal; he knew already that something was wrong when his other
          friends screamed one after the another.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now, three terrifying beings had appeared before him on black clouds.
          They were all covered in scaled armour and had enormous wings which
          surrounded him. The nearby mountain range and ancient trees had
          already been flattened, so he had no place to hide and eventually was
          blocked by them. They looked at him with gazes full of interest and
          scorn, not rushing to attack him as if wanting to see how he was going
          to deal with this.</span

          >[What should I do now? Will I die here today? It&#8217;s too unfair…]
          Jiang Chen was pale with extreme fear as he screamed internally,
          trying to communicate with the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat
          of Creation. If there was no other way, he would die here as these
          beings were frighteningly strong. Their auras were enough to make his
          knees weaken, ready to prostrate himself on the spot.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Artifact Spirit was scared as well, since it had only awakened
          not too long ago and did not have enough power to assist him. Jiang
          Chen might be the vessel for the Artifact Spirit, but he was currently
          just a mortal occupying a human body after going through
          reincarnation. He had no chance of surviving these beings, who were at
          least in the Enlightenment Realm. [Are we going to die here?]

          desperate. Given more time, it was confident it could assist Jiang

          black-robed old man walked out into the sky. He wasn&#8217;t tall but

          landed someplace else. It wasn&#8217;t known if they survived.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The scene shocked Jiang Chen, who stood stunned with wide eyes. [Is
          this man going to save me? But, why do I have the feeling that he is
          up to no good as well? His features and aura still contain coldness in
          them. Did I just escape by jumping out of the pan and into the fire?
          But, I shouldn’t judge based on how one looks. After all, who would
          have thought that Gu Changge was so evil when we first met him?]</span

      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Thank you for saving me…&#8221; Jiang Chen came back to
          himself quickly and expressed his gratefulness to the man.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young man, I will be your guardian from now on. I will assist
          you to the peak where you will compete with the young prodigies of the
          Upper Realm for the top spot, and become famous! It will be easy for
          you to avenge yourself too!&#8221; A freezing cold hand suddenly
          landed on his shoulder as if judging his physique. The man had
          disappeared without him noticing and appeared right beside him while
          saying such things.</span

          >&#8220;Guardian?&#8221; Jiang Chen was confused and could not answer.
          [Why did this man suddenly appear and save me, then offer to become my
          guardian? Could I really be that lucky?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;Jiang Chen, you need to be careful. This old man seems to have
          evil motives towards you… so, don&#8217;t believe him.&gt; The
          Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation suddenly said. It
          did not know the man&#8217;s purpose here but could detect the
          man&#8217;s evil intentions.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just as it spoke, a beam of black light suddenly appeared on the
          man&#8217;s palm. It looked like a seed surrounded by black light and
          looked extremely strange. The instant it appeared, it flowed from his
          shoulder to every part of his body. After that, it penetrated his
          skin, flesh, and bones, eventually moving to his Dantian, to where his
          Spiritual Sea would be. The seed was very mysterious and seemed to be
          made out of runes, yet was dark black, with many mysterious vortexes
          within.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Just what is this?] Jiang Chen&#8217;s eyes widened, feeling like
          every movement including his breathing was now one with the black
          seed. A mysterious power was surging from his flesh, seemingly strong
          enough to consume everything. The seed probably contained a complex
          and unsurpassable sutra, each word incomprehensible. As the seed went
          inside him, Jiang Chen could feel a strange energy surge within his
          Dantian and the essence of the universe rushed towards him. He could
          feel a strong energy which made him feel confident in battling his
          powerful enemies.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&lt;It seems to be some sort of cultivation technique…&gt; The
          Artifact Spirit sounded shocked as well. &lt;It feels really old and
          strange, yet feels demonic. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be something from
          a reputable good Sect…&gt;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen didn&#8217;t care about that, though. [I don&#8217;t care
          if it&#8217;s demonic.]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Ha ha. Young man, you are now the 108th Successor for the
          Everchanging Demonic Arts from now on. Can you remember that?&#8221;
          The man, seemingly satisfied with his shocked reaction, clapped him on
          the shoulder. A small smile appeared on his cold face which made it
          more ghastly and frightening.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Everchanging Demonic Arts? 108th Successor?&#8221; Jiang Chen
          was stunned. It didn&#8217;t sound like a good thing judging by its
          name. However, he felt a kind of relief settle over him. The man in
          black robes looked fierce and didn&#8217;t look like a good person,
          yet this man had saved his life and passed down his teachings to him.
          He didn&#8217;t know how to repay such a great favour and one
          couldn&#8217;t judge a book by its cover.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Thank you for saving me and also passing down your
          teaching!&#8221; Jiang Chen said gratefully after calming down his
          racing heart.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Ha ha. Don&#8217;t thank me too quickly. I&#8217;m not a good
          person and you won&#8217;t be this grateful when you know what it is.
          You may even hate me!&#8221; The elderly man snorted contemptuously in
          response.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen did not really mind that. The old man had claimed he
          wasn&#8217;t a good person but he was much better than people who
          pretended to be good but were secretly cruel. Jiang Chen could discern
          by its name, that this cultivation technique wasn&#8217;t something of
          a Dao that was righteous and good, but he didn&#8217;t care.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you are
          good or bad, as it&#8217;s indisputable that you saved my life.&#8221;
          Jiang Chen exhaled slowly and calmed down.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Hmph…&#8221; The man snorted again, a hint of approval in his
          expression. &#8220;I saw you were being hunted for some time. These
          beings didn&#8217;t look like they were planning to kill you
          immediately but to make you lose hope. Just who did you
          offend?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He seemed curious yet his tone sounded explanatory.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Someone surnamed Gu!&#8221; Jiang Chen&#8217;s gaze filled
          with hate. He actually knew that too since he wouldn&#8217;t be able
          to flee for so long while being a mortal. Gu Changge not only wanted
          him dead but also wanted him to lose all hope. [That man is pure evil!
          I can never exist in the same world with a man like that!]</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Young Master Gu, we&#8217;ve done everything you&#8217;ve told
          us to. We gave them the chance to survive and other than that stocky
          man, who committed suicide by jumping off a cliff, the one named Jiang
          Chen was saved by a man in black robes, who suddenly appeared…
          everyone else has been dealt with. There are no blunders as both their
          bodies and souls were destroyed.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the pavilion, Gu Changge blew on his teacup slowly as he listened
          to the report, as the one reporting kept his head low.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I know. You&#8217;re all dismissed.&#8221; He drank from his
          cup, eyes distant. Since Jiang Chen was an incarnation of the
          Celestial Boat of Creation, Gu Changge couldn&#8217;t make a move on
          him before the man acquired the complete version of the Boat. So, Gu
          Changge had given him a guardian, to make sure his leek grew lush and
          ripe.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for Niu Tian, that was a little unexpected but not by much. After
          all, he was the best friend of a Fortuitous One. His initial plan had
          been to see if any of the Fortuitous One&#8217;s companions could gain
          some sort of enlightenment in a dangerous situation and thus, reverse
          their chances of dying. After all, Fortuity was a fickle thing and who
          knew what would happen? That was why he hadn&#8217;t let his men kill
          everyone outright. But, disappointingly, no one else was unique except
          for Niu Tian. All were meant to die in the end.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Judging by this situation, Niu Tian may not die after jumping off
          the cliff. I just don&#8217;t know what strange encounter he will have
          after that though. Hopefully, he will give me a surprise the next time
          we meet.] Gu Changge smiled, already prepared for this stage of the
          plan. That Fruit of Knowledge wasn&#8217;t so delicious after all.
          Besides, it was a pleasant surprise to gain another prey too.</span

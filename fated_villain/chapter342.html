          slightly as he looked out of the window of the palace. There was an
          indiscernible smile on his face. Everything was going according to
          plan; he already considered every idea Chu Hao had. He had already
          consumed the Dragon Vein inside the Vermillion Bird Empire. Thus, its
          demise was inevitable. Chu Hao could not reverse this even if he was a
          Fortuitous One. Human strength was limited after all and this could
          not be altered in any way. The only thing Chu Hao could do was witness
          the demise of his precious Vermillion Bird Empire with
          desperation.</span

          the palace. Their auras were powerful like boiling clouds, each of
          them shining in different colours, and had unbelievably strong
          vitality. They were the young and brilliant Successors of their
          respective clans, and behind them were their Ancestors.

          Ancient Flying Snake Family, the Divine Crocodile Clan, the True
          Dragon Clan… All of them here had more powerful cultivation, which
          meant they hadn&#8217;t been defying him behind his back.</span

          the Continent and it is ready for your inspection.&#8221; The person
          speaking was clad in a black dress with a veil over her face. Her face
          was pale and her eyes were clear, while her hair was smooth. These
          features made her look so beautiful, she could accidentally ensnare
          any man.</span

          She was none other thanHei Yanyu, who was known as the most beautiful
          woman in the Celestial Ancient Continent. She was the current leader
          of the Black Hawk Family and was extremely valued and trusted by Gu
          Changge despite her youth. This, she held great status in her family.
          Even those young prodigies from the other clans had to all lower their
          heads in deference when with her.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Really?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled carelessly. &#8220;Since you
          had said so, I&#8217;ll believe you for now.&#8221;</span

          >He had tasked her to secretly gather various Sources, a job similar
          to what he had tasked Yin Mei. She was to find young prodigies with
          rare physiques and Sources. However, his cultivation level quickly
          rose to the Sacred King Realm, which meant that these ‘resources’ were
          not that useful to him now. Nonetheless, since Hei Yanyu had gathered
          them, he might as well check them out.</span

          Am I some sort of monstrous beast or something?&#8221; He

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hei Yanyu looked surprised and pleased, walking to his side with
          light footsteps and a calm expression. She had been a little worried
          that he wasn&#8217;t satisfied with her work, which might result in
          the Black Hawk Family getting into trouble. She already knew what
          abilities and identity he concealed, meaning there was no one else
          more terrifying than him. Combined with the events happening in the
          Upper Realm, this made her extremely anxious. Her calm demeanour was
          merely a facade, as both her and her entire clan’s lives were within
          his control. In fact, they could die at any time because of a change
          in his emotions.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As for the other clans, they all deferred to him since they thought
          he was the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being. Only
          Hei Yanyu knew this wasn&#8217;t the truth, as the real Successor had
          been killed by Gu Changge a long time ago, and he had merely stolen
          that identity.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Well, it seems like the really pleased by my work. Phew…] A smile
          appeared beneath her veil. She had gathered the Black Hawk army as
          soon as she received the order. Gu Changge had handed her a
          cultivation method and asked her to spread it, something she
          didn&#8217;t dare disobey although she knew it wasn&#8217;t anything
          good.</span

          me.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s an honour to work for you.&#8221; Her eyes were
          lowered but the action did not hide her happiness.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Really?&#8221; He put an arm around her waist, still
          smiling.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes.&#8221; A blush spread onto Hei Yanyu&#8217;s face as she
          felt embarrassed by the gesture, but she went with it and leaned
          against him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The other Successors felt envious at this sight, since such an
          intimate action meant she was greatly favoured by him. They did not
          know what task Gu Changge had given her and so they couldn&#8217;t do
          anything but envy her. Her reputation as the greatest beauty of the
          Celestial Ancient Continent was clearly advantageous after all, and
          after seeing this sight, the other clans knew they needed to be more
          respectful towards her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hei Yanyu was smart enough to understand Gu Changge&#8217;s motive in
          making that gesture after seeing the envious and respectful gazes of
          the others. He wanted the others to understand that she belonged to
          him, and was greatly trusted. That way, her power among them would be
          much greater and no one else would dare disrespect her, which would
          make it extremely convenient if she worked for him.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[So, this is the benefit he mentioned…] She realised, suddenly
          feeling dejected. [True, judging by his character, he would never be
          this intimate suddenly for no reason… I’ve been expecting too much.
          Thinking too deeply and romantically about this.]</span

          allowing them to leave except for Hei Yanyu.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s go.&#8221; He nodded and let go of her. They
          left the palace with her leading the way. She felt a little dejected
          but did not dare show it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Continent had stopped in the sky about eight hundred thousand
          kilometres away from the Vermillion Bird Empire’s imperial palace. The
          cultivators with unique Sources that she had brought him were all
          locked in there, which did not take much time for Gu Changge to
          reach.</span

          outside the Forbidden Area of the Continent who were taken there by
          something unknown. No material from the Forbidden Area was effective
          on them. They were dressed in strange clothing and held some
          mysterious metal weapon, which could shoot some kind of silver-like
          metal. It is highly lethal, and it helped them easily take down the
          beasts roaming around over there. But, they probably have never
          cultivated before since they all have weak physiques. In fact, even
          the weakest child in my clan can probably kill them.&#8221;</span

          Continent had been a continent moved there by an Absolute Being from
          Skyward Schloss using a Supreme Ability. The Forbidden Area was part
          of the continent, which was moved. While the continent had always been
          hidden deep within Skyward Schloss, with no one being able to enter,
          after those events, with Gu Changge having taken control over all the
          clans, it had been opened up. Now, many cultivators of the outside
          world could be seen heading inside to cultivate, looking for
          opportunities.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, there was a reason for areas to be called a Forbidden Area.
          This area was a place where even experts in the Sacred Emperor Realm
          would never go recklessly, as they felt there was something
          frightening inside. The area was always filled with swirling fog,
          which belied a mysterious energy field. Thus, any cultivator who came
          near would be reduced to a bloody mist by the energy field, with both
          their body and soul being destroyed. Even those who had the luck to
          escape would be cursed, and would have been better off dead.

          hidden there. Someone so frightening, that even the Absolute Being who

          such rumours piling up, it gave the Forbidden Area a mysterious air to

          and powerful quake from the Forbidden Area. I rushed there but did not
          expect to see more than ten mysterious people running out from the
          area. They all looked terrified, as if they had seen something
          frightening…&#8221; Hei Yanyu nodded and then described how she had
          captured the group outside the Forbidden Area. She did not know how to

          >It wasn&#8217;t important whether or not they were visitors from
          Earth. Many of the innumerable Lower Realm worlds were more inclined
          towards technology, whereby it was rare for a cultivator to appear
          from there. Any cultivator from these worlds would never amount to
          much, though. They would only get to live several hundred years more
          than a normal human. Going up into the sky from the ground, or
          harvesting the moon and stars were too far of a goal for these
          cultivators, much less ascending to the Upper Realm.

          among these mysterious people. If they were really visitors from
          Earth, he could take this opportunity to understand the reason for his
          transmigration. He did not believe that the incident had no reason,
          especially after knowing he had some relation to the Demon Lord.
          [Still, the possibility of them being from Earth is extremely small
          though. They are most likely from some faraway Lower Realm
          world.]</span

          will still be in a disadvantageous position whether or not he agrees.
          If we use our power to pressure him, it may be effective… No matter
          what, the reputation he has built up in the eyes of the public is an
          extremely honourable one. He would never act on us directly unless he
          wants his reputation to be destroyed. This is our only
          chance.&#8221;</span

          >The Vermillion Bird Emperor, seeing Chu Hao ready to confront Gu
          Changge, suddenly thought of an idea and stopped his son. He had ruled
          over the empire for so long, which meant he was quite wise. He could
          tell that using the power of the people of the empire to force Gu
          Changge into taking Sky King Zhi Yang away, was the most suitable
          approach. The empire might be small but still contained billions of
          people. If Gu Changge did not agree and let them get harmed, he would
          have to bear the blame for having killed them. Unless, of course, he
          didn&#8217;t care about that.</span

          really doesn&#8217;t care about the lives of those in the
          empire…&#8221; Bai Yang&#8217;s eyes lit up, looking approvingly at
          the Vermillion Bird Emperor. This strategy might not measure up to
          absolute power but might be useful in this situation.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          discuss strategies. They knew that their own power wouldn&#8217;t be
          enough and if they wanted to use the people to put pressure on Gu
          Changge, they had to gather it first. Thus, the Emperor gave an order.

          >Soon, every sect of the Empire received an invitation to a banquet at
          the Palace in three days. He did not conceal his purpose for inviting
          them, ‘Sky King Zhi Yang’s incarceration within the Empire would mean
          Purple Mansion would invade at any time to rescue him. The aftershocks
          of the battle between Gu Changge&#8217;s army and Purple Mansion would
          destroy the empire a million times over.’</span

          show of unity for the Vermillion Bird Empire. This was regarding their
          survival after all, and if they did not want to relinquish their
          foundations and leave their home in the empire. Thus, they had to
          attend the banquet and think of a way to make Gu Changge move Sky King
          Zhi Yang away.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sects were all shocked after getting wind of this, knowing that
          this was no trivial matter. The empire was like a mere ant compared to
          Gu Changge, and he wouldn&#8217;t care about it, much less think about
          the empire&#8217;s survival. However, this was the place they had
          built their families and sects. If these were destroyed, it would be
          no different from them dying..</span

          without daring to hesitate. These powerful beings were ancient Elders
          in the Sacred Realm, with the highest only being in the Sacred Noble
          Realm, still some distance away from being in the Sacred Lord Realm.
          Such people came together to discuss the situation.</span

          destroyed, we will be close to extinction as well. Our purpose in
          gathering everyone here is to prepare for the banquet the Emperor will
          hold after three days. What suggestions do you have to make Gu Changge
          move Sky King Zhi Yang? We have never wronged him before, so why is he
          targeting us? This is his evil plan to destroy us without him getting

          >Inside the Royal Tutor&#8217;s mansion, a white-haired old man was
          speaking in a serious voice. He looked extremely dignified and strong
          despite his age. He was Tutor Wang, who had taught the current
          Vermillion Bird Emperor as well as Third Prince Chu Hao. He was
          greatly respected as he had taught many students in his time. Standing
          below him were the current authoritative figures of Royal Tutor
          Mansion, all of whom held key positions within the Vermillion Bird
          Empire. There were also many young prodigies among them, who were his
          direct disciples. They all had infinite potential, with the
          responsibility of making the Royal Tutor Mansion even greater.

          being a middle-aged man clad in a long-sleeved shirt. His eyes shone
          with golden light as he blinked, with runes flowing within. He exuded
          Sacred Realm aura, clearly in the Sacred Noble Realm. He was Yi Tian,
          a servant of the Wang Family.</span

          is destroyed, where shall we go?&#8221; A middle-aged man, who looked
          quite similar to the Royal Tutor, asked. He was the eldest son of
          Tutor Wang.</span

          to find a way to survive. We will never be destroyed along with
          it.&#8221; Someone beside him spoke immediately.

          Will he change his mind for a mere ant like this puny kingdom? We are
          in a completely different league compared to him, so why would he care
          about our opinions and ideas? Father, I think the important thing is
          to leave quickly.&#8221; This was the second son of Tutor Wang, who
          also held an important position within the Empire. His words gained
          the support of the other family members since they did not want to put
          themselves at risk.</span

          let&#8217;s just leave overnight. It&#8217;s obvious that this is Gu
          Changge&#8217;s revenge against the Third Prince Chu Hao for offending
          him.&#8221;</span

          foundations of our sect, which we have built all this time…&#8221;
          Tutor Wang sighed deeply.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Fine, fine. I&#8217;ll listen to your suggestions. We
          shouldn&#8217;t stay here. After offending Gu Changge, there will be
          no place for us in the Upper Realm.&#8221; He made up his mind, no
          longer indecisive about this.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, those from the Wang Family began to pack up, taking what they
          had to and leaving behind what they couldn&#8217;t take with them. The
          empire would be destroyed sooner or later and so would these items. No
          one would miss them. And so, during the night, a flying ship cut
          through the sky with a bright beam of light, making a loud rumbling
          sound as it headed into the distance.
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The same scenario occurred in the other sects of the empire. Anyone
          would know what to choose when it came between protecting their own
          homeland or offending Gu Changge. Most of them chose to leave. The
          invitation from the emperor had become a warning for them to flee, for
          which they were grateful for. If the Emperor hadn&#8217;t explained it
          so clearly in the invitation, they wouldn&#8217;t have realised the
          gravity of the situation. It would be horrible if they died in the
          ensuing disaster without knowing the cause. At this time, no one would
          be stupid enough to die along with the empire. After all, patriotism
          was pure nonsense compared to the survival of their families and
          sects!</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The next day, many cultivators of the empire were stunned to find
          several ancient and glorious families and sects were already gone,
          their quarters and mansions empty. It wasn&#8217;t just one; many
          others with enough power and history had vacated their homes
          overnight, refusing to stay here for another second. It was clear they
          had been panicked as some precious items hadn&#8217;t been taken with
          them and were left behind. It was like staying another moment would
          invite grave danger.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sight sent shockwaves through the empire and many cultivators
          were anxious that something drastic was about to happen. In fear of
          the impending disaster, they left in haste as well, without asking the
          reason behind the phenomenon.

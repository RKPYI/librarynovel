        <h4>Chapter 162: This Level Of Acting Is Simply Superb; How Admirable And Praiseworthy!</h4>
        <p> <strong>[In the ruins far away]</strong> </p>
        <p> Some time after Chi Ling and the others left… </p>
        <p> <strong>Boom!</strong> </p>
        <p> Black clouds surged. The breaths of innumerable beasts spread vastly across the region, like a large shadowy
            storm looking to drown the world. </p>
        <p> Many Young Creatures with terrifying Qi and Vitality stood there unmovingly. They stood as if they were
            facing the edge of the starry skies, their faces solemn and grim. </p>
        <p> One could note all sorts of strange features, from a bull-headed man to a boy with draconic scales, to a
            phoenix-tailed woman... all of them shrouded in divine brilliance, an innate sense of stubbornness and pride
            holding their heads and horns up high. </p>
        <p> These creatures stared at the ruins before them. The behaviour of the Young Supreme of the outside world had
            befuddled them. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Sending such an army of men to encircle and suppress a single individual.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Is it really necessary?’</i> </p>
        <p> At this time, a girl clothed in white climbed up the cliff, her beautiful face watching all of the realms in
            indifference as she whispered softly, <strong>“This action the outside world has taken will give us a great
                opportunity. Our target is Gu Changge, and since the Demonic Arts Inheritor poses a greater risk to them
                than us, they will inevitably falter in their defences.”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Unfortunately, he hasn’t shown up yet.”</strong> </p>
        <p> The breath-taking figure who spoke was Hei Yanyu of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan. </p>
        <p> To the left and right of her, a collection of strongest natives, their Qi and Vitality as fiery and
            energetic as an oven at full steam. A desire to run amok brewed in their fierce eyes. </p>
        <p> Shimmering in the light, a young man with a single horn and ancient azure writing all over his gold-plated
            body snorted in disgust, a member of the Golden Rhinoceros Clan. </p>
        <p> White Divine Elephants, Heavenly Crocodiles, and Black Serpents… </p>
        <p> The descendants of these old and ancient races gazed indifferently upon the events unfolding before them.
        </p>
        <p> A charming woman with golden wings on her back frowned and spoke without hesitance after hearing Hei Yanyu’s
            words. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Both Gu Changge and the outside cultivators are our enemies. Does it matter if we choose to kill
                him or them? Isn’t it all just the same in the end?”</strong> </p>
        <p> This was undoubtedly a member of the Tiangou Race, who possessed no good intentions for both Gu Changge and
            the rest of the outside cultivators. </p>
        <p> The massacre in their Ancient City was still fresh in their minds, after all. </p>
        <p> They didn’t even know who the other party was. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com</p>
        <p> Of course, they believed that it was Gu Changge’s doing, but there was simply no evidence. </p>
        <p> This only served to increase their suspicion and hostility towards the human race tenfold. </p>
        <p> And because of this matter, they got into a multitude of intense conflicts with the outside cultivators.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>“It’s not similar. If we initiate the killing en masse</strong>[1]<strong> of the outsiders first,
                we inevitably attract the anger and dissatisfaction of most of their forces. However, if we go after Gu
                Changge alone in the name of justice, it will not result in that big of a reaction.”</strong> </p>
        <p> [1. All together.] </p>
        <p> Another creature with fine, black serpentine scales scattered upon his slender figure, spoke aloud in a
            cunning manner. The thin pupils of his eyes gleamed chillingly. </p>
        <p> The Ancient Serpent Clan’s Young Supremes were of high status and position. Those who could stand at the top
            of this clan were gifted with astounding temperament, resembling black pieces of pristine jade. </p>
        <p> He took a more detailed look at this matter, calmly analysing the pros and cons. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Humph! Mere cowardice. If Gu Changge doesn’t want to show up, then we’ll simply go to him instead.
                I heard that he was injured quite heavily in the battle with the Demonic Arts Inheritor. Why shouldn’t
                we cherish such a good chance? Unless, of course, you all wish to perish the same way that Lord Long
                Teng did?”</strong> </p>
        <p> The woman of the Tiangou Tribe was named Yu Jing. Her eyes were cold, and her will to seek revenge against
            Gu Changge burst forth in a wave of stony pressure. </p>
        <p> In her opinion, Gu Changge was now seriously injured, thus giving them their best chance of success in this
            crusade against him. </p>
        <p> Comparatively, the rest seemed timid in her eyes, having no courage at all. </p>
        <p> This disappointed the feathered woman. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Forget it. If you seek revenge, then you alone can go. We won’t stop you.”</strong> </p>
        <p> At this pressing moment, Hei Yanyu suddenly spoke up. Her voice soft as a falling feather, yet containing an
            irresistible conviction and overwhelming majesty. </p>
        <p> It made Yu Jing cringe in slight fear. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Ugh—! Humph!”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Let’s leave!”</strong> </p>
        <p> Yu Jing was still a little afraid of Hei Yanyu. The two had fought in a mock battle before this, and she had
            lost the initiative in the first exchange, forced into defence in a single move. </p>
        <p> Strength was highly respected in the Ancient Immortal Continent, maybe even more so than in the Upper
            Realms. Hence, Hei Yanyu indeed had the right to speak out against her since her power was greater than Yu
            Jing’s. </p>
        <p> Soon after, Yu Jing took the Tiangou clan warriors and left in the same direction as Chi Ling, Ye Langtian,
            and the others. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Tch. Foolish. That said... you do make for quite the nice sacrificial pawn. We will be able to determine
                the truth of Gu Changge’s situation through your timely death.’</i> </p>
        <p> Hei Yanyu’s eyes were apathetic and indifferent as she started calculating the situation in her mind. </p>
        <p> She could not show her might so easily. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge’s situation was still unclear. </p>
        <p> Hei Yanyu never dabbled in what-ifs. In her opinion, even weakened and injured, the power of Gu Changge was
            not something ordinary people could deal with. </p>
        <p> For Yu Jing to go rushing in to her death— </p>
        <p> Was that not exactly what she wanted from her? </p>
        <p> <i>‘What a shortsighted idiot.’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Hei Yanyu. Your intelligence has been a point of pride of the Black Heavenly Eagle Tribe ever since
                you were young. Tell me, do you know why our clans have sent so many young and strong members to hunt
                down a young man?”</strong> </p>
        <p> A Young Supreme from the Ancient Serpent Clan questioned her. Hei Yanyu recognized him as a middle stage
            False God Realm cultivator named Yu Yu. </p>
        <p> It was abundantly clear that he was not in the clan at the time of Gu Changge’s arrival. </p>
        <p> The matter of Gu Changge atrocious deeds was kept mostly secret by the various ancient households who did
            not want this humiliating matter publicized. </p>
        <p> And so, some members ended up not being in the know even now. </p>
        <p> <strong>“The Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation has appeared...”</strong> Hei Yanyu replied
            casually, taking only a single glance at Yu Yu. </p>
        <p> This matter was not a secret in the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan. </p>
        <p> Furthermore, she was one of the few people who knew about the slave mark. </p>
        <p> Hei Yanyu’s urge to kill the heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation was even stronger than her urge to
            deal with Gu Changge or her urge to garner fame amongst the Ancient Immortal Races. </p>
        <p> She was a mighty figure who intended to lead the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan to glory. </p>
        <p> Yet at this time, the Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation suddenly appeared, with the ability to
            enslave their entire family through the slave seal. </p>
        <p> To put it bluntly, it made a mockery of her efforts, so how could she be expected to just bear it? </p>
        <p> However, she did not know who this unlucky successor was. </p>
        <p> She just knew that it was a young man who was being hunted down some time ago. </p>
        <p> A man who had recently disappeared. </p>
        <p> <i>‘I’ll take this opportunity to investigate the matter, and explore the truth of Gu Changge’s current
                state along the way.’</i> There was a sinister gleam in Hei Yanyu’s eyes. </p>
        <p> ... </p>
        <p> <strong>[Within the central pavilion.]</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>Cough! Cough! Cough!</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“I’m sorry to bother my fellow Daoists. This injury is not a problem; it’ll be fine soon.”</strong>
        </p>
        <p> Within the valley gathered many of the younger generations. </p>
        <p> Familiar Young Supremes such as Wang Wushuang, Ye Langtian, and Chi Ling also came here to visit the
            ‘severely injured’ Gu Changge. </p>
        <p> And even the more estranged Young Supremes who heard the news arrived here as well, such as Peng Jin, the
            Great Golden-Winged Peng Clan’s Young Supreme. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge was dressed in a flowing black robe and a wide gown, embroidered with some startlingly realistic
            images of various sights. Mountains, rivers, sun, moon, and stars, all blended seamlessly to give him a
            gorgeous appearance. </p>
        <p> The indifferent man sat on a luxurious chair, raising the glass in his hand, before pouring a mouthful of
            wine for himself. He smiled wryly at everyone in front of him. </p>
        <p> His usual handsome and elegant features were a bit pale, and his complexion was much worse than what the
            masses were used to. </p>
        <p> Anyone who knew him could see his weakness at this moment. </p>
        <p> When they saw this scene, the many Young Supremes could not help but feel a bit of distress in their hearts.
        </p>
        <p> They thought back to the time when this Young Master of the Immortal Gu Family bravely fought and killed
            Long Teng, the leader of the Ancient Immortal Races’ younger generation. Oh, how high-spirited and arrogant
            he looked! </p>
        <p> But now... he seemed like a weak patient recovering from a serious illness. </p>
        <p> It was as if a breeze could blow him away. </p>
        <p> They felt a deep concern as they could not help but pinch the corners of their skirt, expressing their
            frustration towards the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor. </p>
        <p> <i>’Young Master Changge’s current state is all because of the Demonic Arts Inheritor. He has suffered a
                grave injury for the sake of the world...’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>When they thought of this, their gratitude and sympathy for him</i> quickly overflowed. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Brother Changge’s injury has affected his Origin, and I am afraid that complete recovery will take
                a while.”</strong> </p>
        <p> When Wang Wushuang investigated Gu Changge’s injury, he couldn’t help but sigh. </p>
        <p> No mortal wounds. </p>
        <p> However, the injury wasn’t as light as it seemed. </p>
        <p> The main damage was done directly to Gu Changge’s Origin. </p>
        <p> For Gu Changge to suffer such a big loss, the strength of this Demonic Arts Inheritor can truly not be
            underestimated. </p>
        <p> He shook his head internally, his vigilance towards Ye Ling rising by several levels. </p>
        <p> As for doubting Gu Changge? </p>
        <p> The thought hadn’t crossed his mind, unable to find even the slightest reason to do so. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Brother Changge, please cultivate in seclusion for a while. If the various clans of the Ancient
                Immortal Continent wish to trouble you, I will not be kind to them.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Peng Fei of the Great Golden-Winged Peng Clan also opened his mouth to speak at this time, his entire body
            surging with golden energy. </p>
        <p> His temperament was rebellious and unruly, but today, Gu Changge had convinced him. </p>
        <p> A few days ago, he was unable to participate in the crusade against Ye Ling because of a fortuitous
            opportunity, missing the decisive battle against the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor. </p>
        <p> So seeing Gu Changge in such a state made him feel a sense of admiration. </p>
        <p> Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritors were monsters that anyone could attack and kill. </p>
        <p> But how many could gravely wound them to the level Gu Changge did? </p>
        <p> <strong>“That’s right! If the various clans of the Ancient Immortal Races dare take advantage of Brother
                Gu’s injured state to trouble him during this time, then we have a duty to protect him! Hell, why don’t
                we just kill off the Ancient Immortal Races!”</strong> </p>
        <p> A Young Supreme with a short temper slapped his thigh and declared boldly. </p>
        <p> The fact that Gu Changge had offended the various clans of the Ancient Immortal Continent was already common
            knowledge to most forces from the Upper Realms. </p>
        <p> And now that he is seriously injured, the possibility of him being attacked by the various clans of the
            Ancient Immortal Continent has now risen exponentially. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Brother Changge. Please rest assured and cultivate to relieve your injury...”</strong> Chi Ling
            voiced her opinion as well. </p>
        <p> <strong>“There is no need to trouble yourself, Brother Gu. You can trust us to handle this matter.”</strong>
            Ye Langtian said. </p>
        <p> Damage to the Origin was very deadly for ordinary cultivators. One misstep and it may even result in
            permanent injuries or being half-crippled. </p>
        <p> Of course, for a genius like Gu Changge, it might not be that big a problem. </p>
        <p> However, while on this trip to the Ancient Immortal Continent, it would simply be impossible to say that the
            wound will not be aggravated in any way. </p>
        <p> <strong>“It’s all my fault. If I hadn’t trusted Ye Ling, Senior Brother Gu wouldn’t have been hurt. At that
                time, that b*****d Ye Ling threatened Senior Brother Gu with my life...”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“If it weren’t for me, he wouldn’t have needed to suffer such injury.”</strong> </p>
        <p> It was at this moment that Yin Mei spoke up. This entire time, she had guilt and regret written on her face
            as her eyes turned red and watery when she let out the words. </p>
        <p> The maiden’s sincere expression made everyone sigh. </p>
        <p> It was a fact that people revealed their true selves in times of peril. In order to save his junior sister,
            Gu Changge was willing to take unnecessary damage that could possibly and irreversibly ruin his future, a
            testament to his unshakable character. </p>
        <p> The matter alone was enough to make them praise and admire him for days to come. </p>
        <p> <strong>“I feel ashamed for having bothered my fellow Daoists so much.”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“Furthermore, Junior Sister Yin does not need to feel guilty. Although there was a conflict between
                you and me in the past, in the face of the Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritor, we should all act as one to
                persecute him. I’m sure everyone here would have done the same.”</strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>“So do not worry, a small injury like this won’t affect me too much...” </strong> </p>
        <p> <strong>Cough! Cough!</strong> </p>
        <p> Hearing Yin Mei’s scripted remarks, Gu Changge, who had a faint smile on his face, simply followed up on his
            end. </p>
        <p> And he coughed oh so pitifully as he spoke. </p>
        <p> When they saw this situation, his female followers on the side hurriedly took out plain white handkerchiefs,
            all while tears silently beaded at the corners of their eyes. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge covered the edge of his lips, smudged with a dazzling red. </p>
        <p> Everyone showed a complicated look as their admiration of him increased. </p>
        <p> The lines of play that came out of Gu Changge’s mouth were phenomenal and impeccably natural, to the point
            where no one would doubt their authenticity at all. </p>
        <p> Soon after the greetings and well wishes, everyone said their goodbyes, not intending to disturb Gu
            Changge’s rest any longer. </p>
        <p> For a time, the vicinity of the valley became empty and deserted. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Brother Changge, please take care of yourself, and remember to rest more. This Chi Ling will leave
                first to avoid bothering you.”</strong>Chi Ling also took her leave. </p>
        <p> And when she did so, Gu Changge waved his hands to dismiss his followers. </p>
        <p> Now only he and Yin Mei were left. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Master...”</strong> The guilty, sobbing look on Yin Mei’s face vanished without a trace, replaced
            with an odd expression that looked as if she was holding back laughter. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Everyone is simply dancing in the palm of your hand.”</strong> </p>
        <p> Smiling, Gu Changge turned the plain white handkerchief into a cloud of dust, sweeping away the false signs
            of weakness on his body along with it. </p>
        <p> <strong>“A bunch of idiots, what can they see?”</strong> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Unless an ancient existence with an extraordinary cultivation base were to arrive, I’m afraid that there
                will be none in the world capable of finding the truth of this matter.’</i> </p>
        <p> <strong>“It is thanks to Master’s flawless acting and seamless planning that allowed for such a thing to
                happen.” </strong>Yin Mei spoke happily. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge smiled with a sense of neither confirming nor denying her words before his eyes narrowed and a
            cold air began to coalesce around him. </p>
        <p> <strong>“But now… I think it’s about time I finally dealt with the arrogant clans of the Ancient Immortal
                Races.”</strong> </p>
        <p> As for the matter of his identity as the true Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts, he could temporarily
            put it on the back burner after this. </p>
        <p> The populace won’t be able to find the truth for a very long time. </p>
        <p> And this period, the time when Ye Ling has disappeared, was his best chance for action. </p>
        <p> ... </p>
        <p> Subsequently, news and reports pertaining to the ‘Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor, Ye Ling’ began
            circulating throughout the Ancient Immortal Continent. </p>
        <p> An outrage erupted as people realized that the Ancestral Tombs of certain Ancient Immortal Races had been
            dug up by who knows when, and by who knows who. </p>
        <p> Moreover, the culprit had long since turned the ancestors they buried into ashes. </p>
        <p> An old saying regarding the scattering and raising of ancestors’ ashes comes to mind. </p>
        <p> The Ancient Immortal Races boiled with fury! The shocking incident made almost every clan from North to
            South jump, as they too threatened to kill the Forbidden Demonic Arts’ Inheritor. </p>
        <p> <i>‘He dared to excavate the sacred tombs and desecrate our ancestor’s bodies?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘He must be </i><strong><i>COURTING DEATH!’</i></strong> </p>
        <p> An indescribable humiliation. </p>
        <p> This was a naked slap to their collective faces! </p>
        <p> In the beginning, they took on a gloating attitude as if watching a grand show when the outside cultivators
            encountered the Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritor in their lands. </p>
        <p> But now that the hammer had fallen onto their hands, they could not calm down at all. </p>
        <p> The major clans such as Black Heavenly Eagle, Ancient Serpent, and Divine Crocodiles were so angry that they
            vomited blood. </p>
        <p> Many of their Ancestral Tombs had been devoured, and even their most sacred tombs had been looted and picked
            clean. </p>
        <p> All the clans felt a similar sense of crisis and quickly sent their tribesmen to guard their tombs, aiming
            to prevent the Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritor from sneaking in. </p>
        <p> The damage was not limited to the mere digging of ancestral tombs. The very ashes of their ancestors were
            stirred, such an immoral thing gave a deep sense of discomfort that was worse than death, for these ancient
            clans who held their bloodline in high regard. </p>
        <p> The faces of the Ancient Immortal Continent’s older generation were ashen with anger. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, the Forbidden Demonic Arts Inheritor had seemingly disappeared during this time, without even
            the slightest bit of movement. </p>
        <p> Yet that was exactly what made it disturbing. </p>
        <p> No one knows where the Demonic Arts Inheritor was hiding. </p>
        <p> <strong>[In the Baiheng Mountains]</strong> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong, who worried about the Immortal Gate, also received news of the situation. </p>
        <p> Her phoenix eyes immediately overflowed with a biting chill, and she snapped the jade slip transmitting this
            information into fine powder, causing many nearby mountains to rumble and tremble as if they were about to
            collapse. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge can deceive the world, but how could he deceive her? </p>
        <p> <i>‘Injured?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘As if Gu Changge could be injured. What a joke, such a thing is impossible.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘This was definitely a result of his masterful handiwork.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>’And her! That fox spirit! So it seems she finally dares show herself in front of this Empress!’</i> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong realized something else as well. </p>
        <p> Everything became clear now. </p>
        <p> Regardless of whether it was Ye Ling or Bai Lie, there was always one singular woman beside them. And it was
            the same woman, no less. </p>
        <p> Yin Mei, the Holy Maiden of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family. </p>
        <p> At first, Yue Mingkong never thought that she would have a relationship with Gu Changge since there was
            indeed a conflict between the two. </p>
        <p> <i>‘If not for her help, how else could Gu Changge have possibly enacted his scheme of having the ‘hero’
                save the damsel? How else could his schemes have been enacted so flawlessly and coordinated so perfectly
                with today’s events? Rescuing Yin Mei from Ye Ling?’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘What a bold-faced lie!’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘From the beginning, this Yin Mei must have been one of Gu Changge’s people. For some unknown reason, the
                Holy Maiden of the Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox Family had been subdued and used in his schemes.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘Only in doing so could the follow events have proceeded so smoothly.’</i> </p>
        <p> <i>‘So that fox spirit I smelled on Gu Changge was indeed a fox…’</i> </p>
        <p> This made Yue Mingkong’s phoenix eyes burst with a cold light, as her white jade hand slapped the mountains
            in front of her into dust. </p>
        <p> Within a radius of a thousand miles, no creature dared to approach the impending disaster. </p>
        <p> Even her followers were terrified, thinking that Yue Mingkong had heard that Gu Changge was injured, and was
            furious because of it. </p>
        <p> <i>‘Ye Ling seems to have been killed by Gu Changge. Thus, it is only natural for the treasures of the
                Ancient Deity of Reincarnation to have already fallen into his hands.’</i> </p>
        <p> Yue Mingkong regained her cool moments later. </p>
        <p> She still recognized that her top priority was the Immortal Gate. </p>
        <p> As for the ‘fox spirit’... she would go to settle accounts with her sooner or later. </p>
        <p> ... ... ... </p>
        <p> <strong>[Hundreds of thousands of miles away]</strong> </p>
        <p> During Yue Mingkong’s rampage, on a cloud-shrouded cliff, the meditating Gu Xian’er heard the startling
            news, her cold and arrogant expression quickly tangling into a complicated knot. </p>
        <p> <strong>“Gu Changge...”</strong> </p>
        <p> A muttered sigh echoed through the mountaintops.</p>

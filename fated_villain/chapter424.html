          &#8216;Zhan&#8217; word as they were trying to figure out what it was.
          Some of them were even looking at it with greed and passion in their
          eyes. After all, if Li Xiu the good-for-nothing was capable of using
          such an ability, they should be able to do so as well.</span

          Zhan, which he bumped into in a fateful encounter. And now, he was
          wondering about Li Xiu&#8217;s true identity. If Li Xiu was really who
          he presumed, Heavenly Tide Realm would grow especially inharmonious,
          given the Upper Realm&#8217;s war with Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. With the emergence of the Rune of Zhan, the rest of the world
          would surely be shocked.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, it didn&#8217;t matter whether Li Xiu was the owner
          or successor of the Rune of Zhan. Regardless of his position in the
          past, once he offended Gu Changge, his efforts would only turn out
          futile.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Though, the Ancestor of the Shen Family couldn&#8217;t tell whether
          Gu Changge was knowledgeable about the Rune of Zhan or he was
          deliberately offending Li Xiu.</span

          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, this old one is too senile to take him
          down. I have humiliated myself in front of you…&#8221; After the Shen
          Family members helped their Second Elder up, he walked towards Gu
          Changge and apologised with an embarrassed face, not expecting things
          to turn out this way.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Not only did he fail to take Li Xiu down, but he was also grievously
          wounded by the mysterious &#8216;Zhan (战)&#8217; Rune. A Rune that
          described War! Hence, he was ashamed, especially after how he swore
          that he would definitely defeat Li Xiu.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Alas, he was miserably beaten by Li Xiu right in front of the entire
          crowd, and he couldn&#8217;t feel any more disgraced by that.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then, Gu Changge took a glance at the Second Elder without a change
          in his gaze, after which he turned back to Li Xiu and replied in
          fascination, &#8220;You are not to be blamed. Indeed, you are no match
          for him. Even if you reached the Sacred King Realm, you would still be
          incapable of shattering his defences.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, he was already determined about Li Xiu&#8217;s
          identity, which explained the latter&#8217;s smugness.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Hmm, is he still purely the In-Law Fortuitous One, or is he the
          formidable cultivator who has returned. Perhaps both?] Gu Changge was
          fascinated. In fact, the Fortuitous One of such a character he met in
          the past was the Mortal One. However, the current Li Xiu was not some
          weakling that the Mortal One could rival as the former must have
          countless followers remaining.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >According to the rumours, ever since Li Xiu died, his followers had
          been living in hiding, and now that he had returned, the disturbance
          he caused drew the attention of hundreds of thousands of his
          followers.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Besides, the Rune of Zhan was capable of parrying all attacks of all
          under the Sacred King Realm, but that was all it could offer.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Li Xiu grew somewhat dazed, but he quickly regained his
          composure. He never expected Gu CHangge to have seen through
          him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As a matter of fact, his purposeful usage of the Rune of Zhan was to
          let the crowd understand his position. Unfortunately, the Shen Family
          was too ignorant to recognise him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Yet, Gu Changge was able to identify the limit of the Rune of Zhan,
          which certainly took him aback.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, the Second Elder of the Shen Family felt ashamed.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, a formidable cultivator behind Gu Changge suddenly
          handed the Second Elder a round pill surrounded by intertwining Dao
          Energy and swirling purple energy.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;This is… a Nine-Cycles Great Restoration Pill? Though
          initially dismayed, the Second Elder of the Shen Family widened his
          eyes as his breath quickened.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even the Ancestor of the Shen Family was unable to steer his gaze
          away from the pill, feeling deeply envious of the Second Elder. As
          such, the injuries and humiliation he received no longer bothered
          him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Nine-Cycles Great Restoration Pill was a kind of godly pill which
          was useful even to those in the Sacred Emperor Realm, and it could
          even be perceived as an additional life.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After carefully observing the pill, the crowd instantly gasped in
          disbelief before finding themselves incredibly envious of the Second
          Elder.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          be repaid with luxuries.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In this instant, everyone who didn&#8217;t think of helping Gu
          Changge immediately felt remorseful as they had missed the opportunity
          to pull off heroic acts before Gu Changge.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Thank you, Young Master Changge,&#8221; said the Second Elder
          gleefully, after which he respectfully accepted the pill with all the
          joy in his heart.</span

          >Right at that moment, outside the Shen Family Residence, divine
          rainbows were seen heading towards the courtyard. A great number of
          alarming auras came from each direction, and they were of individuals
          with significant positions in Heavenly Tide Realm. They appeared hasty
          on their way to the Shen Family Residence, eager to meet with a
          certain being.</span

        <p><strong>Translator: Fate</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The palace was divided into two sections, and Gu Changge, donning his white
                robe, was sitting in the primary seat. His inky hair was sparkling with vibrant mists while his eyes
                were amiable and calm. In a graceful posture, he put the glass of White Jade Wine near to his lips.
                Carrying a faint smile, spoke with Xiao Ruoyin.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span><span id="more-28954"></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Xiao Ruoyin, blessed with delicate, captivating features,
                toasted to Gu Changge. Her face was rather red and her eyes were glistening. As she was conversing with
                Gu Changge, she grew more accustomed and astounded with the vastness and mysteriousness of this
                world</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That admirer of yours doesn&#8217;t seem right. Shouldn&#8217;t you
                check on him?&#8221; Suddenly, Gu Changge took a glance at Jiang Chen and the rest, who were below him,
                and leisurely inquired.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Xiao Ruoyin turned around and subconsciously tensed her brows
                when she saw Jiang Chen looking at her with an expression of surprise and dismay.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As their eyes came in contact, Jiang Chen stared at her as if he was
                dazed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Xiao Ruoyin felt discomforted by his gaze as she
                didn&#8217;t want Gu Changge to take it the wrong way. Although she merely bore gratitude for him, not
                daring to carry any other thoughts towards him, she didn&#8217;t want him to think that Jiang Chen and
                her shared some sort of special relationship. However, with how Jiang Chen was staring at her, not
                allowing her to salvage her pride, she was visibly irritated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jiang Chen…&#8221; She intuitively shouted at Jiang Chen, sounding
                somewhat angered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Jiang Chen was startled and regained his senses. Ignoring
                Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s grudgeful glare, he hastily lowered his head and continued drinking, obviously
                perturbed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, Niu Tian and the rest could only contain their rattled emotions.
                Nonetheless, it wasn&#8217;t like Xiao Ruoyin did anything wrong. Furthermore, if it weren&#8217;t for
                Xiao Ruoyin, they would still remain in the underground dungeon, without knowing what might have
                happened to them. But of course, they could tell that Jiang Chen&#8217;s action wasn&#8217;t exactly
                unreasonable.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah’chen, you have to calm down…&#8221; Niu Tian felt obliged to warn
                him. &#8220;Xiao Ruoyin is no longer a part of us. You should move on. There&#8217;s plenty of fish in
                the sea. There&#8217;s all sorts of goddess-like women in the world. There&#8217;s no need for you to
                dwell on Xiao Ruoyin, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could tell that it wasn&#8217;t Gu Changge who bore intentions towards
                Xiao Ruoyin, but the other way round. Thus, his form of address for Xiao Ruoyin also changed, unlike how
                he used to refer to her as &#8216;Goddess Xiao.&#8217;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, despite her prideful attitude, Xiao Ruoyin would never completely
                sever her tie with Jiang Chen, and that could only mean that one&#8217;s out-of-reach goddess might only
                be a plain Jane to another.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know. You don&#8217;t have to tell me that, Niu Tian.&#8221; Having
                calmed down, Jiang Chen nodded and stopped looking at the banquet seats in front of him, as though he
                already accepted the reality.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, only Jiang Chen himself knew about his palms that were pierced
                by his fingernails, with his fists clenched tightly. Despite his reluctance and vexation, he ultimately
                chose to understand. Thanks to the clarification of the Artifact Spirit of Celestial Boat of Creation,
                he got the gist of the matter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I knew Gu Changge is no good man. Releasing us and inviting us to this
                banquet and assisting Ruoyin in cultivation. Tsk, how could such a wonderful thing happen in this world?
                It must be merely the pretence of a predator.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaining his calm look, Jiang Chen snickered in his heart as he was
                contemplating a way to solve his problem. As a transmigrator with the Celestial Boat of Creation, all he
                needed to do was make his plans assiduously and he could easily trump Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Jiang Chen, we have to save Mistress. She has yet to reawaken her
                memories, so she&#8217;s very fragile now. She was our original Mistress, and she&#8217;s destined to be
                a High Priestess. We can&#8217;t just ignore her!&gt;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Jiang Chen&#8217;s mind, the Artifact Spirit&#8217;s voice was trembling
                in fear. Losing its complacency, it was now filled with stupefaction, restlessness, and fear, as if Gu
                Changge was some sort of terrorising being.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;That man is highly dangerous. Although I don&#8217;t know who he is, the
                scary sensation from him irresistibly seeps into my soul. It is very dangerous for Mistress to be by his
                side, and we won&#8217;t see it coming when he eventually hurts her,&gt; the Artifact Spirit
                persistently explained, awfully concerned.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Jiang Chen cut in with a composed look, [Got it. Now, you just
                have to tell me what your functions are and how you can be of use to me. Ruoyin still doesn&#8217;t know
                she&#8217;s being manipulated by Gu Changge, and nobody except us is able to save her.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the spirit artifact of Celestial Boat of Creation answered,
                &lt;Since I&#8217;ve just awakened recently, my uses are quite limited, but my biggest features are my
                abilities to observe fate and Fortituity, as well as dispelling arrays. I can even transfigure your
                physique to the Sacred Physique of Creation.&gt;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sacred Physique of Creation? What kind of physique is that? It already
                sounds so cool!] Jiang Chen then asked, [Also, what are observing fate, Fortituity, and dispelling
                arrays for?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;I won&#8217;t tell you how powerful the Sacred Physique of Creation is.
                All you have to know is that it is one of the Ten Mightiest Sacred Physiques as it allows one massive
                strength and the mastery of the Dao of Creation. As long as we get out of here and head to the outside
                world, with my ability, I can help you to effortlessly locate the opportunities normal people
                can&#8217;t and identify treasures that are indiscernible to others. Furthermore, Origin Stones,
                mountainous terrains, and sealing arrays are no problem to me,&gt; the spirit artifact of Celestial Boat
                of Creation explained with its habitual smugness.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So it&#8217;s something like taking cheating in stone gambling?] Listening
                attentively to the Artifact Spirit, Jiang Chen nodded as a glimmer of hope occurred in his heart.
                Though, to others, he was still bitterly chugging down his wine.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did his cheat get activated? Well, it should be about time.] On the primary
                seat, Gu Changge finished the wine in his glass with a gulp. Carrying a subtle smile, he was constantly
                observing Jiang Chen&#8217;s movement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his eyes, Jiang Chen&#8217;s Fortuity was exponentially growing, as if it
                was an erupting volcano, unlike how it would only encounter a minor bump once in a while. In other
                words, Jiang Chen finally became a true Fortuitous One and received his own cheat, as well as his right
                to become Gu Changge&#8217;s prey.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[One is the spirit and the other is the vessel, Reversed Universe of
                Creation? What can they possibly mean? Perhaps they&#8217;re related to the Celestial Boat of Creation?]
                Gu Changge ponder on the answer his System gave him as his eyes grew enthralling.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, he figured out what kind of character Jiang Chen was. Possessing
                an Artifact Spirit, he was reincarnated as a person, and the rest was only simple, trivial
                stories.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Qingxuan, why don&#8217;t you fetch some Fruits of Knowledge
                over?&#8221; All of a sudden, Gu Changge ordered Ji Qingxuan who was beside him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fruit of Knowledge, as its name suggested, could allow its consumer to
                swiftly understand the languages of this world, and it was an object of utmost rarity to cultivators
                that ascended from the Lower Realms and were unfamiliar with the languages of the Upper Realm.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As you wish, Young Master Gu.&#8221; Immediately, Ji Qingxuan stood up
                and went to grab some fruits. As a matter of fact, the Upper Realm was abundant in Fruits of Knowledge
                as they could be commonly found in shops and stalls.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fruit of Knowledge?&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin turned to Gu Changge with a
                look of bafflement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her confused expression, Hei Yanyu slightly smiled and explained,
                &#8220;It&#8217;s a common spirit fruit in the Upper Realm. Since you and your acquaintances do not
                understand the languages of this world, you&#8217;ll quickly understand what we say once you consume it.
                Thereupon, even if your friends failed in cultivating, they could still live comfortably in this
                world.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon Hei Yanyu&#8217;s explanation, Xiao Ruoyin was enlightened and she grew
                even more thankful to Gu Changge as sentimentality surged in her heart. Earlier, she simply mentioned
                that her acquaintances intended to learn to cultivate, and to her surprise, not only did Gu Changge
                agree to help, but he even provided them with Fruits of Knowledge. As such, she felt as though she was
                eternally indebted to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you so much, Young Master Gu,&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin softly thanked
                Gu Changge as she looked at him with her charming, crimson eyes, thinking that Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t
                have minded such an insignificant matter if it weren&#8217;t for her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. Don&#8217;t mention it,&#8221; Gu Changge replied
                with a smile, seemingly unbothered as he continued to toast and drink.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Ji Qingxuan returned with a jade plate in her hands. On the jade
                plate, there were seven exquisite, vibrantly glowing fruits with the size of a fist covered in gleaming
                mists. At the same time, the fruits emitted a wondrous scent and a thick aroma that could give anyone
                goosebumps.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So these are the Fruits of Knowledge…&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin curiously
                peered at the fruits.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are indeed.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, Xiao Ruoyin got up from her seat and accepted the jade
                plate from Ji Qingxuan before walking towards Jiang Chen, Niu Tian and the rest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon their puzzled faces, Xiao Ruoyin revealed a smile and explained,
                &#8220;These are the Fruits of Knowledge. Once we eat them, we&#8217;ll be able to understand the
                languages of this world. Other than this, Young Master Gu also accepted my request, and shortly,
                you&#8217;ll be able to test out whether you have the aptitude for cultivation.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Fruits of Knowledge?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seriously?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s great! Young Master Gu is so kind!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, Niu Tian, Wang Ning, and the rest were dazed. When they realised
                what was happening, their faces instantly reddened from the thrill as they instantly got excited,
                shooting gazes of gratitude towards Gu Changge and Xiao Ruoyin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, they couldn&#8217;t be more grateful to Gu Changge as not
                only did he agree to help them, but he even gave them the Fruits of Knowledge so they could understand
                the languages of this world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, they couldn&#8217;t feel more indebted to Gu Changge, and the
                frustration they amassed from being confined completely dispersed. In fact, they didn&#8217;t even care
                about their fallen friend anymore as they would soon be cloud-riding, stars-picking godlike
                beings.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu is quite a good man. No wonder Xiao Ruoyin has changed
                to act like this…&#8221; Niu Tian muttered, but fearing that he might upset Jiang Chen, he quickly shut
                his mouth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, at this point, Jiang Chen no longer cared about it, nodding and
                revealing a faint smile as he agreed, &#8220;Indeed. Young Master Gu is a wonderful man. I must have
                been blind to misunderstand him.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, he turned to Xiao Ruoyin and added, &#8220;Ruoyin, you must
                relay my gratitude to Young Master Gu. I will never forget what he did for us.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was no fool, he was aware that causing a scene out of momentary
                frustration not only would upset Gu Changge, but he would also attract Gu Changge&#8217;s attention,
                which would be disadvantageous for his future plans.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Xiao Ruoyin revealed a smile on her emotionless face.
                &#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll pass it to Young Master Gu, though I think it&#8217;s best that you tell him
                yourself. Given his personality, I&#8217;m sure he won&#8217;t blame you.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite saying that, Xiao Ruoyin couldn&#8217;t help but be relieved as she
                was still worried that Jiang Chen might still bear a grudge. Otherwise, given Jiang Chen&#8217;s
                strength, him going up against Gu Changge would be equivalent to striking a rock with an egg, and that
                would only lead to his demise. As his acquaintance, she didn&#8217;t want to see Jiang Chen throwing his
                life away either.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course. Whenever I have the chance.&#8221; Not affected by Xiao
                Ruoyin&#8217;s words, Jiang Chen responded with a slight smile as he grabbed one of the Fruits of
                Knowledge on the jade plate. However, instead of eating the fruit right away like the others, he
                curiously, carefully studied it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a deep glance at him, Xiao Ruoyin, for some reason, felt as though
                Jiang Chen was different than before. It was as if he became another person. Judging by his refreshing
                sense of confidence and serenity, it wouldn&#8217;t be an overstatement to say that he was reborn. In
                such a short time, Jiang Chen went through such a drastic change, and after a moment of contemplation,
                Xiao Ruoyin could only come to a conclusion, it was the evolution of Jiang Chen&#8217;s mind when he
                came to realise that he could also take on the Path of Cultivation.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve thought this through,&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin
                said with a smile before returning to Gu Changge&#8217;s side and discreetly discussing some matter with
                him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Gu Changge, in his elegant posture, politely chatted with a smile.
                Naturally, he answered every question of hers without omitting any details.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Niu Tian, Wang Ning, and the rest impatiently consumed the
                Fruits of Knowledge the moment they got their hands on them. Since it was their first time eating a
                spirit fruit of the Upper Realm, they were indubitably stunned by the wondrous sensation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant they swallowed the Fruits of Knowledge, the fruits turned into a
                spring, filling their bodies with an invigorating sensation as every cell and inch of their skin felt
                the fantastic gush of magical energy. They also felt a revitalising aura entering their heads, as if it
                was opening their minds. At once, the inaudible noises around them suddenly became crystal clear.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How wonderful…&#8221; One of them widened his eyes in disbelief when
                he realised he could understand the conversation happening around him. As such, he grew extremely
                ecstatic. [Am I going to be a flying Immortal whose presence alone attracts the most beautiful women in
                the world? Am I going to control the world?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Niu Tian…&#8221; Watching as Niu Tian eagerly swallowed the fruit in
                his hand, Jiang Chen revealed a scowl. He wanted to warn Niu Tian to wait a little longer before eating
                the fruit, but it was too late, and he could only helplessly sigh.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, Jiang Chen was aware of Gu Changge&#8217;s evil intentions, and
                the Fruits of Knowledge Gu Changge gave them might be problematic, so cautious would be useful at such a
                moment. Besides, Jiang Chen could already understand the languages of this world, so it didn&#8217;t
                matter whether he consumed the Fruit of Knowledge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; After eating the fruit, Niu Tian turned to
                Jiang Chen with a baffled look and assumed that he was reluctant to consume it out of concern that the
                fruit might be unsafe, after which he subconsciously laughed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s safe.
                We can already understand what they&#8217;re saying. This fruit is indeed wonderful.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm.&#8221; Jiang Chen nodded, but in reality, he was questioning the
                Artifact Spirit of Celestial Boat of Creation in his heart. However, if he refused to eat the fruit now,
                he would be disrespecting Gu Changge right in front of everyone, and who knew what the consequences
                would be.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Jiang Chen, don&#8217;t eat the fruit. I mean, put it in your mouth but
                don&#8217;t swallow it. For some reason, this Fruit of Knowledge feels different from the usual ones.
                You must remain wary,&gt; the Artifact Spirit of Celestial Boat of Creation warned Jiang Chen with
                uneasiness and caution in its child-like voice.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mm, got it.] Jiang Chen nodded and swallowed the fruit right before
                everyone&#8217;s eyes. However, when the Fruit of Knowledge was melting into a spring, he didn&#8217;t
                swallow it like the rest, and instead, he kept it in his mouth before pretending to swallow it by moving
                his throat.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Jiang Chen would continue drinking on his own, seemingly troubled.
                Nonetheless, as if he chugged the wine down too quickly, he seemed to have choked and immediately
                vomited the alcohol in his mouth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Steady, brother! What&#8217;s the rush?&#8221; Niu Tian helplessly
                stared at Jiang Chen, but knowing that Jiang Chen was currently upset, he stopped himself from saying
                anything more.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m fine now.&#8221; Jiang Chen chortled
                as if nothing just happened.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, on the primal seat, Gu Changge, who caught every sneaky
                action of Jiang Chen, intuitively laughed without exposing him. To him, Jiang Chen&#8217;s actions were
                nothing but ridiculous child&#8217;s play as they wouldn&#8217;t affect him in the slightest.
                Nevertheless, in order to allow Jiang Chen to grow into a healthy, vigorous leek, Gu Changge
                didn&#8217;t mind him pulling off this little mischiefs.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, Jiang Chen wanted me to relay his apology for his
                rashness back then, and hope that you&#8217;d be generous to forgive him.&#8221; A waft of a subtle
                fragrance could be detected.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Xiao Ruoyin didn&#8217;t know what Gu Changge was thinking, and
                she passed on Jiang Chen&#8217;s message as she raised her glass to Gu Changge and toasted.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. Such a small matter means nothing to me.&#8221; Gu
                Changge turned to her with an unbothered smile.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin seemed to be blushing, as though she grew
                bashful upon Gu Changge&#8217;s gaze.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that from afar, after a moment of visible awkwardness, Jiang Chen
                quickly regained his composure, though the clenching fists hidden under the table remained
                forceful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, the guests would indulge in the banquet as many appeared to have
                gotten drunk. As Niu Tian, Wang Ning, and the rest lost their alertness against Gu Changge, one of them
                was even so bold as to toast to Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Gu Changge simply nodded like an amicable man with his usual,
                ever so noble smile, leaving the crowd pleasantly surprised.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, as the banquet neared its end, a figure suddenly appeared outside
                the palace.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She&#8217;s here?] Sensing the minor disturbance, Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes
                slightly moved towards the direction.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the air, a stunning woman in a scarlet robe showed up. Her bare feet were
                paler than snow; her skin, as white as snow, was glowing amid godly mists. Her features were impeccable;
                her tranquil eyes resembled glassy gems, and there was a mole at the corner of her eye, accentuating her
                extraordinary charm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, Niu Tian and the rest were dumbfounded and their breaths grew
                unstable as they never saw such a perfect being, who could be labelled as the most beautiful woman in
                the world. Be it Hei Yanyu or Ji Qingxuan, none of them carried the same elegance and grace as the woman
                in red.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She must be a terrifying, formidable cultivator!] The crowd intuitively
                thought.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Gu.&#8221; Unquestionably, the woman in red
                was Yan Ji, who hurried over upon receiving Gu Changge&#8217;s instruction. As of now, her aura was
                significantly more daunting compared to before as she was now in the Sacred King Realm. Although she
                just broke through recently, she would never forget that she was merely a Cursed Spirit, who could have
                faded away anytime before she first met Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Congratulations, you&#8217;ve reached the Sacred King Realm. It seems
                you didn&#8217;t let me down,&#8221; Gu Changge smilingly stated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yan Ji silently looked at him and turned to Ji Qingxuan, Hei Yanyu, and Xiao
                Ruoyin accordingly. There was no telling what she was thinking.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thought you had forgotten about me, Young Master Gu.&#8221; Yan Ji
                sounded rather calm, but Niu Tian and the rest sensed a vague jealousy in her tone. Thereupon, they grew
                immensely envious as their eyes reddened. [When can we have such a beautiful woman by our side?]</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why? Did you not enjoy cultivating in silence?&#8221; Gu Changge let
                out a chuckle before turning to Xiao Ruoyin and stated, &#8220;This is the mentor I&#8217;ve found for
                you. From now on, she&#8217;ll guide you in cultivation.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My mentor?&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin was somewhat dazed. Initially, she
                thought the mentor Gu Changge looked for for her would be some old man with his hair full of white hair.
                Little did she expect, her mentor turned out to be an excessively beguiling woman.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Xiao Ruoyin quickly regained her senses and hastily greeted,
                &#8220;Honoured to meet you, Master.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she didn&#8217;t have any experience of cultivating, she was aware
                of the cultivation levels in this world, and the excessively beguiling woman before her who seemed to be
                around her age, was actually in the Sacred King Realm. As for the significance of a Sacred King, Xiao
                Ruoyin was very much aware of it, so she had nothing but respect for her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the purpose of Gu Changge summoning her, Yan Ji wasn&#8217;t
                confused. With a tranquil look, she had Xiao Ruoyin be at ease.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Master?] Niu Tian, Wang Tian, and the rest never expected Gu Changge even
                arranged a mentor for Xiao Ruoyin, let alone such a bewitching one. As such, they were left greatly
                envious.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sacred King Realm… What level is that? Is that very strong?] Nonetheless,
                Jiang Chen&#8217;s focus was on another point as he asked the spirit artifact of Celestial Boat of
                Creation about the strength of the Sacred King Realm and intended to estimate Gu Changge&#8217;s true
                power. After all, Gu Changge, being able to make someone with that cultivation level subservient to him,
                must be far more powerful than the Sacred King Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the spirit artifact of Celestial Boat of Creation, who was
                rather boastful earlier, suddenly grew wordless, after which it replied, &lt;Very strong. For you right
                now, too strong. Too powerful.&gt; It even accented its words, fearing that Jiang Chen might fail to
                comprehend its message.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So how strong is it?] Jiang Chen wasn&#8217;t exactly satisfied with the
                spirit artifact&#8217;s answer.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;They can destroy an entire star with a lift of a finger…&gt; The spirit
                artifact of Celestial Boat of Creation replied.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What!?] Despite his intense resentment towards Gu Changge and urge to avenge
                himself, Jiang Chen couldn&#8217;t help but gasp, shaking as he was overwhelmed by a chilly sensation.
                [If the woman&#8217;s in the Sacred King Realm, then how powerful is Gu Changge? I can&#8217;t even
                begin to imagine!]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, as if he was bashed with a bucket of cold water, chills
                overwhelmed his body. The determination and confidence he had earlier instantaneously vanished as they
                were replaced by hopelessness. [Destroying a star with a lift of a finger? How is that possible? In
                other words, Gu Changge can obliterate the world I previously lived in with a lift of a finger? Can a
                person actually be that powerful?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Don&#8217;t lose hope, alright? By the time we reach our peak, Immortals
                are hardly a trouble. Look at you, so startled by someone only in the Sacred King Realm…&gt; Detecting
                Jiang Chen&#8217;s strangeness, the spirit artifact of Celestial Boat of Creation hastily comforted him.
                Although he currently has no chance to beat an expert in the Sacred King Realm, in the future, such
                experts would be nothing but insects to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Jiang Chen was successfully convinced, after which he swiftly
                calmed. Although he was indeed weak now, no one could truly predict the future.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Oh boy, your mind still has a long way to go,&gt; the spirit artifact of
                Celestial Boat of Creation stated.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the banquet ended.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Ruoyin brought Jiang Chen, Niu Tian, and the rest to test out their
                aptitude and physique, but instead of following them, Gu Changge dismissed Hei Yanyu and Ji Qingxuan,
                staying behind in the palace with Yan Ji, alone.</span></p>

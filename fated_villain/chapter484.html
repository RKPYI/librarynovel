          almost collapsing. All the living beings in the Eight Wastelands and
          Ten Domains had fallen into despair because of such a scene. It

          power of an external item now. The Celestial Seal of the Nine
          Mountains might be powerful, but there was a limit to it after all. As
          long as they continued to make Gu Changge consume its power, Gu

          Daoists didn&#8217;t have it easy either. The Lu Clan&#8217;s Ancestor
          was especially injured, and was covered in blood when Gu

          determinedly at her cousin, wanting him to know she was there for him.
          However, before she could even finish her words, Gu Changge whacked
          her on the head, making her cry out in pain. &#8220;What was that

          have never been willing to humble yourself. Will it kill you to
          appreciate other people&#8217;s kind wishes for once!?&#8221;</span

          However, his reaction still caught her off guard, leaving her
          dumbfounded for a moment. But very quickly, she came to herself and
          snorted. &#8220;You&#8217;re the dummy. You better not overthink it. I
          just don&#8217;t want to owe you. Shen Xian&#8217;er&#8217;s issue

          many mysterious runes meticulously like never before. After all, he
          had other plans for this place. It was going to be used against the
          demoness in red, who would soon emerge from the Demon-burying Abyss.

          mid-journey. It had nearly been a year since she last returned to
          Peach Village. Though a year was nothing to a cultivator, she still
          missed her Masters residing in Peach Village.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since she grew up in the village, her attachment to it was naturally
          far deeper than Gu Family Residence.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s go there. There&#8217;s no point for you in
          joining the battle against the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains right
          now.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded. Besides, he had something he wanted to
          verify with Tao Yao, so he would have to head to Peach Village sooner
          or later.</span

          >Thus, their path was opened and they began to pass through it. Given
          Gu Changge&#8217;s current powers, travelling in the void was a piece

          all, his speed of advancement was far too shocking and unbelievable.
          [Then again, even the other Successor of Demonic Arts would not

          >The massive, luscious, ancient peach tree, in which every leaf
          contained mysterious grooves and resembled works of art, looked even
          more ancient under the moonlight. It looked even more glorious and
          mysterious when the leaves rustled and swayed against the
          breeze.</span

          angelic voice rang out, and a slender figure emerged from the peach
          tree the very next second. Although her face had been obscured, she
          had a peerless sense to her, and though her eyes were as gentle as the
          autumn water, they looked as though they could see through the
          universe.</span

          chance to taste it.&#8221; The young man smiled.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Tao Yao said nothing but only glued her gaze to him for some time
          before saying, &#8220;Some memories came to me when I was sorting out

          with surprise as his heart skipped a beat.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since Tao Yao and Yao Yao didn&#8217;t merge as one, then by right,
          she shouldn&#8217;t remember everything.</span

          from his past memories or if she had deliberately shown them to him.
          But either way, it was without a doubt that Tao Yao and Lao Shi of the
          Immortal Academy were old friends. Then, the demoness in red, Tao Yao,
          and Lao Shi were clearly of the same generation, and they were closely
          related to his Demon Lord identity.</span

          >Gu Changge never believed he was actually the Demon Lord from the
          memories. However, he had to be. Too many things had been destined
          from the very beginning, including his connection to Tao Yao, Lao Shi,
          and Chan Honyi, the demoness in red. [Is Tao Yao suspecting something
          now that she&#8217;s telling me this?]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I remember having a friend who loved to dress in red. She said
          she had to do her best to cultivate and not disappoint her Master,
          then marry him when she grew up…&#8221; Tao Yao recounted as she
          stared at Gu Changge, seemingly telling him the story but also
          seemingly telling it to herself. &#8220;She saved me from the jaws of
          a demonic beast back when I was still just a peach tree with a weak
          spirituality and consciousness. I was basically akin to a normal peach
          tree at that time, one that knew nothing except for life and death… It
          was after knowing her that I realised what a friend was. Too bad it
          was all in the past, and it looks like I&#8217;m the only one who
          still remembers after countless years had passed, left forgotten in
          the forbidden era.&#8221;</span

      <p>

          >&#8220;Then, she brought me to her Master, and it was then I made
          another friend. It was a rock. I never thought that a simple rock and
          an empty peach tree, despite having some spirituality and
          consciousness at that time and were pretty much lifeless, could one
          day walk on the path of cultivation like other demonic beings. Her
          Master was very strict with her but treated us exceptionally well and
          didn&#8217;t despise us despite our origins. He taught me how to read
          and write. I asked him to give me a name, but he said a name is a very
          important thing… So he taught me the word

          flashed across his eyes.</span

          to go to the Demon-Burying Abyss?&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Just asking,&#8221; the young man replied impassively.
          &#8220;Something came to me, so I got curious. I thought you&#8217;d
          know a thing or two when you&#8217;ve been alive for a long
          time.&#8221;</span

          know, you can just check it out yourself, no?&#8221; A chuckle escaped
          Tao Yao. Unlike the previous angelic voice, this chuckle had a hint of
          indescribable demonic tinge to it, and as her words came to an end,
          her voice suddenly turned to nihility. She disappeared, having
          returned to the peach tree, and nothing came of it again.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Judging from this, he could tell the situation wasn&#8217;t in his
          favour. He had come to Tao Yao only to find out about her stance
          toward him, and judging from that, he could naturally make out some of
          her thoughts as well as if she had doubts about his identity.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          was very much alike to someone, and this time, Tao Yao changed her
          moves and began reminiscing about the past. If that wasn&#8217;t
          probing, he didn&#8217;t know what was.</span

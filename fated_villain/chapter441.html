          felt a surge of energy, similar to the one in the Demon-Burying Abyss.
          However, it was at most similar. It was not even close to the real
          thing. Although, it was hard to imagine such an array at the current
          epoch. The person who made it mustn&#8217;t be taken lightly.

          chirped while casting a flattering glance at Gu Changge.

          a slap to their faces, especially when their Ancestor was just killed
          by him. Furthermore, they knew those selfish donkeys from Buddhist
          Mountain would never stick out their necks to help them out.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          towards their words. Many have tried to please him before, but not
          everyone had the qualifications to do so. In his heart, he was still
          thinking about the array. [From what has happened so far, she will
          definitely feel threatened by this array. If she is still sensible,
          she wouldn&#8217;t fall into this trap. Still, with me being here, she
          obviously knows where I am and will head over regardless. When she
          arrives and goes ballistic, such a trap shouldn’t be able to do
          anything to her.]

          it, my plan will be ruined.] Gu Changge thought about the solution as
          he looked away from the Green Luan Clan.

          north, south, east and west. With the whole area sealed off and
          Nirvana Grade Artifacts in our hands, it is impossible for the
          Demoness to escape unscathed once she falls into our trap.”
          Confidently, an old monster stood out to lead the discussion. He
          looked haggard with sunken eye. Yet, he had a strong chaotic aura with
          eyes that seemed to contain universes.

          sand. Even if the Demoness wanted to cause destruction to the world,
          people like him wouldn’t care as long as their lives weren’t at risk.
          The only reason why he was present was because they were interested in
          studying the Demoness’ corpse as it may help them in their
          cultivation. If it weren’t for that, they wouldn’t have been so kind
          as to gather in Divine City nor would they put in so much effort to
          capture the Demoness. [So what if millions get slaughtered? If my
          lifespan decreased and living became difficult, people like me would
          also devour others to extend our lifespans. Afterall, what do the
          common man have to do with me? They are no different from ants.]

          >Upon hearing his words, the crowd remained silent. With complicated
          feelings, they looked around. Everyone was divided in terms of
          opinions and thoughts.

          alongside those from Buddhist Mountain? If the Elders are worried,
          they can send other cultivators. However, I do think that the current
          number is sufficient to guard the eye of the formation.” At that
          moment, Gu Changge suddenly opened his mouth again. His eyes swept
          across the crowd with a smile on his face.

          >“Young Master Gu, what do you mean?” A confused Sect Master couldn’t
          help but ask. Others also looked at Gu Changge quizzically as they
          didn’t understand why Gu Changge brought up this matter out of
          nowhere. They were unable to comprehend Gu Changge’s motive.
          Similarly, those from Buddhist Mountain were even more confused. They
          felt as though they had been led on by Gu Changge since the very
          beginning.

          me and the monks? This way, all of you only need to guard the four
          city gates.” Gu Changge replied with a smile on his face. “This way,
          if anything goes wrong, only the monks from Buddhist Mountain and I
          will be responsible.”

          you do not need to put yourself at risk.” A Sect Master persuaded. It
          wasn’t because he doubted Gu Changge’s abilities, instead he was
          afraid of the implications if something went wrong. Not to mention,
          the eye of the formation was of paramount importance. There was no
          room for any mistakes. This was why they had discussed who and how to
          guard the eye of the formation for days.

          go for the eye of the formation. Thus, the eye of the formation was
          obviously the most dangerous place. Many were reluctant to guard the
          eye of the formation as they could easily lose their lives.</span

          One by one, the many monks of Buddhist Mountain agreed with Gu
          Changge. If Gu Changge were to covet the array, at least they would be
          there.

          weirdly assured.

          Even Ancestors had to treat him with utmost respect. The Green Luan
          Clan was one of the strongest clans in the Upper Realm, yet their
          Ancestor was trying to please Gu Changge. The problem was obvious. Gu
          Changge wasn’t just thriving. He was on the same level, if not higher,
          than these Ancestors. After what happened today, there would never be

          and began to discuss the plan. In contrast, Gu Changge was pretty

          siblings from the Ancient Ye Family.

          >Hearing this, the old monster became even more afraid of Gu Changge.
          He had lived for a very long time and his eyes were equally
          discerning. He could tell that the follower in dark grey iron armour
          had an unprecedented amount of respect for Gu Changge. [What exactly
          did this young man do to make such a strong cultivator so loyal
          towards him?]</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just half a day after the formation was finished, a petrifying rumble
          came from the sky above the Divine City. It was as though someone
          pushed endless waves of blood towards the Divine City. Murderous auras
          enveloped the skies and earth. Suddenly, the ground shook so
          vigorously that even faraway stars trembled as though they were going
          to fall.
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“The Demoness is here!” Within the Divine City, several cultivators’
          expressions became solemn as they looked towards the end of the sky.
          Everyone present felt an extraordinarily terrifying aura. It felt as
          though thousands of troops were dashing forward, together with the
          endless waves of blood. The atmosphere felt icy cold, to the point
          where the shaking cultivators felt as though their souls were being
          pierced.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that end of the sky, a blood-coloured light shot up. There was a
          billowing red cloud in the sky, visibly condensed with evil spirits.
          It seemed endless as tremors could be felt throughout the world.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A woman in red emerged. She had lustrous hair that reflected traces
          of blood while her bare feet treaded along in snow. She was like a
          lotus flower that had bloomed in a sea of blood. Her visuals were
          clean and stunning, yet her expression was indifferent with not a
          single trace of emotion. Her pace was slow, yet every step shook the
          world.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unconsciously, knots formed in everyone’s hearts, as though she was
          walking on their chests. Even those in the Sacred Emperor Realm
          couldn’t shake off the unease. Their expressions became stoic with
          fear.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, some even doubted if the formation could really kill
          the Demoness. They felt as though she could destroy everyone and
          everything with a flick of her finger. In a blink of an eye, the
          Demoness arrived just outside the Divine City. Her billowing red cloud
          pressed down on the Divine City in an attempt to destroy it.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was as though she didn’t see the myriad of arrays set up for her.
          Or perhaps, even if she knew that the Divine City contained great
          danger for her, she would still set foot in it without any hesitation.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The monstrous evil spirits condensed within the red cloud spread out
          and enveloped the Divine City. The Demoness stood high within the sky.
          Her cold and emotionless eyes swept across the many buildings within
          the Divine City. [This place contains his aura. He is hiding here,
          somewhere.]

          >“Why don’t you come out and meet me?” At that moment, everyone’s
          expressions dropped dramatically as they heard those words come out of
          the Demoness’ mouth. Although it sounded natural, it contained so much
          hatred that it made hair stand.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many couldn’t help but shudder. They had always felt that the
          Demoness was disoriented as she never stopped her killing-spree ever
          since she had emerged from the Demon-Burying Abyss. Now that she
          spoke, her words were of an ancient language that was hard for the
          cultivators to understand.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge, who was at the eye of the formation, remained composed
          and unmoved even though he knew the Demoness was talking to him. [Her
          animosity to kill me is already a problem. Now, there is also the risk
          of her uncovering my identity…]</span

          >“It seems like the Demoness is saying…’why don’t you come out to meet
          me?’ Who exactly is she talking to?” An old monster, who was
          well-educated on ancient history, furrowed his brows as he tried to
          understand the meaning behind the Demoness’ words. This made them look
          at each other in confusion. [Could it be that the Demoness came and
          killed all the way here just to find someone?]

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her words were laced with deep hatred. The person who she was seeking
          definitely did not have a simple relationship with her. It was most
          likely a relationship that was embroiled in many secrets. It was
          likely a hatred born from love, an extremely deep-seated hatred. This
          coupled with the knowledge of what era the Demoness was from set off
          waves of questions in their hearts. [If that old man’s translation is
          right, then that means that there are still more people from her era
          who still exist. Naturally, there is still a possibility that she
          isn’t talking to someone, but is just randomly rambling nonsense.

          The next second, a Sect Master instructed while suddenly urging the
          runes within his palm. Instantly, bright rays of light burst forth and
          Principles blanketed the Divine City.

          the Demoness who was trapped within. However, her expression
          didn&#8217;t change in any way, and she continued to walk into the
          city gate, unbothered by the formation. She was indifferent to
          everything that had happened around her, as if she was only focused on
          killing.</span

          appeared at the city gate. Their bodies were surrounded with light as
          they activated the formation to trap the Demoness.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“He’s there.” The Demoness’ crystal-like eyes carried a red hue and
          were just like rubies. At that moment, she landed in an area deep in
          the Divine City as she felt the familiar aura belonging to Gu Changge.
          Thus, she continued forward as every array under her feet came to
          life, which caused divine powers to bombard her.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Blinding light started to burst forth, as if countless stars
          exploded. It made it hard for the surrounding cultivators to even open
          their eyes. Even for a True Daoist, it would be undoubtedly difficult
          for them to resist such strong power. It seemed like the Demoness
          couldn’t resist the power as well. She looked ahead and tried her best
          to move forward but to no avail.

          from one of the Ancient Royal Families shouted loudly. With a
          purple-gold sledgehammer in his hand, he rushed towards the Demoness.

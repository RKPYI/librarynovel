<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even if there was an assassin, do you think I would be injured?&#8221; Yu Feiya might have tried to explain. However, some things could never be taken back. Yu Lie no longer held any pleasant expression towards Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. He now looked at him with extreme indifference.</span><span id="more-32782"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xiao Yao didn’t mean that, he was just worried for your safety. Don&#8217;t put it to heart.&#8221; Yu Feiya shook her head as she explained while sighing in her heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew that he was a prideful person, and had misunderstood Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s words. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eldest sister, you don’t have to say more, I know.&#8221; Yu Lie replied indifferently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was the future Successor of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Even if Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had been hiding his strength for years and had immense talent, he would ultimately be a subordinate. Their statuses were drastically different. Since birth, it would be others who would be currying his favour. He had never had to curry anyone&#8217;s favour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, because of his cautiousness towards the potential of assassins, he wasn&#8217;t able to concentrate during this event. So, in the end, nothing happened and it made it look as though he was being paranoid. This made him disgruntled, especially towards Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, who was the one that stirred up the rumours. Therefore, he didn&#8217;t hold Tuo Ba Xiao Yao in a favourable light.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao knew that his words earlier had offended Yu Lie, but he felt helpless about it. There were times when things wouldn&#8217;t turn out the way he wanted. It was a part of life, something he had no control over/</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems like I have been too overly worried, I hope you can forgive me.&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao spoke in a tone that wasn&#8217;t overbearing nor humble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you think that you can be supercilious just because you have some strength? My brother has the Fortunity of the Great Yu on him. How can some random guy even be compared to him?&#8221; Yu Ming saw the situation and didn&#8217;t hesitate to sneer and mock Tuo Ba Xiao Yao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tuo Ba Xiao Yao didn&#8217;t mind the sarcasm. Instead, he was looking at Yu Feiya with eyes of inquiry. He wanted to know if Yu Lie encountered any assassins during this period of time? [Could some accident have occurred, which caused a change in this life? Could Gu Changge have given up on the assassination attempt?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Tuo Bao Xiao Yao&#8217;s inquiring eyes, Yu Feiya shook her head lightly to express that she wasn&#8217;t sure either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had great trust towards Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. Therefore, she told her father to send more guards to protect the Second Prince during the Hunting Event. However, they didn&#8217;t encounter any assassins at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the countermeasures that Emperor Yu had put up were useless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, she was more curious to know where Tuo Ba Xiao Yao obtained this information. If Emperor Yu wanted a thorough explanation, she didn&#8217;t know how she was going to explain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This isn&#8217;t normal. Could Gu Changge have given up on the assassination attempt because he knew in advance that Emperor Yu would send more people to protect the Second Prince?] This was the greatest possibility that Tuo Ba Xiao Yao could think of.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge might have planted spies among Emperor Yu&#8217;s men, otherwise, it was hard to justify this reasoning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s expression turned awful. [Doesn’t that mean all of my plans have been in vain? I originally wanted to be the centre of stopping the assassination attempt, and receiving the favours from Emperor Yu. Meanwhile, I would build a great relationship with Yu Lie]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I will explain to my father.&#8221; Seemingly seeing through Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s worries, Yu Feiya smiled and consoled him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These are this generation&#8217;s prodigies? They seem disappointing. I had assumed they would be formidable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a voice that suddenly emerged from within the Eternal Overcast Fog, while multiple figures walked out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slender, purple-robed man with fair skin shook his head as he walked over. His body was wrapped around with a faint grey fog. He had a strange aura that gave off a stifling feeling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were plenty of other people following behind him. From their appearances, there were humans and also other races, both young and old. However, they had one similar thing and that was their fearsome aura. They were like a living wave of mountains and sea. It made everyone’s heart palpitate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Members of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a sudden outburst of Eternal Overcast Fog. They are definitely related to the Eternal Overcast. Are they members of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the young prodigies had apprehensive expressions as they watched the opposition walking over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eternal Overcast Royal Family hadn&#8217;t appeared in the world for countless years, but their strength and mystic were things that all Forces recognised. Beings that existed in the Eternal Overcast didn&#8217;t need to cultivate, their cultivation would grow stronger along with the increase of their age. As such, each individual that emerged from the Eternal Overcast were individuals that had overwhelming cultivation. Normal cultivators wouldn&#8217;t dare to provoke them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, their aura was equivalent to fatal poison to cultivators.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, even the leaders of the youth generation of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty like Yu Lie, Yu Feiya, and others were all having solemn expressions. They didn&#8217;t dare to underestimate the enemy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purple-robed young man gave off an immeasurable feeling, that he was hard to see through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My name is Jia Luo. Greetings to all the young prodigies.&#8221; The purple-robed young man didn&#8217;t mind the apprehensive expressions of the surrounding people as he smiled and spoke with an amiable attitude. But when thinking of the comment he made earlier, everyone felt that he was obviously insincere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people behind him behaved as though he was their leader and had yet to speak. They were just sweeping glances at everyone while occasionally showing disdain and contempt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our Great Yu doesn&#8217;t have any ties with the Eternal Overcast Royal Family, there is no feud either. I wonder what is the purpose of your visit?&#8221; Yu Feiya had a calm tone as she questioned the purple-robed man.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She might not feel hostility from the purple-robed man, but she had an uneasy feeling in her heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Jia Luo, he’s the one!] Tuo Ba Xiao Yao stared at Jia Luo while many of his past life&#8217;s memories emerged. [He might be the Prince of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom and wield fearsome strength. In fact, his status was obvious to anyone, but he is actually Gu Changge&#8217;s subordinate!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tuo Ba Xiao Yao’s previous life, Jia Luo had requested for an alliance marriage to Emperor Yu. He proved his strength by overwhelming the young prodigies of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. No one was a match for him. Not even Yu Lie or Yu Feiya were able to test his true strength. He was truly terrifying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s Princess Feiya right? Just like your name, you are a heavenly beauty and I truly appreciate it. Let me introduce myself. I am the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Third Prince. My visit to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty is actually for you, princess.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Luo didn&#8217;t reply to Yu Feiya&#8217;s question at first, but when he explained, he gave an elegant smile which even showed his teeth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His statement had changed everyone&#8217;s expression. Many of them were stunned in place. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Third Prince of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom was actually here for Princess Yu Feiya?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Lie, Yu Ming, and the other imperial descendants were frowning as they didn&#8217;t understand the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Third Prince&#8217;s intention.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean? You are here for me?&#8221; Yu Feiya&#8217;s beautiful brows were knitted tightly as she was also confused.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was rather gloomy as he naturally knew of Jia Luo&#8217;s objective. He was certainly going to prevent this alliance marriage and wasn&#8217;t going to allow Yu Feiya to leave him just to jump into a fire pit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could it be a marriage proposal?&#8221; Yu Ming muttered softly as he couldn&#8217;t help guessing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Yu Ming&#8217;s mutter, Jia Luo looked at Yu Ming and said as he was still smiling, &#8220;Precisely.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What!?&#8221; Everyone was shocked and in disbelief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Prince of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom had personally descended into the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty through the Eternal Overcast for a marriage proposal?  This news was truly appalling and unbelievable. Princess Yu Feiya was indeed overwhelmingly beautiful and had countless pursuers, but even the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Prince had come because of that? It just felt so surreal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in consideration of status, the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Prince was indeed fitting for the Eldest Princess, Yu Feiya.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You wish to marry my elder sister?&#8221; Yu Lie&#8217;s eyes had turned very deep. It seemed like he had a resplendent light around him, like he was a young god that was hard to look at.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Luo remained smiling as he replied, &#8220;Yes, that is my intention. To show my sincerity, I can promise that when the Eternal Overcast sweeps over the Upper Realm, it will not affect the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When hearing Eternal Overcast, even Yu Lie had a change in expression and felt fearful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest let out a cold breath and felt silent. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya wanted to say something but was stunned and didn&#8217;t know how to refuse. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this was a calamity that even Immortal Forces were afraid of. The Eternal Overcast could devour and engulf everything, turning whatever it devoured into part of the Eternal Overcast as well. It was like a fire that would keep growing bigger with the wind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If even barriers of space couldn&#8217;t be spared, let alone the cultivators, all life that existed were in jeopardy. Furthermore, in the face of such terrifying calamity, it was hard to stop it unless one was in the Immortal Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the main reason why the Upper Realm was fearful of the Eternal Overcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the appearance of the Eternal Overcast Royal Family, the Hunting Event was ended in advance. The Eternal Overcast Fog that shrouded most of the wilderness had also gradually scattered. The world had regained its clarity, but there were dense fogs in everyone&#8217;s minds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as the Eternal Overcast wasn&#8217;t resolved, this terrifying demon mountain would be suspended over everyone&#8217;s head. Not even Immortal Forces would be spared. Thus, even the Formidable Forces would face a harsh time as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Third Prince?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the ancient battleship outside of the wilderness, Emperor Yu had finished listening to Jia Luo&#8217;s intention. His eyes were flickering with golden light as he was pondering about gains and losses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jia Luo led the Eternal Overcast group and stood in front of Emperor Yu with a calm attitude that wasn&#8217;t humble nor overbearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were plenty of ministers on both sides and they each had their own emotions. The sudden appearance of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Prince, and the marriage proposal, was actually more advantages than disadvantages in their opinions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya might have great talents and a limitless future. But when compared to the overall benefits she could bring to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, it could be said to be insignificant. Thus, just the promise of not affecting the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty with the Eternal Overcast had already tempted them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the marriage also signified an alliance. In the future, the Eternal Overcast Kingdom was definitely going to be in the Upper Realm. With such a powerful and mysterious ally, it was definitely a huge advantage for the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s future development.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was still unknown if Yu Feiya would agree, but it wasn&#8217;t really something they needed to consider.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge might be standing at the front with Emperor Yu, but he was acting as though he wasn&#8217;t involved. He wasn&#8217;t interested in this alliance marriage, as most of his attention was still on Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. [As the owner of the Sword of World Domination, he should already know that his identity has been exposed. Yet, he still acts as per usual without revealing any flaw. Guess he is deserving of being a regressor. He isn’t as simple as the others.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the appearance of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s prince, most of the attention on Tuo Ba Xiao Yao had been averted. The scarred-man that appeared in the wilderness had seemingly been overlooked too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu might have sent his men to investigate, but they still had no clues as of now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya lowered her beautiful eyes and stood quietly behind Emperor Yu. Even though it was a discussion about her future, she didn&#8217;t seem to be involved. It was her destiny as a member of the imperial family and she already knew this day would come.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wonder what Emperor Yu thinks? This proposal is personally written by my father and it states the conditions that my Eternal Overcast Royal Family is willing to provide.&#8221; Jia Luo smiled again as he spoke and took out a letter from his sleeve. He then ushered someone to present it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu received the letter and glanced through the contents. His eyes couldn&#8217;t help widening, and even though they reverted back to normal quickly, many of the ministers still saw his reaction. They were all trying to guess what the conditions stated in the proposal was, for Emperor Yu to show such an alarmed expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An alliance marriage is not a small matter. Why not let this emperor carefully consider and give Prince Jia Luo an answer after returning to the Imperial Capital?&#8221; Emperor Yu smiled as he kept the proposal silently and didn&#8217;t ask for Yu Feiya&#8217;s opinion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course, just so happens that I can take this chance to admire the majestic views of the Great Yu Capital.&#8221; Jia Luo replied with a smile that was flawless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu laughed heartily and said, &#8220;Naturally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the ministers saw Emperor Yu&#8217;s attitude, they knew that Emperor Yu was moved by the offer. However, he didn&#8217;t immediately agree due to some reason.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of status, the Prince of Eternal Overcast Kingdom was obviously worthy of Yu Feiya. Furthermore, the other party was here with great sincerity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s expression was still the same, but his heart was abnormally heavy. His fists were clenched tightly under his sleeves. He really wished he could stand out to speak for Yu Feiya. But, his rationality told him that it would only make him look foolish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This must be the rumoured Young Master Changge. I have heard many things about Young Master Changge from my elder sister. I have been impressed. Now that I’ve seen you in person, it  only makes me feel that the rumours are indeed true.&#8221; Jia Luo looked at Gu Changge who was beside Emperor Yu, and was extremely sincere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he gave this statement, everyone was shocked as they didn&#8217;t expect Jia Luo to say such things. [His elder sister? Who is that? ]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is Jia Lan your elder sister?&#8221; Gu Changge&#8217;s brows raised a little as he put down his tea cup and replied with a faint smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the family name, Gu Changge had already guessed it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Precisely. If my elder sister knows that Young Master Changge still remembers her, she will definitely be delighted.&#8221; Jia Luo smiled in response and had a respectful expression this time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inheritance system of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom was different from the outside world. He might be a male descendant, but he wasn&#8217;t the next Successor. Instead, it was his elder sister, Jia Lan. In terms of strength, he was far inferior to his royal elder sister. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for why he was so sincere, the construction of the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Reincarnation Platform required his assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when his elder sister was searching for the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being, she encountered Gu Changge. When seeing him use the Reincarnation Technique, she thought he was the Successor. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Eternal Overcast Kingdom&#8217;s Reincarnation Inscription Tablet, they found out that the true Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had been killed by Gu Changge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, this was destined to be a messy night.</span><span id="more-34826"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world mourned and cried over the death of Emperor Yu as a bloody rain showered down with endless depression and sorrow. All within the Imperial Capital were bawling and mourning. They couldn&#8217;t believe this to be true.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu, the emperor of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, was someone shrouded in endless Imperial Qi, aided by the entire Dynasty. He could be described as peerless.  It was unimaginable for him to die like this. However, his death was an indisputable fact. Everyone saw it with their own eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Forces believed something unforeseen must&#8217;ve happened, or given Emperor Yu&#8217;s tactics and abilities, he couldn&#8217;t have fallen so easily. However, the massive fog looming over the Imperial Capital was far too profound. No one could see through it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some ancient beings attempted to probe into the origin of the mist, but it backfired on them very quickly. Their countenances turned awful as they coughed up blood while the impact threw them back, nearly killing them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Unbelievable… Just who in the world plotted to attack the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty? Anyone who probes into this will suffer a terrifying backlash. They might even die…&#8221; Fear and apprehension enveloped several ancient beings as their faces blanched. They dared not imagine who would dare to plot against the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty like this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Great Yu Celestial Dynasty will probably be in great chaos for a while…&#8221; High-ranking leaders of various Forces sighed and planned to leave while the situation was still under control.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, a guffaw reverberated across the world. &#8220;Yu Tianyong is dead! It&#8217;s time you people give up!&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bloody Yu Tianzheng moved out on the Capital Summit with dishevelled hair. Though he suffered serious injuries, his aura still frightened everyone into silence. Some even retreated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Dynasty’s Dao Sword is in his hand…&#8221; gasped a minister with a shaky voice when he recognised the Chaos Dao Sword in Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sword was a National Artifact of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, forged with its Fortuity and Power of Faith. It contained the power of the Celestial Dynasty. If it awakened fully, it could obliterate billions of kilometres of land.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, only the Emperor of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty could wield such an artifact. Now that it was in Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s hands, it was apparent how the battle ended, and the discovery crushed the hopes of many, who were still holding onto one last sliver of hope. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Emperor Yu was still alive, would he have allowed the Chaos Dao Sword to fall into Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s hands? Of course not!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kill him and avenge His Majesty!&#8221; A minister roared with bloodshot eyes as he stood before the Summit of the Capital, ordering his men to attack and kill Yu Tianzheng.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a massive troop of soldiers appeared in the opposite direction in shining silver armour, charging towards the Summit with animosity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, the Imperial Capital had plunged into total chaos. Roars of anger and malice lingered on the streets; even some princes couldn&#8217;t help charging towards Yu Tianzheng, wanting to avenge their father.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the man had long seen it coming. With a sneer, he crushed the Jade Talisman in his hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, battle cries thundered outside the Capital. The massive army that had long been awaiting charged towards the Imperial Capital, moved like an invincible tsunami.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the schemes Yu Tianzheng had been laying all these years have also finally emerged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, many ministers, whom people believed were loyal to Emperor Yu, jumped ship altogether and attacked the soldiers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the turn of events shocked everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Emperor Yu is dead. A new Emperor now reigns.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Emperor Yu has fallen. We should be protecting the new Emperor!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many ministers roared one after another. Even a general had surrendered himself to Yu Tianzheng long ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place turned into a bloodbath very quickly, and no one was spared. Worse, those who failed to escape in time were also dragged into it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t the defensive array activate?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Feiya and the others were in dismay, standing in front of the Imperial Palace as they finally realised something dire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the founding of the Celestial Dynasty, countless arrays have been placed within the Imperial Capital, and because of their existence, not even Immortal Forces could infiltrate the place. It was practically impenetrable. However, they had seemingly fallen into slumber that day, unable to be activated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Looks like he set everything up a long time ago. No doubt, even the person in charge of maintaining the arrays has also long submitted to him… To think Yu Tianzheng could devise such schemes. He must have an ally…] Yu Feiya realised very quickly, and her face blanched.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a bloody war was happening in the Imperial Capital. Men in black were being chased by the experts of various Forces when the experts came to a halt. They sensed something was amiss.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had already left the premises of the Imperial Capital. Currently, they were at a place where everything looked bleak, as thin mist lingered all around them. In addition to that, stars were slowly revolving above them as magnificent energy floated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a deserted Star Territory with many deserted stars surrounding it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why does something feel off… Those rats sure can run. to think we can&#8217;t catch up to them,&#8221; a True Daoist of Sky Emperor Mountain mumbled with a frown as he hovered in the air. Given his cultivation level, traversing from one Star Territory to another was a piece of cake. Yet, he very quickly lost the men in black during the pursuit. He hadn&#8217;t a clue where they were at this point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such speed truly shocked him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His instincts were incredibly sharp, thanks to his millions of years of cultivation. In fact, it had even saved his life on several occasions. Hence, he quickly realised something wasn&#8217;t right. The men in black were clearly going to kill Yu Tianzheng, but why did they run away right after trying to assassinate Gu Changge? If they were genuinely assassins, they wouldn&#8217;t cause such a huge ruckus when they fled, even if they failed their mission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if the men in black were intentionally luring them to this place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it! We&#8217;ve been duped!&#8221; Chills ran down his spine as his countenance turned awful. Perhaps the men in blacks&#8217; goal wasn’t to assassinate Gu Changge but use that to lure them here!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As for why… Are they planning to kill us here?&#8221; He figured out the whole picture very quickly. He swept his vast and majestic divine sense all around like a tidal wave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like there&#8217;s a smart one in the group… To think you&#8217;d notice.&#8221; A soft, monotonous voice rang out of the blue in the silent space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You?! How can it be? Aren&#8217;t you gravely injured?&#8221; The True Daoist widened his eyes with incredulity as he gazed fearfully in the direction of the voice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man in white appeared. His glistening hair was flowing like a waterfall, as his eyes were unfathomable like the deep sea, and his skin was as white as porcelain. He was the epitome of being ethereal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was none other than Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he was walking, the space had seemingly shrunken beneath his feet, allowing him to traverse the nearly endless terrain instantly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I get it now. You were never injured in the first place. This was all your plan,&#8221; said the True Daoist from the Sky Emperor Mountain with a shaky voice, as he bore into the flawless young man, who no longer looked pale and sickly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seemed to be in perfect condition, so handsome that the heavens and even women would be jealous of him. His entire body was one with the world, giving the illusion that he was standing within the distant, endless Celestial Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the True Daoist became alarmed and concerned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course, I wasn&#8217;t. No one in this whole realm can hurt me anymore,&#8221; Gu Changge monotoned as he shook his head lightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re the man backing Yu Tianzheng, aren&#8217;t you? And you&#8217;ve instigated this chaos too. That group of men in black are your men, aren&#8217;t they? You&#8217;ve lured us into chasing them to this place. Am I right?&#8221; Questioned the True Daoist as his voice involuntarily trembled. After hearing Gu Changge&#8217;s words, an epiphany struck him as chills enveloped him. It had been a long since he became a True Daoist that he felt such fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only someone with colossal ambitions and means would dare do such a thing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, they were True Daoists, existences that stood at the peak of the Upper World. Yet they were wrapped around Gu Changge&#8217;s little finger like this!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m impressed that you managed to catch on,&#8221; said Gu Changge with a chuckle while looking at the True Daoist like he was a dead man.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you doing this? Are you not afraid that you&#8217;ll become a mortal enemy of the world if the truth comes to light!?&#8221; The True Daoist denounced in shock and horror. &#8220;Even if you&#8217;re the future Head of the Gu Family, it&#8217;s impossible for you to fight all the Forces alone!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m naturally not worried my schemes will be exposed since I dare actually act it out. Besides, being the enemy of the whole world is nothing to me.&#8221; A chuckle continued to escape Gu Changge as he spoke. He was being too relaxed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You—&#8221; Fear enveloped the True Daoist as he gazed at Gu Changge as though he was looking as a true monster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It just so happened that I lack a few True Daoist Realm puppets, and you all just so happened to have brought yourselves to me..&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head and gave a euphemistic explanation. Given his current powers, allotting several slivers of his soul to control cultivators and disguising them as those men in black to create this chaos was a piece of cake.</span></p>

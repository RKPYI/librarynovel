          herself, she couldn&#8217;t help feeling a slight disappointment at
          how she hadn&#8217;t done anything. She basically only accompanied Gu
          Changge here before watching him obtain the Tower of World Domination

          thinking about how useless I have been. I didn&#8217;t help you with
          anything.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite her words, Gu Changge would have spent a lot of effort to
          find the place where the Tower of World Domination would appear if it
          wasn&#8217;t for Yue Mingkong. In addition, the Mirror of World
          Domination and Seal of World Domination were all given to him by Yue
          Mingkong after she found them. He couldn&#8217;t imagine how difficult
          it must have been for her to get two Tools of World Domination, when
          obtaining just one was no walk in the park.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >&#8220;If you are useless, the rest of the world would have to be
          worse than useless.&#8221; Thinking of this, Gu Changge smiled and
          gently pulled her into his arms. &#8220;There is something else that
          you were wrong about. It is not like you didn&#8217;t help at
          all.&#8221;</span

          words. She was already in a much better mood as she gazed at him and
          asked, &#8220;And what did I help you with?&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The woman&#8217;s smile immediately went stiff as she glared at him.
          A fog suddenly rose to cover her beautiful face, and she struggled out
          of his arms before she transformed into a divine rainbow that rushed
          into the sky.</span

          won&#8217;t do it, Mingkong.&#8221; Gu Changge kept the Tower of World
          Domination and walked out of the hall, the smile still hanging on his
          lips. &#8220;I only need to say the word anyway. The women who want to
          warm my bed would probably make a line all the way to the Immortal
          Academy from here.&#8221;</span

          sharp. Even though she was now high in the sky, she hadn&#8217;t gone
          far. Her expression turned cold and murderous the moment she heard his
          words.</span

          >In a fit of rage, she swung a palm that was as white and fair as a
          beam of moonlight. It was bright and beautiful, but also powerful and
          domineering with an unparalleled bearing as it descended from the
          sky.</span

          off in half by Yue Mingkong&#8217;s palm. As it broke from the middle,
          smoke and dust shot up into the sky.</span

          fear and shock from a distance. Even the Ji Siblings had rushed over,
          and were looking with wide eyes, completely astonished.</span

          After all, she had never launched an attack nor shown her skills in
          front of them before. But now that they were watching her, they were
          amazed by how much stronger she was than they had expected.</span

          hurriedly dispersed as they didn&#8217;t dare stay any longer. They
          knew that it was better for them not to watch something like
          this.</span

          bright light as runes intertwined. There was an aura of the Great Dao

          behind her.</span

          shook, and a terrifying power shot out as the world seemed to get
          sucked into his palms, leaving only darkness behind. The big sleeves
          fluttered as though his palm contained the void, and an endless

          palace of the Gu Family Residence were in a circle. They were staring

          beautiful and slender. It had a pair of clear and big eyes like glass,
          and a thin, transparent tail. It didn&#8217;t seem frightened at all,
          being surrounded by many curious eyes. Instead, it was looking back at
          them with the same curiosity.</span

          be a little congenitally deficient compared to what a young Wang Yue
          should be. It must have been given birth by its mother under difficult
          circumstances, and its mother had probably sacrificed her remaining
          lifespan to make up for its congenital deficiency.”</span

          of the Platform.

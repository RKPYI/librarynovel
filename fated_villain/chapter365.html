          those words insinuated that the siblings were already taking Gu
          Changge&#8217;s side. Although Ji Chuyue was aware of Jiang
          Chen&#8217;s grudge against Gu Changge, she couldn&#8217;t help but be

          minor mastery over the Universal Great Shi and worldly changes. He was

          significant figure worthy of challenging Gu Changge.</span

          following us in the dark?&#8221; Ji Chuyue, who calmed down upon

          her head. In her swaying red dress, she slowly walked towards Ji

          Changge&#8217;s ass every chance she gets.] As such, immense
          resentment and exasperation surged in Jiang Chen&#8217;s heart.</span

          Chen Ning&#8217;er scoffed as she advanced.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Ji Chuyue grew wordless and anxious. If Gu Changge were
          to know about their venture, the Ji Family would surely be slammed
          with a massive loss. The reason they dared to recruit Jiang Chen to
          help them locate the Tower of World Domination was because they wanted
          to find it behind Gu Changge&#8217;s back and leave with it. As long
          as Gu Changge was clueless to this, they would be perfectly
          fine.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, now that Chen Ning&#8217;er personally witnessed them
          formulating their scheme, if she were to disclose this to Gu Changge,
          Gu Changge might not pursue it on the surface, but covertly, after
          having offended him, they were as good as dead.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, the situation was basically overt and covert, and the
          consequences of offending Gu Changge needed no clarification. When the
          siblings made the decision initially, they figured what the results
          might be. Yet, they took the risk in optimism, thinking that nothing
          would go wrong as long as they could hide it from the world.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, Ji Chuyue couldn&#8217;t come up with a reliable
          solution. She certainly felt remorseful, but since the Wheel of World
          Domination was in their possession, she was quite reluctant to give up
          the Tower of World Domination. At this point, she was racking her
          brain to think of a way to mend the situation.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As Chen Ning&#8217;er caught Ji Chuyue&#8217;s face blanching, her
          grin grew even wider, &#8220;Since you have the time now, perhaps you
          should contemplate how you intend to explain yourself to Young Master
          Changge later. Young Master Changge may be patient, but definitely not
          with his opposition. I&#8217;m sure you are aware of how Purple
          Mansion ended up. You don&#8217;t want the Hidden Ji Family to share
          the same fate, do you?&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          indicating that she already reported to Gu Changge.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          her delicate fists so tightly that her palm whitened.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You!&#8221; As her body trembled in rage, she indignantly
          stared at Chen Ning&#8217;er. Never did she expect that not only Chen
          Ning&#8217;er was following her in the dark, but she even relayed
          everything to Gu Changge.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In fact, the only purpose they executed their plans in the middle of
          the night was to stay out of Gu Changge&#8217;s awareness.
          Nonetheless, Chen Ning&#8217;er&#8217;s action tonight blatantly
          showed that she intended to pit them against Gu Changge. [How
          ruthless!]</span

          >[Gu Changge is coming?] At the same time, Jiang Chen&#8217;s face
          also slightly changed. Although he was in disguise now, his heart
          remained filled with uncontrollable fear and distress towards Gu
          Changge.</span

          this place is the most advantageous. If I detected correctly,
          somewhere in those purple mountains is a treasure obtainable only by
          you.&gt; Nevertheless, the sound of the Artifact Spirit of the
          Celestial Boat of Creation suddenly spoke without any
          hesitation.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          am certain that we&#8217;ll be able to manipulate the Earthly Shi of
          this region and fend them off&gt; the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial
          Boat of Creation answered in unwavering determination.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Jiang Chen felt greatly relieved, though he was unable
          to relate to Ji Chuyue&#8217;s mind-boggling restlessness. In his
          perspective, he was already being very kind to help Ji Chuyue and the
          rest find the Tower of World Domination. As for upsetting Gu Changge,
          the siblings should have been prepared for that in the
          beginning.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Such big words coming from you. I doubt Gu Changge is so
          domineering that he was to own all treasures found in the Upper Realm,
          and none could compete with him for them,&#8221; Jiang Chen then
          stated, sounding rather angered as if he was persuading Ji Chuyue, but
          more to expressing his dissatisfaction towards Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon those words, before Ji Chuyue could say anything, coldness
          flashed across Chen Ning&#8217;er&#8217;s eyes as she waved her dainty
          hands and summoned numerous divine talismans in the sky, which turned
          into speeding arrows. The arrows were shot at Jiang Chen with the
          intention to murder him. Although her strength was significantly
          inferior to that of elite young prodigies, killing a mere mortal was
          still as effortless as stepping on an ant.</span

          her teeth, retaliated as the green flute in her hand rose and conjured
          a misty beam that resembled a fog in front of Jiang Chen, shielding
          him from Chen Ning&#8217;er&#8217;s attack.</span

          intended to explain herself, but in that instant, she dared not to
          speak back as given the current state of her family, they
          wouldn&#8217;t dare to go up against Gu Changge, especially in the
          public eyes. In spite of that, she couldn&#8217;t simply watch Jiang
          Chen get slaughtered while she did nothing. She could never bring
          herself to be so heartless.</span

          coming from the purple mountains. The noises, endlessly reverberating,

          the mountain range was engulfed in ambiguous Purple Qi seemed to come
          alive. Dense purple mists started to arise from the gaps between rocks
          and pebbles, quickly surrounding the region. Such an anomaly
          instantaneously took the crowd by surprise, and even Chen
          Ning&#8217;er as well as her men revealed looks of disbelief.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          out of the purple mountains.</span

          good state as his hair was messily loose, his body was covered in
          blood, and his garment was all torn up. Judging by his miserable
          appearance, he must have encountered some sort of abysmal

          never expected you to follow us in the dark. Young Master Changge will
          surely be startled by this. We intended to obtain the Tower of World
          Domination and present it to Young Master Changge. That way,
          we&#8217;ll be able to lessen his burden. Seeing how you troubled
          Young Master Changge to tend to this trivial matter personally, I
          wonder how you are going to explain yourself to him later, Lady

          locate the Tower of World Domination at ease and retrieve it,&#8221;
          Ji Yaoxing steadily noted as if he was stating facts. Simultaneously,

          us find where the Tower of World Domination is. Having been left with
          no choice, my sister and I could only resort to this plan of ours, or
          there was no way he would have agreed to help us locate the Tower of
          World Domination.&#8221; Ji Yaoxing heaved a sigh and slightly changed
          his expression. &#8220;Unfortunately, because of you, our plan is put

          Ning&#8217;er couldn&#8217;t determine whether Ji Yaoxing was telling
          the truth, but if the Divine Source Master before her indeed had bad
          blood with Gu Changge, the siblings of the Ji Family, being aware of

          off such a flagrant act. Although she was aware that her
          brother&#8217;s disloyalty and betrayal were to protect her and the
          family, she was momentarily unable to accept his actions. And she was
          even apologetically looking at Jiang Chen, who failed to notice her
          gaze.</span

          was no longer hatred or vexation, but absolute disappointment. He
          never expected the first thing Ji Yaoxing would do upon his appearance
          was saying those words and selling him out, and even thoroughly
          severing any ties they had.

          another way to defend himself if their venture tonight didn&#8217;t
          work out. Realising how he was thinking that Ji Yaoxing would make a
          worthy friend, he couldn&#8217;t help blaming himself for being so
          blind.</span

          extraordinarily elegant in their swaying clothes, the leaders were

          and the pressure. She could already feel cold sweat surging on her
          palms. She never felt such a sensation whenever she met Gu Changge
          back then, but now, she could feel a frightening aura repressing her,

          Chen Ning&#8217;er hurriedly recounted the events earlier without
          hiding anything. She told him everything, including how she followed
          the siblings of the Ji Family, how she eavesdropped on them, as well
          as Ji Yaoxing&#8217;s explanation without omitting a single

          Yaoxing with a chilly, mysterious expression. Indubitably, she knew
          what idea he was carrying, but she didn&#8217;t bother to expose him.
          Rather, she was more curious about how the siblings of the Ji Family

          her and thanked her instead, Chen Ning&#8217;er felt somewhat pampered
          as she swiftly waved her hand. As she received such words from him,

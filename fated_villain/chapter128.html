            Fortune Generator!
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Ancient Immortal Continent was vast beyond measure, with endless
            immortal mountain ranges that resembled dragons flying around, like a
            world never seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
            The atmosphere had an ancient aura seeping everywhere, as if it came
            from the primordial times to give birth to all under heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still, the most important matter for the Young Supremes of the various
            heritages wasn’t the scenery, but to bring together all of their
            disciples so as to prevent them from getting ambushed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, their peers and the aborigines of the Continent were their foes.
        </p>
        <p>No one dared to take this trip lightly.</p>
        <p>
            Soon, Gu Changge also arrived at the Continent with a group of his
            followers and disciples from the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace.
        </p>
        <p>Their group landed in a valley.</p>
        <p>
            The terrain of the valley was flat, and they could see an emerald lake
            in the distance that seemed to be made up of Spiritual Qi.
        </p>
        <p><b>“Master, where should we go now?”</b></p>
        <p>
            A tall creature from among his followers walked out and asked Gu Changge
            for instructions.
        </p>
        <p><b>“Go east.”</b></p>
        <p>Gu Changge pondered for a moment and then commanded.</p>
        <p>
            At the same time, he took a glance at Jin Zhou and the others behind
            him; to be honest, he didn’t wish to bring this bunch of True Disciples
            with him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jin Zhou and the others weren’t weak — after all, they were Young
            Supremes — and they also had quite a lot of followers.
        </p>
        <p>
            If they followed him, then his group would most-likely get into conflict
            with their group when they chanced upon some opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gu Changge wasn’t someone who would take a loss, but he was too lazy to
            deal with such trifles.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>“Since Senior Brother Gu is going to the east, then we will head to
                the west. Later, all of us should find a way to meet in the central
                area.”</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Jin Zhou and the others weren’t stupid either, and understood that they
            won’t get any benefits if they followed Gu Changge…no, they might even
            end up slaving away for him if they went with him.
        </p>
        <p>So, as smart people, they bid their farewell and went on their way.</p>
        <p>
            Gu Changge’s expression showed no change as he was too lazy to say
            anything in response.
        </p>
        <p>What’s more? This was exactly what he wanted.</p>
        <p>
            Soon, only Yin Mei and Gu Changge’s followers were left on the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gu Changge didn’t allow Yan Ji to follow him inside the Ancient Immortal
            Contient this time as that would expose Yan Ji’s existence, and that was
            something he didn’t want to see.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, it was possible that Yan Ji wouldn’t even be able to get
            inside with her mighty Cultivation Base.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, all the Young Supremes had to rely on themselves, and none of them
            were allowed to bring in any guardians.
        </p>
        <p>So, for Gu Changge, this might be his…greatest hunting season.</p>
        <p>
            As long as a Young Supreme piques his interest, they won’t be able to
            escape their fate of dying at his hands as he swallowed their origin or
            planted a [Great Dao Treasured Bottle] inside their Primordial Spirits
            to control them.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s just that he must tread with caution and do all this with great
            care.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once his actions are discovered, he would need to pin even more blame on
            Ye Ling’s head.
        </p>
        <p><b>“Let’s go.”</b></p>
        <p>
            With those words, everyone followed Gu Changge’s lead and headed towards
            the east.
        </p>
        <p>
            If he wasn’t wrong, then the Vermillion Bird Family’s people would be in
            that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Master asked me to find a chance to get close to Ye Ling; it seems that
            Ye Ling also sneaked in here. I think he will take the initiative to
            find me.’
        </p>
        <p>Yin Mei followed Gu Changge while thinking about his command.</p>
        <p>
            Gu Changge’s followers had no idea that Yin Mei was also in his camp.
        </p>
        <p>Yin Mei reckoned that it wouldn't be hard for her to trick Ye Ling.</p>
        <p>
            On the way, Gu Changge felt that their luck wasn’t all that great this
            time. Even after traveling through tens of thousands of miles, they
            didn’t come across a single creature, and this made Gu Changge wonder if
            they somehow entered some forbidden region?
        </p>
        <p>
            Still, they did chance upon a lot of opportunities on the way. He
            discovered countless Mystical Herbs that had long disappeared from the
            world — these herbs had grown for innumerable years, so their fragrance
            spread far and wide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Gu Changge disliked these things, the followers behind him were
            more than happy to take whatever they could find.
        </p>
        <p>‘There’s no way I am going to find anything like this.’</p>
        <p>
            ‘The Ancient Immortal Continent is vaster than I expected! I should have
            asked the Great Elder for some information when I had the chance.’
        </p>
        <p>Gu Changge frowned.</p>
        <p>
            After that, his majestic and vast Spiritual Sense swept towards the
            horizon like a gigantic wave. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, there weren’t any other strong cultivators here, so he wasn’t
            worried about exposing his mighty Primordial Spirit’s secret.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon, Gu Changge sensed the aura of the Vermillion Bird Family’s people
            from not too far away, only a few thousand miles away at most.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before them, though, he sensed the sound of battle and brilliant rays of
            light soaring into the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            Divine runes flashed with brilliance one after another and spread in
            every direction, and he could tell that the ones battling weren’t weak —
            they were at least in the Conferred King Realm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gu Changge’s Spiritual Sense soon perceived a Young Supreme from the
            Upper Realm who was trying to get his hands on a sword grass that
            resembled a star; the sword grass released mighty sword intent that made
            the Void vibrate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sword grass resembled a magnificent star, and he could see lines on
            its leaves that resembled the veins of a star.
        </p>
        <p>
            The place where the sword grass grew showed a strange scene where
            strands of sword light could be seen hanging from the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Young Supreme’s opponent was a violent beast that was about to enter
            the True God Realm, and the two fought together as if nothing in the
            world could separate them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>“Master, it seems that someone’s fighting in that direction.”</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gu Changge silently stood on a mountain peak, while a follower behind
            him said with a puzzled face, <b>“Are we going to take a look?”</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>“There’s no need to intervene in such matters.”</b></p>
        <p>Gu Changge said with a wave of his hand.</p>
        <p>
            Of course, he wouldn’t go there. The reason he came all the way here was
            to find the Vermillion Bird Family, so he could create an opportunity
            for Yin Mei.
        </p>
        <p>
            As long as Yin Mei wasn’t too far away from him, he could feel her
            position.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once they found the Vermillion Bird Family, he would put Yin Mei beside
            Ye Ling and then keep track of Ye Ling’s position through her, and then
            pick the fruit once it ripened.
        </p>
        <p>Wouldn’t that be the most convenient method of doing things?</p>
        <p>
            Yin Mei understood Gu Changge’s thoughts, so her eyes shifted a bit here
            and there, and then she said,
            <b>“Senior Brother Gu, I can only come this far with you, so let’s part
                ways now.”</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            She also brought her followers along, so she couldn’t show the slightest
            flaw in her actions when dealing with Gu Changge. On the surface, she
            had to pretend that they weren’t on good terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>“Alright! Junior Sister Yin Mei, make sure you pay attention to your
                safety.”</b>
        </p>
        <p>Gu Changge nodded with a calm expression.</p>
        <p>
            Afterwards, he watched Yin Mei leave his group and rush in the direction
            of the battle with the intent to intervene.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gu Changge nodded with satisfaction and the interest in his heart rose
            to another level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Didn’t Ye Ling always desire to obtain Yin Mei’s heart? He had sent her
            to him now.
        </p>
        <p>
            He specially created an opportunity for him to be a ‘hero saving a
            damsel in distress.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Yin Mei would go to snatch the sword grass and then put herself in a
            disadvantaged position. After a while, Ye Ling would sense the
            fluctuations caused by the battle, and wouldn’t be able to hold himself
            back from playing the hero who would save the beauty.
        </p>
        <p>Gu Changge had read this trope countless times.</p>
        <p>
            Today, he specially created such an opportunity for Ye Ling, so he
            reckoned that Ye Ling must be quite grateful to him once he found out.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, Gu Changge didn’t stay on the spot anymore and decided to
            leave.
        </p>
        <p>After all, he had other matters to deal with.</p>
        <p>
            The Ancient Immortal Continent was far too vast, and what he desired was
            most likely hidden in the place where the aborigines gathered.
        </p>
        <p>
            The place where the aborigines gathered could also help him find
            opportunities in the form of their ancestral tombs.
        </p>
        <p>Gu Changge had long been craving those immortal corpses!</p>
        <p>
            And even if there were no immortal corpses there, the corpses of Ancient
            Emperors wouldn’t be a waste either, if he could find some.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, Gu Changge hoped that the ancestors of the aborigines
            wouldn’t be like the ancestors of his Ancient Immortal Gu Family who
            loved to bury themselves underground and sleep inside coffins for their
            secluded cultivation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those actions of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family’s ancestors were
            unacceptable in his eyes.
        </p>
        <h4>Chapter 128.2: Hero Saving the Beauty; No One Can Bully My Exclusive Fortune Generator!</h4>
        <p> While Gu Changge searched for the aborigines of the Ancient Immortal Continent, Gu Xian’er happily skipped
            around and found a lot of great opportunities. </p>
        <p> The red bird on her shoulder wasn’t a simple creature as it was born with a talent that allowed it to locate
            treasures and opportunities. </p>
        <p> Nothing good could escape its eyes! </p>
        <p> Whether it was something above the surface or buried under a mountain, it could pull out anything. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er turned into a ray of light and flew around. On her way, she encountered many beasts in the
            Conferred King Realm, but none of them could survive against her. </p>
        <p> After all, she wasn’t secluding herself in vain over the last period of time; her strength had risen to
            another level. </p>
        <p> Soon, Gu Xian’er came across disciples from the other forces. </p>
        <p> ‘This group should be from some other force of Immeasurable Heaven! They don’t seem human…I can smell the
            sea from them.’ </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er recognized them from their abilities and techniques as their clothing and appearance didn’t
            differ much from the rest of the world. </p>
        <p> The one leading them was a young man surrounded by stars. He stood among his peers like a king who couldn’t
            be matched by anyone else, and appeared extremely mighty. </p>
        <p> The rest of the people were in the Conferred Lord Realm or below, with a majority of them in the Saint
            Realm. </p>
        <p> <b>“Which force is this little girl from? She couldn’t have come in alone, right?”</b> </p>
        <p> The leader of the group had blue hair and showed a frivolous expression as he stared at Gu Xian’er and
            asked. </p>
        <p> At the same time, his followers surrounded Gu Xian’er. </p>
        <p> He merely asked for fun as no one inside the Ancient Immortal Continent gave a damn about someone’s
            background. </p>
        <p> The fog shrouding the Ancient Immortal Continent could cover up every trace, and even the old monsters from
            someone’s background couldn’t calculate anything even if they died in here. </p>
        <p> <b>“Lass, it’s not good to be alone! You should follow us, or find someone to take care of you. Haha…”</b>
        </p>
        <p> The young man stared at her with a fiery gaze. </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er frowned at his words, and felt uncomfortable under the man’s lustful gaze. </p>
        <p> He was another bastard aiming for her body. </p>
        <p> <b>“Scram!”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er held no respect for such scum. Her expression froze over and she slammed her slender, jade-like
            fist towards him. Her body might appear thin and weak, but her physical strength couldn’t be matched by
            anyone among her peers. </p>
        <p> She rarely used her physical might as she preferred to use a sword on normal days, but when it came to
            slaughtering bastards, she loved to keep it simple and straightforward. </p>
        <p> <b>[Boom!]</b> </p>
        <p> Just one punch from her blasted away the group of cultivators in front of her; many of them collapsed on the
            ground, while others burst into blood mist. </p>
        <p> <b>“You…”</b> </p>
        <p> Their leader’s expression changed at once, but Gu Xian’er didn’t give him a chance to react. Her figure
            turned into an afterimage as she disappeared from her spot. At the same time, an ancient treasure with
            brilliant runes appeared in her hands and fell straight down like a sword engraved with runes of Dao! </p>
        <p> She was already in a bad mood, and this bunch angered her even more. </p>
        <p> Soon, a large group of people perished as the blood mist in the air drifted away. </p>
        <p> <b>“Reckless fools.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Xian’er patted her dress to get rid of the dust covering it, and watched the fallen fools with an
            indifferent expression. After that, she took all of their Spatial Rings, and then turned into a ray of light
            and disappeared from the scene. </p>
        <p> She had encountered countless such situations when she left the Peach Village and traveled all the way from
            the Upper Realm’s Outer Region to the Inner Region. </p>
        <p> Killing trash and taking their treasures wasn’t something new to her. </p>
        <p> Just because Gu Changge could easily bully her inside the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace and made her look
            like a dumb girl, it didn’t mean that she wasn’t a shrewd chick. </p>
        <p> Soon after Gu Xian’er disappeared from the scene, another group appeared and watched the scene. </p>
        <p> The one leading the group was a woman wearing a colorful feather coat. She had blue hair and scales covering
            her forehead. </p>
        <p> The woman had a prideful expression, and when she saw the blood mist scattered in the surroundings, her eyes
            spewed daggers as rage changed her expression and she roared, <b>“It’s always me killing others, so who is
                it?! WHO DARES TO KILL MY BROTHER?!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“Seventh Princess, there are beasts in the surroundings who must’ve witnessed everything, so you can
                search their souls and see.”</b> </p>
        <p> Someone among her followers noticed the tracks of beasts not far away and suggested. </p>
        <p> The blue-haired woman didn’t hesitate and rushed away as soon as she listened to his words. </p>
        <p> Her figure moved at breakneck speed and she captured a beast within a blink. Ignoring the poor beast’s
            roars, she directly looked through its soul to find out the truth of the matter. </p>
        <p> <b>“Dammit! The murderer turned out to be a little girl dressed in blue.”</b>
        </p>
        <p> <b>“I will make her pay for her sin! I never thought that someone would murder my brother a moment before I
                could find him!”</b> </p>
        <p> The blue-haired woman’s eyes almost spit fire as she stared at the sight in front of her with rage and
            trembled. </p>
        <p> From what she saw in the beast’s memory, her brother merely uttered a few words without doing anything, yet
            the girl in blue ruthlessly murdered everyone without a second thought! </p>
        <p> <b>“My brother had countless life-saving treasures on him, yet he died at the hands of such a girl, so her
                identity mustn’t be simple!”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“So what?! My Sea King’s Palace lords over hundreds of millions of miles of territory across many star
                fields, so how can we suffer such a disgrace?! Spread the order that I wish everyone to hunt that bitch
                in blue!”</b> </p>
        <p> The blue-haired woman’s rage-filled voice spread in the surroundings as she commanded her followers to hunt
            the girl dressed in blue. </p>
        <p> Her command compounded the fright of her already-frightened followers. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at

        <p> Once the rage of the Sea King Palace soared, the entire world would tremble. </p>
        <p> The Sea King Palace lorded over the endless heritages of the Endless Sea that was located next to
            Immeasurable Heaven. </p>
        <p> The shadow of the Sea King Palace could be seen throughout the vast waters of the Upper Realm, and even
            Supreme Heritages and Immortal Forces had to give them face. </p>
        <p> Moreover, the Sea King Palace commanded many subordinate sea families, and many of those families were
            related to the Ancient Immortal Non-Human Families, and that made the Sea King Palace a mighty force that
            brought headache to countless Dao Heritages. </p>
        <p> All of her followers turned pale. </p>
        <p> That girl in blue had thoroughly offended the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace. </p>
        <p> That younger brother could only be regarded as a relative from her mother’s family, but since he had the
            blood of the Sea King Palace’s royal family, then that meant he was a bonafide member of the Sea King
            Palace.[1] </p>
        <p> [1: so he’s a cousin I think, and she was probably f!ck!ng him behind their parents’ back.] </p>
        <p> How could the Seventh Princess not be enraged when he was killed in a place like this? </p>
        <p> The followers couldn’t help but tremble in fear. </p>
        <p> They reckoned that the matter would cause a massive catastrophe. Even if the girl had some supreme master
            backing her up, she wouldn’t be able to escape a disastrous fate. </p>
        <p> One had to depend on themselves to survive inside the Ancient Immortal Continent — this was a rule every
            heritage agreed on. </p>
        <p> The Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace was a mighty figure who had left the Palace for the first time,
            yet this was what she encountered as soon as she made her debut, so how could she rest easy? </p>
        <p> She had to wash her hands with her enemy’s blood! </p>
        <p> Soon, the news spread far and wide in the Ancient Immortal Continent, and caused massive waves. </p>
        <p> The younger brother of the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace got murdered by a girl dressed in blue,
            so the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace commanded her followers to hunt the girl in blue to avenge
            her slaughtered younger brother. </p>
        <p> The news caused a great stir as soon as it came out. </p>
        <p> Everyone knew that people from the Sea King Palace were better left alone as nothing good would come out
            from offending them, yet someone actually dared to murder their Princess’s younger brother, and that shocked
            everyone who got the news. </p>
        <p> Many cultivators felt sympathy for the girl in blue, and at the same time, they felt curious about her
            identity. </p>
        <p> After all, not just anyone would dare to murder someone from the Sea King Palace.</p>

        <p> A young man covered in mist stood inside a mist-shrouded valley, and said to himself, <b>“Young girl in blue
                clothes? She wouldn’t be Gu Changge’s cousin who’s said to be the reincarnation of a Supreme Immortal,
                right?”</b> </p>
        <p> The one who spoke was Wang Wushuang, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Wang Family. </p>
        <p> He went into the depths of the Ancient Immortal Contient all by himself, and one couldn’t tell how he got
            his hands on the news. </p>
        <p> <b>“Interesting! I can take advantage of both sides if the people from the Sea King Palace try to duke it
                out with Gu Changge.”</b> </p>
        <p> Golden runes appeared on his body and he disappeared into the mist as soon as he finished speaking. Vissit
            n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels</p>
        <p> A golden light flashed on a mountain range in another direction. A Golden-Winged Great Peng spread its wings
            and flew through the air unhindered. </p>
        <p> Its whole body appeared golden, and it easily killed a beast in the True God Realm after tearing it apart
            and throwing its corpse on the ground. </p>
        <p> <b>“It’s said that there’s some sort of grudge between Gu Changge and his exceptionally talented cousin, so
                I wonder if he will intervene if the girl in blue is really his cousin?”</b> </p>
        <p> <b>“The Sea King Palace isn’t easy to deal with…”</b> </p>
        <p> The Golden-Winged Great Peng landed on the ground and turned into a tall man — he was Peng Fei, the Young
            Master of the Golden-Winged Great Peng Family. </p>
        <p> He couldn’t help but mutter to himself with a frown. </p>
        <p> A similar scene played at the edge of the Ancient Immortal Continent.[2] </p>
        <p> [2: of people killing beasts and each other.] </p>
        <p> Countless young people arrived at the Continent one after another. Some had long gone ahead, while others
            fell behind them because they came from territories that were far away from Immeasurable Heaven and it took
            them a lot of time to reach the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. </p>
        <p> Still, all of them were equally mighty Young Supremes. </p>
        <p> After the Ancient Immortal Continent opened up, some of the people encountered the aborigines of the
            Continent, and that led to conflict and murder. </p>
        <p> However, the appearance of the outsiders was also an opportunity for the younger generations of the
            aborigines as they never got to experience something like this before. </p>
        <p> …… </p>
        <p> <b>“Are all the natives present here?”</b> </p>
        <p> A golden, unknown plant swaggered around like a golden blade of grass on a low-lying plain. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge raised his eyebrow and asked while looking at those in front of him. </p>
        <p> In front of him knelt a group of terrified creatures with appearances and clothing different from those who
            came from the outside. </p>
        <p> Their legs were broken and bloodstained, and they couldn’t bear the terrifying aura Gu Changge released.
        </p>
        <p> A small number of them were blown into blood mist just from Gu Changge’s aura, and perished immediately.
        </p>
        <p> When he was passing by this place, this bunch of aborigines attacked his group out of nowhere, and several
            of his followers perished at their hands. </p>
        <p> <b>“Where are you from?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge asked using his Spiritual Sense. </p>
        <p> In front of him stood a dark man dressed in a beast robe. The man didn’t appear old, and his strength was
            also in the Middle Stage of the Conferred King Realm, but right now, he felt extreme fright due to the fact
            that Gu Changge’s aura was about to crush his very soul. </p>
        <p> Facing Gu Changge made him feel like he was even worse than an ant before him. </p>
        <p> The young men and women behind him were dressed in extraordinary clothes and held exceptional treasures in
            their hands, but even they were trembling at the moment as terror gripped their very souls. </p>
        <p> The young man in front of them looked to be the same age as them, so how could he be even more terrifying
            than a young emperor? They wondered. </p>
        <p> <b>“Tell me the location of your gathering place, and I might let you go.”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge knew that they could understand him through his Spiritual Sense, so he asked without worry. </p>
        <p> After that, he grabbed the man in front of him with one hand and lifted him up like one lifted up a chicken
            by its throat. </p>
        <p> <b>“Master, we just got news that Miss Xian’er seems to have offended the people from the Sea King Palace,
                but we aren’t sure if it’s really Miss Xian’er.”</b> </p>
        <p> Right then, the follower who spoke up in the beginning walked over and informed Gu Changge about the news he
            received. </p>
        <p> They naturally had means to inquire about news from all over the world, so it wasn’t surprising that he knew
            about this matter since it had been causing quite an uproar among those from the younger generation. </p>
        <p> <b>“Sea King Palace?”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge frowned and pondered for a moment and then said, <b>“Don’t worry about her, she won’t die.”</b>
        </p>
        <p> After all, Gu Xian’er was a Favored Daughter of Heaven, so the Sea King Palace was merely arranged by the
            Heavenly Daddy to increase her experience points. </p>
        <p> Of course, it was possible that she would suffer with her current strength, but Gu Changge didn’t intend to
            be her nanny. </p>
        <p> Although the little chick was somewhat prideful and cold, countless opportunities would still come to her
            since she was a Favored Daughter of Heaven, and it won’t be hard for her to turn a crisis into an
            opportunity. </p>
        <p> Although it was possible for her to suffer, Gu Changge was convinced that nothing major would happen to Gu
            Xian’er. </p>
        <p> However, Gu Changge thought that he could make use of this matter since he had long been busy with other
            matters, and hadn’t had time to play with Gu Xian’er after the last time. </p>
        <p> As for the Sea King Palace? What the heck was that? </p>
        <p> Did they think they could bully Gu Changge’s exclusive Fortune Value generator? </p>
        <p> <b>“Lead the way if you don’t want to die!”</b> </p>
        <p> Gu Changge soon left his thoughts, and looked at the creatures in front of him with a flat expression. </p>
        <p> He decided to let them live as they could work as a compass for him. The reason Gu Changge didn’t directly
            search their souls was that he worried their souls might explode if he tried that. </p>
        <p> The aborigines of the Ancient Immortal Continent were descendants of various ancient races, so their
            strength was obviously much greater than those from the outside world — this was what Gu Changge felt, but
            that didn’t matter to him. </p>
        <p> Right now, even someone in the Sacred Realm couldn’t threaten Gu Changge, so what could these greenhorns
            from the younger generation do? </p>
        <p> <b>“Sir, I will lead the way!”</b> </p>
        <p> The creature in front of him replied in haste as he could feel the young man’s sinister aura and
            unparalleled might pressing down on him and that terrified him. </p>
        <p> His strength was already comparable to the Elders of his tribe, and that compounded his feelings of terror.
        </p>
        <p> Just now, he had single handedly blocked their offense and obliterated it while subduing them at the same
            time. </p>
        <p> It’s just that they couldn’t figure out why the man wanted to go to their place of gathering as it was in
            the depths of the Continent, after all. </p>
        <p> What’s more? There were many stronger ones there. </p>
        <p> Soon, they left the place and headed towards the east. </p>
        <p> Along the way, Gu Changge witnessed countless magnificent structures that seemed to have existed since
            ancient times, but all of them were already abandoned. </p>
        <p> There were stone carvings, intent of Sacred Realm masters, and whatnot. Brilliant runes soared towards the
            sky and divine radiance covered everything above them. The intent and carvings could help one with their
            cultivation, and even help them reach enlightenment — they were a rare opportunity for anyone who chanced
            upon them. </p>
        <p> The number of younger generations from the aborigines and the outside world kept on increasing by the
            moment, and the number of fights and murders also soared. </p>
        <p> Gu Changge lost interest after taking one glance at the surroundings. </p>
        <p> The aborigines guarded the secrets of the Ancient Immortal Continent, and the Immortal Spirit was something
            they had been nurturing until today. He had already calculated the time of its birth before he even joined
            the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace. </p>
        <p> Once the Immortal Spirit is born, the entire Continent would go into turmoil, and even the old monsters
            outside would rush inside to get their hands on it.</p>

          >As the group from the Hidden An Clan arrived at Kun Mountain, An Xi’s
          expression soured when she noticed An Yan’s striking presence. After
          she settled things in Kun Mountain, she was going to return home and
          demand An Yan to return her the True Blood of the Hidden
          Celestial.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the past, she never took An Yan seriously despite being aware of
          the facade she put up. Her carelessness this time had allowed An Yan
          to steal something incredibly valuable from her, rendering all her
          previous efforts futile.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Sister…” While An Xi was still lost in her gloomy thoughts, An Yan
          had appeared before her. A sweet and enchanting smile adorned her
          beautiful face as she greeted An Xi warmly. Outsiders who were unaware
          of their true relationship would have thought that they were sisters
          who shared a strong bond with each other.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You brat, you really caught me off guard this time.” An Xi quickly
          composed herself and spoke in a neutral tone, but not without a hint
          of arrogance. She maintained her dignified status and refrained from
          engaging in a public argument with An Yan. As someone with ample
          resources and time, she knew there were better ways to handle the
          situation.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Many thanks to your generosity, my dear sister. Without your
          assistance, obtaining it would have been a great challenge.” An Yan’s
          innocent smile revealed a charming set of dimples on her cheeks, but
          her words were laced with deadly motives. An Xi’s face immediately
          darkened, as she never anticipated her sister would have the audacity
          to taunt her in front of their clan members.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You’re still too naive. Are you flaunting because you truly think
          that you’ve won by snatching it away? How amusing. We’ll continue
          this, only if you can survive the challenges of Kun Mountain.” An Xi
          sneered and gave her a disdainful look. As onlookers observed the
          tense exchange, they wisely remained silent to avoid getting involved
          in the internal conflict within the An Clan.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I think you have misunderstood me, sister.” An Yan suddenly giggled,
          as if she had just heard the funniest joke.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?” An Xi frowned.</span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“I didn’t come to Kun Mountain for you,” An Yan said with a
          disdainful smirk.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >While she was speaking, a stir arose in the vicinity, drawing the
          attention of the True Daoists from various Forces in the sky. A group
          of figures were approaching, led by none other than the Gu
          Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Young Master Gu…” An Yan&#8217;s face lit up with excitement as she
          eagerly made her way toward Gu Changge, seemingly unaware of the
          extremely unpleasant expression on An Xi’s face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Damn it! When did she become so close to Gu Changge…?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As An Yan hastened toward Gu Changge, An Xi couldn’t shake off the
          ominous feeling that crept up on her when she connected An Yan’s
          relationship with the man and the True Blood of the Hidden Celestial
          she had stolen from her. It appeared that her journey to Kun Mountain
          might not go as smoothly as she had initially anticipated.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Jiang Chen…” Niu Tian, who had been quietly trailing behind An Xi
          and the others, also caught sight of Jiang Chen, who was being guarded
          by Gu Changge’s men. He was greatly relieved to see that Jiang Chen
          was unharmed, suspecting that Xiao Ruoyin must have played a part in
          this.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Greetings, Young Master Gu.” An Yan eagerly approached Gu Changge
          and respectfully greeted him. She had diligently kept in mind the task
          that Gu Changge had entrusted to her. Now that she had successfully
          obtained the True Blood of the Hidden Celestial, she had passed his
          test and proven her worth.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Looks like you have obtained the True Blood of the Hidden
          Celestial?” Gu Changge did not expect to see An Yan here but he
          remained unfazed. He viewed her as a mere pawn, one he could easily
          discard. If she could demonstrate her value, he would be willing to
          assist her. On the other hand, if she failed, he saw no reason to
          waste his time on her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Of course, I didn’t let you down.” An Yan nodded with a smile of
          relief on her face. She presented a bronze box adorned with glowing
          ancient runes to Gu Changge.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“The True Blood of the Hidden Celestial is sealed in it. You can
          count on me to retrieve the remaining blood from the An Clan.” Her
          eyes sparkled with hope as if seeking for Gu Changge’s praise.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge merely glanced at the bronze box before him with a smile,
          showing no interest in opening it. He knew that An Yan would never
          dare to deceive him. “Good work.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“An Yan actually gave it to Gu Changge!?” An Xi watched their
          exchange from a close distance, her eyes turning red and her jaw
          clenched tightly. That was one of the only three remaining drops of
          the Hidden Celestial’s True Blood left in the An Clan.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Should Niu Tian successfully absorb that drop of True Blood, he would
          swiftly regain some of the splendor of their Prime Ancestor. With his
          help, she would undoubtedly be able to secure her position as the head
          of the An Clan.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“When did that girl develop such a strong bond with Gu Changge, to
          the point where she is willingly give it to an outsider&#8230; To
          think that she would betray her own Clan just to please Gu Changge!”
          An Xi’s Grand Uncle wore an equally grim expression.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As per the An Clan’s rules, An Yan was indeed entitled to make her
          own decision regarding the True Blood of Hidden Celestial that she had
          obtained. No one could stop her even if she chose to dispose of it.
          Nevertheless, seeing her using it to gain favor with Gu Changge left a
          bitter taste in the mouths of many members from the An Clan.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Shortly after, many cultivators had gathered outside Kun Mountain.
          Crowds were seen forming all around the mountain. Following their
          deliberation, various Forces initiated their assault on the
          mountain.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!!* Dao Artifacts floated in the sky, emanating a terrifying
          divine radiance as they stirred from their slumber. The energies they
          emitted were overwhelming, leaving most cultivators breathless. A
          furnace covered in magnificent red flames rose into the sky like a
          sun, its radiance searing and intense. It released red clouds as it
          charged toward Kun Mountain!</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The remaining Dao Artifacts also stirred to life, accompanied by
          Chaos Qi. Their unparalleled radiance illuminated the surroundings and
          the Sound of the Great Dao reverberated.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!!!* The space ruptured with a violent force, creating a crack
          that spanned thousands of kilometres. The gusts of wind that escaped
          were fierce enough to reduce most average cultivators to dust. This
          aftermath was beyond anything Sacred Emperor Realm experts could
          handle, causing a wave of fear to ripple through the creatures
          inhabiting the ancient cities near Kun Mountain, souls were on the
          verge of freezing in terror.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“The Ancient Beings from the various Forces are opening up a path, we
          shall follow behind them.” One of the Sect Masters gestured with a
          commanding wave of his hand, and led his disciples and Elders behind
          him. They transformed into a brilliant light and entered the mountain
          that was shrouded in thick fog. The people of other Forces proceeded
          to follow suit, but each ventured in a different direction.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The terrain of Kun Mountain was intricate and perilous, yet it also
          held numerous opportunities. With the presence of Dao Artifacts paving
          the way for them, the usual intimidating aura shrouding Kun Mountain
          was significantly diminished, hence increasing the likelihood of
          encountering a stroke of luck.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many young prodigies shared the same notion. Since they were forced
          to enter Kun Mountain by Gu Changge, they might as well try to reap
          greater rewards while safeguarding their lives.</span

          >“Let’s go this way.” People from the Hidden An Clan and War Immortal
          Mansion walked together, the two True Daoists looked at each other,
          and then went in from another direction. An Xi and the Young War
          Immortal cast a wary glance at Gu Changge, who was standing not far
          away from them. Both of them felt uneasy to see that he hadn’t taken
          any action yet and appeared to be observing. Even so, they refused to
          believe that Gu Changge would have the audacity to attack them, when
          there were two True Daoists in their presence.</span

          distance, Gu Changge stopped observing and started carefully studying
          the terrain of Kun Mountain. In the end, he didn’t follow An Xi’s
          group but instead chose to forge ahead on a less travelled path.

          definitely an invaluable asset in our efforts to rescue our Prime
          Ancestor.” Ji Chuyue remained deeply concerned for Jiang Chen&#8217;s
          safety. She feared that her family might choose to burn bridges rather
          than cross them, so she persisted in defending him.</span

          valuable asset, so he had to make promises in order to entice him.
          However, it didn’t change the fact that Jiang Chen had offended Gu
          Changge, and the Ji Family wasn’t going to risk the safety of their
          family to defend him. In any case, he would decide how to deal with

          unstoppable force rose up into the heavens, illuminating the sky for
          millions of kilometres. Supreme experts clashed in a fierce battle
          against the energy of arrays found in Kun Mountain. The sheer

          the world had crumbled away. The impact was felt far and wide, sending

          to rescue their Prime Ancestor, it would undoubtedly have a
          significant impact on the current state of affairs in the Upper
          Realm.</span

          World, the Eternal Overcast continued to ravage the land, this time,
          with even greater intensity. Its momentum was akin to the unstoppable
          force of the water bursting through its dam. The repercussions were
          felt far and wide, with daily life in the Upper Realm greatly

          of more normal living beings, akin to the Humans, dwelling in the
          Eternal Overcast. Those of the older generation who were very
          knowledgeable about the Eternal Overcast immediately surmised this was
          likely the Eternal Overcast Royal Family’s emergence.</span

          appeared a handful of times, making their presence all the more
          significant. Their appearance had instilled a sense of crisis in many
          Forces. They could only hope that the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family
          would be successfully rescued so that he could quell the looming
          crisis.</span

          scattered patches, and the mist added a mystical ambiance to the area.
          The landscape was filled with ancient trees, vines, and spirit grass

          aura emerged, suffocating everyone. A magnificent cauldron condensed
          from golden runes soared through the air. It released a powerful black
          and yellow aura, and crushed a hazy monstrous creature.</span

          were manifested from the regrets of cultivators who once traversed Kun
          Mountain and perished within its depths. Their prowess was even more

          facing numerous challenges along the way, they were able to overcome
          them, albeit at the cost of many lives. Jiang Chen somewhat played his
          role as the Fortuitous One, and his assistance significantly reduced
          casualties in the Ji Family. As a result, members of the Ji Family
          started treating Jiang Chen more kindly.</span

          heart of Kun Mountain.” Gu Changge’s eyes held a peculiar glint as he
          spoke. With a gentle shake of his head and a wave of his hand, the
          golden cauldron in the sky exploded into a dazzling display of runes,
          dispersing the thick fog in the area.

          Immortal, An Xi, and their group to depart before picking a different

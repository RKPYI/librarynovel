        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resurfacing of the demoness in red in the Upper Realm took everyone by
                surprise. After the battle in the Divine City back then, the Demoness vanished without leaving any
                tracks behind.</span><span id="more-30676"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forces that participated in the Demon Slaying Event were either
                slaughtered or severely injured, leaving only a few survivors.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, while some guessed where the Demoness were headed to, some
                suspected she, too, was gravely injured, which she went somewhere to recover. There were also rumours
                stating that she perished in the battle, which was why she had been silent for so long. In all, all
                kinds of rumours sprouted about.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, the Demoness’ seem to be creating a Devil Mountain at the peak of
                the Endless Sea caused a great disturbance. This news was as grave as if a ginormous meteorite was going
                to crash into the ocean. As verification of the news, some cultivators witnessed the dense, unlimited
                demonic energy at the peak of the Endless Sea. It was thick enough to cover the moon, and cast a large
                shadow within millions of kilometres.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, there were stars plummeting from the sky, surging and forming
                an astral island that was engulfed in spine-chilling Mists of Chaos.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon such an uncanny sight, many were stupefied and some forces even sent
                their formidable experts to investigate the area in an attempt to take a glimpse of the Demoness&#8217;
                grand scheme. It would be reasonable if she merely intended to build a Devil Mountain, but if her plan
                was to rebuild an army to dominate the world, another massive massacre would surely be repeated.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Upper Realm was focused on invading Eight Wastelands and Ten
                Domains, they didn&#8217;t have sufficient manpower to deal with the Demoness. Furthermore, after the
                Demon Slaying Event, the Demoness&#8217; current terror considerably haunted countless of the Upper
                Realm, stripping them of their bravery to cross her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Devil Mountain was based at the peak of the Endless Sea, ancient
                palaces could be seen towering from the ground, along with a number of heavenly palaces and divine
                towers. Their figures were vague from afar, and resembled the burial site for all living as described in
                legends.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the assembly of Demons, the peak of Endless Sea was turned into a
                Demonic Domain comparable to the Demon-Burying Abyss. Its Demonic Energy filled the sky, repressing the
                regions in its vicinity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the Demoness seemed to have recovered much of her strength and
                mind. The forces that were concerned that she might initiate another massacre, found themselves relieved
                after seeing no notable movements from her. Thus, they could focus their attack on Eight Wastelands and
                Ten Domains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, the Upper Realm was in no way harmonious, especially after
                the destruction of Nine Great Mountains, Gu Changge&#8217;s name grew even more renown, causing enormous
                commotions all over the Upper Realm as countless forces grew even more afraid of him.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, Gu Changge had become a young peerless legend in the eyes of
                countless. Essentially, he was barely in his twenty, yet his strength, enough to intimidate the entire
                world, was rivalled by none. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including annihilating those in the Sacred Emperor Realm and leading an army
                and causing the destruction of the Nine Great Mountains, all sorts of rumours were spread around. They
                left the younger generation trembling in hopelessness as they were disheartened by the disparity between
                them and Gu Changge.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, to the older generations, Gu Changge&#8217;s name was ever
                so horrid as they were deeply astounded by him. Some of them even claimed to be witnessing the birth of
                a legend and assured that the historic records in the future would definitely feature Gu Changge. In
                fact, describing his glory to be unparalleled wouldn&#8217;t even be an overstatement.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in the Lower Realm, innumerable people were also praising Gu
                Changge&#8217;s name, chanting his name as if it could protect them from mortality. Moreover, there were
                even ancient beings that began to disregard his age.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young prodigies that had been compared to him previously, such as the
                King with Six Crowns and the Phoenix Lady, who also possess daunting Talents in their own right, were
                absolutely nothing compared to him now. The distance in strength between them was like the distance
                between heaven and earth. .</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, in many cultivators&#8217; opinion, the only person of the young
                generation that could match Gu Changge was the one who escaped from him numerous times—the Successor of
                Demonic Arts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it had been quite a long time since the Successor of Demonic Arts
                last made a sound, given that they were not as rampant as they were before. Therefore, cultivators came
                to the conclusion that the Successor of Demonic must realise that he was no match for Gu Changge,
                resulting in his decision to stay low and refrain from encountering him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* At that moment, giant ancient battleships soared across the sky
                towards the Boundary Marker Sea. A great number as figures covered the sky, casting endless shadows upon
                the world. As ancient horns were blown, the battleships carried the colossal Upper Realm Army for the
                assault.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possessing vast auras, the ancient battleships could traverse through Space
                Tunnels, and their terror knew no bounds as their auras tore everything amid chaos apart.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing the dreadful auras, even the vigorous living beings of the
                Lower Realm grew subconsciously terrified.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the battleships, one was significantly larger and older as celestial
                energy was wafting around it while there were heavenly palaces, Mystic Mountains, and levitating
                celestial islands. Also harbouring a waterfall that glistened like silver, the battleship resembled a
                gargantuan ancient continent. Unlike that of the other ancient battleships, the faces of the cultivators
                on this one seemed much more youthful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than the young prodigies of the current era, there were also ancient
                monsters that had just surfaced recently, including the descendants of certain Ancient Immortal Races
                whose frightening auras and aggression filled the sky, as they each possessed their own ultimate
                methods.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the door, formidable followers were waiting to serve, but compared to
                ordinary cultivators, they were clearly much stronger as they had reached the Sacred Realm.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instant, the forces of the younger generation raised by Immortal
                Academy, Skyward Schloss, Sky Demon Tower, Holy King Palace, and War Immortal Manor were gathered on the
                ancient battleship. They were considered to be the most exceptional elites among the young generation in
                the Upper Realm. It was as though it was a gathering between celebrated figures of the world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, all of them were intent on participating in the attack on Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains. According to precedents and customs, before a path through the Aether Abyss
                was found and had been solidified, there would be a fight between the cultivators of the younger
                generation or the older generation of two parties, while the supreme experts, also the ultimate decision
                makers, would not interfere unless necessary.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the Principles of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were not
                complete, and this was still close to the borders of two realms colliding with each other. This meant
                that the Great Dao here was chaotic and it hindered the supreme experts from using their full power.
                Once, because of this, quite a number of supreme experts were killed in the Aether Abyss.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, nevertheless, all forces of the Upper Realm marched over with
                terrorising intimidation as supreme experts were already advancing in their Dharma Bodies.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So we meet again, Xianer&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, on a mountain top surrounded by Celestial Mists and crimson
                gleams, a young woman—a true perfect beauty in a wide-sleeved Celestial Dress, blessed with a slender
                waist, impeccable visage, was cultivating with her legs crossed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around her body, there were glowing mists and her every pore seemed to be
                shining, as though there were miniature goddesses chanting ancient scriptures within. Under the vibrant
                glow, her skin appeared even snowier and flawless, thanks to the fragile-looking radiant shade.
                Seemingly cool, she was carrying celestial energy all around her body. However, there was some sort of
                coldness that forbade others from getting close to her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not far away from the young woman was a big red bird, glancing at an
                approaching silver-haired young woman with the corner of its eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How many times do you need to come here to purposefully look for
                me?&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Xianer opened her eyes. Although the silver-haired young woman felt familiar
                to her, she couldn&#8217;t help but grow impatient with her.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, didn&#8217;t I say we&#8217;re quite fateful? How can you say that
                I&#8217;m here on purpose?&#8221; The silver-haired young woman giggled as she spoke, giving off a
                playful, innocent sensation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possessing a lofty body with delicate, perfect curves, she was also blessed
                with an intricate, flawless face. Her skin was as elegant as porcelain and as exquisite as jade, and her
                beauty was comparable to that of Gu Xianer.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, her eyes, resembling scarlet grass, were rosy and alluring,
                and as they captivatingly flickered, none could find a single reason to hate her. Meanwhile, on the top
                of her head, there was an inconspicuous pair of red horns, signifying her identity as a
                non-human.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two seemed to be of the same age.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Speak. What business do you have with me?&#8221; Gu Xianer
                coldly asked as she glanced at the silver-haired young woman.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silver-haired young woman before her was An Yan, and she was of the
                Hidden Celestial An Clan, which was considerably one of the strongest Clans in the Upper Realm as they
                possessed frightening, mighty abilities.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, as their bloodline was ever so potent, their number was rather
                small, similar to that of Godly Illusion Clan. Though, compared to Godly Illusion Clan, The Hidden
                Celestial Races tended to be more mysterious and discreet as only a couple of their members were seen
                treading in the outside world.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the An Clan wished to have a hand in the Upper Realm Army&#8217;s
                invasion, desiring a slice of the big pie, which was why they sent some of their men to participate in
                the battle.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Xianer and An Yan knew each other, but their relationship did not start
                from here, but back when Gu Xianer, upon the instruction of her mentors, departed from Peach Village and
                headed to Ascension Island to cultivate. And as she was attempting to breakthrough, she coincidentally
                met An Yan.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, after knowing about Gu Xianer&#8217;s identity, An Yan took a
                notable interest in her and started to cling to her all the time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, the two would explore secret ruins and together, they would
                acquire items that fetched wonders offered in auctions, and so, the two then became acquainted.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can&#8217;t I visit you just to see how you&#8217;re doing? You sound
                as if I can&#8217;t visit you when I have nothing to do.&#8221; An Yan rolled her eyes, complacently
                talking before sitting very close beside Gu Xianer.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Gu Xianer shot her a glare and moved to the other side, saying,
                &#8220;Stay away from me.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmph!&#8221; What a heartless girl! Did you forget who almost got
                slaughtered by a beast in the Sacred King Realm? If I hadn&#8217;t cast the array at that crucial
                moment, perhaps now your tomb would be filled with grass!&#8221; Somewhat angered, An Yan looked at her
                scornfully, whining as she sneered.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gu Xianer, as her patience was thinning, blandly
                stated, &#8220;Rest assured. Even without your help, I could still have survived that day. The number of
                protective items I carry with me is no less than what you have.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, right! I almost forgot who you are! You&#8217;re the little
                princess of the Immortal Gu Family! There&#8217;s no way you would lack any protective items!&#8221; An
                Yan&#8217;s face speedily changed as it turned into a gleeful grin. &#8220;Besides, the man whose
                current popularity in the entirety of the Upper Realm, who is known to be peerless, also happens to be
                your cousin. Gu Changge is said to treat you extremely well, so how would you ever lack protective
                items?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, Gu Xianer slightly tensed her delicate brows. &#8220;Gu
                Changge didn&#8217;t give me my protective items. In fact, he should be grateful that I didn&#8217;t
                seize his belongings!&#8221; She sounded rather resentful when An Yan mentioned Gu Changge, though she
                managed to retain her celestial, noble look in front of the other women, not losing the slightest
                composure.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly surprised by those words, An Yan widened her crystalline eyes.
                &#8220;But the rumours say that he&#8217;s so good to you! Why would you take his stuff?&#8221; </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if it was her first time hearing such news, she was rather curious and in
                disbelief. &#8220;Besides, the rumours say everything about Gu Changge, and they&#8217;re being spread
                around like some kind of mythical fable! I&#8217;ve always assumed that they were real!&#8221;</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snickering through her nose, Gu Xianer replied, &#8220;Rumours are only
                rumours. You can only believe what you see. Anyway, why are you always bringing that scum
                up?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, An Yan giggled and answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m just curious, alright? We
                are such best friends. I basically hear rumours about him every day, and it is said that he has
                destroyed the Nine Great Mountains. And since you&#8217;re his cousin, I suppose I could refer to
                you.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really?&#8221; Gu Xianer turned her head and stared deeply at her, as
                if she could perceive her true intentions.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fine, fine. To be frank, I&#8217;ve heard that we will be fighting
                against young prodigies from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. So, I&#8217;m worried that certain
                accidents may occur. Since Gu Changge will be there, should any accident happen to me, I suppose I could
                use some help. You know, I haven&#8217;t come to the outside world for long, please take pity on me.
                Look. I really lack battle experience, I am surely no match for the young prodigies from the Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains.&#8221; An Yan shook her head and confessed, seemingly unable to withstand Gu
                Xianer&#8217;s judgmental stare.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, for the sake of our acquaintanceship, I won&#8217;t
                abandon you if you get into trouble.&#8221; Following An Yan&#8217;s honesty, Gu Xianer decided not to
                pursue the matter any further.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that! Perhaps I could take the chance to meet
                your cousin. Fine, I shan&#8217;t interrupt your cultivation any longer. Can&#8217;t wait to see you
                defeat Gu Changge!&#8221; Upon Gu Xianer&#8217;s assurance, An Yan revealed a smile before excusing
                herself and happily leaving with jovial skips.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After watching as she left, Gu Xianer furrowed her brows and called for the
                big red bird that was not far away. &#8220;Hong, why am I getting the feeling that she came with an
                ulterior motive?&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She uncertainly asked as she couldn&#8217;t fathom An Yan&#8217;s purpose of
                getting close to her after numerous contemplation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the big red bird glanced at her and tilted its head, revealing
                a look that suggested her to be more cautious.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then why did she come to me?&#8221; Gu Xianer&#8217;s brows were
                tensed even tighter as she was thoroughly puzzled.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Given her identity as the Princess of the An Clan, she is by no means weaker
                than me. Did she mean everything she said, merely wanting my help during the battle? Or does she intend
                to get close to Gu Changge?] Thinking the matter was more than meets the eye, Gu Xianer still
                couldn&#8217;t think it through, after which she dropped the pondering and got back to cultivating.
                Gleaming mists then surged around her body as she was preparing for the battle against Eight Wastelands
                and Ten Domains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, after leaving the mountain, An Yan returned to the cave
                which she was currently staying in. The innocent, exuberant look of hers in front of Gu Xianer
                disappeared, and there wasn&#8217;t much emotion on her face.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Yan, are you certain this will work?&#8221; Before her, there was
                an hunchbacked old servant, whose eyes were sunken and cheeks were high. Also possessing a pair of horns
                on the head, the old servant carried a dense, unconcealable aura.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There shall be no problem. After such a long investigation, I&#8217;m
                sure Gu Xianer is one of the individuals who is closest to Gu Changge, and she is the most precious
                person to him. What Gu Xianer knows about Gu Changge is much more realistic than what the rumours hold.
                This is a good indication of how highly he values her. Otherwise, there&#8217;s no way a person like him
                would reveal his true colours so mindlessly. As long as I keep Gu Xianer by my side, I&#8217;ll be able
                to enter Gu Changge&#8217;s sight, and thereby be able to come in contact with him.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, An Yan shook her head and revealed a pondering look that
                didn&#8217;t quite fit her appearance. In that instant, she was very calm and reserved. Compared to how
                she was in front of Gu Xianer, she was completely different now as those were two distinctive faces of
                hers.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In that case, this old one is relieved. Gu Changge is a dangerous man.
                If you wish to approach him, you must keep your guard up and proceed with caution at all times.&#8221;
                Upon those words, the old servant heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodding, An Yan then donned a gloomy expression. &#8220;I am indeed aware of
                that. Gu Xianer may appear rebellious and obnoxious, but she&#8217;s a smart one. Perhaps she has
                already seen through some things.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, she then let out a disaffected sigh. &#8220;But she
                didn&#8217;t make things difficult for me. If it weren&#8217;t for the risks and burdens, I&#8217;d be
                happy to befriend her genuinely.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The recent years have been hard on you, Lady Yan. Lady Xi&#8217;s
                influence is exponentially growing, and her right to speak has gradually exceeded that of the clan
                leader. I estimate that she&#8217;ll be in control of the entire An Clan in a couple of years, and only
                by then you will find yourself extremely burdened in the clan, Lady Yan.&#8221; Hearing that, the old
                servant seemed rather sorrowful and quite sympathetically dejected.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Yan, you&#8217;ve been living in the crevices of the clan, warily
                walking on thin ice all these years. Not only are you shouldering the task of alleviating Lady
                Xi&#8217;s problems, you also had to keep the greed of the other branches towards the clan’s legacies in
                check. Yet, as your father, the clan leader, didn&#8217;t seem to care and is even ignoring this. If
                Mistress is still with us, she would have let Lady Xi rule the clan on her own.&#8221; The old
                servant&#8217;s voice was trembling, harbouring overwhelming sadness and rage.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Yan then shook her head and replied, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to tell
                me that. I&#8217;m aware. Besides, there&#8217;s no point in being so pessimistic. After all, it&#8217;s
                An Xi&#8217;s fault for having saved someone she shouldn&#8217;t have. If she were to hear about this…
                Hidden Celestial Bloodline or not, it doesn&#8217;t matter any more. Even if True Immortals were to
                resurface in the world, no one would have batted an eye.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, she began to chortle coldly, as if she was completely
                confident.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, many ancient battleships soared through the sky and crashed open
                the border of the sky as they flew across the Boundary Marker Sea. Raging waves were continuously
                gushing, as if it could break the world apart. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurrying towards the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the ever so vast Upper
                Realm Army that knew no bound hid everything inside as their number even reached ten million.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, outside the Aether Abyss, fogs were drifting everywhere, filling
                the sky as battlecries thundered. The ancient battleships halted their forward motion as innumerable
                soldiers of the army menacingly approached. At the same time, the neighbouring universes were also
                emitting blaring, quaking noises upon the daunting presence of the army.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a palace, Gu Changge, whose figure was vague, was sitting as wafts Chaos
                Qi swirled around him. It was as though there were thousands of ancient worlds surrounding him while
                gods vaguely flickered around him in silver lights that wouldn&#8217;t wane.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, a drop of True Blood could be seen underneath his organs. It
                was as though there was a reflection of all worlds in existence travelling along the flow of the River
                of Time, shattering the World Principles. It seemed to form a type of energy, traces of which were being
                absorbed by him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a fathomless drop of Forbidden Blood.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, the Sky Deer Goddess was clearly dumbfounded, not daring to get
                closer as unshakeable dread arose in her heart.</span></p>

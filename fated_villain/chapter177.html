      <h4>
        Chapter 177: The Relationship is Not Complicated at All, Adulthood
        Beauty and Bitter Couples Go Well Together!
      </h4>
      <p>———</p>
      <p>
        Though Mingkong had lived two lifetimes, the sight still managed to
        shock her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She’d finally seen a portion of Gu Changge's strength that was always
        hidden by him .
      </p>
      <p>
        In secret, his cultivation base had already broken through to the Sacred
        Realm. Such terrifying speeds defied all common sense. If news of this
        were to spread, it would undoubtedly cause panic.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was at this moment she understood the true horrors of the Immortal
        Devouring Demonic Arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the reason why chaos erupted in the world every time inheritors
        of the Immortal Devouring Demonic Arts were born. Countless Daoist sects
        and lineages will chase them, hunting them down until they are
        eventually slaughtered.
      </p>
      <p>Such cultivating speed was simply too shocking.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was only in his early twenties, and yet he’d already reached
        a height that most ordinary cultivators would never achieve.
      </p>
      <p>‘To be targeted by Gu Changge must be a nightmare…’</p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong suddenly remembered her hopes of taking revenge against
        him. But now, it was crystal clear that such thoughts were stupid,
        ridiculous even.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        The Immortal Road suddenly trembled, as if a terrible earthquake had
        occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mountain shook as a multitude of densely packed divine lights began
        to rush outwards.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge…”</b></p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong’s cold eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
      <p>
        In the next instant, she saw a figure in the middle, scorched black with
        a Black Dao Bottle above his head, rushing towards the exit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Billions of lightning bolts covered the sky, letting out a ferocious
        roar as it rumbled and fell behind him.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>The road shook again, as cracks began to form!</p>
      <p>
        However, the moment the sea of lightning attempted to rush to the
        outside world, it was blocked by a layer of runes that seemingly rippled
        at the touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lightning vanished into the void, like snow melting under the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this mighty calamity of thunder and lightning had yet to
        split Gu Changge in two.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was his good fortune to devour the Fairy Spirit and have a
        breakthrough in his cultivation base. However, as a result…
      </p>
      <p>
        The skies immediately darkened, as a volatile thunderstorm fell. Each
        strand of lightning was enough to strike down any ordinary Sacred Realm
        cultivator. If they dared to act carelessly, let alone their bodies,
        their very souls would be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge knew that this was caused by the Divine Rules within the
        Immortal Road, which led to Heavenly Tribulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the present-day Upper Realm, having such breakthroughs would not
        cause the descent of a Heavenly Tribulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only in the Immortal Period did talented and powerful demons encounter
        the baptism of the Heavenly Tribulation when having a breakthrough.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, it seems as though this tribulation wanted him dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge faced a few waves, but he felt that the situation was
        steadily growing out of hand, so he left. He knew that the subsequent
        waves would only get stronger, with its power reaching the Great Sacred
        Realm, perhaps even spiking to the Quasi-Supreme Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge knew his strength well, but there was no need to end up
        half-dead in a place like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get his Cultivation Base to the late stage of the Sacred Realm – a
        very comfortable stage to be in – in one fell swoop, Gu Changge had to
        gather up the entirety of the Fairy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, for now, he’d have to hold off on finishing the refinement
        process.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, his main goal has been fulfilled.</p>
      <p>And Gu Changge was very satisfied with the outcome.</p>
      <p>
        But now he had other things to do. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p><b>“Pfft…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong could not help but let out a pleasant laugh at Gu Changge,
        who was now scorched black.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the first time she’d ever seen the wretched Gu Changge be
        chased by something.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked at her, and he looked at himself, his face as calm as always.
      </p>
      <p>
        His body began to gently shake as the layer of skin that was scorched
        black began to break inch by inch!
      </p>
      <p>A layer of clear fragrance surfaced.</p>
      <p>
        His newborn skin was crystal clear, possessing the lustre of immortal
        jade. ‘Even if the world is destroyed and the universe collapses, I
        shall remain.[1]’
      </p>
      <p>[1.Long Teng’s skill description (vitality power)]</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong stared.</p>
      <p>
        Her snow-white face, her pair of eyes that emitted a fire of divine
        glory, stared unblinkingly at Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“For you to look at me for so long, it’s only fair if I look at you
          as well, no?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge casually spoke, as a smile tugged at the corners of his
        mouth.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Fairness?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong froze, hurriedly turning her head as she faintly said,
        <b>“Th-then, shouldn’t you hurry up and put on your clothes?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge laughed as he asked,
        <b>“If you’re so fascinated, why not take advantage of it?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong bit down, forcing herself to swallow her words, as she
        desperately wanted to hide the places her mind had wandered to.
      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGS!]</p>
      <p>Gu Changge soon found a robe and casually dressed himself.</p>
      <p>He went outside, muttering to himself…</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The Fairy Gate will close soon. But since I opened it in advance,
          it’ll be harder to open in the future.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        He knew that the next time the Fairy Gate opens, those old geezers will
        come running, engulfing the area in a terrible and bloody storm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, Gu Changge has picked the peaches ahead of time. Even if
        they did come running, they wouldn’t get much.
      </p>
      <p>Other than Yue Mingkong, there was no one else who knew.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Irrelevant. Additionally, it’s not like anyone will know that you
          opened it,”</b
        >
        Yue Mingkong replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although her harvest was far inferior to Gu Changge’s, she still managed
        a huge breakthrough in her cultivation, managing to faintly touch upon
        the peak of the False God Realm.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Mhm, no one other than you.”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge said with a smile.</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong was momentarily stunned, ‘What does he mean?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Is he trying to warn me that, if word gets out, he’ll come to find me
        first?’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Don’t worry, I won’t leak any information.” </b>Yue Mingkong said.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Not you, what are you so nervous about?” </b>Gu Changge shook his
        head as he bluntly replied.
      </p>
      <p>He had quite a headache.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Mingkong really does a good job at illustrating the saying “Once
        bitten, twice shy ”.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong has let down her guard, but she still didn’t trust him in
        full.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, Gu Changge didn’t have any current need to harvest any more
        Fortune Value and Destiny Points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite having exchanged for more transcendent bones and expanding his
        Inner World, he still had tens of thousands of remaining Fortune Value
        and Destiny Points.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘I’m afraid that the next phase of the plan is still needed if I want to
        complete the system’s task .’
      </p>
      <p>His intentions were quite simple.</p>
      <p>Generally, women tend to place more weight on emotion than reason.</p>
      <p>
        He had already paved the way; all that’s left to do was wait for the
        next heart-wrenching scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Ye Ling was dead. Unfortunately for Ye Ling, he still
        carried the black pot as the “Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It was time for Gu Changge to consider finding yet another scapegoat.

      <p>

          >“Oh, and consider this your payment for standing guard. There’s no
          need for doubt, just take it.”</b
        >
        Gu Changge added, speaking with a natural tone of voice that was neither
        close nor distant.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he raised his hand, vague signs of immortal intent emerged. Wisps of
        immortal aura seemed to fill the area in a brilliant haze, like the rays
        of the sun.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong could hardly believe it when she saw it.</p>
      <p><b>“The Fairy Spirit, for you.”</b></p>
      <p>[PR/N: Take notes, guys. Don’t give flowers, give fairy spirits.]</p>
      <p>
        With those words, Gu Changge sealed the jade jar. Though these were
        merely leftovers, it wasn’t a small amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the current Yue Mingkong, these were obviously more than enough.
        Even after using them, she would still have plenty left.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, the jade jar fell lightly onto Yue Mingkong’s hand.</p>
      <p>
        And with a single step, Gu Changge’s robe fluttered as he appeared high
        in the sky.
      </p>
      <p><b>Whoosh!</b></p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, many of his nearby followers – including Yin Mei –
        appeared in unison.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge turned into a divine rainbow as he led them elsewhere.</p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong stood, frozen in place, as she stared at the jade jar in
        her hands.
      </p>
      <p>She was at a loss for words.</p>
      <p>She didn’t expect Gu Changge to give her the Fairy Spirit.</p>
      <p>
        After all, he risked his life to obtain this prize in the Immortal Road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each strand was incomparably rare, holding an incalculable value that
        even a Supreme Realm existence would be moved by.
      </p>
      <p>She couldn’t help but feel frustrated.</p>
      <p>
        Previously, Gu Changge would tease her, referring to himself as her
        husband. But now, there was a clear distance between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This arrangement where we merely remained on good terms with one
        another…’ Yue Mingkong was in a daze.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was difficult to get to where they were before, where she pretended
        to be confused as Gu Changge happily teased her.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘How good would it have been if I didn’t say those words?’ Yue Mingkong
        shook her head, as she let out a bitter sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        She quickly restrained herself, before packing up the many formations
        she’d placed.
      </p>
      <p>Then, she left with her group of followers.</p>
      <p>———</p>
      <p>
        After leaving the Baiheng Mountains, Gu Changge rushed to the place
        where he was before.
      </p>
      <p>
        He’d already sent a message back to his family. Their people should be
        already running around the Ancient Immortal Continent at this very
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gu family was more than happy to annex the Ancient Immortal Races
        under the guise of righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge has stirred up the water so much that, in his eyes, it would
        be impossible for the other Daoist Sects to stand idle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resources within the Ancient Immortal Continent, alongside the many
        events that have taken place, were more than enough to alarm the Daoist
        Sects.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Greetings, Young Master!”</b></p>
      <p>
        In the middle of the ruins was a mighty soldier in immortal armour,
        riding atop an ancient pure-blooded beast whose murderous intent shook
        the very heavens and cast a chilling aura on the surrounding area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The soldiers had been waiting here, their horrifying and incomparable
        killing aura permeating the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of them was covered in bright immortal armour. These were veterans
        who have experienced countless battles, their eyes like heavenly swords
        that seemed to disturb the very air in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>The Invincible Army of the Immortal Gu Family!</p>
      <p>
        Whenever a big conflict or war involving the Immortal Gu Family came
        about, this team was sent to swiftly resolve the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their hands were stained with countless blood, as one would expect from
        one of the sharpest weapons in the Gu Family’s arsenal.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most, it would be impossible for them to use so many of this elite
        group. However, the situation in the Ancient Immortal Continent proved
        to be quite exceptional.
      </p>
      <p>
        They received his orders, and they were merely waiting for his return.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘With this much power in addition to a few of my puppets, I’ll be able
        to clear some of the clans with ease.’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s gaze swept over them, nodding a bit.</p>
      <p>Naturally, he knew that an ancestor was among them.</p>
      <p>He was from Gu Xian’er’s lineage, but that was all he knew.</p>
      <p>
        That said, this figure was an ancestor of the Gu Family, so it would be
        no problem at all even if they encountered some of the Ancient Immortal
        Races’ powerhouses.
      </p>
      <p>And if the ancestor didn’t agree to lend his aid?</p>
      <p>Then it matters not. After all, Gu Changge has his ways…</p>
      <p>
        ‘The Great Elder still owes me a favour as well. I don’t think even he
        would be able to resist coming to the Ancient Immortal Continent…’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘When the time comes and it really doesn’t work out, there’s still plan
        B.’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge’s eyes narrowed. He’d long since planned everything.</p>
      <p>
        He’ll start with the Tiangou Clan, a group that was a constant thorn at
        his side.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, he’ll knock on the mountain and shake the tiger up a
        bit by killing the chicken to make an example for the monkeys.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the other races were smart, they wouldn’t want to make the same
        mistake, and they’ll know what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the ensuing chaos will create the perfect opportunity
        for the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan to strike from the shadows.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Go to the Tiangou Clan.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge gave the order as he indifferently landed on the ancient
        warship. The vast collection of soldiers flew across the skies with huge
        and shocking momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, three figures stood in the sky, observing all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er, the Great Elder, and Gu Nashan – still dressed like an old
        yellow-toothed farmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Gu Changge should be headed to the Tiangou Clan.”</b> Gu Xian’er
        speculated upon noticing the route Gu Changge took.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Such a heavy heart filled with vengeance and murderous intent. How
          did he become the Young Master…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Nashan shook his head, but his face said otherwise.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Ancestor, the Tiangou Clan was here since the Immortal Period. The
          agreement was set in stone, and yet they broke it. Do you not care
          about what happens to Gu Changge?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er felt that Gu Changge wanted to crush the Tiangou Clan,
        despite only having the Invincible Army with him.
      </p>
      <p>‘Wouldn’t it be too much?’</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Don’t worry, when the time comes, this old ancestor will make his
          move.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing her concerns, Gu Nashan couldn’t help but twitch a bit as
        he quickly recovered, forcing himself to smile as he replied.
      </p>
      <p>In truth, he wanted Gu Changge to suffer a big loss.</p>
      <p>
        Though he sung his praises in front of Xian’er, he had to consider the
        long-term for the sake of the family, not to mention resolving the
        grudge between the two.
      </p>
      <p>Personally, he had no good feelings for Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>In fact, he wanted to teach him a lesson for bullying Gu Xian’er.</p>
      <p>But Gu Xian’er has spoken, so what could he do?</p>
      <p>
        When the time comes, it would be impossible for him to just watch as the
        Tiangou Clan’s ancestors show up to push around the Gu Family’s juniors
        while he – an ancestor – hides in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, Gu Nashan felt like he had encountered a giant pain in
        the a*s.
      </p>
      <p>‘It feels like I’ve been scammed…’</p>
      <p>The void blurred in front of the three, as they quickly followed.</p>
      <p>
        At this moment, it wasn’t just them. The other Daoists who were
        currently in the Ancient Immortal Continent, and even the Ancient
        Immortal Races themselves were on high alert.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, the outside area of the Tiangou Clan was being swept by
        multiple instances of divine sense, as many experts inquired about the
        various goings-on.
      </p>
      <p><b>Rumble!</b></p>
      <p>
        However, the number of warships parked in the sky made countless natives
        and outside cultivators tremble, as their hearts couldn’t help but
        shudder.

        The Primordial Divine Sect had been camping here for quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tiangou Clan resolved themselves, doing everything they could to
        prevent the invasion of the Primordial Divine Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the fact was that these people came to their land with the
        intent of not just killing them, but blackmailing them. This came as a
        great shock and horror for all onlookers.
      </p>
      <p>Such bold attitude showed that they were worthy of their namesake.</p>
      <p>
        They openly paraded their weapons, boiling with murderous intent as they
        allowed the other side to wash their necks right after they’d run them
        through.
      </p>
      <p>The people trembled at their monstrous, demonic nature.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It is said that the sect is merely waiting for Young Master Changge
          to arrive. Some time ago, the Tiangou Clan used a Sacred-grade
          Artifact to attack the Young Master with the intent to kill. This
          matter has incurred the wrath of the Primordial Demon Sect, as they
          personally sent a large number of elites to join in the slaughter…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I believe that the Immortal Gu Family is also furious. There’s a
          group of soldiers clad in immortal armour, who used a void passage to
          descend to this location. They’re here to suppress the clan too!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The Tiangou Clan must be scared out of its wits. I doubt anyone
          would’ve expected the Primordial Demon Sect to run so rampantly as to
          blockade them.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I would be scared too! Even the thought of resistance is futile… the
          Ancient Immortal Gu Family is one of the most mysterious lineages in
          the Upper Realm. It’s said that they’ve stood at the top since the
          Immortal Period, far beyond any other power.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Their heritage is unfathomable. Even if the battle unfolds and it
          isn’t as deadly as a war between immortals, the aftermath wouldn’t be
          something that people can easily scoff at…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the many peaks and ridges in the distance, a group of cultivators
        discussed amongst themselves, as they stared at the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Young Supremes were among them, such as the Immortal Lake’s heir,
        who watched from a nearby mountain peak with his forces behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In another direction was the heir of the Ancient Immortal Wang Family,
        Wang Wushuang, who frowned as he pondered the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In another place, the Ancient Immortal Ye Family, with Ye Langtian, Ye
        Luili, and others.
      </p>
      <p>———</p>
      <p>Everyone was shocked.</p>
      <p>The battle held a huge significance.</p>
      <p>
        The Tiangou Clan was, among the Ancient Immortal Races, a large clan
        that was ranked in the top 15.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although their clan did not have the privilege of being called
        “Immortal”, their ancestors once stood at the top of every other race.
      </p>
      <p>They were emperors!</p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        At that moment, to the shock of all cultivators and native beings, a
        radiant spatial channel emerged from the void.
      </p>
      <p>Immortal chants followed, immortal light filling the area.</p>
      <p>
        The sharpness of a heavenly sword, the killing aura of veteran soldiers
        in full immortal armour as they rode atop fierce and hideous beasts that
        seemed to flood the world with murderous intent.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Slaughter them!”</b></p>
      <p>Their bloodlust echoed throughout heaven and earth.</p>
      <p><b>“Young Master!”</b></p>
      <p>
        The strong figures atop the warships in front of them respectfully
        shouted in their direction.
      </p>
      <p>Amidst the blurred passage, Gu Changge’s figure appeared.</p>
      <p>
        He stood on a warship with his hands behind his back, his robes
        fluttering as his indifferent eyes overlooked the Tiangou Clan below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him were a large group of followers whose murderous auras
        threatened to overturn the sky itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“No need to be so polite.”</b> Gu Changge said, nodding at the group
        of powerhouses from the Primordial Demon Sect.
      </p>
      <p>This was the sect from his mother’s side.</p>
      <p>And the current sect leader was none other than his uncle.</p>
      <p>The previous head was, of course, his maternal grandfather.</p>
      <p>
        Compared to his grandfather, his uncle was so dedicated to cultivation
        he never married and was childless.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, he was practically the Young Master of the Primordial Divine
        Sect as well.
      </p>
      <p>Nothing complicated about this relationship at all.</p>
      <p>
        Why else would the rest of the Young Supremes be so afraid to provoke
        him? Not only in strength but also in background, they were far inferior
        to Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Gu Changge appeared, the heavy aura extended to what seemed like
        thousands of miles all around.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge!”</b></p>
      <p><b>“Let go of our young master!”</b></p>
      <p>
        From within the Tiangou Clan, several figures rushed out, soaring
        through the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Their wings unfolded, as their fury was made known.</p>
      <p>
        Going by their appearance, they were about the same age as Gu Changge,
        members of the ever-impulsive younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>They rushed out at once, defying their elders’ orders.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Let go of their young master?”</b> Gu Changge asked with a sinister
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged man in golden armour at the side respectfully replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Young Master, that person over there is none other than the heir of
          the Tiangou Clan, Yu Xuan.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        As he said that, he grabbed Yu Xuan – whose cultivation was sealed –
        with one hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge! I’ll kill you! You’ll pay for what you did to Yu Jing!” </b
        >Yu Xuan’s angry, unyielding face filled with killing intent stared
        daggers at Gu Changge, his scarlet eyes practically hissing.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If not for my cultivation being sealed, I would’ve killed him hundreds
        of times by now!’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“And what’s his relationship with Yu Jing?” </b>Gu Changge asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Young Master, they are childhood friends, and they were quite close
          with one another.</b
        >” The golden-armoured middle-aged man replied with a bit of a playful
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Oh, I see. In that case, allow this saintly Young Master to help
          fulfil this poor man’s wishes. I’ll be sure to send the other lovebird
          to its partner.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge said, his smile never once having left his lips.</p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, let go of our heir this instant!”</b></p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the young natives in front of him roared with anger and
        killing intent as they rushed toward Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their hands glowed a Divine Artifact, shining brightly as its
        terrifying aura surged all around.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“And you plan to stop me with just a few of you and an Artifact?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge chuckled, as he stepped forward, his face unchanged. He
        raised his hand… and brought it down.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        Divine symbols intertwined, as Black and White Qi shone. The symbols
        stabilized and faded, like a divine disc spinning and crashing through
        the heavenly sky, as his palm pressed down.
      </p>
      <p><b>Puff!</b></p>
      <p>
        Their precious artifact was shattered, blood splattering everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Young Geniuses in the False God Realm, along with their weapon, were
        obliterated on the spot, both their body and spirit destroyed.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Stupid.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge never expected such brainless idiots would show themselves
        yet again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tiangou Clan was so cowardly that none of the older generations
        dared to show up themselves.
      </p>
      <p>He was a bit disappointed.</p>
      <p>
        He then raised his palm yet again, as he sent Yu Xuan to accompany his
        beloved childhood sweetheart.
      </p>
      <p>
        When all was said and done, one could only pray that this pair of
        lovebirds would meet once more on the other side.

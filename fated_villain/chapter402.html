          far off distance. With her current ability, she couldn&#8217;t sense
          the battle happening there. Even though she knew that Gu Changge was
          very powerful, she couldn&#8217;t be sure until the result was

          sudden faint fluctuation from outside the Domain, and the void in
          front of her blurred before Gu Changge&#8217;s figure appeared from
          it. Seeing how calm and clean he was, Empress Yao Xi and Song Youwei
          were both stunned from the disbelief at how relaxed he looked. There
          were no injuries on his body, and his breathing was stable without any
          disordered fluctuations. He didn&#8217;t seem any different from his
          normal self.</span

          for suddenly running away in the end. I didn&#8217;t go after him
          because I was worried about what is happening here. &#8220;How are

          Empress Yao Xi shook her head. However, she didn&#8217;t actually
          believe what Gu Changge said. She had a feeling this matter was not as
          simple as Gu Changge made it sound to be.</span

          demeanour if the Night Demon really escaped. The Solar Heavenly Blade
          was probably in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands now as well. However, she
          tactfully avoided asking Gu Changge since he didn&#8217;t say
          anything. She had already accepted a great favour from Gu Changge
          today.

          nothing to Gu Changge. When Purple Mansion was destroyed, most of what
          they had fell into his hands. One or two Nirvana Grade Artifacts might
          be precious to most forces, but Gu Changge was someone who even had a

          went to Gu Changge after the Night Demon died. Of course, he also took
          his Sacred Emperor Source. It was just that since he had said nothing

          Overlords who have disappeared. I wonder, what secrets are they
          hiding?] Gu Changge was very interested in their so-called secrets.
          There were only two possibilities as to what this &#8216;secret&#8217;

          Or could it be poison? If Qing Zhu had prior knowledge about it, Jun
          Bufan must have control over her using her soul or a curse. That way,
          it would allow him to have control over her life and death at any

          realisation. The four female officials around Her Majesty could be
          said to be her right-hand women, who had been by her side for hundreds
          of years. Many even treated them like they were the Empress herself.

          years. It was impossible to believe that she actually betrayed Empress

          Empress found out who had betrayed her if the assassination failed.
          But in his opinion, it would still take some time. He believed that
          Empress Yao Xi would not be able to find out who betrayed her
          immediately. That an investigation was necessary before she would find

          regular one. He could still freely control the poison&#8217;s

          past. She didn&#8217;t ask Qing Zhu her reason for betraying her. In
          her eyes, Qing Zhu had grown from an ordinary bamboo tree, with a

          >What happened in the Sacred Mountain and the Black and White Academy
          today soon shocked the Demon World, and the news was so widespread
          that many in the Upper World also caught wind of it. The scale of the
          assassination attempt this time was the biggest one in 6000. There was
          even a powerful Sacred Emperor Realm Master who appeared, holding the
          Solar Demon Overlord&#8217;s Solar Heavenly Blade.</span

          >There were also a great number of skilled assassins in the Sacred
          King Realm and Sacred Lord Realm who took many lives. Many great Clans
          of Demon World also suffered heavy casualties in this attack. Among
          the servants who followed the Empress, many of them suddenly became
          violent and killed anyone in sight. In addition, a number of young
          prodigies had died, having been brutally murdered by the
          assassins.</span

          >The most shocking news was that Empress Yao Xi was poisoned, and it
          was the person closest to her who did it. Although the person who
          poisoned her had died, things were far from being over.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that, Empress Yao Xi began to thoroughly check the people around
          her, and the court filtered through all the staff. Not one of the
          officials in charge of wine was left unchecked. No matter what was the
          reason for the betrayal, all of them, plus their families, were
          executed.</span

          >The entire Demon World was a bloody mess. Everyone in the major Clans
          began to live their days with their hearts in their mouths, for fear
          that Empress Yao Xi would suddenly take them down.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, while some people were executed in this rebellion, there
          were others who were rewarded instead. Empress Yao Xi had seen how the
          Quelling Chaos King, the Grand Tutor and other groups and individuals
          had bravely fought off their enemies during the rebellion, and so she
          rewarded them with riches and Artifacts. Many of the young prodigies
          had also gained a reputation, and were generously rewarded for
          protecting the Empress

          >After &#8216;cleaning up&#8217; the court, Empress Yao Xi began to
          send people around to find traces of Jun Bufan. She also began an
          investigation on Qing Zhu&#8217;s many whereabouts and movements
          before, trying to find clues from them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A lot of things seemed to become clearer after she changed the way
          she thought. Since Jun Bufan was likely to be reborn, he would
          definitely have relatives in this life. This was something she
          completely left out before this. As a result, many whom she knew very
          well became suspicious to her. Moreover, Jun Bufan&#8217;s parents in
          this life could be kept in the dark by him, or they could be his
          accomplices.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Now that she had this clue, Empress Yao Xi was no longer worried that
          they couldn&#8217;t find the culprit. It was only a matter of time
          before it all came to light. Of course, during this period, she told
          Gu Changge the truth about everything that happened more than 6000
          years ago, as thanks for saving her, and part of a promise,</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Dealing with all this soon wore her out. Fortunately, the poison in
          her body was not causing her much damage. After a few days of being
          treated by many doctors, the poison began to recede, and she could use
          her Qi again.</span

          palace, where water vapour rose like Celestial Mist from the
          petal-filled surface. Right then, an ethereal, beautiful body that
          seemed to have taken shape from celestial jade of the highest quality

          a deal between you and me? I wouldn&#8217;t be here now if I rejected

          confused her. The perfect image he had was nothing more than the side
          he showed, and wanted people to see.</span

          >At the very beginning, she regarded Gu Changge as a Junior, or even a
          confidant, who she could talk to because Gu Changge understood the
          many intentions and painstaking efforts she had made for the Demon
          World. However, the more she got to know Gu Changge, the more she
          noticed how every word he said and everything he did was
          intentional.</span

          premise that the other party, herself, was of value to him. If he
          wasn&#8217;t promised anything in return, he could cruelly throw just
          about anyone aside. The reason he was so unrealistically perfect was
          that he only showed the side of him he wanted others to see. There was
          no way anyone could ever see through someone like him.</span

          the pool when he brought a cup of wine to his mouth. After taking a
          small sip, he calmly smiled and continued, &#8220;Furthermore, all
          that isn&#8217;t important when we both consented to this. Isn&#8217;t

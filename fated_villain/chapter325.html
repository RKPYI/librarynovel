          He waved both of his hands, and two black beams suddenly appeared in
          the void, surging with an unparalleled aura. Then, the two beams
          crisscrossed, turning into a terrifying cross that moved forward.
          Endless might that seemed to be able to devour everything, causing
          runes to gush out. It was beyond frightening.

          impact and vomited a mouthful of blood. Her aura also greatly
          weakened.</span

          unparalleled killing intent as it slashing down at him. The one who
          emitted such cold killing intent was Liu Ziyan as she asked.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Saintess Ziyan. I mean no harm. It was Sky
          King Zhi Yang who had asked me to save you.&#8221; Qin Wuya explained.
          He didn&#8217;t want to cause any unnecessary trouble. However, he
          felt that there seemed to be something wrong with her current
          state.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Sky King Zhi Yang? Save me?&#8221; Hearing this, Liu Ziyan
          sneered. Her pretty face became colder and colder, like a mysterious
          glacier that had not melted for thousands of years. It was so cold
          that everything around her seemed to freeze.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This time, she chose to make a direct move without mercy. She
          displayed her most powerful Ancient Heavenly Art, where she summoned
          all kinds of runes, involving many Great Dao Principles, that were far
          too enigmatic.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Qin Wuya frowned, feeling that things had become very tricky. [Why is
          her reaction completely different from what it is supposed to
          be?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, he didn&#8217;t want to hurt her. Instead of making a move,
          he kept dodging.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh? It seems that this is a trick to lure the tiger away from
          the mountain. I&#8217;ve been wondering why that guy seems like he was
          buying time. So, this is the true goal.&#8221; Suddenly, there was a
          voice outside the courtyard. A figure in white swept over the eaves
          and appeared. There was a faint smile on his handsome face.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Rumble!* The sky trembled, creating a huge and indescribable sound.
          Outside the courtyard, there were also many that suddenly rushed over.
          They were blocking from all sides, such that even a fly would not be
          able to fly out.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone stared at everything happening in the courtyard and took out
          all kinds of artifacts. There were radiant light shining from
          different sides, with great murderous intent engulfing the place,
          enough to completely envelop the universe.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Gu Changge&#8230;&#8221; Staring at the young man who was
          walking unhurriedly, Qin Wuya&#8217;s expression suddenly changed. His
          scalp went numb, and a boundless chill rose from his back.</span

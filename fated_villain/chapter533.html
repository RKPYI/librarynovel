          passed away, and we never even considered that he&#8217;s still alive
          and is trapped somewhere, suffering in Kun Mountain. As his

          Elders, after having consumed quite an amount of wine, were all

          &#8220;Senior Ji Shengchu&#8217;s cultivation level is unquestionably
          high and immeasurable. Despite having been trapped in Kun Mountain for
          so many years, he manages to stay alive. That pretty much sums it up.
          If we are able to rescue him, I am sure it would be of great merit to
          the Upper Realm.&#8221;</span

          troubled by the crisis caused by the Eternal Overcast. Since the Prime
          Ancestor of the Ji Family had also earned the title as a Human
          Ancestor, once he was free, he could remain in the Ji Family Residence

          Qingxuan—who were standing behind Gu Changge. It was hard to tell who
          was the older or younger one between the two of them with a brief
          glance.</span

          never showed her any concern, let alone took care of her.
          Nevertheless, at such a moment, he had to don the &#8216;good
          uncle&#8217; guise, worried that Gu Changge might think that he had
          been mistreating Ji Qingxuan.</span

          charming one,&#8221; Gu Changge replied with a light smile, turning to
          Su Qingge as he spoke. Remaining quiet, Su Qinggge lowered her gaze
          wordlessly, as she was now pretending to be Ji Qingxuan.</span

          >As delight arose on Ji Hao&#8217;s face, he hastily nodded.
          &#8220;Indeed, Qingxuan has always been an intelligent girl. Her
          approach has always been reasonable and clean.&#8221;</span

          the day, didn&#8217;t carry the &#8216;Ji&#8217; name, so to the rest,
          she seemed more like an outsider.</span

          Family, who had spent her entire life here ever since she was a child.
          If she could gain Gu Changge&#8217;s affection as her older sister
          did, that would indubitably be advantageous to the whole Ji Family.
          After all, there was no one more dependable than Gu Changge in the
          entire Upper Realm.</span

          past, they had yet to greet him on his sudden visit to the Ji Family
          Residence. Therefore, Ji Yao believed that he could take the
          opportunity to establish a connection with him.</span

          alone, his daughter, Ji Chuyue was by no means inferior to Ji Qingxuan
          and Su Qingge. Besides, Ji Qingxuan was merely his niece, while Ji
          Chuyue was his actual daughter.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, Ji Chuyue donned a light yellow dress. Her figure was
          tall and slender as mischief glistened across her beguiling eyes on
          her stunning face. Spiritual energy seemed to be whirling around her
          body, as if she was some sort of spirit.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          the Tower of World Domination behind Gu changge&#8217;s back and ended
          up upsetting him. Eventually, the Ji Family resolved the conflict by
          offering him the Wheel of World Domination, which they had arduously
          looked for.</span

          Mountains, it was all thanks to the both of you that I was able to
          locate the Tower of World Domination.&#8221; Gu Changge slightly
          nodded with a smile.</span

          awkward and were visibly embarrassed. If it weren&#8217;t for Chen
          Ning&#8217;er who was following them in the dark back then, Gu Changge
          wouldn&#8217;t have shattered the barriers outside the Purple
          Mountains so easily. But of course, Jiang Chen also had a remarkable
          contribution to the matter.</span

          forgive my sister and I for our past mistakes, but now you are even
          willing to help the Ji Family out. I am thoroughly humbled.&#8221; Ji
          Yaoxing&#8217;s face carried a trace of remorse and
          apologeticness.</span

          >&#8220;It&#8217;s no big deal. Don&#8217;t mind it.&#8221; Gu Changge
          waved his hand, seemingly casual and unaffected.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In his eyes, Ji Yaoxing was an intelligent man destined for great
          things. This trait of him grew more obvious when he shifted all the
          blame to Jiang Chen without any hesitation, making him an individual
          who understood what decision to make based on the situation. [It’s
          possible he would step back and have Ji Qingxuan take up the mantle of
          the head of the Ji Family without my persuasion at all.]</span

          Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family, not being dead quickly scattered
          across the cities. It stirred up massive disturbances and commotions
          throughout the Upper Realm. Many Forces were instantly dismayed and
          amazed.</span

          figure who had gained the title of Human Ancestor, along with the
          Mortal One, countless years ago. He had single-handedly established
          the foundation of the Ji Family. Such an individual was undoubtedly a
          jaw-dropping figure of the era. Nonetheless, for unknown reasons, he
          suddenly vanished. Thus, many assumed that he had died, which further
          led to the Ji Family&#8217;s gradual downfall.</span

          Mountain, many were dumbfounded, widening their eyes in disbelief.
          [How many years has the Prime Ancestor of the Ji Family been trapped?

          the Ji Family was a powerful figure from countless years ago, and he
          stood at the peak of the whole Upper Realm during that time. And now,
          it was revealed that all these years, he was merely trapped in Kun
          Mountain. In other words, he had been living in Kun Mountain for a few

          huge number of formidable cultivators to the Kun Mountain. However,
          before they could near Kun Mountain, they carelessly walked into
          strange arrays and were instantaneously turned into dust.</span

          recklessly. There were even instances where True Daoists were killed
          around the mountain. Thus, it would be difficult for the Ji Family to

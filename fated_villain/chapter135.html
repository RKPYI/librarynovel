      <h4>
        Chapter 135: Masters were Correct; All Good-Looking Men are Tigers!
      </h4>
      <p><b>[Boom!]</b></p>
      <p>
        With her Cultivation Base sealed by Gu Changge, the Seventh Princess was
        thrown in front of Gu Xian’er with disheveled hair, a ghost-like face,
        and a blood-covered figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene frightened all those in the surroundings, and everyone fell
        silent.
      </p>
      <p><b>“The Seventh Princess lost…”</b></p>
      <p>
        All the Sea Creatures trembled and showed faces full of terror — right
        now, they felt as if the sky had fallen on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        They couldn’t believe the truth in front of them, as it terrified them
        to even think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess, an invincible figure with a terrifying and rare
        talent among the Sea Creatures whom none could rival suffered such a
        gruesome defeat as soon as she made a debut in the outside world!
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the first major event in her life, and now, there was a chance
        that she might fall right here right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, many Young Supremes had died in Gu Changge’s hands, so there
        was no way he would let the Seventh Princess go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone knew that Gu Changge was mighty — it was clear from his
        previous track record — but no one expected him to be so despairingly
        strong.
      </p>
      <p>They couldn’t help but panic right now.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Master is a Reincarnation of a True Immortal, and he’s destined to
          stand at the pinnacle of the world and look down on the billions and
          billions of stars of the Upper Realm in the future…how can a mere
          seventh princess of the Sea King Palace be Master’s opponent?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>A Yaksha-like creature said with a cold smile.</p>
      <p>
        As soon as he finished his words, he reached forward and tore the Sea
        Creature in front of him in half and made his blood pour like a fountain
        in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the Sea Creatures in the surroundings turned pale after listening to
        his words, and clenched their teeth as they trembled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their mighty formation also started to dissipate at this moment, and the
        strong smell of blood wafted in every direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a tragic scene, with corpses scattered all over the place — most
        of them belonging to the Sea Creatures — and that made all the onlooking
        cultivators tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn’t doubt the fact that today’s events would cause a massive
        earthquake throughout the world; the earthquake was sure to shake the
        entire Ancient Immortal Continent, and that’s what terrified even the
        Young Supremes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Someone as mighty and indifferent as the Seventh Princess of the Sea
        King Palace chased after Gu Changge’s sister with the intent to murder
        her, but Gu Changge intervened at a critical moment and slaughtered all
        the Sea Creatures to defend his weak sister.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Even the Seventh Princess was defeated, and she was defeated without
        any ability to retaliate.’
      </p>
      <p>
        No one could estimate the heights Gu Changge would reach in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he crushed the Seventh Princess with ease, just with the
        raise of a single palm. From the beginning to the end, no one witnessed
        him use any of his trump cards!
      </p>
      <p>
        This was what shocked all those from the younger generation, as they
        couldn’t estimate Gu Changge’s true strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I am afraid he’s already stepped into the Realm of Young Sovereigns!
          Since ancient times, only the Young Supremes who have surpassed all of
          their peers and stand unmatched…can be called Young Sovereigns.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Young Sovereign! What an awe-inspiring title!”</b></p>
      <p>
        One of the cultivators couldn’t help but say with a trembling voice;
        right now, he was in awe of Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young Sovereigns had to prove themselves through combat, and in the
        future, they could move unhindered throughout the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Supreme Heritages of the Upper Realm would rarely give birth to such
        a mighty figure — it could take anywhere from a few hundred thousand
        years to a few million years to see such an existence come to being.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no doubt that Gu Changge’s appearance and strength terrified
        all the cultivators in the surroundings, and they couldn’t help but
        reach the same conclusion: ‘Young Sovereign!’
      </p>
      <p>
        One couldn’t just become a Sovereign by having a good talent, they also
        needed to show proof of tyrannical, unmatched strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more? Young Sovereigns could easily cross more than two Realms
        without issue when in battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of Young Sovereigns, Young Supremes were nothing more than ants
        that could be crushed to death with a single stomp!
      </p>
      <p>
        Didn’t the terrifying might Gu Changge display in the battle just now
        show that he was already a Young Sovereign?
      </p>
      <p>
        All the cultivators felt their scalps go numb, and even their mouths
        dried up and they couldn’t bring themselves to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Young Sovereign! I haven’t heard those words in countless years, and
          now, the Young Master of the Ancient Immortal Gu Family has reached
          that Realm…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cultivators spoke with trembling voices, caused by awe and fear.

      <p>
        What kind of shock would go through the world once this news spread?
      </p>
      <p>They already knew the answer to that.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge would sit above their heads like a terrifying, unshakeable
        mountain if no other Young Supreme stepped into the Realm of Young
        Sovereign soon.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, are you really going to hand her over to me?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er, who still had a face full of shock, couldn’t help but ask Gu
        Changge with a hint of disbelief lacing her tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess, whose Cultivation Base was sealed, was thrown in
        front of her like a piece of rag by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without her Cultivation Base to back her up, she was like a poisonous
        snake that had its fangs pulled out! No matter how vicious it might be,
        it held no lethality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er couldn’t help but blink her beautiful eyes as she thought
        about the matter, and the suspicions in her heart grew stronger.
      </p>
      <p>There were too many oddities.</p>
      <p>
        Although she claimed that Gu Changge would come to save her, but…Gu
        Changge was definitely scheming something!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Xian’er, is this the attitude you should have towards your
          savior?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge looked at her and asked with a faint smile.</p>
      <p>
        Her delicate, flawless little face that made her resemble a porcelain
        doll was still somewhat pale, with blood trickling down the corner of
        her mouth…she looked somewhat embarrassed and lovely.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, do you think I will thank you? Don’t even think about
          that happening! I would have survived even if you didn’t intervene,
          humph!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s face showed her cold and arrogant expression once more,
        appearing as if she was asking for another spanking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her heart, however, bubbled with joy, and all the feelings of loss and
        sadness vanished in the blink of an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, she wouldn’t show any of that in front of Gu Changge — even
        if it meant saying a simple thank you — as she refused to admit defeat.
      </p>
      <p>After all, who asked Gu Changge to be her greatest foe?</p>
      <p>What’s more? She was stating the truth!</p>
      <p>Even if Gu Changge didn’t intervene, she could have escaped safely.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“That’s not good! Gu Xian’er, you wouldn’t have forgotten the lesson
          I taught you that day, right?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge restrained his smile and casually looked at her. At the same
        time, his desire to throw her down an abyss and suppress her there for
        half a decade or so intensified.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was alright when he didn’t mention that, but now that he did, Gu
        Xian’er’s heart burst with shame and rage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she, Yue Mingkong, and Gu Changge were the only ones present on
        the scene that day, Gu Changge was the only one who had dared to spank
        her like that since the moment she was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Don’t be complacent! I will smash your face into the ground one day,
          so you can understand what it feels like…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A hint of visible anger could be seen on Gu Xian’er’s face as she
        muttered to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        She no longer held the hatred she held for Gu Changge when she left the
        Peach Village, and the complicated feelings budding in her heart worried
        her.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian’er couldn’t understand the emotions rising in her heart.</p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, her Masters were correct! All good-looking men were tigers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Xian’er, you are itching for another spanking, right? You, with
          your ability, want to smash my face into the ground?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Xian’er uttered her words in a low voice, she couldn’t
        prevent Gu Changge from hearing her.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Dao of Mockery had always been a cut above the rest, and even the
        Great Elder of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace couldn’t contain his
        anger at his words, so how could a little girl like her not jump with
        rage when he specially targeted her?
      </p>
      <p>
        Right after that, Gu Changge changed his tone to an indifferent and
        merciless one, and said,
        <b
          >“If you want revenge, then prove to me that you are good enough!
          Don’t make me look down on you anymore. Otherwise, you will be the
          same as before, a little kitten following behind me all the time — you
          will have no chance at revenge…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s expression froze as she heard his words, and she recalled
        how she used to cling to Gu Changge back when she was a child.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back then, Gu Changge was always indifferent to her and never bothered
        with her, and that hurt her a lot, but she kept up with her clinging.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian’er fell silent as she thought about the past.</p>
      <p>
        If she heard those words from him before leaving the Peach Village, then
        she would be enraged and want to murder him even more, but now, she
        didn’t hold much hatred towards him.
      </p>
      <p>Instead, she was incredibly calm right now.</p>
      <p>
        She could tell that Gu Changge was hiding some secrets regarding their
        past, judging from all of his recent actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back then, everyone in the Ancient Immortal Gu Family loved her, but Gu
        Changge was the only one who treated her with indifference and alienated
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Gu Xian’er thought about it, she felt that there was something
        strange about the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did Gu Changge really have a reason for doing what he did? Surely, he
        couldn’t have dug out her Dao Bones with such ruthlessness just to
        satisfy his ‘cravings,’ right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did he do it? Why did he not kill her directly, and left her with a
        chance to survive?
      </p>
      <p>
        Even now, he was intentionally mocking her to increase her rage and
        hatred towards him.
      </p>
      <p>Why was that?</p>
      <p>One had to accept the fact that Gu Xian’er had an amazing brain!</p>
      <p>She analyzed every detail and possibility one after another.</p>
      <p>
        When they were at the Supreme Peak of the Heavenly Immortal Dao Palace,
        Gu Changge almost lost his life under her blade! Since he’s so powerful,
        it wouldn’t have been hard for her to dodge her attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge treated her with indifference and alienated her,
        as if he was looking at a stranger when he looked at her.
      </p>
      <p>But…why did he show up to save her when she was in danger?</p>
      <p>Was this not contradictory to his actions?</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, don’t think you can hide it from me for the rest of your
          life! I will investigate what happened back then…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“After that, I will take revenge in a dignified manner and defeat you
          fair and square!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er stared at Gu Changge without blinking. By now, she was sure
        that he was hiding something from her.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Xian’er, you think too much.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge gave her a perfunctory response after listening to her words.
      </p>
      <p>His response, however, increased Gu Xian’er’s belief in her guess.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge showed a natural expression on the outside, but on the
        inside, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could already guess Gu Xian’er’s thoughts, after all, everything was
        going according to his plans and expectations.
      </p>
      <p>Right then, a System Prompt dinged in his mind.</p>
      <p>
        [Ding! Gu Xian’er, the Favored Daughter of Heaven, has shown a shift in
        her attitude towards you! You earned 1000 points of Fortune Value and
        5000 Destiny Points.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s showed a smile full of intrigue as he listened to the
        prompt.
      </p>
      <p>A bloke-head was a bloke-head, indeed.</p>
      <p>Just a little trick, and she was dazed and disoriented.</p>
      <p>
        He really couldn’t comprehend how her Masters could rest assured that
        she would be able to avenge herself after leaving their side?
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, what should we do with her?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er then looked at the disheveled Seventh Princess in front of
        her and asked Gu Changge for his advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        She thought that she had ‘figured out the truth,’ so her attitude
        towards Gu Changge changed a lot.
      </p>
      <p>She no longer showed hostility towards him when talking to him.</p>
      <p><b>“What did you call me?”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge glanced at her after he heard her words.</p>
      <p>
        Sure, he gave a lot of face to Gu Xian’er on normal days, but he also
        had a bottom-line. Right now, it was time to let her understand the
        hierarchy between the old and the young.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Gu Changge tut-tutted in his heart over the fact that
        even though Gu Xian’er was getting chased and almost died, her Fortune
        Value didn’t stop rising.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could it be that this arrogant lass had the talent to climb through
        Realms during arduous moments?
      </p>
      <p>
        It was possible that his sudden appearance interrupted Gu Xian’er’s
        opportunity to break through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, Gu Changge had Gu Xian’er’s ‘best interests in mind’, and
        understood that it would be better for him to let her grow by herself —
        she needed to be tempered.
      </p>
      <p>Bullying her like this was interesting, too, every now and then.</p>
      <p>
        She was clearly enraged, but in front of him, she could only stand
        helplessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge considered whether he should artificially arrange some
        ‘opportunities’ for her in the future?
      </p>
      <p>
        Like putting the blame on her head? That could help her make some
        enemies and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, if she really couldn’t survive, then wouldn’t he have
        another opportunity to be a hero saving the damsel in distress?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, dream on! There’s no way I am going to call you Big
          Brother.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er showed an indifferent expression when she heard his words,
        and showed an expression that said: ‘I have your deepest secrets in my
        grasp.’
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, however, she felt a chill go down her spine and
        wondered if someone was scheming to murder her or something?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn’t care about her response and said with a playful smirk,
        <b
          >“To kill or not to kill, that’s up to you. Since I gave her to you
          already, I don’t care about what you do with her.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        His words were simple, but he had considered a lot before deciding on
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin with, the Seventh Princess was clearly a monster that gave
        experience points specially prepared for Gu Xian’er, so even if she
        couldn’t get the experience right now, she would end up claiming it some
        time in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        In simpler terms, Gu Xian’er would need to face a similar situation in
        the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for why he threw the decision back at her? It was because he wanted
        the Sea King Palace to go after her.
      </p>
      <p>The Masters behind her won’t sit idle if that happens.</p>
      <p>
        After all, who told this little lass to pull that trick from before and
        divert all the hatred towards him?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was already treating her with magnanimity by not teaching her
        a lesson outright.
      </p>
      <p>Was there any reason for Gu Xian’er to direct hatred towards him?</p>
      <p><b>“Humph! I knew you weren’t here to save me out of kindness.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er understood the meaning behind Gu Changge’s words. The Sea
        King Palace was a Supreme Heritage that controlled countless Sea
        Families, so there was no way Gu Changge would want to take the blame
        for killing their Seventh Princess.
      </p>
      <p>He had already done his best for her.</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, when the time comes for the Sea King Palace’s revenge, the
        one they will target will be her.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge had a heart as poisonous as before.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Your brother, I, came to rescue you from afar, yet this is how you
          treat me? Gu Xian’er, I feel chills going down my spine because of
          your ungrateful behavior!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge couldn’t help but tease her. At the same time, he showed a
        smug expression that made it clear that he was proud of his actions and
        didn’t care about what she thought.
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes, he was very silly, and other times, he was demonic.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Seventh Princess, don’t you think now that I was right when I said
          all of you will die if you dare to touch me?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er looked at the pale, frightened, and desperate Seventh
        Princess in front of her, and asked with a calm smile on her face.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Don’t kill me, I am willing to surrender…”</b></p>
      <p>
        The Seventh Princess begged for mercy with unwillingness and
        desperation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, all of her arrogance had disappeared into thin air. She was
        smashed down by Gu Changge and her Dao Heart had also collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she still held a final life-saving treasure, her sealed
        Cultivation Base made it impossible for her to use it.
      </p>
      <p>She…had reached a dead end.</p>
      <p>
        The lawless Ancient Immortal Continent had opened, and all those from
        the younger generation were fiercely competing for opportunities, so it
        was obvious that the winners would live while the losers would die.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Too late! You should have thought about this when you rushed out to
          murder me.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er showed no change in her expression as a big black sword
        appeared behind her and broke through the air to slash at the Seventh
        Princess without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Puff!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Blood splattered in all directions, and the Seventh Princess of the Sea
        King Palace died just like that!

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princess Xuan Dea didn&#8217;t suspect any underlying insinuation in Gu Changge&#8217;s words. Rather, she innocently thought that he was simply warning them not to anger him. Regardless, that statement erased all the remaining concern in her mind.</span><span id="more-33869"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Young Master Gu. Those of Sword Cliff will not do anything to upset you. The Sword Immortal Order has nothing to do with Sword Cliff,&#8221; the Snow Sword Immortal assured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s great, Master! Young Master Gu is really not evil. If he truly held ill intents against us, he would have attacked us. With his strength, he doesn&#8217;t even need to scheme against us,&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea claimed with a gleeful expression. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what world, one&#8217;s appearance was important. Besides, she was also indebted to Gu Changge since he saved her life. Even she, as the Second Most Graceful Damsel of Southbarren State, could not be ungrateful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, whenever she was playing her zither, Gu Changge would even give her tips for her technique. Although she was shocked, she nevertheless benefited tremendously from it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not expecting that her disciple was now so fond of Gu Changge, the Snow Sword Immortal gently heaved a sigh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, Princess Xuan Dea used to be a prideful woman who wanted nothing to do with ordinary men. She did not have the slightest interest in the rest of the Four Young Paragons as well. Yet, despite only having spent a few days with Gu Changge, she was already making such flattering statements about him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s say Sword Cliff wouldn&#8217;t anger me, but is Sword Cliff the only Force in the entire Profound Sword World?&#8221; Hearing that, Gu Changge softly chuckled. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the stupefied gaze of the crowd, he took a step forward and instantaneously appeared on the city wall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is bad…&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s face grew dire. It was only at that moment that she detected terrifying Sword Qis coming from the sky, and judging by their auras, a great number of powerful experts were appoarching.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, she knew it was the other Earth Sword Immortals who came to capture Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems a horrible war is inevitable…&#8221; With a scowl, the Snow Sword Immortal speedily teleported away and reappeared in the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She firmly stood in the sky as her hair danced in the wind amid crystalline snowflakes. Her surroundings were turned into a Snow Sword Domain, as the air around her froze over. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frightening chilly air wafted and formed a vast snowstorm that covered the sunny sky. Evidently, she wasn&#8217;t honoured as the Snow Sword Immortal without a reason. Her mastery over Ice and Sword Dao alone was unrivalled by anyone in the same Realm as her, and where her gaze was set upon were referred to by the world as the Ice and Snow Domain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s appearance left the entire Ancient Mulberry City dumbfounded. After all, the sudden appearance of an Earth Sword Immortal would definitely stir up a remarkable commotion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, everyone was looking up in daze, unable to comprehend the situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The time has come. We can finally take action.&#8221; Sensing the disturbance, the Elders of numerous Families within Ancient Mulberry City revealed a piercing gaze, as if they noticed something, after which, they immediately sent forth the strongest cultivators in their Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Earth Sword Immortals were planning to attack Gu Changge, they unquestionably had to join in as it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So you&#8217;re that &#8216;Young Master Gu?'&#8221; A sullen voice sounded from afar, as a figure was speedily approaching in the sky, resembling a plummeting meteor. There was not a strand of white hair on his face. Wearing a daoist robe, he held a Seven-Star Dao Sword as his entire body emitted a daunting aura.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a question, he was a being in the Earth Sword Immortal Realm. His aura was as enormous as a Divine Mountain, intimidating everyone in Ancient Mulberry City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Gu Changge stood above the city wall of Ancient Mulberry City as Ah Da stood behind him. Resembling a towering metal pavilion, Ah Da possessed a terrorising aura of a demon, trembling the hearts of all within Ancient Mulberry City, suffocating them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is all the mightiest experts of this world can do?&#8221; Without much change on his face, Gu Changge let out a scoff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous! The Otherworldly Sky Demons are all enemies of this world. You&#8217;d be wise to submit yourself. Any resistance will only be futile.&#8221; The figure landed outside Ancient Mulberry City. His eyes glistened like stars, emitting a light in the form of swords that could shatter the void.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221; Hearing that, everyone in Ancient Mulberry City was stunned, widening their eyes in stupefaction and wondering if they misheard the figure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Otherworldly Sky Demon? The young man who returned with Lady Ah Qing is an Otherworldly Sky Demon?] Immense fear surged on the faces of the residents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ah Qing, Princess Xuan Dea, and the rest in City Lord Manor were frightened, feeling that things were about to grow out of control. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Earth Sword Immortal was obviously trying to expose Gu Changge&#8217;s identity to provoke him. As such, he would be able to thoroughly push Gu Changge into becoming the enemy of the Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, in their eyes, the Earth Sword Immortals were extremely foolish. Although Gu Changge had never displayed his true strength, given that he dared to come to Profound Sword World openly and alone, he must not be worried about such a matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who do you think you are to talk to me in that manner?&#8221; Above the city wall, Gu Changge subtly tensed his brows, pretending to be surprised.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Such boldness! This old one shall see how capable you are in this world of ours!&#8221; The elder in daoist robe coldly exclaimed as murderous intent flashed across the depths of his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As his grandson was murdered by Otherworldly Sky Demons, he now abhorred every single Otherworldly Sky Demons with every cell in his body. He couldn&#8217;t wait to slaughter every single one of those invaders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the old Sword Immortal from the Shu Sect used the Sword Immortal Order to gather all Sword Immortals to capture Gu Changge, he was too impatient to wait to kill Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that he was an Earth Sword Immortal, he possessed a degree of understanding about the World Principles of Profound Sword World, hence he also knew that Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t be able to use his full strength in Profound Sword World despite being overpowered in his own world. Moreover, he was not the only Earth Sword Immortal who came to kill Gu Changge. Virtually all the peerless, powerful cultivators of the entire Profound Sword World were rising up to take Gu Changge down. It was as if they had set up a flawless trap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Star Sword Immortal, please do not misunderstand. Young Master Gu bears no ill will towards the Profound Sword World. What you&#8217;re doing will only bring forth disaster.&#8221; Step by step, the Snow Sword Immortal approached, her gaze underneath her mask icily staring at the elder in daoist robe. Although her clear voice was not loud, it harboured an alarming determination that engulfed the entire Ancient Mulberry City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who were already haunted by fear now grew even more confused, unable to fathom why the Snow Sword Immortal, someone so prominent in Profound Sword World and was even beyond the elder she was facing, was now deliberately defending the Otherworldly Sky Demon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Snow Sword Immortal, do you intend to protect this man and oppose us?&#8221; The Star Sword Immortal&#8217;s glare was stone cold. He never expected that the Snow Sword Immortal would stand up to him, which was totally out of his expectation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to save you!&#8221; the Snow Sword Immortal stated. The Ice and Snow Domain spread under her feet and formed a vast snowstorm that stormed forward, freezing and shattering the void which then revealed a grey crack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;d never expect a day where you would defend an Otherworldly Sky Demons. He must be controlling your mind!&#8221; The Star Sword Immortal coldly replied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in the City Lord Manor, Lin En, who donned the guise of a steward, furrowed his brows. Upon mysterious steps, he instantaneously vanished and reappeared in another region without revealing his true self.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is Senior Snow siding with Young Master Gu?&#8221; Lin En was puzzled. He had assumed that the Snow Sword Immortal was here under the command of the Sword Immortal Order.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* At that moment, with a glacial expression, the Elder in daoist robe began to make his move. Raising his big hand and displaying his masterful sword skills. Immediately, twelve Star Divine Swords flew over, and each of them was horrifying, carrying the spine-chilling shrieks of godly demons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Sword One World. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The twelve swords form an array. The Twelve Star Divine Array emitted an ever so terrorising Sword Dao, with each sword created a world, wherein all earth, fire, wind, and water swirled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the might of an Earth Sword Immortal. Every cultivator in Ancient Mulberry City was uncontrollably shaking under the menacing aura, having a hard time resisting their urge to get on their knees and kneel towards the direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Star Sword Immortal cultivated using the stars in the Outer Territory six hundred years ago. After taking the last step, he has now finally attained the level of perfection. His Twelve Star Divine Array contains the might of godly demons and could destroy all his enemies!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old City Lord&#8217;s face was stern. Although he was no weakling, he was no different from an ant if he were to face someone of the Earth Sword Immortal Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing and Princess Xuan Dea, too, tensed their brows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re seriously going to attack even with all that I’ve said?&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal revealed a sullen expression. Ice and snow were speedily amassing, forming an ice shield that charged forward to defend against the sword array.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, it was plain that the Star Sword Immortal came prepared. As he cast his ability, a star-like glow twinkled in his sleeves and flew toward the void around him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha! This old one can&#8217;t wait to see what you have to offer!&#8221; The Star Sword Immortal coldly chortled with dense aggression in his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, an aura that left all the people of Ancient Mulberry City shocked. Beams of light surrounded them and shot up into the sky, as if there was a divine furnace that burned for an eternity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What a menacing move! Does he plan to burn us alive?!&#8221; The old City Lord was dazed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the surrounding air, ancient altars appeared. There were mysterious divine patterns that resembled starlight engraved on them, emitting traces of terrifying lights which intertwined into one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Star-Sealing Sacrificial Ritual!&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal was visibly nervous. What she was facing was a frightening array seal, and those trapped within it would be sacrificed alive without resisting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She never expected that the Star Sword Immortal would resort to such an ability. [How ruthless! He&#8217;s not even considering the people of Ancient Mulberry City!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, everyone in Ancient Mulberry City was overwhelmed by dread as the flesh on their bodies was burning. Even their souls and Qi were uncontrollably waning. Some of the residents even exploded, disintegrated by the overbearing energy of the sacrificial ritual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahh…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the next moment, an agonised scream suddenly thundered as thick blood scattered in the air. An aura that left everyone trembling and their muscles tearing was intertwining in the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A frightening punch, as if it had traversed through eternity, carrying pitch black demonic energy, shredded the Twelve Star Divine Array and Star Divine Sword in front, before exploding on the Star Sword Immortal&#8217;s body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Impossible…&#8221; The Star Sword Immortal&#8217;s eyes were filled with shock and disbelief. Before he realised, he noticed a gigantic phantom of a demon that resembled a metal building appearing before him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As his foe landed a punch, everything before his eyes crumbled into pieces and blew up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a mind-blowing, fear-striking sight. The Star Sword Immortal, who appeared to be so formidable earlier, was instantly turned into blood mist, with his bone turning into dust that wafted in the air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an Earth Sword Immortal, a being who stood at the peak of Profound Sword World!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He must not be of the Ninth Realm. His physical strength alone far exceeds the power of Earth Sword Immortals…&#8221; The old City Lord and the rest peered at Ah Da in absolute stupefaction as they never expected that the wordless subordinate of Gu Changge would possess such traumatising strength.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Solely using his physical strength, he killed an Earth Sword Immortal with a single punch!?]</span></p>

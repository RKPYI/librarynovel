        Chapter 170: You Need to Remember only One Thing; I Am Your Master!
      </h4>
      <p><b>[The mountains outside the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan]</b></p>
      <p>In this moment of crisis for the Ancient Immortal Races…</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s figure swept across the large mountain of sacred buildings
        in front of him, a faint smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Time for yet another bountiful harvest. When I planted this seed, I
          had expected it to bear fruit, but for it to grow into such a lush
          forest…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Hei Ming truly didn’t disappoint.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge spoke casually but with great interest. The void blurred as
        he stepped forward once more, approaching the mountains ahead.
      </p>
      <p>‘It's like walking in your own backyard.’</p>
      <p>He did not hide his aura, nor did he bring any followers.</p>
      <p>
        Naturally, his presence was noticed the instant he stepped foot outside
        the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Who goes there?”</b></p>
      <p>A powerful divine sense swept the area.</p>
      <p>
        The aura of several powerful beings appeared from between the peaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a pair of black wings behind him, a being of the True God Realm
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guards looked at the approaching Gu Changge with shock as they
        asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Inform the Chief Elder of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan, Gu Changge
          has come for a visit.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at them, standing with his hands behind his back, as
        he spoke with a faint smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moment they heard his name, the two guards’ former face of
        indifference took a drastic change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s name had echoed throughout the Ancient Immortal Continent,
        and whether they were from the older generation or the younger
        generation, there was hardly anyone who didn’t know him.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to various rumors, Gu Changge was a vicious villain who aimed
        to slaughter the Ancient Immortal Races.
      </p>
      <p>
        He’d manipulated the Tiangou clansmen, and his purpose? To guide the
        Daoist Sects of the outside world to dominate the Ancient Immortal
        Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's name could even silence the crying children of the Ancient
        Immortal Races.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, these two guards from the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan knew of
        how terrifying Gu Changge was, their eyes reflecting this sudden
        situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        They both felt a touch of fear, as the one who dared ask had his voice
        tremble.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, what… what is your business here?”</b></p>
      <p>When he asked, both his lips and soul trembled.</p>
      <p>
        A mere existence in the True God Realm would obviously be unable to get
        any advantage against Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the rumors, Gu Changge was supposed to be seriously
        injured.
      </p>
      <p>His current aura, however, did not show it. He was clearly well.</p>
      <p>‘His body looks to be in perfect condition, where is this injury?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Are the rumors wrong? Or could this person not be him? A fake Gu
        Changge?’
      </p>
      <p>
        When the two considered this possibility, they suppressed their fears
        and shot at Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        The aura of the being in the True God Realm fluctuated, dashing over in
        an instant, causing the mountains in a radius of hundreds of miles to
        rumble and tremble.
      </p>
      <p><b>“I'm just here to take my things.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said with a smile, his figure blurred as he waltzed straight
        through the attack,
        <b
          >“If you don’t want to deliver the report, then I suppose I’ll have to
          do it myself.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Although I can’t help but wonder, why is it that people like you
          don’t value your own lives?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>As he walked by, a strange flicker, a wave in the void appeared.</p>
      <p>
        The two Black Heavenly Eagle clansmen in the True God Realm then
        immediately collapsed with a puff, instantly wiped in both body and
        spirit.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge made no secret of his arrival.</p>
      <p>
        An incomparably powerful figure, casually strolling through the void as
        he walked all the way to the depths of the Black Sky Eagle Clan…
      </p>
      <p>
        In his mind, a cobweb-like picture begins to form, each line running
        through and connecting everything, giving special attention to the Black
        Heavenly Eagle clansmen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their thoughts, their actions, they were all clear as day, brimming with
        insight.
      </p>
      <p>For a moment, there was none who could hide themselves from him.</p>
      <p>With a single thought, he could decide their life and death.</p>
      <p>
        And it was all thanks to the Immortal Binding Arts, and Hei Ming’s hard
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was able to control the life and death of the entire Black
        Heavenly Eagle Clan without the slightest bit of effort, and Hei Ming
        was an excellent collaborator.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Not good!”</b></p>
      <p><b>“Someone trespassed into the Clan’s territory!”</b></p>
      <p><b>“Follow me, everyone!”</b></p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the entire Black Heavenly Eagle Clan was shocked,
        surprised by the fluctuations they had felt from the mountain gate[1].
      </p>
      <p>
        [1. It is the entrance. Same as the one in the Heavenly Dao Immortal
        Palace.]
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        One after another, the Black Heavenly Eagle clansmen who had felt this
        disturbance, turned into divine rainbows, rushing across the sky,
        heading towards Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were furious. It was the first time in a great many years that they
        had trespassers in their territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This old man also wishes to see just who would be so bold to come
          here…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        From within one of the palaces, several old men in the midst of
        negotiations flickered with a black light, their expressions cold and
        angry.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hum!</b></p>
      <p>
        The next moment, their figures moved in unison, vanishing from the
        palace and reappearing in the sky outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘What is going on? Who dares to trespass on our clan’s territory? Such a
        suicidal act is nothing more than courting death!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Atop a mountain where cloud and mist converged, a girl in white wondered
        to herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        With her slender neck and jade skin, it was none other than Hei Yanyu.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Could it be that the Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation came to
        the door? If my guess is correct, then the heir is the one named Ye
        Ling, the same one accused of being the Inheritor of the Demonic Arts…’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If it's really Ye Ling, then I need to pay close attention. He must be
        no ordinary man to have escaped Gu Changge’s clutches.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Her heart froze at the thought, she then turned into a divine rainbow
        and rushed to the sky, hoping to get a glimpse of who it was.
      </p>
      <p><b>[At the same time, on another cloud-shrouded mountain peak]</b></p>
      <p>
        Hei Ming, who had moved out of the previous courtyard and now lived in
        the palace, was in the midst of cultivating when he suddenly opened his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, he felt something strange in his heart. This vague
        feeling… was similar to when he’d faced the Supreme Being!
      </p>
      <p><b>“What happened? Could the Supreme Being be close?”</b></p>
      <p><b>“I’m sure of it…”</b></p>
      <p>Hei Ming was surprised, but he was ecstatic, excited even.</p>
      <p>He was almost certain it was the Supreme Being.</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to him, he’d obtained the Immortal Binding Technique, an
        earth-shattering ability that allowed him to be reborn.
      </p>
      <p>‘If I can get more…’</p>
      <p>People are greedy, their desires inexhaustible.</p>
      <p>
        In the past, Hei Ming only wanted to be respected by his clan, but now
        he wanted more.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the thought of this, he got up and left, aiming to see what the fuss
        was all about.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, how…”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Why are you here? You’re supposed to be seriously injured and in the
          midst of recovery!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The many people of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan were shocked, eyes wide
        in surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clansmen had already seen Gu Changge
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though they’d given up, those who had planned to surround and kill Gu
        Changge under Hei Yanyu, were especially familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, they were astonished, as they stared at the young man
        ahead of them.
      </p>
      <p>If this wasn’t Gu Changge, then who was it?</p>
      <p>
        Though there was none who could block his path, they had never expected
        for Gu Changge to come to their clan alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Was his injury already healed, what is the purpose of his ‘visit’?’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I'm here for my belongings. The people in charge should come out and
          talk; I don’t like wasting time.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Having heard their questions, Gu Changge smiled a bit. Despite being
        facing the threat of being attacked by such a large group of people, he
        didn't care at all.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Your belongings? What?”</b></p>
      <p><b>“Is that why you trespassed on our clan’s territory?”</b></p>
      <p>
        The people’s faces sank when they heard this. They asked with ferocity,
        practically threatening to strike out at Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Changge was a very strong figure, that statement is made
        relative to his peers. And right now, he was in their territory!
      </p>
      <p>No one would stand for such arrogance.</p>
      <p>
        The Black Heavenly Eagle Clan has existed since the Immortal Period.
        They had many beings in the Sacred Realm, and their ancestors were in
        the Quasi-Supreme Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        With such a terrifying background, how could a young man dare to break
        in all alone?
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Does he have some sort of trick prepared? Or is he simply not afraid of
        death?’
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, a terrifying aura descended, an old man with a hunched
        body in the Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stared at Gu Changge in front of him, waving his hand, and saying.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Stop, all of you!”</b></p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, what is your purpose?”</b></p>
      <p>He was a very powerful Elder of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan.</p>
      <p>
        His appearance alone made the many clansmen breathe a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        In secret, these clansmen were quite wary of Gu Changge. Many Young
        Supremes of the Tiangou Clan were eliminated by Gu Changge even when
        their leader, Yu Jing, used a Sacred-grade Artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        It only went to show that Gu Changge had the means to contend with even
        those in the Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point in time, they were unsure of whether they could
        successfully suppress Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I’ve already said that I’ve come to get my belongings back. Can’t
          you understand something so simple?”</b
        >
        Gu Changge casually spoke in the same manner he always did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with a being of the Sacred Realm in front of him, he wasn’t
        concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, he was waiting for the Ancestors in the Quasi-Supreme Realm of the
        Black Heavenly Eagle Clan to appear.
      </p>
      <p>They’re the only ones qualified to negotiate.</p>
      <p>
        Though these beings were in the Sacred Realm, his current true
        Cultivation Base that lay at the peak of the God King Realm was more
        than enough to deal with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Your belongings? What belongings?”</b> The elder stared at Gu
        Changge and asked with a frown.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't dare move so readily against Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        With how unclear the situation was in the Ancient Immortal Continent,
        all the clans were now in grave danger, for the outside world appeared
        to have taken an interest in direct intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he were to make a move against Gu Changge, he must be ready to bear
        the wrath of those backing him.
      </p>
      <p>The price of such an act would be too much.</p>
      <p>
        The Black Heavenly Eagle Clan was an ancient clan with deep roots.
        However, when faced with the wrath of an Ancient Immortal Family, they
        would have to be cautious or risk being wiped out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“My belongings? It would naturally be the Reincarnation Platform</b
        >[2]<b>, and the entire Black Heavenly Eagle Clan.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>[2. Different from the Enlightenment Platform that Gu Changge has.]</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge replied, laughing as though he didn’t understand the gravity
        of his words.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Reincarnation Platform was forged using the Reincarnation Stone left
        by the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation. It carried both great power and
        great insight on the power of Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge intended to refine the Reincarnation Platform, merging it
        with his Primordial Spirit to transform his Innate God’s Spirit Temple
        to Immortal Wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was bound to get the Reincarnation Platform, but as for the clan…
      </p>
      <p><b>“What?!”</b></p>
      <p>
        The moment they heard his words, everyone was shocked, including the
        Sacred Realm clan elder, whose complexion suddenly darkened.
      </p>
      <p>
        How did Gu Changge know about the existence of the Reincarnation
        Platform?
      </p>
      <p>
        What did he mean by saying that the entirety of the Black Heavenly Eagle
        Clan now belonged to him?
      </p>
      <p>
        It was at that moment that the rest of the Black Heavenly Clan’s people
        descended from the rest of the mountain peaks to come here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people heard Gu Changge's words, their expressions taking a drastic
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Reincarnation Platform was controlled by each of the various clans,
        taking turns in a cyclical manner. This year, it was the Black Heavenly
        Eagle Clan's turn to use it, but that did not mean they owned it.
      </p>
      <p>In their opinion, Gu Changge's words were practically extortionate.</p>
      <p>Everyone angrily stared at him.</p>
      <p>
        If it weren’t for the clan elders holding them back, they would be
        unable to help themselves, they would’ve charged in and reminded Gu
        Changge whose territory he was in.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“How could Gu Changge be here? That’s impossible, his injury couldn’t
          possibly have recovered so quickly…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Hei Yanyu was naturally among the people who came.</p>
      <p>
        The moment she saw Gu Changge, she paled, unable to believe what she’d
        witnessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she felt a slight chill, her back covered in cold sweat.
      </p>
      <p>She knew how serious Gu Changge's injuries supposedly were.</p>
      <p>So how could he have healed them so quickly?</p>
      <p>‘His injuries… they must have been fake.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘If so, then he must’ve wished to start a war between the Ancient
        Immortal Races and the outside world.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Can't you feel it yet? The life and death of your clan is in my
          hands.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“All it takes is a single thought for your deaths to be set in
          stone.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“So remember your manners. Although I've always been kind, it doesn't
          mean… you have the right to talk to me.”</b

      <p><b>“Tell your ancestors in the Quasi-Supreme Realm to get out.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled lightly, turning a blind eye to the angry, icy glares
        of hatred that the people of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan had.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hum!</b></p>
      <p>
        As his words fell, heaven and the earth trembled, and the people felt a
        terrifying sensation in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, it was like their very hearts were grasped by an
        invisible pair of hands.
      </p>
      <p><b>“What is this?!”</b></p>
      <p>From hatred to fear, they paled as their voices trembled.</p>
      <p>
        There were some who couldn’t bear this strange feeling, as they
        struggled to breathe, falling from the sky.
      </p>
      <p><b>Puff!</b></p>
      <p>Those who fell were reduced to a puddle of blood!</p>
      <p>
        In an instant, everyone became terrified as they looked at Gu Changge
        like he was some sort of monstrous existence.
      </p>
      <p>‘What was that feeling we had just now?’</p>
      <p>
        Their lives were instantly put at the hands of someone else, their lives
        could be harvested at any moment!
      </p>
      <p><b>“You…”</b></p>
      <p>
        The elder’s face paled, even he felt it… the sensation of having his
        life and death be in the hands of someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“What is this? The slave seal? No, the slave seal has clearly not
          manifested itself!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        His face turned white as paper and his eyes showed his despair. He
        couldn’t believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        He tried to use his own might to get rid of that sensation just now, but
        it was meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a muddy cow falling into the sea, there would be no sound, hardly
        able to create even a ripple in the water.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge's methods obviously exceeded his understanding.</p>
      <p>This matter was no longer within the realm of ghosts and deities…</p>
      <p>The sign of a True Immortal? No, he was the devil himself!</p>
      <p><b>“This feeling…”</b></p>
      <p>On the other side, Hei Yanyu’s face also paled.</p>
      <p>
        Her pupils shrunk to the size of a needle’s point, revealing an
        indescribable look of fear.
      </p>
      <p>No one was spared, not even her.</p>
      <p>For Gu Changge, they were all the same.</p>
      <p>
        Whether they were in the False God Realm or the Sacred Realm, there was
        no difference, for all it took was a single thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of the Immortal Binding Technique, their lives were a string,
        easily cut.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“A means more terrifying than slave marks, but when was it
          planted…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Hei Yanyu’s delicate face was as pale as snow.</p>
      <p>
        She has always been smart, known for being the general among her peers.
      </p>
      <p>She was finally beginning to process things.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Back then, when I saw Gu Changge for the first time outside the ruins,
        I had this strange feeling.’
      </p>
      <p>‘At first, I thought I was just imagining things.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘But now that I think about it, he must’ve sensed my presence. The idea
        of killing me must’ve come to him, and…’
      </p>
      <p>At the time, the idea merely passed by, so she disregarded it.</p>
      <p>Now, however, Hei Yanyu felt cold all over.</p>
      <p>
        Her attitude towards Gu Changge had completely changed, he is a monster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite all of her precautions, it seems she had still far
        underestimated just how terrifying Gu Changge truly is.
      </p>
      <p>‘How did he do all this?’</p>
      <p><b>“This is obviously not a slave mark, so how…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Throughout this period, the attitude of the Sacred Realm clan elder had
        undergone an earth-shaking change.
      </p>
      <p>He was frightened, cautious.</p>
      <p>
        After all, with his life and death at Gu Changge’s fingertips, how could
        he afford to act so arrogantly?
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, he could only pray that the ancestors would arrive and
        solve this problem.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, it will all be as Gu Changge said.</p>
      <p>The entire Black Heavenly Eagle Clan belongs to him!</p>
      <p>With a single thought, he commanded the life and death of the clan.</p>
      <p>
        ‘And I still can’t figure it out… how could Gu Changge have done all
        this? We had never even had any contact with him before.’
      </p>
      <p>
        These thoughts echoed throughout the clan, plunging them into
        desperation!
      </p>
      <p>
        He was hit, and he couldn’t even explain how. ‘How could there be such a
        strange thing in this world?’
      </p>
      <p><b>“Does it matter?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Hearing is words, Gu Changge casually replied,
        <b
          >“From here onwards, you need only remember one thing: I am your
          master.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“Follow me and live, or no need to live at all.”</b></p>
      <p>
        When the words were spoken, everyone paled even more and fell silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        No wonder Gu Changge dared to break in alone. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on
        no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
      </p>
      <p>
        With such means, to enter the territory of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan
        was as easy as entering and leaving one’s own backyard.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This method must be directly tied to the slave seal. Other than its
        descendants, there are none who know of the connection between the
        Ancient Deity of Reincarnation and the Reincarnation Platform…”
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Either Ye Ling, the true heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation was
        killed and robbed by Gu Changge… or Gu Changge is the true Inheritor of
        the Forbidden Demonic Arts.’
      </p>
      <p>Hei Yanyu's eyes were fixed on Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>As she thought about this, her whole body and spirit trembled.</p>
      <p>Thanks to her sharp mind, she was able to connect the dots.</p>
      <p>And there was a high possibility she was right!</p>
      <p>No other explanation would work.</p>
      <p>‘But… how could there be such a terrible person in this world?’</p>
      <p>
        She looked at Gu Changge with fear. The more she thought about these
        things, the more her scalp became numb.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Oh? You’re a smart one.”</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge sensed Hei Yanyu's thoughts.</p>
      <p>He was slightly surprised.</p>
      <p>
        To have deduced the truth with just the evidence at hand… she was quite
        remarkable.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, he didn't care.</p>
      <p>Hei Yanyu's life and death were under his complete control.</p>
      <p>
        If she dared expose the truth, all it would take is a single thought for
        her to suffer a quick yet violent death…
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s eyes then slightly narrowed as he looked at the distant
        mountain peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        A terrifying feeling rose from that area, like the rising of the morning
        star[3].
      </p>
      <p>[3. A phrase used to describe the brightest star in the sky.]</p>
      <p>
        The aura spread in all directions, like the revival of a supreme being
        that looked down on the world.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Finally…”</b></p>
      <p>
        This scene gave hope to the Black Heavenly Eagle clansmen gathered here.
      </p>
      <p>Their ancestors had arrived!</p>
      <p>
        The ancestors had an unparalleled cultivation base that lay in the
        Quasi-Supreme Realm, and they have lived for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        If their ancestors came forward, today’s events may yet turn in their
        favor.
      </p>
      <p>But in the next moment came the same feeling from earlier.</p>
      <p>
        And then, the once unparalleled aura seemed to have been blown away by
        the wind, gone in an instant as though someone had laid down the
        flag[4].
      </p>
      <p>[4. Surrendering, giving up hope.]</p>
      <p>
        When they saw these events, the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan was plunged
        into desperation.

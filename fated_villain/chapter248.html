      <h4>Chapter 248: Its really a blessing, You are a good Master</h4>
      <p>
        In their opinion, Gu Xian'er was probably threatened by Gu Changge, so
        she brought him here.
      </p>
      <p>
        But they couldn't understand, where did Gu Changge have the courage to
        do this? Did he look down on these old people?
      </p>
      <p>
        Was it by virtue of his identity as the young master of the Gu family?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, what do you mean? Do you think we can be bullied easily?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "How dare you be so arrogant and take the initiative to come here?
        Xianer, don't be afraid, with your masters here, if Gu Changge dares to
        threaten you, then we will not let him leave this place alive."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Even if it offends the Ancient Immortal Gu Family behind him, we will
        not hesitate!"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, several old men spoke, and their words were very cold,
        staring at Gu Changge, revealing killing intent and coldness.
      </p>
      <p>There was a disagreement, and they planned to suppress Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        One must know that under their pressure, ordinary people would have been
        frightened to the ground, trembling, and unable to stand up.
      </p>
      <p>But Gu Changge didn't.</p>
      <p>
        His expression was still calm as if he couldn't feel it, and he didn't
        speak, just like an outsider.
      </p>
      <p>This scene made the hearts of several old guys sink.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't seem to be simple, and he probably made all
        preparations before coming, so he was not afraid of them at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, you have misunderstood. Things are not like this at all. Can
        you listen to my explanation first?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this scene, although Gu Xian'er had expected it long ago, she was
        still a little dumbfounded, and of course her heart was still very warm.
      </p>
      <p>
        For her sake, her masters did not hesitate to offend the Ancient
        Immortal Gu Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also understood that even if her masters were mysterious and
        powerful, they could not be the opponents of the family behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing Gu Xian'er's words, the brows of the old guys were still tightly
        wrinkled, thinking that there was something wrong with her brain, or did
        she go out and join forces with evil?
      </p>
      <p>Could there be any misunderstanding in this?</p>
      <p>There was a blood feud between her and Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        At the beginning, Gu Changge dug out her Dao bone while she was young,
        and almost killed her. If it wasn't for her fate, it would have become a
        pile of trash now.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the clansmen behind her were also suppressed and exiled,
        etc…
      </p>
      <p>This hatred, how could there be a misunderstanding?</p>
      <p>
        For a while, they all felt that Gu Xian'er must have been coerced and
        deceived.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, the clansmen behind her were controlled by Gu Changge,
        so they took the opportunity to threaten her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Junior, I advise you to be smart and don’t play tricks. In front of us,
        any conspiracy and tricks will not work…"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Village Chief of Peach Village stared at Gu Changge indifferently,
        wanting to see a flaw in his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge was calm and composed from beginning to end, and his
        tone did not fluctuate at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If the seniors feel that there is a problem, they can do it. Why waste
        such words?"
      </p>
      <p>"How dare you! Are you threatening us?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er's third master spoke, his voice was cold, and he was deaf,
        but it didn't mean that he couldn't hear Gu Changge's words.
      </p>
      <p>
        His cultivation base had reached a very advanced level, whether or not
        these organs were needed was the same.
      </p>

          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, can't you say a few words? Have you forgotten what your
        purpose of coming here is?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er also had a headache of Gu Changge's attitude of being
        indifferent to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, she could only speak like this, to let Gu Changge take Yaoyao
        into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        And she also took this opportunity to transmit sound to several masters,
        telling them what happened between her and Gu Changge these days, which
        made their expressions change quickly and became complicated.
      </p>
      <p>"And what else is hidden in it?"</p>
      <p>"It's unbelievable."</p>
      <p>After hearing this, the Village Chief of Peach Village frowned.</p>
      <p>
        There seemed to be nothing wrong with what Gu Xian'er said to them,
        especially after Gu Xian'er's deciphering, they discovered this secret
        from various clues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if they wanted to find it, they didn't know how difficult it
        would be.
      </p>
      <p>All kinds of details made several old guys silent.</p>
      <p>
        After all, judging from Gu Xian'er's words, the credibility of the
        matter had increased hundreds of times. One must know that Gu Changge
        had never confessed to her from beginning to end, and everything was
        based on her own discovery and investigation.
      </p>
      <p>"Natural demonic heart? Which one caused it?"</p>
      <p>
        "So, it's possible. According to the family style of the Ancient
        Immortal Gu Family, it really doesn't seem like he could do such a
        thing."
      </p>
      <p>
        "In those days, there were still such secrets, did we blame others just
        now?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking about this, the faces of the old guys became a little
        embarrassed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this hatred could be resolved in this way, that would not be bad, and
        they didn't want Gu Xian'er to carry a blood feud all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at her now, she was much happier and more relaxed than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great enemy whom she hated deeply was now standing in front of her.
        Not only did she not hate him, but she also wanted to protect him.
      </p>
      <p>This was really a blessing!</p>
      <p>"What are you looking at?"</p>
      <p>
        However, at this moment, everyone suddenly heard a soft and pleasant
        voice, just like the sound of nature, with an ethereal feeling.
      </p>
      <p>"Lord Peach Demon!"</p>
      <p>
        All the Villagers in Peach Village were excited and bowed their heads to
        the Peach Tree at the entrance of the village.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, when the Village Chief and others were not there, the
        Peach Tree at the entrance of the village had always been the guardian
        of their safety, which had never changed from generation to generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this Peach Tree, they revered it from the bottom of their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that over the years, Master Taoyao had rarely spoken, and
        everyone thought it was falling into a deep sleep, but they didn't
        expect her to speak suddenly today.
      </p>
      <p>"Lord Taoyao, you actually took the initiative to speak today…"</p>
      <p>"And you are still talking to this guy."</p>
      <p>The Village Chief and other old guys were also a little surprised.</p>
      <p>
        Although their origins were very large and ancient, they were still not
        comparable to the mysterious Peach Tree in front of them, so they were
        also very respectful.
      </p>
      <p>Except for very few times, Lord Taoyao would not speak.</p>
      <p>
        It's a bit strange that she would take the initiative to talk to Gu
        Changge today.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I didn't see anything, I just felt that the aura on the senior's body
        was a bit similar to Yaoyao."
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>Gu Changge said slowly and withdrew his gaze from the Peach Tree.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was not surprised that it would take the initiative to speak.
      </p>
      <p>Presumably, it had already noticed that Yaoyao was special.</p>
      <p>
        While saying that Yaoyao, who was behind Gu Changge, was also looking at
        the Peach Tree curiously.
      </p>
      <p>
        The uneasiness and worry at the beginning had dissipated, and now there
        was only a natural familiarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if the Peach Tree in front of her was inseparable from her
        relationship, it was more like a blood relative.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There is indeed a deep connection between her and me." Fôll0w current
        novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)
      </p>
      <p>
        "I can sense what she thinks, and she can probably sense what I am."
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Peach Tree, a pleasant voice came again, still calm and gentle,
        without the slightest malice.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Master, I seem to be able to perceive her existence… just like my
        sister…"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Yaoyao also opened her mouth, her little face was filled
        with doubt and confusion, and also meant to be close, she couldn't help
        but want to get close to this Peach Tree.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was silent as if he was lost in thought.</p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that there is really some kind of connection between Sister
        Taoyao and Yaoyao? Isn’t this too coincidental?"
      </p>
      <p>At this time, hearing these words, Gu Xian'er was very surprised.</p>
      <p>
        At first, she said that bringing Yaoyao to Peach Village was just a
        coincidence. The main purpose was to ask the respected masters if there
        was anything they could do about Gu Changge's situation.
      </p>
      <p>But she really didn't expect this to happen.</p>
      <p>"Come over to me."</p>
      <p>From the Peach Tree, the voice sounded again.</p>
      <p>
        Yaoyao hesitated, feeling that the other party might hurt her, but she
        still asked Gu Changge's opinion.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded, his voice very calm and authentic,</p>
      <p>
        "The existence of Yaoyao is not just as simple as an apprentice for the
        junior. I hope the senior will not have any ill intentions towards her…"
      </p>
      <p>"Otherwise, senior will know what regret is."</p>
      <p>
        Of course, he knew that this Peach Tree would definitely not hurt
        Yaoyao, but he still had to put down the harsh words first, after all,
        he could gain goodwill.
      </p>
      <p>"Interesting. You actually threatened me?"</p>
      <p>
        The voice of the Peach Tree seemed to be stunned for a moment, and then
        there was a sneer like a sound of nature, "I can feel what Yaoyao
        thinks, you are a good Master."
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the Peach Tree swayed gently, and the branches and leaves were
        gorgeous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately afterward, a vast white fog suddenly appeared in all
        directions, the sky and the earth fell in a regular manner, and there
        were bursts of sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the old guys in Peach Village couldn't see what happened there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only Gu Changge noticed that after Yaoyao walked over, a figure of
        peerless elegance faintly appeared in the Peach Tree. With a wave of her
        jade hand, the heavenly light descended and merged into Yaoyao's body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other party seemed to be thinking the same thing on purpose to let
        him notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Gu Changge felt that that pair of eyes were as soft and calm
        as spring water as if they could understand the universe.
      </p>
      <p>It was falling from there as if to see through him.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's expression was calm and indifferent, and all kinds of
        thoughts flashed through his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, in the heart, with a humming sound, wisps of innate demonic nature
        emerged.
      </p>
      <p>But there was still nothing unusual about his face.</p>

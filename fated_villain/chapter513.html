          flying over Sky Deer City, directly into the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains. This made many feel hopeless. Even the ancient clans, who had
          already predicted this. tried to migrate to some Lower Realm worlds
          before things further escalated. However, the Upper Realm seemed to
          have predicted this and managed to track them down. All these clans

          one of the battleships, Gu Changge stood with his hands behind his

          were clearly thinner. It was because this place was much more barren
          since it was at the edges of this realm, and had probably experienced
          an unimaginable war which caused the Principles here to have broken
          apart. This was how the place had become so desolate.</span

          slightly surprised him, but it seemed logical after some
          consideration. [They are much smarter than the others, since fleeing
          to the Lower Realm would result in the Upper Realm Army blocking their
          path before they could arrive. They chose to take the opposite
          approach and concealed themselves in the most remote place in the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. If not for Lin Wu, it would have
          taken more time for me to find them.]</span

          She looked cold, proud and unapproachable in her black dress, with
          hair fluttering in the air. Based on her cultivation level, there
          weren&#8217;t many who were stronger than her, yet she had struggled
          to bear the duty of attacking the Family of Protectors.

          already feel the terrifying control he exuded with every movement. It
          seemed like everything in the world was within his control and he
          rarely seemed surprised by anything.</span

          She thought, now more understanding as to why the Sky Deer Goddess
          would choose to yield. Even the Bone Ancestor had to treat the young
          man with great respect.</span

          of survival,&#8221; Gu Changge said, his gaze becoming solemn. All his
          plans and efforts were for a similar reason as the other Forces from
          the Upper Realm. To enable him to step into the Immortality Realm.

          Familyâ€™s camp and sent out the order for his forces in preparation to
          destroy the Four War God Clans. There was no news of the other three

          and told someone to put them under close watch. They couldn&#8217;t
          die before then. Besides, he had already successfully gotten answers
          from Luo Feng regarding the secrets of the split between the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains and the Upper Realm.

          hadn&#8217;t expected Luo Feng to choose to steal the Fortuity of the
          Upper Realm to rejuvenate it. He was a decisive man who had great
          ambition but unfortunately, he didn&#8217;t have enough strength and
          ended up suffering from the war over the Heavenly Dao Authority. This
          resulted in his death and reincarnation. Naturally, he could only
          accomplish all of this due to the World Principles being greatly
          damaged at that time.</span

          Sky Deer City, but it had already been moved before the Upper Realm
          Army conquered the city. Thus, Gu Changge currently didn&#8217;t know
          which clan had it with them, but it must have been one of the Four War
          God Clans. Once he exterminated all four of them, the Tree would
          naturally fall into his possession.</span

          cluster of stars where several were filled with signs of life while
          others without. Bright entrances appeared from which enormous cargo
          ships and countless soldiers emerged, seemingly bringing goods towards
          these stars, making it a noisy scene.</span

          and pavilions rose from the ground while islands floated in the sky. A
          silver waterfall cascaded from it, emitting clouds of mist. The rate
          of construction was fast for cultivators but the trouble lay in
          carving the arrays to protect the region.

          Solemn faces were covered with sweat as they busily carved mysterious

          were thankful yet sentimental since they got out of the crossfire in
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains early. They had already moved out
          of their original land and found this place, for which they felt
          grateful for. A moment too late, and they would be exterminated by the
          Upper Realm Army.</span

          extremely remote and barren as well, so it wasn&#8217;t likely that
          the Upper Realm would discover the clan here. Instead, the Upper Realm
          would think they had gone to the Lower Realm. This would give them
          millions of years where they could recuperate.

          reawakened and returned while bringing a treasure which was hard to
          describe in terms of value and words. With that treasure, they
          didn&#8217;t need to worry about cultivating here. Of course, only the
          higher-ups knew about it since it involved their Prime Ancestor, whose

          finding this place after being informed via a secret technique by the
          clan members waiting here.

          decided to seal up the place and hide here without getting involved in
          the issues of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. If Lin Wu had been
          a moment too late, he would have been exiled and could never return to
          his clan. In fact, his own family members didn&#8217;t care about his

          against Gu Changge&#8217;s army? Even Sky Deer City couldn&#8217;t

          exceptionally old while exuding terrifying energy. They were the Lin
          Clan Ancestors who were all True Daoists. They frowned, filled with
          suspicion about the army&#8217;s sudden arrival. It hadn&#8217;t been
          long since they fled here, so how had the Upper Realm found them? Did
          the clan have a traitor in their midst? Someone who had secretly
          pledged loyalty to the Upper Realm? It wasn&#8217;t the time to think
          about that though.</span

          situated. Mysterious energy permeated the place and made this place
          resemble a separate world. A black river converged like the Spring of
          Death to form a deathly quiet sea. Several ghosts could be seen
          wandering the riverbank, descending from somewhere far away,

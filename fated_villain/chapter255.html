      <h4>
        Chapter 255-1: As a fellow tool man, he did not play cards according to
        the routine at all (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's calculations were actually very good. Now he didn't
        actually have to do anything as he just planned to watch the play on the
        sidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang was well hidden. Although he was an imposter, compared with
        the real Prince Ying, most people probably wouldn't be able to tell the
        difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang was not stupid. After so long, even a pig would know how to
        disguise itself. During this period, the people around Ying Shuang had
        not noticed anything, which also displayed his prudence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had anticipated this for a long time, so he planned to let
        Wang Ziji act so that it would be difficult for Ying Shuang to continue
        to pretend. After all, demeanor and actions could be disguised, but in
        terms of strength, he did not believe that Ying Shuang could be the same
        as the original Prince Ying.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was worth it as long as people who were familiar with him could
        notice the abnormality of Ying Shuang. Therefore, Gu Changge had already
        anticipated Ying Shuang's next move.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the excuse of showing weakness, he had informed everyone in the
        Heavenly Emperor Mountain that his cultivation had gone wrong recently.
        With regards to Ying Yu's character, before this, she must have
        suspected Ying Shuang's abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as Ying Shuang had a little brain, he would definitely use the
        excuse of something going wrong in his cultivation, which lead to some
        confusion in her memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering the current situation it would be a big deal for him to fool
        everyone again with such a reason. And Gu Changge just waited for him to
        say so.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, it could be a mistake in cultivation, but it could also be a
        transfer of a certain inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a descendant of Heavenly Emperor Mountain, Ying Shuang took the
        initiative to abandon the original inheritance and then switched to
        another method. If this basin of sewage was poured on it, Ying Shuang's
        Luck points would be hit hard again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't plan to harvest Ying Yu so quickly. Before that, the
        Luck points on Ying Shuang had to be harvested first.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he had to moniker the blame of the inheritor of demonic arts
        for a longer time. And finally finding a scapegoat, Gu Changge wouldn't
        just let him go until he squeezed all his value out.
      </p>
      <p>Then, Gu Changge's gaze surged with interest again.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Terrible rune fluctuations emerged, accompanied by terrifying chains of
        order, descending from all directions. There suddenly seemed to be many
        stars exploding, and the energy fluctuations were terrifying to the
        extreme.
      </p>
      <p>Many mountain ranges collapsed and turned dust under this breath.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji's sudden action not only shocked the group from Heavenly
        Emperor Mountain but also shocked many of the younger generation
        cultivators near the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        They naturally recognized that this was a visitor from Emperor Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them, Prince Ying Shuang was the one who had an extraordinary
        bearing and was surrounded by Immortal intent, and he was also the most
        suspected inheritor of demonic arts today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Ying Shuang seldom showed up because of his demonic power, he
        was notorious during this period, but he was the Son of an Emperor from
        the Ancient Royal Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since he had been sealed for a long time to the present, his own talent
        was extremely strong. Many people thought that he would be the most
        powerful young existence in his life.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Of course, his strength needed no explanation. However, now he was
        instantly injured by the hands of a woman in a blue dress, and was
        bleeding profusely, which really shocked everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Including Ying Yu and Agu, others also widened their eyes and looked so
        shocked that they couldn‚Äôt believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of them were still former followers of Ying Shuang, and their
        strength was the highest among their peers. They all felt that the scene
        in front of them was unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did Ying Shuang become so weak? He couldn't even stop the opponent's
        blow? Or was it because there was no response?
      </p>
      <p>"Little Lord‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>"Stop it!"</p>
      <p>
        Afterward, everyone reacted, and they sacrificed various divine
        artifacts one after another, all kinds of powerful fluctuations erupted,
        the brilliance was gorgeous, being reflected in all directions, and
        attacked Wang Ziji.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How can you only have such strength?" Wang Ziji frowned slightly, with
        a little surprise, and even she did not expect that Ying Shuang's
        strength would be so weak.
      </p>
      <p>
        He couldn't even take a single blow from her. In her perception, Ying
        Shuang at least had the strength above the Quasi-Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no reason to be this weak. Even if he didn't dare to use the
        forbidden magic, with the inheritance of Emperor Mountain, it should be
        enough to deal with her blow. Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on
        ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm
      </p>
      <p>
        "Are you feigning weakness?" She shook her head gently, waved her hand
        again, and a large piece of clear light emerged, which was filled with a
        powerful breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sky trembled, and all directions resonated. At this moment, she was
        like a supreme female Immortal King with various runes intertwined, like
        two huge moon seals, pushed by her, to suppress Ying Shuang.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Such a blow instantly changed the expressions of the rest of the nearby
        cultivators from the Heavenly Emperor Mountain, making them afraid as
        they did not dare to take it hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        This had already involved the power of laws at the Sacred Realm. Only
        the same level of power could stop it.
      </p>
      <p>"You are the descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>At this time, Ying Yu's expression changed slightly.</p>
      <p>
        Immediately afterward, her jade hand lifted, and her crystal fingers
        pointed out in the virtual space that had the sky full of brilliance.
        She had used a supreme talisman to resist the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it could only resist for a breath, and she was not Wang Ziji's
        opponent at all. At this moment, she recognized Wang Ziji's identity,
        and her silver eyes were filled with shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        She never expected that they had just come to the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield, and encountered the descendant of Human Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        With her terrifying strength, unless her brother took action, none of
        them would be her opponent. But at this time, Ying Shuang seemed to be
        in a wrong state. He had been passive during the previous attack and was
        constantly wounded, making him cough up blood. He had absolutely no
        terrifying strength like the Prince Ying in the past.
      </p>
      <p>"So you still recognize me, that's fine."</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji still had a smile on her face, her blue dress fluttered, and
        she looked unparalleled, but she didn't show mercy at all. As a
        descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall, it was normal for her to deal
        with the inheritor of demonic art.
      </p>
      <p>No one could say anything more.</p>
      <p>
        "My brother has nothing to do with the inheritor of demonic art. Stop
        quickly, and don't accidentally hurt the innocent."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu couldn't help shouting, although she suspected that Ying Shuang
        had something to hide from her, she didn't believe that he would have
        something to do with the inheritor of demonic arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Wang Ziji's expression did not change much, and she said
        lightly, "Just because you say he has nothing to do with the inheritor
        of demonic art, it doesn‚Äôt make him innocent. As the evidence points to
        him‚Ä¶ If you want me to stop, then that‚Äôs fine, let your brother display
        his real strength."
      </p>
      <p>Saying so, her hands became even more ruthless.</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The divine light blooming in the sky was like a large piece of petal,
        gorgeous and crystal clear, and more runes emerged from it as if they
        were rooted in a small world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a vast and ancient divine art with infinitely evolving
        mysteries. In a trance, everyone seemed to notice a door opening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countless divine chains of laws emerged from them, causing the
        expressions of everyone from the Emperor Mountain to change drastically.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Someone instantly sacrificed a piece of forbidden weapon to resist this
        attack. This kind of power was too terrifying, and it could not be
        blocked by ordinary people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Gu Changge, who had been watching from a distance, felt that Wang
        Ziji's strength was quite good. At the Quasi-Sacred Realm, it showed the
        power that even someone at the Sacred Realm would be afraid of.
      </p>
      <p>It was worthy of being a fellow traveler.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the face of this terrifying blow, Ying Shuang‚Äôs expression changed.
        He wanted to resist, but a vague and stalwart figure, swallowing all the
        world, appeared behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Ying Shuang didn't have any indifferent confidence on his
        face when he entered the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, and he was
        completely gloomy and ugly. He didn't understand why Wang Ziji was
        waiting at the entrance, just waiting for his arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he was not the original Prince Ying after all. In a moment, the
        brilliance erupted, like countless stars exploded, and the terrifying
        energy raged here. Ying Shuang spurted blood again, and his body flew
        upside down, with severe pain all over his body and many broken bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji slapped him with a palm, and the terrifying force collapsed
        everything like an immortal turned into a mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Do you still want to feign weakness? I underestimated your
        forbearance."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji frowned, she really didn't expect for Ying Shuang to no't
        fight back, and continued to feign weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the time she was cultivating in the Human Ancestor Hall, she had
        learned a lot of the divine powers inherited from the Dao traditions,
        among which the divine powers of the Emperor Mountain were by no means
        only at this level.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she couldn't understand why Ying Shuang would choose to show weakness
        in front of everyone.
      </p>
      <p>This was completely hitting him in the face of Emperor Mountain.</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 255-2: As a fellow tool man, he did not play cards according to
        the routine at all (2)
      </h4>
      <p>
        He was able to endure such a shameful thing. In this regard, she could
        only say that he was worthy of being the inheritor of demonic art, and
        his heart was far beyond many of the young supreme beings she had
        encountered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, Wang Ziji's expression couldn't help but turn colder,
        but she still chose to stop.
      </p>
      <p>"Master, are you alright?"</p>
      <p>
        The rest of the people of Emperor Mountain also hurried to help Ying
        Shuang at this time. But Ying Shuang's appearance was really miserable,
        covered in blood, hair disheveled, and many of his bones broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shock caused by this scene was too great for the many culitvators of
        the younger generation who found the rest of the entrances near the
        battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was hard to believe that the person in front of them was the rumored
        Prince Ying. In the hands of this mysterious woman, there was no way for
        him to fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, more people were staring at Wang Ziji, as if they wanted to see
        through her.
      </p>
      <p>"Who is this opponent of Prince Ying? How can she be so strong?"</p>
      <p>
        "It seems that she is the rumored descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall,
        the mysterious queen of the Royal Family‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>"No wonder such a thing happened."</p>
      <p>
        "This strength is really terrifying, I'm afraid she already has the
        strength of a Sacred Realm."
      </p>
      <p>"However, Prince Ying looks too weak, doesn't he?"</p>
      <p>
        They talked a lot and were surprised. Both of them were from the younger
        generation, they were outstanding in various places, and they had a good
        understanding of the elites of all ethnic groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were also many young supreme beings from the Ancient Clans.
        Although their cultivation was not as good as those of the Ancient
        freaks, it was still difficult for them to find rivals in the same Realm
        in various places, and there was an image of invincibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The performance of Prince Ying today made them wide-eyed, completely
        unexpected and unacceptable. That was the leader of the younger
        generation in the Primordial era, why did he lose so humiliatingly?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge watched with interest, and the system prompt sounded again in
        his mind.
      </p>
      <p>Ying Shuang‚Äôs Luck points were still decaying.</p>
      <p>
        Although he did not suppress Ying Shuang with his own hands, but through
        the tool named Wang Ziji, it did not prevent him from harvesting Destiny
        Points and Luck Points.
      </p>
      <p>In just this moment of effort, Ying Shuang had lost a lot of Luck.</p>
      <p>
        After all, the younger generation in the vicinity were all prominent
        figures from all walks of life, and behind them were different Dao
        forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were even many Ancient freaks hiding in the dark. Just like him,
        they didn't show up.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        "Do you think it has something to do with the recent rumors? Didn't you
        say that Prince Ying was the inheritor of demonic arts? He simply
        displayed weakness to his enemies in order to clear his suspicions, but
        in this case, it feels like a superfluous effort‚Ä¶.."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, many people were guessing, and their eyes were very
        puzzled.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How is it, are you still playing around? This is my strength, is it
        disappointing you a little‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at this time, Ying Shuang stood up with the help of several
        followers, but it was completely different from the angry and gloomy
        expression that everyone thought of.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, he was very calm, his eyes were extremely indifferent, and
        he was not at all anxious and frustrated as everyone thought. As if all
        of this had been within his expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Ancient freaks of Emperor Mountain who were a little suspicious
        of him just now became suspicious, feeling that Ying Shuang's move had
        some profound meaning?
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, why would he look like this?</p>
      <p>"Elder brother‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu looked at Ying Shuang in surprise and suddenly felt that he had
        become unfathomable. The humiliation just now seemed to be intentional.
        Was it really showing?
      </p>
      <p>"He's quite capable."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, whose figure was hiding in the dark, couldn't help but
        chuckle slightly when he saw this scene. This Ying Shuang was a little
        clever, and he really regarded himself as a forced king.
      </p>
      <p>
        But did he have the capital to pretend? Wang Ziji in front of him was a
        transmigrator, not a native genius.
      </p>
      <p>"What are you pretending to be in front of me at this time?"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Wang Ziji was slightly taken aback. Turning around, she
        couldn't help laughing, with a faint smile on her beautiful face.
        Although she was wearing a veil, it still made many young men stare.
      </p>
      <p>
        To think that there were such perfect people in this world. It could
        only be said that it was worthy of being the descendant of the Human
        Ancestor Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji was not angry because of Ying Shuang's attitude. No matter
        what Ying Shuang's plan was, at this time, he had already been defeated
        in such a humiliating manner, and yet, he dared to act in front of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji hated this kind of pretense the most. So the moment her words
        fell, she shot forward again.
      </p>
      <p>
        A seal crossed the sky and turned into a majestic mountain, with
        hundreds of millions of rules and laws of divine light hanging down from
        it, pressing down towards Ying Shuang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this scene, his expression was indifferent at first, and he felt
        that he had to be calm like Ying Shuang, but his expression changed a
        little.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't expect that Wang Ziji wouldn‚Äôt play according to the routine
        at this time, and she didn't ask any questions and directly made a move.
      </p>
      <p>
        This caught Ying Shuang a little off guard. At this time, shouldn't Wang
        Ziji frown and ask him for his reasons?
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he would maintain such an unpredictable expression, first bluffing
        her so that she was not interested in attacking him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, the sacred mountain, which was condensed by laws and order was
        pressing down and was about to hit him on his head.

      <p>"Little Lord‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        The expressions of everyone of the Heavenly Emperor Mountain changed
        suddenly, and they wanted to fight against this blow, but they couldn't
        resist, but they were hit by its after effect, making them vomit blood
        and scatter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Shuang, who was the first to bear the brunt, looked even more
        miserable, and half of his body exploded directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn't for his physical strength, he wouldn't have been so injured
        by this blow.
      </p>
      <p>"If you're going to keep feigning weakness, then I'll fulfill you‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji had a faint smile on her face, but the words she said made
        everyone from Emperor Mountain pale. Could it be that they had to leave
        as soon as they entered the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield?
      </p>
      <p>They couldn't even get a place in True Immortal Academy.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, they hoped that Ying Shuang would make a move, and not
        show weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Young Master, don't hold back anymore, let's take action at this time."
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you don't do it, we will lose all of the reputation of Emperor
        Mountain. Maybe even the quota for True Immortal Academy will be lost at
        this time‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
        They opened their mouths one after another, hoping that Ying Shuang
        would quickly show his true skills, and stop acting like this, it was
        too humiliating.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Brother, what are you hiding at this time‚Ä¶" Ying Yu was also extremely
        anxious and shouted at Ying Shuang. Explore new ùíèovels on nùíêvelbiùíè(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        She felt that since Ying Shuang had taken action just now, it meant that
        he had a solution.
      </p>
      <p>"‚Ä¶"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing everyone's words, Ying Shuang was really suffering and sad. If
        he really had a way, why would he be beaten and not fight back, and it
        was so miserable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although he had learned a lot of the unique inheritance skills of
        Emperor Mountain during this time, he was not at all comparable to Ying
        Shuang who had cultivated for decades.
      </p>
      <p>How could he fight Wang Ziji?</p>
      <p>
        However, just as the expressions of everyone from Heavenly Emperor
        Mountain became even paler, faint ripples spread in the void.
      </p>
      <p>Immediately afterwards, a young figure stepped out of it.</p>
      <p>
        "Holy Maiden Ziji, why don't you give this Gu some face and stop first?
        I believe there may be some misunderstanding in this matter."
      </p>
      <p>
        It was Gu Changge, he glanced at Ying Shuang and the others with a
        somewhat surprised expression, then stood in front of them, and said to
        Wang Ziji.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge!"</p>
      <p>"It's him!"</p>
      <p>"He actually came to the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield?"</p>
      <p>
        A group of young beings nearby saw Gu Changge, and their expressions
        couldn't help changing suddenly. They were very shocked and fearful, and
        many people's eyes flashed with obvious awe.
      </p>
      <p>They never thought that Gu Changge would suddenly come here.</p>

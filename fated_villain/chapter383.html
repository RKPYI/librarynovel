          you bastard!&#8221; Gu Xianer&#8217;s body trembled in anger. She was
          beyond livid. However, even was huffing, there were barely any visible
          changes to her ‘physique’, no thanks to her flat figure.</span

          nothing you do will make me feel better!&#8221; Snarled Gu Xianer
          while glaring daggers at him, seemingly about to erupt. As a money
          grubber, how could she allow her treasure to be stolen away right
          before her eyes!? It was absolute humiliation to her.</span

          horrible…&#8221; Gu Xianer suddenly bawled, seeing that he
          wouldn&#8217;t budge no matter what she said or did. However, the man
          pinched her nose and shook his head. &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to
          cry, at least make it believable, or I won&#8217;t feel any sense of
          accomplishment.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Returning the stone engraving to her was naturally not an option.
          There was a sliver of Godly Illusion Source in the thing. It would
          serve Gu Xianer no purpose other than giving her a chance to refine it
          into an artifact. However, for Gu Changge, he could devour it to
          advance his strength.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          smiled.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Okay, fine. Since you&#8217;re willing to give, two it
          is.&#8221; The young woman agreed to the offer at once for fear that
          he would go back on his words. That said, she pretended to accept it
          begrudgingly, like she had suffered a major loss. She could tell as
          extraordinary as the stone engraving was, it was still nothing
          compared to a Sacred Lord Grade Artifact, much less two.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, artifacts in the Sacred Grade and above were deemed as
          hereditary items to many ancient forces. They were all super rare and
          extremely difficult to forge. Meanwhile, that stone engraving only
          contained some unique properties to it. Thus, it was Gu Changge who
          suffered a loss, no matter how she looked at it.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, Gu Changge naturally wouldn&#8217;t go back on his words
          when he promised to give Gu Xianer two Sacred Lord Grade Artifacts in
          exchange. Thus, he randomly picked two Sacred Lord Grade Artifacts
          before her wide, predatory eyes. When she saw her two compensation,
          the grimacing young woman finally smiled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;At least you still have some conscience in you.&#8221; She
          snorted. Now in a good mood, she returned to her aloof, supercilious,
          ethereal self.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Perhaps because she was so used to growing up poor, she had an
          instinctive obsession towards various treasures. Thus, she would
          involuntarily reveal her money grubber side in front of such things,
          and also in front of Gu Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Subsequently, Gu Changge took her to meet up with Yue Mingkong. While
          the members of the Immortal Gu Family followed after him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since Gu Changge showed up, they would naturally follow his
          lead.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, the gazes of the disciples and Elders of the Immortal
          Academy at Gu Changge were somewhat unnatural. Sure, they had feared
          him even in the past, but never to this degree. In fact, the likes of
          the Kind with Six Crowns, the Phoenix Lady, and more would
          subconsciously avoid making eye contact with Gu Changge.</span

          get to see you suppress and steal the princess,&#8221; Wang Zijin
          joked with a beam.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          gorgeous eyes curved into beautiful crescents, looking exceptionally
          bubbly against her stunning face. She was definitely a woman who would
          attract any man’s heart, and her beauty was comparable to Yue
          Mingkong, completely flawless. However, their temperaments were vastly
          different.</span

          >&#8220;I was only joking earlier. I must&#8217;ve looked like an
          idiot to you.&#8221; Gu Changge was long used to her teasing and
          didn&#8217;t take them to heart. After a smile, he took a gander at
          Jiang Chuchu, who looked unfazed with no intention of even greeting
          him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In actuality, he could&#8217;ve saved all the superficial appearances
          at this point, but he still had an image to uphold.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Wang Zijin continued to smile brightly as she took a profound glance
          at Gu Changge without a word. Though Gu Changge was the Mortal One’s
          reincarnation to the public, the way she saw it, it was merely some
          sort of agreement between him and Jiang Chuchu.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, to the other forces, it was a deal between Gu Changge and
          Mortal Palace. His identity as the Mortal One’s reincarnation was a
          ploy created by Mortal Palace to stabilise their followers.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, how could Gu Changge be the Mortal One’s reincarnation all
          of a sudden!? Hardly anyone believed it either. In fact, it was an
          unstated secret that stood among the Upper Realm&#8217;s topmost
          forces, that they doubted Gu Changge as the Mortal One.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, after witnessing Gu Changge&#8217;s powers for herself
          earlier, Wang Zijin suddenly thought the assumption she had made so
          simply some time ago might actually be true. Based on her
          understanding of the man, she naturally knew he had nothing to do with
          the so-called Mortal One at all. Thus… Why would Gu Changge have the
          Mortal One&#8217;s Purifying Nirvana Lotus Body?
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Of course, these were still just mere speculations on her part. She
          wasn&#8217;t that interested in the Mortal One. In fact, she had a
          slight aversion towards it. Thus, she was just curious why Gu Changge
          agreed to take on this status as the Mortal One.</span

          with a smile. &#8220;Did you gain anything?&#8221;</span

          giving her an otherworldly appearance. Perhaps because she had been
          cultivating, her skin was now glowing, smooth and fair like
          jade.</span

          disciples of Skyward Schloss greeted Gu Changge exceptionally
          respectfully. After all, the man had another alias, the Successor of
          Skyward Schloss.</span

          surprised, seemingly only just noticed her presence.</span

          white up, and the eyes of many male disciples were laced with
          amazement. The kind of shock stupefied by her beauty.</span

          second while Wang Zijin sized the Xiao Ruoyin up with great interest,
          especially when she sensed something in her no one else had.</span

          Changge. She didn&#8217;t have a deep reverence for the man, but Wang
          Zijin still felt the woman&#8217;s nervousness. That she was not as
          composed as she appeared to be.</span

          sneered, thinking things were becoming more interesting. [Planning to
          manipulate a womaniser, huh? Tsk-tsk.]</span

          voice rang just then, asking bluntly. However, the next second, she
          looked towards Yue Mingkong, sensing weirdness in the air.
          &#8220;I&#8217;m asking for Mingkong, of course.&#8221;</span

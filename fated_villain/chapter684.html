        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly everyone in the arena noticed Gu Changge leave. He was actually the reason many of them had come, and seeing that he was no longer interested in the event, the crowd naturally didn&#8217;t want to stay any longer either.</span><span id="more-36147"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many assumed from Gu Changge&#8217;s attitude this night that he had likely come here to select some battle-hardened condemned prisoners or servants. After all, given his current status, he probably wouldn&#8217;t be interested in ordinary followers. If anything, they should at least be Sacred or Sacred King  Realm experts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even when this was the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, Sacred King Realm experts were hard to find.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, that was what everyone thought. As for whether it was true or not, no one knew.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Gu Changge left, the gaze of the host in the arena flickered, and he quietly notified the waiting condemned prisoners not to come up to the battleground anymore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That sir has left?!&#8221; The group from the Blue Flood Ancient World was also greatly surprised. Then again, they and Gu Changge were from different worlds. So they dared not harbour any dreams. However, they couldn&#8217;t help but look at Xue Yan with envy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very quickly, what happened here had been secretly transmitted to the spies of various Forces, and many young prodigies, who thought they were strong, began to get excited and eager to participate in the battles. They hoped Gu Changge would notice them and select them to be his followers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like that, an undercurrent Gu Changge deliberately left had swept through the entire Battlefield of Hundred Worlds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the Vermilion Bird Hall, the Azure Dragon Hall, White Tiger Hall, Ming Luo Hall, and others also received the news in no time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could Gu Changge have only come to select followers? Have we just been overly cautious?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That, or he did it just to cover up his true intentions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several terrifying figures shrouded in thick fog stood within a stygian palace in the depths of the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. Horrifying, world-ending scenes appeared in their eyes as an eerie glow flickered within them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They possessed unrivalled might, with boundless auras, like mighty Suns that never extinguish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneath them were mountains of white bones and skulls from the corpses of Sacred Emperors and True Daoists of the recent eras. Every single one of them was crystal clear and hard like divine iron with undispersed divinity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the assassins who walked in the dark, each bone here represented a glorious achievement. After all, they belonged to beings of distinguished status and origin, or they wouldn&#8217;t have been qualified to be displayed in this palace as collectables.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neraka had ten Palaces in total, each located in a mysterious space. Not even the Palace Lords could locate each other&#8217;s coordinates. It was also why the Neraka always succeeded in avoiding getting besieged and annihilated by various Forces throughout its long history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for six out of the ten Palace Lords to gather like this moment was also a rare occurrence in the history of Neraka&#8217;s existence, and the well-being of the Neraka would be at stake every time this happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can&#8217;t be hasty about this. We don&#8217;t even know why Gu Changge is here. It&#8217;s better not to act recklessly just yet. Gu Changge is simply too terrifying. If we were to fight him head-on, we would only end up being crushed to pieces.&#8221; A terrifying figure shrouded in black mist and grave malice spoke up. Their eyes were profound yet extremely cautious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neraka had made countless enemies since its existence. If the location of the headquarters was suddenly exposed, the countless Forces would inevitably attack them, and this wasn&#8217;t something the Palace Lords wanted to see.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So be it if he has only come to pick out followers. What worries me is that he has other plans. There&#8217;s no way Nephrite Breeze Pavilion has nothing to do with him,&#8221; said another Palace Lord, also shrouded in mist, making it impossible to see his true form. Meanwhile, vast aura and animosity swirled around him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ten Palace Lords of Neraka were formidable individuals who had killed countless, and they naturally were no simple characters having come this far. They were incredibly prudent and not ones to take risks lightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it were anyone else, they naturally had ways to make them disappear from the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. However, this was Gu Changge. The man was incredibly powerful, and there was likely barely anyone who could match him in the Upper Realm. After all, he could fight several mysterious True Daoists in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty even when he was gravely injured! They dare not even entertain the thought of facing him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity that the First Palace Lord hasn&#8217;t reached our level yet. Otherwise, we&#8217;d be able to fight against Gu Changge if all of us joined forces to form the Immortal Annihilating Formation. If we can kill him, Neraka&#8217;s reputation will definitely return to its peak, and we won&#8217;t have to fear him like this,&#8221; said one of the Palace Lords who had been silent as he shook his head regretfully, eyes cold and filled with terrifying malice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immortal Annihilating Formation was a secret technique Neraka had passed down since ancient times, and it could only be cast when all ten Palace Lords joined forces. Its power was unimaginable, even capable of killing Immortals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, 30 million years ago, the former First Palace Lord was ambushed and apparently suffered severe injuries and died, with his whereabouts remaining unknown till this day. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the current First Palace Lord, he was still far from the cultivation level of his predecessor. Hence, it was difficult for him to sustain the Immortal Annihilating Formation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, they didn&#8217;t want to fight Gu Changge unless absolutely necessary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in the Palace Lords were discussing the trouble at hand. The cultivators of Blue Flood Ancient World, who returned from the battle arena, returned to their respective quarters to rest after explaining to their Elders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon returning to his room, Lu Ming looked around cautiously as he closed the doors and windows. Naturally, not forgetting to set up arrays to prevent eavesdropping after making sure no one was around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You promised me that you would give me a great opportunity once I arrived in the Upper Realm,&#8221; Lu Ming mumbled calmly as if he wasn&#8217;t alone in that space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Lu Ming spoke, a soft glow appeared from under his sleeve. Then, a crystal-like stone resembling amber emerged, radiating with a brilliant and dazzling light. &lt;To think there&#8217;d be a day I&#8217;d return to the Upper Realm. Who would have thought?&gt;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unfathomable wave spread within the stone, illuminating the entire space with a mysterious glimmer. At the same time, a middle-aged man&#8217;s voice echoed from within, sounding both plain and old, as if he had experienced many things in the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Ming was unfazed. In fact, he was calm. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t forgotten what you promised me, have you, Senior? You said you would grant me a great opportunity if I could come to the Upper Realm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Lu Ming was little, the rock streaked across the sky one day like a shooting star and landed in his backyard. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early days, this mysterious rock would absorb his spiritual energy and then return more pure and profound power to him. Thanks to it, Lu Ming, who came from a small place, laid an extremely solid cultivation foundation from childhood. It allowed him to be able to fight against top Sect disciples like Xue Yan later on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had to be honest that it was this mysterious rock that had everything to do with his achievements till this day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, he discovered something by chance—a universe lived within the rock, and time there flowed very slowly. Normally, he would have to spend several months and even a year before he could master a technique. However, only two weeks had passed when he studied and practised those techniques in that space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that, his cultivation advanced by leap and bounds, and he became quite the local celebrity. So much so that he was able to join the Sect where Xue Yan was in and even become qualified to participate in the Great War of Hundred Worlds in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it was only a little after he joined the Sect where Xue Yan was in did he learn that there was a remnant soul hidden in the universe within the rock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, the remnant soul tried to possess him but eventually had to give up because his physical body was too weak to contain it. Although Lu Ming survived by chance, he became wary of the remnant soul. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the soul promised him many things, he never agreed to them. The only condition Lu Ming thought sounded reliable was bringing it to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Huh, you dare question me, kid? Your Ancestors weren&#8217;t even born yet when I roamed the Upper Realm.&gt; The middle-aged man inside the rock burst into a guffaw while feeling the World Principles of this place for the first time in aeons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked faint and illusory and unable to maintain his original appearance. Still, one could see hints of his former grandeur. He was tall, with deep and awe-inspiring eyes. Even as a remnant soul, he still possessed an invincible aura that overlooked everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he couldn&#8217;t exactly obliterate the whole world during his peak, he was still unbeatable in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I dare not doubt your words. I just hope you will stick to your words and provide me with the opportunity you promised,&#8221; Lu Ming remained neither overbearing nor servile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew the soul could kill him easily, but the latter had sworn upon his Dao heart, which would affect the latter&#8217;s well-being. Hence, Lu Ming wasn&#8217;t worried the soul would break their promise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Relax, I used to be on equal footing with Sect Masters, for goodness sake. Even if I was ambushed by my enemy and went through the biggest crisis of my life, I  still survived. Do you think I&#8217;d lie to you about this mere opportunity?&gt; The middle-aged man snubbed Lu Ming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Ming merely stood there silently. He was aware that this middle-aged man was likely his only chance in the Upper World. In fact, after what happened in the battle arena earlier, he could tell that Xue Yan, who he used to be extremely close with, had become estranged and would ultimately leave him. Therefore, he had to become stronger to seize everything that belonged to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;I found this rock in your hand back in a deserted star. It contains ancient divine runes, and I turned it into a divine artifact after refining it. It originally had seven layers, but it was shattered during my battle to the death. Now, only this piece remains. Since you obtained it by chance, I shall also tell you how to activate it, the middle-aged man said as he looked at the floating rock. Then, he reached a finger out, and a brilliant golden glow landed in the middle of Lu Ming&#8217;s forehead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An extremely obscure ancient scripture spread out in Lu Ming&#8217;s mind, with every word shining brilliantly and exuding an awe-inspiring aura. He widened his eyes in shock. It was his first time coming into contact with such a profound scripture.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in the Blue Flood Ancient World, the most profound scripture he came across were merely vague interpretations. They were hardly deep.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Would everything be different now if I had obtained this scripture earlier?] Lu Ming mused with stupefaction. But very quickly, he cheered triumphantly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Ming&#8217;s disbelief pleased the middle-aged man, but he quickly withdrew his expression and brought up another topic. &lt;Don&#8217;t get too excited just yet. This isn&#8217;t everything. Remember what I told you? Look for an organisation named Neraka after coming to the Upper Realm. Find a point of contact, and I will grant you an even bigger opportunity. The Great War of Hundred Worlds will be nothing compared to this!&gt;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was a character everyone revered thirty million years ago. Even Sect Masters feared him. At that time, he roamed the Upper Realm, killing young prodigies, ancient Sacred Realm beings, Sacred Emperors, and Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts. Wherever he went, people trembled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silavin: 都天灭狱仙煞阵 &#8211; Heavenly Destruction Hell Annihilation Immortal Demon Array. Holy shit that’s long. Going to just shorten it to Immortal Annihilating Formation</span></p>

      <h4>
        Chapter 142: Wastes Producing Miracles; Not Giving a Damn about Gu
        Changge!
      </h4>
      <p>Gu Changge did hold some expectations for Hei Ming.</p>
      <p>
        After all, wastes had produced miracles since ancient times, so wouldn’t
        it be wonderful if Hei Ming could also do something great after he
        ignited a flame in his heart?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the prerequisite for wastes to produce miracles was that they
        don’t encounter a massive villain like him…either way, Hei Ming’s
        failure wouldn’t affect Gu Changge in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p><b>[Hum!]</b></p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Gu Changge faced Hei Ming, who kneeled in front of him, and
        released ripples in the space in front of him through his eyes!
      </p>
      <p>
        Hei Ming, who was lost in the excitement, turned pitch-black and was
        pushed out of Gu Changge’s inner world by a majestic force.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, Hei Ming found himself back in the private room from
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        His hands trembled as he watched the familiar scene around him, and he
        felt as if…everything was a dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only a moment had passed, but he felt as if he had lived through an
        eternity.
      </p>
      <p>Hei Ming couldn’t help but flap the wings behind him in excitement.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“That Art is simply unimaginable! Just what level of existence is the
          Supreme Being…I am afraid, they are stronger than those fabled
          Immortals…”</b
        >
        L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
      </p>
      <p>
        Hei Ming’s muttered to himself with a trembling voice and then tried to
        calm himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        What he failed to notice was a faint, silver pattern that imprinted
        itself in his eyes and slowly disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“[Binding Immortal Art]! The Supreme Being seems to have specially
          prepared this Immortal Art for me. He knew that I only have a mediocre
          Cultivation Base and Talent, so he bestowed upon me a technique that
          can ignore the limitations of one’s Talent.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“As long as I teach others a part of the [Binding Immortal Art], I
          will be able to have some of their Talent, and even Cultivation
          results.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>“This is incredible!”</b></p>
      <p><b>“This…this is too awesome!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Hei Ming’s voice trembled and his eyes widened as he muttered to
        himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        He carefully studied the power of the [Binding Immortal Art] and his
        entire person trembled, and so did his soul.
      </p>
      <p>It was a terrifying and heaven-defying Immortal Art!</p>
      <p>
        Once it came out, it would definitely cause unimaginable consequences!
      </p>
      <p>
        Hei Ming believed that only the Supreme Being could bestow such a
        heaven-defying Immortal Art upon their followers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chills went down Hei Ming’s back as he came to this realization and he
        felt scared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effects of the [Binding Immortal Art] subverted his long-standing
        understanding of Cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I wouldn’t be stuck in the Transcendent Realm if I received such a
          heaven-defying Art earlier…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        With that, Hei Ming took in a few deep breaths and finally calmed down.
      </p>
      <p>
        He swore in his heart that he wouldn’t let the [Binding Immortal Art] be
        exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, the [Binding Immortal] part of the [Binding Immortal Art]
        didn’t involve anything that would risk exposing its original function,
        and this fact relieved Hei Ming.
      </p>
      <p>
        [TL/N: the Binding Immortal Art has two parts, one is cultivated by the
        prey and the other is cultivated by the hunter. The part cultivated by
        the prey takes their Talent and Cultivation and gives it to the hunter
        through the part they cultivate.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“First, I must find a way to try it out! On the surface, the [Binding
          Immortal Art] has nothing unusual about it and looks no different from
          ordinary Cultivation Arts, but it’s extremely profound and obscure in
          reality…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Hei Ming paced back and forth in the private room with a frown.</p>
      <p>
        Before long, he put his target on several of his followers with the
        intent to test out the effects of the [Binding Immortal Art].
      </p>
      <p>
        What Hei Ming failed to notice was the distorted Void behind him,
        through which a playful gaze paid attention to all of his actions.
      </p>
      <p>Then, the Void blurred and the gaze soon disappeared.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge finally left.</p>
      <p>
        Either way, he had already implanted an ability of his own inside Hei
        Ming’s eyes, so he could see through his eyes at any time and get an
        idea of what he was up to.
      </p>
      <p>
        He loved to keep a bunch of eyes here and there! Even if they were
        useless, it was alright.
      </p>
      <p>It’s not like they got in the way.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, Hei Ming, too, left the private room in excitement, greeted the
        people outside the Pavilion, and prepared to return to the Black Sky
        Eagle Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, he had already decided on his target…his sister, Hei Yanyu!
      </p>
      <p>Hei Ming was an ambitious fellow.</p>
      <p>
        His sister’s talent was recognized to be the best among the five Ancient
        Immortal Families, and only a few could match up to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her bloodline was the closest to their Ancestors, after all, so even
        among the Ancient Immortal Families of the Ancient Immortal Continent,
        she was able to rank among the best.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more? She was already in the Middle Stage of the False God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘If the effects of the [Binding Immortal Art] are really as
        heaven-defying as I think, then I can also teach it to my sister later.
        After all, it’s not like I will suffer a loss by doing so…’
      </p>
      <p>Hei Ming didn’t hold much malice towards his sister now.</p>
      <p>
        At first, Hei Ming resented his sister and didn’t want to admit that
        they were related because she was a genius and he was a waste who had to
        live under the halo of her brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        For him, her talent wasn’t anything he could be thankful or happy about,
        instead, it was a matter of humiliation for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now that he possessed the [Binding Immortal Art], all those feelings
        vanished into thin air as he was sure that he would surpass his sister,
        Hei Yanyu, soon.
      </p>
      <p>After all, the Supreme Being was backing him up!</p>
      <p>He was the faithful believer of the mighty Supreme Being!</p>
      <p>
        ‘Recite my true name, and you will receive the secret to eternal life…’
      </p>
      <p>
        That one sentence was enough to fill Hei Ming’s heart with excitement
        and anticipation.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        After that, Gu Changge put aside his plans for the five major families,
        including the Black Sky Eagle Family, for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he had already planted his chess piece and arranged
        everything, so now, he could relax and watch everything as an ‘honest
        man’ leading the play from behind the scenes who didn’t show up and
        participate in just everything.
      </p>
      <p>Wasn’t it more awesome to pick the fruit when it ripened?</p>
      <p>Of course, Gu Changge didn’t really care much about all that.</p>
      <p>
        Right now, he started to think about Ye Ling’s affairs as he wasn’t
        someone like Hei Ming, a false Favored Son of Heaven he created with his
        own hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was quite interested in the next moves of Ye Ling, the actual
        Favored Son of Heaven.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Of course, he first needed to find an opportunity to squeeze out a wave
        of Fortune Value from him, or the time he spent on Chi Ling, the Holy
        Maiden of the Vermillion Bird Family, would be in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for his plans for them? Of course, it was to provoke a fissure in
        their relationship.
      </p>
      <p>Provoked people were the easiest to mess with.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge understood this strategy by heart since the moment of his
        inception.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just like Yue Mingkong often said: ‘there were endless evil ideas
        budding in his mind.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Ye Ling offended him, there was no way he would let him off easily
        even if he reincarnated a few times.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Right now, it’s possible for me to create an accident for Ye Ling, and
        that way, Yin Mei can use her role to its full potential.’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p><b>[Hum!]</b></p>
      <p>
        His figure flickered, and he left his spot and rushed towards another
        area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ruins were massive, and except for the city in the central area, the
        rest of the place consisted of collapsed mountains and dried-up bodies
        of water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who knows where the Ancient Heavenly Emperor of Reincarnation hid his
        so-called Cultivation Abode?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn’t plan to look for it, nor did he have the time for
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important matter for him was to take advantage of the time he
        had on his hands to go through some more ancestral tombs and
        breakthrough to the Sacred Realm as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Gu Changge started to search through the ruins since he knew
        that there were more ancestral tombs hidden between the sturdy mountains
        that reached through the clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, this was the gathering place of the aborigines and it had
        existed since ancient times. This place most definitely experienced
        quite a number of different eras, and the span of time it lived through
        couldn’t even be imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the ancient corpses held astonishing strength, with some even
        reaching the Quasi-Supreme Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quasi-Supreme, Supreme…in fact, although both realms held the word
        Supreme in their name, there was a fundamental difference between both.
      </p>
      <p>Between the two Realms existed a chasm of Nine Layers of Heaven!</p>
      <p>
        The Quasi-Supreme Realm was different from the rest of the Realms as it
        wasn’t divided into the standard four stages: ‘Initial Stage, Middle
        Stage, etc.’
      </p>
      <p>Instead, the Quasi-Supreme Realm was divided into Nine Heavens!</p>
      <p>
        Only when one cultivated all Nine Heavens of the Quasi-Supreme Realm
        could they be called a real Supreme!
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, they could truly become immortal and overlook life and
        death! Their lifespan would exceed a million years, and they would be
        almost immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was like the guy in the Ancient Heavenly Secret Realm whose body was
        penetrated by the [Eight Desolate Demon Halberd]. Although Gu Changge
        absorbed his remains, he didn’t actually get much from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more? Some Quasi-Supreme corpses would mutate and give birth to
        all kinds of strange things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ominous, ancient creatures covered in red hair were quite normal among
        them.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        The center of the Ancient Immortal Continent bubbled due to the
        intrusion of the youths from the outside world, while Gu Changge, Ye
        Ling, and the others busied themselves with wandering around the ancient
        ruins with different purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the True Dragon Family wasn’t actually a family of True Dragons
        because they only had a part of the real True Dragon bloodline, and
        weren’t real descendants of True Dragons, they still prided themselves
        as the overlords of the Ancient Immortal Races and the Ancient Immortal
        Tribe living on the Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>Right now, a bang was heard in their territory!</p>
      <p>
        A barren mountain range and various other mountains exploded out of
        nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terrible energy raged in the surroundings, and divine lights surged
        towards the sky and blew certain creatures and beasts who didn’t have
        the time to react into blood mist.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, a terrifying, handsome youth with extraordinary features
        dressed in blue robes walked out.
      </p>
      <p>Right now, he seemed to be standing above the Heavens.</p>
      <p>
        An amazing scene played behind him, showing off the evolution and
        destruction of the Universe in all four directions!
      </p>
      <p>
        A golden True Dragon phantom hovered between Heaven and Earth and
        released its majesty in all eight directions.
      </p>
      <p>The phantom resembled an actual, living True Dragon!</p>
      <p>
        The light in the youth’s eyes was even more terrifying, with showed
        stars floating around, and holding the might to easily crush anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two dazzling, crystal-clear dragon horns grew on the youth’s forehead
        covered with light-cyan dragon scales, and he radiated a terrifying
        divine might that could shatter the Heavens into nothingness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just looking at him made people’s hearts palpitate, with their souls
        almost flying away!
      </p>
      <p><b>“Congratulations, Lord!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Right then, a large number of creatures appeared near the mountain range
        and congratulated the youth in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creatures had both men and women, all with strong, ancient auras
        surging towards the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were young girls in the group, with the weakest in the Conferred
        King Realm, and the stronger once in the Initial and even Middle Stage
        of the False God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the most important details about them were their gorgeous,
        sultry looks that could move anyone’s heart with a smile or a frown.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Get up, everyone!”</b></p>
      <p>Long Teng commanded calmly.</p>
      <p>
        On the surface, he didn’t resemble the man he was said to be in the
        rumors, but those who knew him knew that he was a self-confident man who
        didn’t keep anything in his eyes and looked down on the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he claimed to be second in the world, no one would dare claim to be
        first.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, not just anyone could be said to have the Talent of a True
        Dragon!
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng proved himself worthy of that title with his strength and
        talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that his Cultivation Base had reached the Pinnacle of the False God
        Realm, he could ignite the True Dragon Flame at any time and step into
        the True God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Cultivation Base alone was enough to make him stand proud in the
        world, and no foe of his could survive even a single palm attack from
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than his strong True Dragon Bloodline, he also held different
        Talents, Mystical Abilities, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since birth, he hadn’t met anyone who could survive a single palm from
        him, let alone defeat him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Elders of the True Dragon Family suspected in the beginning that
        Long Teng was the reincarnation of an actual True Dragon, but it was
        later discovered that apart from his strength and talent, Long Teng had
        special about him when compared to the other Heavenly Geniuses of the
        True Dragon Family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, the beauties of the other Families and Races that Long Teng
        already bred had reached the double-digits.
      </p>
      <p><b>“What about the thing I ordered?”</b></p>
      <p>Long Teng questioned his followers while leaving the place.</p>
      <p>
        Born invincible, he had no interest in anything other than looking for
        more stunning chicks.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as he heard that the Ancient Immortal Continent would be opened
        up to the outside world, and countless outsiders would rush in, Long
        Teng ordered his followers to spread throughout the Continent in search
        of the female Young Supremes from the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if all the beauties in the world fell into his arms, he still
        wouldn’t be willing to let go of the juicy ones coming in from the
        outisde.

        Hearing his words, his followers responded to him one after another, and
        then took out jade talismans that shone with brilliance and projected
        the appearance of the beauties they captured in the sky.

      <p>Long Teng casually looked at them.</p>
      <p>
        It was as if…he was an Emperor picking three thousand concubines for his
        harem.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, Long Teng did have such a mentality.</p>
      <p>
        With his followers’ strength, it wouldn’t be hard for them to subdue the
        young talents from the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Ancient Immortal Continent was rarely opened up to the
        outside world, the result of their clash would always be the same. The
        strength of the outside cultivators was never as good as theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the difference between the outside and the inside was like
        the difference between Heaven and Earth. The Ancient Immortal Era was
        called the Ancient Immortal Era because True Immortals came to be in
        that era and moved unhindered in every direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Natural Laws in that Era were quite suitable for Cultivation, and
        those exact Natural Laws were well-preserved in the Ancient Immortal
        Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This, and many other reasons, made it so that the younger generation of
        the outside world couldn’t reach the same heights as them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, the outsiders wouldn’t give a damn about them if they had a
        large number of advantages over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“My Lord, I found a peerless woman for you this time! Her beauty is
          rare to find even in a million years.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then, a woman with a flattering face stepped forward and said to
        Long Teng.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was the dragon-horned girl who chose to retreat after her battle
        with Yue Mingkong.
      </p>
      <p>
        She used an [Imagining Stone] to record the battle at that time, and
        also got footage of Yue Mingkong’s appearance and figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng showed some interest when he heard her words, and said,
        <b>“Let me see!”</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>[Hum!]</b></p>
      <p>
        The dragon-horned girl put on an even more flattering expression when
        she heard his words, and the [Imaging Stone] in her hand overflowed with
        a hazy brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her claims made the curiosity of the other creatures soar as well, and
        they gathered around her to see what this dragon-horned girl got her
        hands on? What gave her her confidence?
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the image of a peerless beauty dressed in a blue, silk dress
        fluttering in the wind appeared in front of them. Although the image
        only showed a half-captured face, they could tell that the woman was
        breathtakingly beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>Immortal demeanor, with peerless elegance!</p>
      <p>For a while, the place fell into silence.</p>
      <p>
        Even Long Teng’s breathing hastened, and visible surprise appeared in
        his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“What a picturesque, Immortal visage! Who is this woman? Where is
          she?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Long Teng asked with a massive smile on his face.</p>
      <p>
        The dragon-horned girl’s flattering face disappeared, and she showed a
        face that was looking to score brownie points as she said,
        <b
          >“Reporting to My Lord! This girl’s name is Yue Mingkong, and she’s
          from the Supreme Immortal Dynasty of the outside world; she’s their
          contemporary Crown Princess, and has the appearance of an Empress…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“She also has a fiancé who comes from the Ancient Immortal Gu Family
          of the outside world, and is also the Heir of the Heavenly Immortal
          Dao Palace! He has an extraordinary identity and is known as the
          Reincarnation of a True Immortal…he’s extremely powerful.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to score some brownie points, she made sure to inquire about
        Yue Mingkong’s background.
      </p>
      <p>
        With her ability, she only needed to capture a few young talents from
        the outside world and question them if she wanted to know something.
      </p>
      <p>Alas! The information they possessed was limited.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Good! To think the world possessed such women as well — it seems
          that things are going to get more and more interesting.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Teng’s eyes glowed when he heard her explanation, but he wasn’t in
        a hurry.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he was far too strong, so there weren’t many opportunities
        for him to make a move.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, he decided to personally take action to capture the beautiful
        woman he just saw.
      </p>
      <p>As for her fiancé who sounded somewhat intimidating?</p>
      <p>Did he even need to give a damn about him with his strength?</p>
      <p>If that guy tried to stop him, then he will just slap him to death.</p>
      <p>
        Once you entered the Ancient Immortal Continent, your identity in the
        outside world no longer mattered. If you offended someone you shouldn’t
        offend, then you will either have to deal with them or die!
      </p>
      <p>Long Teng didn’t take the other party to heart.</p>
      <p>
        Afterward, he took a group of his followers and headed for the area
        where the young talents from the outside world gathered.
      </p>
      <p>For a while, turmoil broke out in all parts of the Continent.</p>

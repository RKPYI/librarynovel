        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To the outside world, the obliteration of the Eternal Overcast will certainly entail a terrible disaster. No doubt countless people and Sects will perish in it.&#8221;</span><span id="more-36181"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being and Gu Changge strode through the void. His face carried a hint of sadness, seemingly pitying the impending suffering of all living beings. Inch by inch, the space beneath their feet collapsed, turning into nothingness and disappearing into oblivion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An inexplicable expression flashed across Gu Chagge&#8217;s face in response before showing a thoughtful look, saying, &#8220;In recent years, various Forces of the Upper Realm have tried to establish an Immortal Academy, attempting to cultivate a True Immortal to prevent the Eternal Overcast Sourge. Unfortunately, the Immortal Academy is still too young, and having someone become a True Immortal is still just a distant prospect.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge seemed quite regretful as he spoke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being took a gander at Gu Changge, sensing quite a few implications in his words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you suggesting that I take this opportunity to establish my own Faith and save all the living beings?&#8221; Temptation crept up on him despite the plain smile on his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was indeed giving the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being a hint that there were no True Immortals in the Upper Realm at present. Furthermore, only the power of a True Immortal could stop the Eternal Overcast Scourge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was a colossal figure from the Celestial Ancient Times. Even till this day, he still possessed many mysterious and terrifying techniques, so it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult for him to prevent the Eternal Overcast Scourge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being to return and single-handedly fight against the disaster now, it would be tantamount to seeing the light in the darkness for the people of the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Gu Changge benefited somewhat from being known as the Successor of the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the various Forces of the Upper Realm were secretly discussing how to get rid of him, spreading rumours that he was the real Successor of Demonic Arts, stirring up the  entire Upper Realm. Even ordinary cultivators were deeply affected and pondered over the validity of the rumours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being were to resolve the Eternal Overcast Scourge at this time, Gu Changge could take advantage of his power to influence the Upper Realm and make strategic moves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having disappeared for so many years, you will surely cause endless waves with your return, Master, and I believe you can utilise this opportunity…&#8221; Gu Changge smiles faintly, putting his intentions out in the open.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being gazed at him with a hint of surprise, shook his head lightly, and stayed silent, seemingly contemplating Gu Changge&#8217;s intentions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had learned about Gu Changge&#8217;s identity from the young man himself—the Young Master of the Immortal Gu Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He might have looked away if Gu Changge were any other Young Master of an Immoral Family. However, the Gu Family was a whole nother story. Even in the Celestial Ancient Times, the Gu Family was extremely mysterious, with an unfathomable history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being pondered for a moment and smiled, nodding in agreement with his disciple&#8217;s suggestion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, he wasn&#8217;t certain when the Immortal Path would emerge in this era. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coincidentally, he could use this time to continue to plan for the Immortal King Dao Fruit and reap the benefits of the many ancient worlds he had laid traps in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge&#8217;s Master, he also had a reason to visit the Immortal Gu Family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being was quite curious. How different was the Immortal Gu Family today compared to the Gu Family of the Celestial Ancient Times? After all, he vaguely remembered hearing rumours that an Immortal King had once lingered in front of the Immortal Gu Family&#8217;s gate for a long time before quietly leaving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the Eternal Overcast, a thick fog surged, ruins piled up, the sky and earth collapsed, and the ground cracked, creating the sight of an apocalypse. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless Eternal Overcast Beings fled in all directions, hoping to escape this place before the Eternal Overcast collapsed into eternal silence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For them, this was a hopeless day, as their people would disappear with time following the destruction of the Eternal Overcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge and the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being remained calm and indifferent to everything, their figures passing through the vast Eternal Overcast Fog, intending to leave this place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, Gu Changge did see Jia Nan, Jia Jiuer, and others flee, but he couldn&#8217;t be bothered with them. After the destruction of the Eternal Overcast, the so-called Eternal Overcast Royal Family, including Jia Nan and Jia Jiuer, would continue to live like the other ordinary Eternal Overcast creatures, no longer any different from them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, he and Jia Nan were only using each other.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[With their ancient well in hand, the next step is to find a suitable ancient world,] Gu Changge mused, devising how to lay out his next big plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also quite curious about what the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had been planning for all these years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he had been hiding in the Upper Realm all this while, traces would certainly be left behind. Therefore, he suspected that the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being might have been hiding within a Great Universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those Great Universes were endless distances away from the Upper Realm, and even True Daoists would find it difficult to find their exact whereabouts in the chaos of the void. This could likely be the reason that the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had left space coordinates in the Eternal Overcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Perhaps I can use the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being to set up the trap in a suitable ancient world?] Gu Changge mused as he glanced plainly at the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the shocking war that erupted here, the surrounding territories were also submerged in the vast Eternal Overcast Fog.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge and the Ancient Reincarnation Supreme Being had left the desolate Eternal Overcast, tearing through the barriers of space, heading towards the centre of the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the vast Upper Realm was shrouded in the Eternal Overcast Fog, which had already swept through many surrounding Domains, many Forces near the area also tried to find ways to evacuate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The many Elders of the Immortal Academy, too, sent out messages immediately to seek help from their allies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the outbreak of the Eternal Overcast wasn&#8217;t stopped in time, its spread would be unstoppable. Hence, many Immortal and Formidable Forces of the Upper Realm dispatched a large number of people to set up formations to resist the Eternal Overcast Fog.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Saintess of Mortal Palace, Jiang Chuchu, also brought many Mortal Palace cultivators to join in the effort.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mortal Palace was originally established to resist the Eternal Overcast Scourge, after all. Hence, they accumulated many experiences and skills over time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago, when the Eternal Overcast first erupted, Jiang Chuchu also travelled far and wide to prevent many disasters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Eternal Overcast eruption this time is even more terrifying than before. I wonder what&#8217;s causing it,&#8221; Jiang Chuchu wondered as she stood atop a collapsed and lifeless ancient star along with many powerful Mortal Palace cultivators.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked incredibly stunning in her long white dress and fluttering dark hair. She exuded an otherworldly and aloof demeanour as she gazed at the vast mist in the distance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, many cultivators of other Forces appeared at the surrounding Star Territories, carving out large arrays in the void with various materials and divine rocks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ancient battleships stretched across the starry sky, with glowing runes and dazzling lights, constantly dispelling the dense fog ahead. But the Eternal Overcast Fog was still too thick and could not be dispersed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Eternal Overcast Creatures, corrupted by the Eternal Overcast Fog, emerged from it with bloodshot eyes and boiling malice, possessing formidable strength.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the common cultivators avoided the Eternal Overcast Fog at all cost, not daring to touch it, for it would not only corrode the cultivator&#8217;s flesh but also their soul.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some cultivators had attempted to endure the fog for a long time in the past, but after their souls got corrupted, giving birth to a new consciousness, which was extremely terrifying because they would lose themselves. Their physical body would be occupied by the new consciousness, causing them to lose all of themselves and become new living beings. Hence, no cultivator dared to take risks and venture deep into the Eternal Overcast. Even True Daoists only observed from afar without intending to enter. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, on a collapsed ancient star, an elderly woman from the Mortal Palace spoke respectfully to Jiang Chuchu with a hint of worry in her eyes. &#8220;Saintess, the outbreak this time may not be as simple as we thought. The Third Elder sensed the aura of unparalleled cultivators battling deep inside the Eternal Overcast. She speculated that it might be the cause of this outbreak.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Third Elder mentioned was an extremely ancient existence of the Mortal Palace, who had only recently come out of seclusion. Her cultivation had reached the level of standing of the Upper Realm. Yet, even the Third Elder herself felt uneasy about the Eternal Overcast outbreak and advised Mortal Palace not to get involved, fearing unexpected consequences. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Jiang Chuchu insisted on investigating, afraid that the Eternal Overcast Scourge would threaten all living beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, her decision made many Elders worry and fearful that she would encounter danger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the calamity was really caused by the battle between some supreme experts in the depths of the Eternal Overcast, investigating placed their lives in huge risks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu understood the Elders&#8217; concerns, but she still shook her head and sighed, &#8220;The cultivators from various Forces are unwilling to investigate the cause. If I, the Saintess of Mortal Palace, choose to back down at this time, who would solve this calamity?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew this was extremely dangerous as well, and a slight mistake could cause her death. However, she just couldn&#8217;t step away, especially when she was the Saintess of Mortal Palace, who was revered by billions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, if you insist, Saintess. This is as far as we will follow you. The danger in the depths of the Eternal Overcast is great. Given our cultivation, we probably won&#8217;t be able to keep ourselves safe; we might even cause you trouble.&#8221; The several Elders sighed helplessly when they knew they couldn&#8217;t dissuade Jiang Chuchu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t that they were afraid of death, but rather because of the special nature of the Eternal Overcast. Once they enter, they might encounter corrosion and even have difficulty controlling themselves. By then, they would only be a hindrance to Jiang Chuchu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand. Please wait for me here,&#8221; Jiang Chuchu said firmly. &#8220;I will find a way to escape if there&#8217;s any danger. I won&#8217;t take my life lightly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was because her unique physique allowed her to resist the Eternal Overcast Fog to the greatest degree. It was the reason why she decided to take the risk and find out the cause of the Eternal Overcast outbreak so as to cure the problem from the root.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Be careful, Saintess,&#8221; the Elders still expressed their concern. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not even the space teleportation runes would work inside the Eternal Overcast Fog. Hence, one could only go back the way they came if one wanted to escape. However, the journey was extremely dangerous, and even a slight mistake could lead to death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the cultivators of the surrounding Forces were surprised when they noticed the situation of the Mortal Palace. They couldn&#8217;t believe the Saintess of the Mortal Palace would venture into the Eternal Overcast at this given time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She&#8217;s just sending herself to death! Not even True Daoists dare step into it. Who is she to dare venture into the Eternal Overcast?!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Saintess of Mortal Palace is quite close with Gu Changge. Didn&#8217;t the Mortal Palace claim Gu Changge to be the Mortal One’s reincarnate? Why hasn&#8217;t he shown up? Has he hidden away because of the recent rumours?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sounds to me the rumour that Gu Changge stole the identity of the Mortal One’s reincarnate with ulterior motives is true.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several cultivators of the Sky Emperor Mountain sneered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As powerful and terrifying as Gu Changge was, they believed the man would eventually be eliminated by the other Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately, the rumour of Gu Changge being the Successor of Demonic Arts had spread across the entire Upper Realm. Even common cultivators had become aware of it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it wasn&#8217;t to the point where everyone was an enemy, it still attracted a lot of hatred towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Eternal Overcast had erupted and all eyes in the Upper Realm had turned towards it, they would like to see what Gu Changge, the so-called Mortal One’s reincarnate, would do.</span></p>

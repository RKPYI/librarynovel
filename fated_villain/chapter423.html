          daring to act rashly, especially the followers of Saintess Yao Yue
          from Blazing Moon Holy Land who were now subconsciously trembling.
          Their faces blanched and their souls shiver as they almost fell onto
          their knees, daring not to imagine the fate of Blazing Holy Land would
          be so effortlessly determined by their adversary, who seemed intent on
          destroying the whole thing. In fact, they would never have believed
          that such a ludicrous incident would actually occur in this world.

          all beings of the Heavenly Tide Realm since the beginning of time.
          Given how its existence struck fear in the hearts of all other forces,
          it was not easy to be taken down.</span

          the words of the young man before them. As they were frantic with
          dread and hopelessness, some of them even collapsed to the ground due

          unquestionably overbearing and unimaginably horrid. Even the Ancestor
          of the Shen Family was respectfully standing at that young man’s side,
          waiting to be commanded by him, Hence, there was no way Blazing Moon
          Holy Land could afford upsetting the young man.</span

          Moon Holy Land, in accordance with Gu Changge&#8217;s order. In their
          eyes, the Holy Lands of Heavenly Tide Realm were nothing but lowly
          vermin. Even if they had Sacred Emperor Realm Masters in their midst,
          these formidable cultivators wouldn&#8217;t be intimidated at

          they harboured True Daoists—would instantaneously be wiped out. For
          instance, Purple Mansion, which could make the world tremble,
          eventually perished solely because they offended Gu Changge. The
          destruction of Blazing Moon Holy Land, on the other hand, would
          require only one flick of a finger.</span

          shivered as it was their first time experiencing fear, and many came
          to understand why the Ancestor and Elders were so reverent to this
          young man. After all, if Gu Changge could annihilate Blazing Moon Holy
          Land with one command, he undoubtedly had the capability to do the
          same to the Shen Family.</span

          day, he was doing it in Gu Xianer&#8217;s defence, so they
          couldn&#8217;t say anything about it. Essentially, Saintess Yao
          Yue&#8217;s comments were blatantly derisive towards Gu Xianer, which
          also enraged her parents.</span

          rest of Blazing Moon Holy Land. After all, they were irrelevant to the
          feud. Regardless, judging by Gu Changge&#8217;s personality, no one
          would be able to make him reconsider his decisions.</span

          Something he didn&#8217;t have to slaughter by himself. All he needed
          to do was to make the call and countless would be more than willing to
          crush these &#8216;ants&#8217; in his stead. Nevertheless, it was this
          very side of him that allowed Gu Xianer to feel safe.</span

          by how he would go so far as to destroy Blazing Moon Holy Land solely
          because its saintess had embarrassed Gu Xianer. As Shen Xian&#8217;er
          had always remained neutral, she had never expected that, in this

          was as pale as their; even her mind was filled with nothing but
          blaring rings. Never had she imagined that she would be the one to
          draw havoc upon her own people.</span

          realised that it would be unacceptable for him to refrain from
          standing up for her, given that he was a major factor to the dramatic
          episode. Indeed, Gu Changge&#8217;s belligerence was unnerving to him,
          and that, as well as Gu Changge&#8217;s pugnacious instinct to take
          down Blazing Moon Holy Land, was unprecedented even back in the era in
          which he was a prominent figure.</span

          their head and look him in the eyes.</span

          >&#8220;Fellow Brother, is there a need to be this harsh? Yao Yue was
          merely venting her frustration. I believe it would only be a waste of
          time and effort to stir up a huge commotion over such an insignificant
          matter.&#8221; Unbothered by the vexed faces of the Shen
          Family&#8217;s Elders, Li Xiu walked forward and spoke to Gu Changge.
          Although there was no sign of cultivation on him, his strangely calm
          quality forbade others to belittle him.</span

          manner, thinking that you&#8217;re a mighty person!? You must be sick
          of living!&#8221; The face of the Second Elder of the Shen Family grew
          cold. To his surprise, Li Xiu still managed to retain his composure
          without feigning a hint of fear at such a moment, and he
          couldn&#8217;t help but wonder how Li Xiu gained the bravery to talk
          to Gu Changge in such a brazen manner.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At this point, the Shen Family was already aware that Li Xiu
          possessed another hidden identity, though they had yet to discover who
          he truly was. Therefore, they were all scowling upon his calm approach
          and boorish speech.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that, those of Blazing Moon Holy Land began to feel
          optimistic. Since Saintess Yao Yue put things that way, Li Xiu&#8217;s
          true identity must be a complex one. Otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t have
          dared to be so bold and collected.</span

          tremendous than that of the Mortal One. Hmm, he must be more than the

          first time facing such an enigmatic young man who even gave him
          immeasurable pressure. Despite that, he managed to keep himself
          together as he was pondering about Gu Changge&#8217;s identity.</span

          the Upper Realm, or the Shen Family wouldn&#8217;t be treating him
          with such reverence.] Nonetheless, Li Xiu had never left the Shen
          Family Residence for the past few years, so he wasn&#8217;t exactly
          informed of the events in the outside world.</span

          troublesome than he expected, Li Xiu thought that he had to handle it
          with utmost caution. Though, if Gu Changge was aware of his identity,
          he should look past the matter out of courtesy. Although the Gu Family
          was no force to be offended, Li Xiu, given his complex identity, was

          the rest, whose faces blanched and eyes filled with dread. In an
          enthralling tone, he continued, &#8220;As for the huge commotion you

          then turned into a golden barrier that parried the Second

          >At once, a hint of vexation arose on Li Xiu&#8217;s face as he lost
          his patience upon Gu Changge&#8217;s irking words. It seemed his goal
          to resolve the conflict could no longer be actualised. Furthermore, he
          couldn&#8217;t bear being humiliated by Gu Changge right in front of
          the crowd.</span

          >In response, Gu Changge shook his head and replied, &#8220;I am
          simply explaining the context. Though, your assumption is not
          wrong.&#8221;</span

          &#8220;Very well, &#8216;Changge.&#8217; Your presence today sure has
          enlightened me.&#8221;</span

          Changge&#8217;s name like that!&#8221; The Second Elder&#8217;s face
          was ever so gloomy. He never expected that he, a being in the Sacred
          Lord Realm, was unable to take down a good-for-nothing as his attacks
          were continuously parried, and he felt especially ashamed to be
          humiliated in front of Gu Changge.</span

          now!&#8221; Having said that, the Second Elder attacked once again as
          his fearsome power engulfed his surroundings. This time, he was
          visibly more serious than before as the power he now displayed was
          remarkably more daunting.</span

          more and more radiant as an irresistible pressure arose in the air.
          Vaguely, one could perceive the &#8216;Zhan&#8217; word within the
          rune, carrying a dense aura that would instil fear in anyone in its

          Xianer was in Peach Village, she was taught by her few Masters, hence
          she developed an extraordinary sense of perception. Yet, she was
          unable to perceive what kind of method Li Xiu was using.</span

          shouldn&#8217;t be able to resort to Secret Techniques, divine
          abilities or any sort of magic treasure. Therefore, it became a
          question as to how he was able to fend off the Second Elder&#8217;s
          attacks.</span

          Realm.&#8221; Shen Xian&#8217;er was also taken aback by Li
          Xiu&#8217;s display of such abilities, which was obviously why
          Saintess Yao Yue dared to be so complacent earlier.</span

          >In this instant, if there was anyone that wasn&#8217;t surprised, it
          would be Gu Changge. There was faint interest on his face. [The In-Law
          Fortuitous One has been pretending to be harmless, only to ultimately
          reveal his ferocity. Of course, he wouldn&#8217;t have been so calm
          had he not had the means to protect himself.]</span

          >However, Gu Changge had still yet to draw his hands, as he wished to
          witness Li Xiu&#8217;s current limit. Plainly, the golden runes were
          only triggered when he was attacked, which must be one of his
          abilities from the past. Though, if that was all that he offered, Gu
          Changge would be disappointed. Regardless, he believed that Li Xiu
          would make a fruitful harvest as his gaze fell upon Li Xiu&#8217;s
          Fortuity.</span

          Detachment Bones. After all, cultivation teachings were crucial for a
          cultivator of a high cultivation level like him, and Absolute
          Detachment Bones were a pivotal part of it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that moment, Gu Changgen noticed that, whenever he acquired an
          Absolute Detachment Bone, he would feel an indescribably familiar
          synergy, and as the sensation persisted, the memories sealed within
          him would gradually grow clearer.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As such, he began to infer whether Absolute Detachment Bones were
          actually his bones in the past. Though, the accuracy of his inference
          still depended on the origins of the System, which would be hard for
          him to investigate given his current cultivation level.</span

          sent flying away with his entire body covered in blood. Miserably, he
          then lay on the ground with his eyes widened in shock and disbelief.
          Not only was he unable to break through Li Xiu&#8217;s defence, but he
          was also heavily injured by the deflection.</span

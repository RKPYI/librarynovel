          Eldest Senior Sister, I believe that there’s nothing in the world that
          can’t be discussed about. I do feel guilty about it and intend to make
          amends. I wonder if he can be so magnanimous as to give me a chance to
          change my ways?&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing those words, the Second Mountain Elder was left
          speechless with an unpleasant look on his face. The other Mountain
          Elders fell silent, their eyes flickering as they struggled to find
          words to refute Gu Changge.</span

          on their faces too, as anger and powerlessness grew in their hearts.
          They recognized that Gu Changge was merely repeating what Xiao Yang
          had said earlier.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          of her grudge. Could he truly follow his own advice and let go of his
          hatred if he were to experience a similar situation?</span

          something happening to someone else differed greatly from the emotions
          that one would experience when the same thing happened to
          themselves.</span

          sullied by the blood of people like that?” The Sky Deer Goddess
          blinked her eyes, which were crystal clear and radiating a beautiful
          luster like a pair of flawless jades.</span

          had the urge to find out if this disciple of the Second Mountain Elder
          could be magnanimous for once.”</span

          like no other, smiled. Her smile was so enchanting that it entranced
          several male disciples, making them unable to look away.</span

          senses. He looked at the blood mist and the glittering white bone
          fragments that filled the air in front of him. Rage and resentment
          filled his eyes as he glared at Gu Changge with enough hatred to kill.
          His entire body quivered with anger, his fists tightly clenched, and
          his eyes bloodshot.</span

          intense fury and malice, as if he wished to inflict a thousand cuts
          upon Gu Changge.</span

          you now, huh? If you want to avenge your Eldest Senior Sister, then
          you are welcome to try.” As he looked at Xiao Yang, Gu Changge’s
          expression remained indifferent, as though he had just crushed an
          ant.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Buzz!* Faint green patterns glowed under Xiao Yang’s skin, exuding a
          mysterious and profound aura. Blood rushed to his head and his eyes
          reddened. He looked like a ferocious beast, ready to pounce at any
          moment while being cornered.</span

          >He and his Eldest Senior Sister had been inseparable for over two
          decades. She was both a mother and a sister to him. How could he
          remain indifferent after witnessing her get murdered. To hell with
          being understanding and magnanimous.</span

          just sit idly by and do nothing. Xiao Yang’s strength was no match for
          Gu Changge’s. The difference between them was simply too great.</span

          Throughout this time, he had been cautious and vigilant, avoiding
          anything that might trigger the anticipated signs in his divination of
          the end.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge fearlessly killed Chen Suyun in front of all the Mountain
          Elders and their disciples. He must have possessed great confidence
          and strength, and had no fear toward the Nine Great Mountains.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite the Second Mountain Elder’s reluctance, he was forced to
          endure this. If they were to argue, they would not be entirely correct
          either.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Master!” Xiao Yang gritted his teeth, filled with an intense
          frustration. However, he knew that even if he had a hundred lives, he
          wouldn&#8217;t be able to defeat Gu Changge in a fight.</span

          >“What happened today was between your Eldest Senior Sister and the
          Sky Deer Goddess. As outsiders, we do not have the right to
          intervene.” The Second Mountain Elder sighed softly, feeling just as
          frustrated as Xiao Yang. He took Chen Suyun under his wing after she
          had left Sky Deer City. How could he not feel anything about this,
          aftering spending so many years with her?</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          ancient battle arena turned into a stream of light and flew back into
          his sleeve. He then took Xiao Yang with him, transformed into a divine
          rainbow and left the area, not wishing to stay here for a moment
          longer.</span

          >The disciples, who had been feeling indignant, were left dumbfounded
          when the Second Mountain Elder chose to withdraw. Obviously, they did
          not expect that the Second Mountain Elder would be able to just turn
          around and leave with Xiao Yang without doing anything after
          witnessing his own disciple getting killed by an outsider. Many of
          them were either in disbelief, extremely angry or frustrated.</span

          >As Ah Da’s cold gaze fell upon them, they immediately shuddered and
          refrained from further commenting on the situation at hand. His
          towering and ominous black shadow instilled a deep sense of fear in
          people, and the immense pressure he exuded seemed capable of tearing
          through their skin.</span

          Fortuitous One. When the hatred for the natives of the Celestial
          Ancient Continent was at its peak, the Fortuity was lower than this.

          Suyun. In fact, he was the first to refuse her when Chen Suyun fled to
          the Nine Great Mountains and knelt under the mountain gate.
          Unfortunately, his opinion could not waver the Second Mountain Elder’s
          decision to take her in out of kindness.</span

          something that only a True Daoist could withstand. He was truly
          impressed to see a True Daoist at such a young age. It even made him
          wonder if Gu Changge’s origin was related to the Celestial Domain,

          >The Third Mountain Elder then ordered the person standing behind him,
          “Wudi, the Third Mountain shall host a banquet today to celebrate the
          Goddess’ triumphant revenge. Go make the necessary
          arrangements.”</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He did not even worry if doing so would offend the Second Mountain or
          the others. After all, the two had already been at odds a long time
          ago, so they usually acted without regard for each other.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >For instance, if the Third Mountain Elder had not insisted on having
          a competition to choose the candidate to guard the Celestial Seal of
          the Nine Mountains, the Second Mountain Elder would have ignored the
          Third Mountain’s opinion and just passed the Celestial Seal to Xiao
          Yang.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon receiving the order, Gu Wudi threw a glance at Gu Changge before
          quickly leaving.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It seemed like the Third Mountain Elder was unaware of Gu Changge’s
          true identity. This made Wudi feel a little uneasy about the
          situation.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He could only hope that the Third Mountain Elder would have the
          wisdom to not resist when the time came for Gu Changge to destroy the
          Nine Great Mountains. Otherwise, he could not bear to imagine the
          consequences.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The news of today’s incident quickly spread throughout the Nine Great
          Mountains. Even the disciples who were in retreat, who could not
          witness the battle, were shocked by the news. They never thought that
          Chen Suyun would be killed in such a mannerway. It was both
          disheartening and infuriating.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Mountain Elders remained silent on this, so what could they, the
          disciples, possibly do? Had they attempted to confront Gu Changge,
          none of them would have been spared, given how ruthless he was at the
          time.</span

          spiritual energy. Runes flickered and intertwined on the walls and
          jade pillars, creating a breathtaking Celestial Realm-like
          ambiance.</span

          Many beautiful female disciples danced gracefully in their dresses
          with flowing long sleeves. Their mesmerizing faces and enchanting
          bodies were truly a sight to behold.</span

          >The Third Mountain Elder gave specific instructions to his disciples
          to prepare a grand feast using the large amount of sacred fruits and
          spiritual birds they had gathered over the years. As a result, the
          food was infused with remarkable divine light, creating a dazzling
          brilliance.</span

          food, but its ominous aura made it seem like the creatures depicted
          would leap out from the projection, causing many disciples to turn

          the Third Mountain for millions of years. All these creatures that
          possessed immense strength were now hunted and slain for food. If an
          average cultivator were to approach the food, they might explode on

        Chapter 182: You Dont Understand Your Brothers Good Intentions; Swear by
        the Dao Heart Not to Hurt Her!
      </h4>
      <p>———</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was confused, ‘Why is Gu Changge here instead of his Supreme
        Peak?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘He already stirred up the hornet’s nest in the Ancient Immortal
        Continent, throwing it into chaos. What does he want now?’
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, why are you here?”</b></p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder was quick to react. The moment he saw him, he stepped
        forward, threw his sleeves, and asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        He never had a good impression of Gu Changge, whether it was before or
        now, it has always been the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if he complimented and appreciated him, he simply can't agree with
        Gu Changge's schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two had completely different principles when it came to cultivation!
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Nanshan had an unsightly expression, but because Gu Xian'er was
        beside him, he had to pretend to admire Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>He felt even more depressed now.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Naturally, I awaited the Great Elder and the ancestor’s return. I
          also wanted to see if Xian'er has been slacking off.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge spoke with a smile. His slender stature, as rich as pure
        jade, complemented his wide robe to give him a noble and natural look.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Xian'er, I haven’t seen you in a while and your Cultivation Base has
          improved a lot. Your dear brother is very happy.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>As he said that, he looked at Gu Xian'er, who moved back a bit.</p>
      <p>
        Those who aren’t familiar with him will definitely be fascinated by his
        handsome smiling face.
      </p>
      <p>But Gu Xian'er wasn’t.</p>
      <p>
        Even though her attitude was very cold and indifferent on the surface,
        she rolled her eyes slightly in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't believe that Gu Changge would be so kind that he’ll come to
        see her himself.
      </p>
      <p>‘He’s probably cooked up a new scheme.’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er still vividly recalled her visit to the ‘injured’ Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only did he not appreciate it, but he also humiliated her severely.
        He schemed against her, forcing her to get involved in the attack of the
        Tiangou Clan. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was a bit naive, but she clearly remembers this debt. One
        day, she’ll find Gu Changge and return it with interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“What’s wrong? Do you still blame your dear brother for what
          happened? I did it for your own good. You’re young, and unless I train
          you like this, your future will be filled with hardships.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“When I, your brother, was as old as you, I had already entered the
          Infinite Sea by myself…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Unlike you, who was unable to deal with a mere Princess of the Sea
          King Palace.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        One look at Gu Xian’er’s face was all it took for Gu Changge to guess
        her thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        His reply was immediate, marked with his warm signature smile and aloof
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>As he spoke, he shook his head.</p>
      <p>
        His words seemed quite sincere, like a brother concerned about his
        precious little sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Nashan was a bit stunned upon hearing their exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thought that Gu Changge and Gu Xian'er were enemies, so he believed
        it would be best if they didn’t meet up so early.
      </p>
      <p>‘This is strange; their relationship seems to be quite good.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Did he really do something wrong? Or did Gu Changge already address the
        conflict?’
      </p>
      <p>Thinking about it only shocked him further.</p>
      <p>
        ‘No wonder Gu Xian'er didn’t have any hatred or murderous intent towards
        him. It seems Gu Changge has already resolved it.’
      </p>
      <p>Gu Nanshan was a little relieved; he sighed.</p>
      <p>
        His anger for Gu Changge and the desire to teach him a lesson had now
        faded significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This junior truly has an impressive set of methods, so it is quite
        possible…’
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, stop pretending!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Everything was fine until Gu Changge spoke. As soon as he opened his
        mouth, Gu Xian’er was furious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately for her, his plans won’t progress without this step. Gu
        Xian’er’s anger was precisely what he needed…
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er hated him so much that she couldn't help it anymore.</p>
      <p>
        At that moment, she gritted her silver teeth and stared at Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>In her crystal clear and beautiful eyes, there was a cold air.</p>
      <p>Like icy blades that wanted to pierce him!</p>
      <p>
        Just now, she was smiling and in a good mood. The trip to the Ancient
        Immortal Continent could be said to be a rewarding experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the blink of an eye, her little face was covered with an ice-cold
        expression, like an iceberg that will never melt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“You still don’t understand your dear brother’s good intentions.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge shook his head and spoke with a hint of both regret and
        disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Ancestor, can you suppress Gu Changge's cultivation? I’ll beat him
          fair and square and tear his mouth apart!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er replied coldly after hearing Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge was really pissing her off.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Xian’er, did you become full of yourself again at the mere thought
          of having an ancestor behind you?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge chuckled without even glancing at Gu Xian’er.</p>
      <p>Throughout this entire conversation, he kept a casual tone.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er was further enraged when she recalled how Gu Changge had
        suppressed her before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Xian'er, </b><b>cough! cough!</b
        ><b>… I'm afraid you have misunderstood Changge's good intentions…”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Nashan coughed as he said this. It would seem that much of the two’s
        grievances have already been resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an ancestor, he naturally wants to see harmonious relations in the
        family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if he doesn't want to see Gu Changge ever again, he really can’t
        let them fight right now.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, he stopped her.</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>In fact… even he, an ancestor, can’t tell how strong Gu Changge is.</p>
      <p>‘Who knows how many trump cards Gu Changge has?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘If Xian'er really fought against Gu Changge, then with her current
        ability, she would definitely not have the upper hand.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Ancestor, aren't you from my family branch? Why do you favour Gu
          Changge so much…?”</b
        >
        Gu Xian'er was a little angry with her ancestor. She didn’t have her
        usual calm, and Gu Changge was a big part of why.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“This is for your own good, little princess.”</b> Gu Nanshan
        helplessly replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        After listening to the two of them, Gu Changge's smile remained
        unchanged. He poured himself a drink, savouring the show before him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had a feeling that, even if Gu Nashan was angry, he wouldn’t take
        action
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Gu Nanshan wasn’t stupid. Would he tell Gu Xian’er that even
        he doesn’t know what’s happening and worsen the situation?
      </p>
      <p>
        He wouldn’t. On the contrary, he’ll assist Gu Changge by trying to
        maintain order.
      </p>
      <p>Just like now…</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If you don’t believe me, then I encourage you to go outside and ask
          what exactly the Sea King’s Palace is doing at this very moment.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        After a bit of thought, Gu Changge replied, with a strange glint in his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p><b>“The Sea King Palace…”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was stunned, as she took a few moments to recall a part of
        her memory.
      </p>
      <p>Most of it was a blur, but she could clearly remember one scene.</p>
      <p>
        It was dark and shadowy, as she felt a force that wanted nothing more
        than her death. And then… Gu Changge descended from the heavens to
        defend her.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Xian’er also remembered that she was the one who executed
        the Seventh Princess of the Sea King Palace in the Ancient Immortal
        Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it was Gu Changge who suppressed her, it was her who struck the
        killing blow.
      </p>
      <p>She was one to blame.</p>
      <p>The Sea King Palace wouldn’t let such a thing go.</p>
      <p>
        If the Sea King Palace desires revenge, then they will surely come for
        her. Gu Changge wasn't stupid. He didn’t kill anyone, leaving the burden
        of choice on her shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“You’re right; the Sea King Palace will come to seek revenge.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Xian'er nodded. Considering her current status, the Sea
        King Palace wouldn’t deem her a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘However, if Gu Changge had killed the Seventh Princess, then this
        entire situation would be different. The Sea King Palace wouldn’t dare
        move against him so lightly.’
      </p>
      <p>‘So why didn’t he deal the killing blow?’</p>
      <p>‘What does he want?’</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Yes, they’re coming. Do try to live up to your brother’s
          expectations, Xian’er.”</b
        >
        Gu Changge replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Is he telling the truth?’ Gu Xian'er said nothing, a little puzzled by
        this turn of events.
      </p>
      <p>‘Doesn’t this mean he tricked me?’</p>
      <p>‘But he saved me when I was in danger…’</p>
      <p>
        ‘No, he let me kill the Seventh Princess. Technically, he did nothing.’
      </p>
      <p>From Gu Xian’er’s point of view, there were two possibilities:</p>
      <p>
        The first was that Gu Changge wanted to watch her struggle. He didn’t
        think it was worth going through the trouble, so he had her offend the
        Sea King Palace instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with Gu Changge’s temperament, is there truly a force in the world
        that he dared not offend?
      </p>
      <p>
        The second was that Gu Changge was too arrogant. Obviously, he’s just
        playing pretend, appearing indifferent despite being truly worried over
        her safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Gu Changge, this was meant to serve as tempering, an
        opportunity he arranged for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She shook her head and threw all these thoughts out of her mind. ‘Gu
        Changge's good intentions? Why sharpen me?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘He wants to help me get stronger so that I can defeat him? maybe even
        kill him to take my revenge?’
      </p>
      <p>‘No sane person would do such a thing.’</p>
      <p>‘Is this really Gu Changge’s ultimate goal?’</p>
      <p>At this moment, Gu Xian’er was completely lost.</p>
      <p>
        If this truly was his purpose, then – in her eyes – it was extremely
        stupid. It was simply too out of character for Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing that his goal has been achieved, Gu Changge smiled slightly, and
        then said to the Great Elder,
        <b
          >“When I came here, I actually came with the intention to discuss
          something with the Great Elder the moment he returned.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“And what would that be?”</b> The Great Elder asked with a frown.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Naturally, it is to discuss recent matters. If I remember correctly,
          the elders once promised to protect the Ancient Immortal Races… with
          the passage now open, several Daoist Sects from the outside world have
          descended. Peace and stability have long since been disrupted.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled and said, not paying any attention to the Great
        Elder’s face that became more gloomy the more he listened.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Don't think that this old man doesn't know that the culprit behind
          all this is you. There is no need for you to pretend to be kind.”</b
        >
        The elder interrupted him coldly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled without a care in the world and replied,
        <b
          >“It's useless to discuss such matters now. The Fairy Gate has
          emerged, sending waves in all directions. Does the Great Elder truly
          plan to allow so many of the older generation to compete for it? Not
          to mention that the Immortal Road is opened…”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The various clans are in disarray, and the Ancient Immortal
          Continent is in chaos. Isn’t this a prime opportunity for the Heavenly
          Dao Immortal Palace?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>He spoke persuasively, but did so with a smug look on his face.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Don't even think about it. My Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace will not
          interfere in this matter. We have done this since ancient times, and
          it will not be broken.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder's face sank, and Gu Changge's meaning was obvious. He
        wanted to take this opportunity to dominate the entire Ancient Immortal
        Continent, unifying its various tribes.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge simply worded it differently.</p>
      <p>As for the “opportunity” that the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace had?</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was now the official heir. He earned that position with the
        intent of using his title to subdue the Ancient Immortal Races, similar
        to how the Tiangou Clan were subdued.
      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: They’ll get off easy compared to the Tiangou. lmao]</p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder has lived for countless years, and he almost instantly
        understood Gu Changge's purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't plan to hide it. In fact, his signature smile remained
        even when he heard his response,
        <b
          >“Don't be in a hurry to reject my request so quickly. Speaking of
          which, don’t you still owe me a favour? Or perhaps you forgot?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“In the end, Xian’er is my family too. If the Great Elder truly
          wishes her well, then you should carefully consider my proposition.
          This Changge truly doesn’t want to call in a favour to force the Great
          Elder’s hand.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Having said that, it was obvious.</p>

      <p>
        There were no fools among those present. Gu Nanshan couldn't help but be
        amazed, for it seems he still underestimated Gu Changge's courage!
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was the first to take such a tone with the Great Elder!</p>
      <p>
        As soon as Gu Xian'er heard Gu Changge mention her, she felt a deep
        sense of discomfort.

      <p>
        <b>“Gu Changge, what are you scheming?!”</b> She stared daggers at Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge ignored her shouting. With a smile, he happily sat on a stone
        chair.
      </p>
      <p><b>“This wine’s gone cold, a pity…”</b></p>
      <p>
        He shook his head a bit, thinking it was a shame he didn’t keep Yin Mei
        by his side. She was very good at warming up wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        [PR/N: Wine isn’t the only thing she is good at warming *wink wink* ]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder's expression froze. His eyes contained a deep fury,
        <b>“Are you threatening this old man?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“No, how could I? The Great Elder is more reputable than that.”</b>
        Gu Changge smiled, denying everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Humph!”</b> The Great elder couldn't help but snort with indignance.
        If Gu Changge didn't have a goal in mind, then why would he mention Gu
        Xian’er’s name?
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, he mentioned the favour. If the Great Elder doesn’t agree,
        then Gu Changge would use it.
      </p>
      <p>This was a conspiracy that he could hardly refuse!</p>
      <p>
        ‘Gu Changge truly is ruthless to treat people as nothing more than
        numbers in a set of calculations.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Nashan heard of it from Gu Xian’er. Back then, the Great Elder and Gu
        Changge made a bet. The Great Elder lost and has to do Gu Changge a
        favour. At the same time, Gu Changge received the position of heir.
      </p>
      <p>He couldn't be stunned by what he was seeing.</p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder was ruthless as well, but here he was being eaten up by
        Gu Changge with no room for refusal.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment, he seemed to calm down. Gu Changge’s request didn’t seem
        unacceptable… was it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Great Elder, do reconsider. Xian'er is in an awkward position. As
          her master, even if you don't care about her personally, there’s still
          the matter of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace. After all, you may not
          dare to unify the Ancient Immortal Races, but… I do.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge still had a faint smile when he continued to speak. He
        finally put his cards on the table, showing his true purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Gu Changge, don't use me to threaten my master, it's useless.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er's brows stood upright. Her little face was cold, as she
        wished she could rush up and kill Gu Changge hundreds of times over.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say such a thing in front of her, didn’t it mean that he was using
        her to threaten the Great Elder?
      </p>
      <p>
        She wasn't stupid; she could understand the meaning behind Gu Changge's
        words.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Gu Xian'er's point of view, Gu Changge’s face was an open book.
        However, that didn’t mean she would simply believe everything written in
        that book.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“This is the first time I’ve seen someone who threatens others with
          such an elegant and refined manner. You’re very impressive, Gu
          Changge.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder's eyes were deep, and he spoke as such. Within his eyes
        roared a flame that threatened to destroy the very universe.
      </p>
      <p>He was pissed.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“It’s useless to be angry, Great Elder. After all, you still owe me a
          favour. Besides, I’m sure the Ancestor won’t sit idle if you plan to
          use brute strength, right?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge spoke calmly, relaxing on his chair as he looked at Gu
        Nanshan with a smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p>Naturally, he wouldn't say such a thing if he wasn’t sure.</p>
      <p>
        Now that he had a firm grasp of Gu Nanshan's attitude, what should he
        worry about?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“You talk big, too big. You are but a young man, so how can you
          dominate all the races in the Ancient Immortal Continent? Your
          background alone will not be enough.”</b
        >
        The elder fell silent, and then sighed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Irrelevant.”</b> Gu Changge cheerily dismissed,
        <b>“That’s not something you have to worry about, Great Elder.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I can swear, but you too have to swear. Swear on your Dao Heart that
          from today onwards, you will not harm Xian'er in any way. In addition,
          you must acknowledge Xian’er’s identity.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        After being silent for a long time, the Great Elder spoke up with clear
        signs of discontent written on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was obvious that this decision took a long time for him to reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, he’d promised the ancestors of the Ancient Immortal Races
        that he would protect them. But considering the overall situation
        coupled with Gu Changge’s persecution, the Great Elder was left with
        little choice but to act.
      </p>
      <p>
        But before he meets with Gu Changge’s conditions, he wants to ensure Gu
        Xian’er’s safety.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er was very likely to be his last direct disciple.</p>
      <p>The Great Elder was an honest and generous person.</p>
      <p>‘Gu Xian'er's biggest enemy is Gu Changge.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Unfortunately, Gu Changge’s attitude remains unclear, and even I don’t
        know what his true purpose is.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Master…”</b> Gu Xian'er was so stunned when she heard this that she
        forgot to look at Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn’t expect that the Great Elder would compromise with Gu Changge
        for her sake.
      </p>
      <p>She was touched, a warm feeling rising from within.</p>
      <p>
        That in mind, she didn’t think it was necessary. From her point of view,
        Gu Changge was just taking her for a ride.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Why must you be so suspicious of me?”</b></p>
      <p>
        When he heard the Great Elder’s words, Gu Changge couldn’t help but
        shake his head a bit, a look of helplessness on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder truly did hit him right in the heart…was what everyone
        thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Gu Changge had no killing intent towards Gu Xian'er from
        beginning to end.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Elder and the others were simply too alert and vigilant to
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        [PR/N: Sometimes, I wonder what the difference between IQ and EQ is,
        then I look at this novel and remember that even elders can be an
        idiot.]
      </p>
      <p>His request was practically worth nothing.</p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge didn’t bother explaining. It was quite normal for
        people to be vigilant around him.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, do you agree or not?”</b></p>
      <p>
        Seeing that Gu Changge was silent, the Great Elder gave a solemn look
        and asked once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge doesn't agree, then he obviously wouldn’t agree to his
        request either.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er was also looking at Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        Her flawless crystal-like eyes shone with hidden emotions that only she
        knew.
      </p>
      <p>She wanted to know how Gu Changge truly felt about her.</p>
      <p>The Great Elder’s words weren’t meant to be a test.</p>
      <p>However, Gu Xian’er couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.</p>

          >The following morning, Gu Changge, Jiang Chuchu, Chosen Monk Jin Chan
          and several others stood on a mountain outside the Floating Buddhist
          Temple, watching the deep abyss swirling with Demonic Qi in the
          distance. The dark purple Demonic Qi surged violently as it spread,
          resembling dark clouds blocking the sky. It was like a darker world
          where no light could be seen.</span

          >The Demon-Burying Abyss was more like a doorway than an abyss. The
          terrifying entrance was like a giant wound slicing across the air,
          emanating frightening energy. Entering it would be like entering a
          dark and silent world. Piles of bodies could be seen inside the
          entrance, some as big as mountains. Even dead, some of the bodies
          continued to glow like tiny suns while emitting heat. However, those
          bodies were covered in hole-like injuries due to pollution by Demonic
          Qi.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There were many powerful arrays near the Abyss, expelling strong
          beams of divine light which transformed into swords, blades, and
          tridents as they shot into the abyss to prevent more from escaping.
          Many strong cultivators could be seen around the Demon-Burying Abyss;
          while they didn&#8217;t dare stand near it, they fought with the great
          demons inside.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They weren&#8217;t here because they wanted to protect the peace of
          the land but because killing the great demons could allow them to gain
          material containing crystals with high concentrations of energy. Those
          included the demonic core, skull, finger bones, and other materials
          which often fetched high prices in the market.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Demonic cores could be used to meld artifacts and set up arrays but
          could only be commonly found near the Demon-Burying Abyss, making them
          extremely rare. That was why many talented and brave cultivators
          risked their lives to come here.</span

          shocked by them, not expecting others to come other than them.
          However, some quickly recognised Gu Changge and became surprised yet
          puzzled. [Why had he come when he has such a noble status?]</span

          with the source of this chaos? I guess that does fit his
          character.&#8221;

          younger generation would risk their lives to come here? They admired
          such bravery and selfless behaviour. They wouldn&#8217;t have set foot
          here if not for money constraints, but here he was walking into the
          lion&#8217;s den.</span

          powerful monk from the Buddhist Mountain set up an array there to
          prevent demonic entities from escaping. Follow me closely and
          don&#8217;t fall into the array,&#8221; Jin Chan told them. He was
          much calmer after talking with the elderly monk last night.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He led the group from the Buddhist Mountain as they transformed into
          divine rainbows and moved forward. Beams of golden light shot from the
          peak of the mountain. The great cloud of Demonic Qi surging towards
          him was repelled by the Buddha aura from the Buddha beads in his hand.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The ghostly golden figure of a Buddha had appeared behind him as
          well, the strong vibrations from its roar of fury sweeping away all
          the demonic entities in front of the group.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge, Jiang Chuchu and the rest followed from a slight distance
          away. Since Jin Chan wanted to open a path for them, it would be more
          convenient for him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changgeâ€™s gaze was distant as he remembered the conversation he
          had heard last night. He had nearly been discovered by that elderly
          monk but fortunately, he had left quickly so nothing had gone
          wrong.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >That elderly monk had to be at least in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm and
          had lived for a very long time. His techniques were also closely
          related to the senses, thus able to even detect mysterious changes in
          the void. The more surprising part for Gu Changge was Jin Chan&#8217;s
          identity; he had known the monk had a Buddha Heart and Buddhist Bone,
          but not that he was the reincarnation of a powerful monk of Buddhist
          Mountain.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[The Zen Robe was probably left in the Demon-Burying Abyss, so
          that&#8217;s why he wanted to take it back.] Gu Changge was now
          intrigued about that Zen Robe; if he wasn&#8217;t mistaken, it was a
          Buddhist treasure which had been brought into the Demon-Burying Abyss
          to suppress the Demonic Qi within. However, it had been left behind
          for some reason.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When he arrived, he did not feel discomfited by the Demonic Qi; in
          contrast, he sensed an overpoweringly familiar yet natural energy. Dao
          runes flickered in his blood as if they were cheering, as the energy
          came from the same source as him. It was a very familiar feeling which
          allowed his sealed memories to become restored. Pieces of them flashed
          in his head, his mind now filled with more memories than before. It
          was all clear to him now.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Demonic Qi here was so much stronger, and Sacred Realm
          cultivators had to be careful to evade corrosion from it. A faint
          celestial light shimmered around Jiang Chuchu to shield her against
          the Demonic Qi as she frowned and muttered to herself. Gu Changge
          glanced at her and waved a hand. A powerful wave spread out to blow
          away the Demonic Qi surrounding her.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you remain outside? With your strength, you
          may just cause problems rather than help.&#8221; He frowned at her
          slightly. Nonetheless, she eyed him before shaking her head.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No. I want to go in with you. You don&#8217;t have to worry
          about me when I have abilities of my own.&#8221; He had been involved
          in this because of her. How could she stay outside and let him go in
          by himself?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing her stubborn eyes, Gu Changge said nothing else. He would have
          to put her in his Inner World if anything went wrong anyway, so it
          wouldn&#8217;t make a difference.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jin Chan was leading their way, yet their journey wasn&#8217;t
          peaceful as they had to watch out for any arrays and kill anyone whose
          minds had been corroded by the Demonic Qi. However, he had the experts
          of the Buddhist Mountain accompanying him, who were at least in the
          Sacred Noble Realm. They were powerful enough to repel the Demonic Qi
          and protect his safety.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This continued for a few hundred kilometres before they eventually
          reached the entrance of the Abyss. The suffocating and depressing aura
          emitted made everyone solemn as their souls began to quiver like they
          were facing something terrible. They even had the urge to prostrate
          themselves before the entrance.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Demonic Qi here had nearly turned into liquid, forming a small
          lake in the ground. Runes flickered within while dark purple demonic
          rocks were scattered around. Those precious and rare rocks emitted an
          aura of Sources.</span

          >&#8220;Young Master, look there.&#8221; Behind Gu Changge, a Sacred
          Lord Realm Master pointed towards a lotus plant in the distance in
          surprise. It was a dark purple lotus which had grown from the small
          lake formed by Demonic Qi, even though the lake wasn&#8217;t even
          fifty kilometres in diameter. There was a fragrant scent in the air as
          if the lotus flower was made of a celestial purple metal.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; One of them walked towards it
          curiously but was enveloped by the dark purple fog emanating from the
          lake before he could approach. He didn&#8217;t have a chance to scream
          before he became a cloud of bloody mist. The horrifying sight scared
          many people and they took several steps back.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;That is a Soul-Exterminating Lotus. Don&#8217;t go near
          it.&#8221; Jin Chan frowned before relaxing again and explaining
          everything to them. &#8220;This plant grows near the Demon-Burying
          Abyss and feeds on flesh as well as Demonic Qi. It may look beautiful
          but contains something very frightening, so you shouldn&#8217;t go
          near it recklessly to pick it.&#8221;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His words made everyone present look wary, knowing how dangerous this
          place was. The closer they were to the entrance of the Demon-Buying
          Abyss, the more dangers they would encounter.</span

          >&#8220;The Soul-Exterminating Lotus. This thing may be hundreds of
          millions of years old since it has already formed its territory in the
          surrounding area.&#8221; However, Gu Changge looked interested and
          walked over to it. Everyone else became stricken while the monks of
          Buddhist Mountain frowned but didn&#8217;t stop him. Jin Chan had
          already warned them and if Gu Changge refused to listen, then he would
          have to suffer the consequences.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Something shocking then happened; as Gu Changge approached, the Soul
          Exterminating Lotus shivered lightly as if in fear. The roots then
          shifted and suddenly walked out of the lake. Its feet glowed purple
          and purple mist rose from the ground as it walked. It was a curious
          sight which made everyone&#8217;s eyes widen in shock. Even Jiang
          Chuchu was taken aback before she quickly controlled herself and
          recalled his identity while looking at him. [Did that
          Soul-Exterminating Lotus have enough consciousness to feel fear from
          him approaching?]</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The roots had formed feet as they approached Gu Changge. He ignored
          them all and quickly grabbed the lotus plant, throwing it into the
          storage ring. This plant was conscious enough that it knew it
          couldn&#8217;t escape him and so chose to submit.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why did you take it?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu was curious, since
          the Soul-Exterminating Lotus, while dangerous, had no medicinal
          properties.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;ll cultivate it since a Soul-Exterminating
          Lotus millions of years old is very rare. It may not take a long time
          for it to manifest physically.&#8221;

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Due to its unique characteristics, the Lotus would have abilities
          specifically countering Primordial Spirits if it manifests physically.
          If that didn&#8217;t happen, he could consume it and cultivate his
          Primordial Spirit. It might be as frightening as poison to others but
          it was a herbal supplement for him.</span

          and did not say anything else. The plant only fed on flesh and Demonic
          Qi in enormous quantities, which wouldn&#8217;t really impact him much
          due to his abilities. While his attitude towards her had improved
          immensely, she hadn&#8217;t forgotten his true personality.</span

          >The group became much more careful upon their arrival, including Jin
          Chan himself who was afraid of any missteps. Blindingly bright
          patterns resembling those of Dao could be seen everywhere, while more
          powerful and savage great demons from the Demon-Burying Abyss were
          present in larger numbers. They had no intelligence in their eyes,
          merely murder and violence.</span

          Lord Realm had become completely pale and shivered in fear.</span

          Warmth flowed through her as she didn&#8217;t know how to refuse.
          However, she quickly recollected herself. They were in public, yet Gu
          Changge had said all that. Wasnâ€™t he admitting to their relationship?
          This made her somewhat shy, being already sensitive herself. Of
          course, she was good at controlling herself in public as she was a
          Saintess of Mortal Palace, so she quickly reined herself in.</span

          while he quickly tore apart the Demonic Qi moving towards him and
          entered the Demon-Burying Abyss. Something flashed in Gu
          Changge&#8217;s eyes, the void blurring for a moment before the
          Demonic Qi parted automatically. He walked in, following Jin
          Chan&#8217;s footsteps, and disappeared in the thick Demonic Qi as he
          descended into the abyss.</span

          >The Demon-Burying Abyss was enormous, practically forming its own
          realm. Terrifying energy ran wild, with many demonic entities fought
          inside without any sign of exhaustion. All beings there, both in
          physical and spiritual form, had been corrupted by Demonic Qi which
          made them fight savagely without caring about their lives.

          red Chan Honyi to be sealed here for countless years or even
          millennia. All beings here, even those with powers which rivalled
          those in the Sacred King Realm, did not have any intelligence and only
          knew how to fight and kill. It was either kill or be killed; if anyone
          else had been trapped here, they would have gone insane and caused
          unimaginable havoc after leaving. A complete massacre of all the other
          worlds was no joke.</span

          >&#8220;Brother Gu, what do you think of the strange stirrings in the
          depths of the Demonic Abyss?&#8221; As Gu Changge pondered the issue,
          Jin Chan, who had been leading their way, suddenly smiled and looked
          back at him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s probably because the seal had broken, or the
          monstrous thing sealed inside will reappear in the world soon,&#8221;
          Gu Changge responded calmly. He had been planning to make a move on
          Jin Chan, but the monk&#8217;s words reminded him. It was best to not
          do anything before he laid eyes on that so-called Zen Robe.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jin Chan didn&#8217;t seem surprised by that and continued asking
          him, &#8220;It&#8217;s strange that when the chaos occurred, all the
          great demons escaped to the outside world. What&#8217;s your opinion
          on it?&#8221;</span

          much he knew about the Demon-Burying Abyss. If Gu Changge was also
          here for the Zen Robe, then Jin Chan would have to find a way to bind
          the other man here forever. Gu Changge might be formidable, but he
          wasn&#8217;t familiar with the Demon-Burying Abyss the way Jin Chan
          was.</span

          first hand, itâ€™s more like they are fleeing rather than causing
          chaos.&#8221; Gu Changge looked like he had quickly guessed Jin
          Chan&#8217;s intentions. &#8220;Did you not conduct any investigation
          before coming here?&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;What&#8217;s your plan then?&#8221; Jin Chan&#8217;s heart
          raced as he asked the question, a Buddha aura shining faintly on his
          robes to counter the Demonic Qi in the place. The monks around him
          were busy fighting to create a safe path and had already sustained
          injuries.</span

          >Gu Changge replied carelessly, &#8221; I came here because I was
          concerned about her being in danger, of course. However, I
          couldn&#8217;t convince her against it. Do you think I&#8217;m
          interested in resolving the scourge inside the Demon-Burying Abyss? If
          so, you may be disappointed.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He laughed after that, sounding rather open yet teasing. Jin Chan was
          taken aback, not expecting Gu Changge to be so honest. It sounded very
          close to &#8216;I&#8217;m here just to retain my good image and do not
          plan on doing anything about the Demon-Burying Abyss&#8217;. However,
          that did fit the impression he had of Gu Changge.

          be risking his life because he had intentions towards Saintess Chuchu

          were now easier.</span

          >&#8220;Ah, I see. You are a very honest person.&#8221; Jin Chan
          smiled. If Gu Changge didn&#8217;t plan on getting involved in the
          issue of the Demon-Burying Abyss, then he wouldn&#8217;t know anything
          about the Zen Robe.</span

          didn&#8217;t dare lie or brush the other man off. If Gu Changge knew
          Jin Chan was just appeasing him, the other man would suspect his
          intentions and become interested in the Zen Robe. His plans would be
          ruined if Gu Changge took it. He decided to open up about it, though
          some details would have to remain secret.</span

          >Seeing Gu Changge&#8217;s sceptical look, he continued, &#8220;I feel
          somewhat ashamed since it is an embarrassment for Buddhist Mountain.
          One of our enlightened monks had a grand wish to destroy the
          Demon-Burying Abyss but was enchanted by a savage and powerful
          demoness in its depths. He was tricked into stealing a treasure from
          Buddhist Mountain in order to relieve his suffering. Yet, that
          demoness was far too savage and cruelâ€¦&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He sighed. It had been his past self who had done it, but he could
          only see things from an outsider&#8217;s perspective since his
          memories of his past life hadn&#8217;t been awakened. It was
          terrifying and inconceivable that a demoness had bewitched an
          enlightened monk just by her looks, yet it had happened.</span

          >â€œThen he was killed by her here?&#8221; Gu Changge asked calmly,
          though he felt that things had become much more complicated. It would
          be fine if Chan Honyi was still dazed, but wouldn&#8217;t she seek
          revenge upon seeing him if she was conscious during all those years of
          pain and torture? Besides, other things had happened before the
          Demon-Burying Abyss.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To Gu Changge, a lot of that hatred couldn&#8217;t be dealt with so
          easily. Hate that had evolved from love was hard to erase even in the
          depths of Hell. That means he would have to use either of the two ways
          he had thought of: slowly smooth things over or find a way to
          eliminate it once and for all.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The only thing he was thankful for was that Chan Honyi hadn&#8217;t
          died after taking on his attack directly. Though, she didn&#8217;t
          fare well after it either. There was a possibility he had gone easy on
          her, but the injuries caused by that attack might not heal after even
          such a long time.

        ><span style="font-weight: 400"

          people rarely talk about it now.&#8221; Jin Chan smiled bitterly as if
          he had a lot of thoughts about it, then continued to lead the way
          while using his Buddhist Bone to sense the whereabouts of the Zen
          Robe.</span

          seemed to be awakening as well, no longer as quiet as usual. The
          frightening aura of the Abyss felt like the weight of the sky falling
